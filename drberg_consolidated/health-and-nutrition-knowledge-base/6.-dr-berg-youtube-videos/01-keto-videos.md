- **[00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23yNXtR-N1s&t=0s)** — I want to tell you the number one best meal to clear out your arteries.
- **[00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23yNXtR-N1s&t=5s)** — I spent a lot of time talking about what not to eat.
- **[00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23yNXtR-N1s&t=8s)** — Today we're going to talk about what to eat.
- **[00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23yNXtR-N1s&t=10s)** — This is going to be quite surprising for most of you because it's not going to
- **[00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23yNXtR-N1s&t=13s)** — follow the traditional American Heart Association idea of what you should be eating.
- **[00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23yNXtR-N1s&t=18s)** — To figure out what to eat, we have to really look at the layer of tissue
- **[00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23yNXtR-N1s&t=22s)** — that's exposed to the blood going through your arteries.
- **[00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23yNXtR-N1s&t=24s)** — And that's called the endothelial layer that controls your blood pressure,
- **[00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23yNXtR-N1s&t=28s)** — both high and low.
- **[00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23yNXtR-N1s&t=29s)** — It also acts as a filter, especially as the blood vessels go through the
- **[00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23yNXtR-N1s&t=33s)** — kidney because that's what the kidney is.
- **[00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23yNXtR-N1s&t=35s)** — It's a filter.
- **[00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23yNXtR-N1s&t=35s)** — Also does other things like preventing clots.
- **[00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23yNXtR-N1s&t=38s)** — It has an immune component.
- **[00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23yNXtR-N1s&t=39s)** — One other very unique thing about it is that the fuel that it
- **[00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23yNXtR-N1s&t=43s)** — prefers is actually glucose.
- **[00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23yNXtR-N1s&t=45s)** — Realize you don't have to consume glucose to feed it.
- **[00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23yNXtR-N1s&t=48s)** — Your body can very easily make glucose because it uses glucose as the
- **[00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23yNXtR-N1s&t=54s)** — That means it also needs insulin to hold this glucose in, which means
- **[01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23yNXtR-N1s&t=61s)** — that inside of the artery is very susceptible to problems with insulin.
- **[01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23yNXtR-N1s&t=65s)** — The majority of the population has this insulin resistance problem.
- **[01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23yNXtR-N1s&t=69s)** — Why is that so important to know?
- **[01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23yNXtR-N1s&t=71s)** — Because if you have an insulin deficiency, you're going to have a
- **[01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23yNXtR-N1s&t=74s)** — deficiency of fuel.
- **[01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23yNXtR-N1s&t=75s)** — How do you develop insulin resistance?
- **[01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23yNXtR-N1s&t=77s)** — By consuming things that increase insulin.
- **[01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23yNXtR-N1s&t=80s)** — And that would be the chronic consumption of carbohydrates, snacking.
- **[01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23yNXtR-N1s&t=84s)** — Both snacking too much and the consumption of too many carbohydrates
- **[01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23yNXtR-N1s&t=87s)** — creates a situation of insulin resistance.
- **[01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23yNXtR-N1s&t=90s)** — The next thing I want to talk about is nitric oxide.
- **[01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23yNXtR-N1s&t=93s)** — The nitric oxide relaxes the vessels.
- **[01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23yNXtR-N1s&t=96s)** — They help keep the arteries from becoming stiff.
- **[01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23yNXtR-N1s&t=99s)** — They really support that endothelial layer of the inside of the arteries.
- **[01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23yNXtR-N1s&t=103s)** — Vitamin D is another thing that triggers nitric oxide.
- **[01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23yNXtR-N1s&t=107s)** — Vitamin D is so powerful and potent at helping support that endothelial layer.
- **[01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23yNXtR-N1s&t=114s)** — This is why so many people that are low in vitamin D have a problem with
- **[01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23yNXtR-N1s&t=118s)** — high blood pressure.
- **[01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23yNXtR-N1s&t=118s)** — Why?
- **[01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23yNXtR-N1s&t=119s)** — Because vitamin D3 supports nitric oxide.
- **[02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23yNXtR-N1s&t=122s)** — There's a couple other things that trigger nitric oxide.
- **[02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23yNXtR-N1s&t=125s)** — One is arginine.
- **[02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23yNXtR-N1s&t=126s)** — This is why a lot of people are taking it as a supplement to help
- **[02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23yNXtR-N1s&t=129s)** — lower your blood pressure.
- **[02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23yNXtR-N1s&t=130s)** — Another interesting thing about nitric oxide is testosterone increases
- **[02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23yNXtR-N1s&t=136s)** — nitric oxide.
- **[02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23yNXtR-N1s&t=137s)** — And fortunately, nowadays, the big reason why people have low testosterone is all
- **[02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23yNXtR-N1s&t=141s)** — the plastics in the environment because that plastic can directly shut down
- **[02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23yNXtR-N1s&t=147s)** — your testosterone.
- **[02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23yNXtR-N1s&t=148s)** — Another thing that's really important in increasing nitric oxide is magnesium.
- **[02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23yNXtR-N1s&t=152s)** — Magnesium tends to relax muscle spasms, tends to reduce cortisol.
- **[02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23yNXtR-N1s&t=158s)** — And think about what cortisol does.
- **[02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23yNXtR-N1s&t=160s)** — It increases stress.
- **[02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23yNXtR-N1s&t=161s)** — What's going to happen to your blood pressure?
- **[02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23yNXtR-N1s&t=163s)** — It's going to increase your blood pressure.
- **[02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23yNXtR-N1s&t=165s)** — The other thing that's interesting about magnesium is that magnesium is a
- **[02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23yNXtR-N1s&t=168s)** — very potent thing to keep calcium from building up inside the arteries.
- **[02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23yNXtR-N1s&t=173s)** — Magnesium and vitamin D can help keep that calcium from even ending up in
- **[02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23yNXtR-N1s&t=179s)** — the arteries in the first place.
- **[03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23yNXtR-N1s&t=180s)** — Vitamin K2 also keeps calcium from building up in the artery.
- **[03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23yNXtR-N1s&t=184s)** — The first thing I'm presenting to you is the various nutrients that are
- **[03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23yNXtR-N1s&t=187s)** — really important in supporting this artery.
- **[03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23yNXtR-N1s&t=189s)** — And then we're going to translate that to the best meal.
- **[03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23yNXtR-N1s&t=192s)** — I always like to take what mainstream recommends to eat to prevent heart
- **[03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23yNXtR-N1s&t=198s)** — problems and really look at that, but in the opposite direction.
- **[03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23yNXtR-N1s&t=203s)** — Because if we take a look at Cheerios, you can see this little
- **[03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23yNXtR-N1s&t=206s)** — certification thing right here, which says American Heart Association
- **[03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23yNXtR-N1s&t=211s)** — certified meats criteria for heart healthy food.
- **[03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23yNXtR-N1s&t=215s)** — All you need to have to get this little certification is if 51% of those
- **[03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23yNXtR-N1s&t=221s)** — ingredients are whole grains.
- **[03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23yNXtR-N1s&t=222s)** — You can have refined grains in there.
- **[03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23yNXtR-N1s&t=224s)** — You can have sugars in there and it's still heart healthy.
- **[03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23yNXtR-N1s&t=226s)** — Hmm.
- **[03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23yNXtR-N1s&t=227s)** — I don't think so.
- **[03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23yNXtR-N1s&t=228s)** — I also need to show you another heart healthy thing that's
- **[03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23yNXtR-N1s&t=232s)** — recommended seed oils.
- **[03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23yNXtR-N1s&t=234s)** — That's what they recommend.
- **[03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23yNXtR-N1s&t=235s)** — If we look at the mainstream recommendation, they basically recommend
- **[03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23yNXtR-N1s&t=239s)** — whole grains, unsaturated seed oils for the heart.
- **[04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23yNXtR-N1s&t=243s)** — Both of those items will start to raise insulin.
- **[04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23yNXtR-N1s&t=246s)** — We're also told to avoid saturated fat.
- **[04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23yNXtR-N1s&t=248s)** — Things with saturated fat have cholesterol and that can damage
- **[04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23yNXtR-N1s&t=252s)** — the heart and clog our arteries.
- **[04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23yNXtR-N1s&t=254s)** — This is why people say you need to avoid red meat, but they're
- **[04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23yNXtR-N1s&t=258s)** — not against coconut oil.
- **[04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23yNXtR-N1s&t=259s)** — One teaspoon of coconut oil has more cholesterol than seven ounces of a
- **[04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23yNXtR-N1s&t=265s)** — steak, but we're not against coconut oil, but we are against meat.
- **[04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23yNXtR-N1s&t=269s)** — There's a tremendous amount of false information in relationship
- **[04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23yNXtR-N1s&t=272s)** — to what's good for the heart.
- **[04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23yNXtR-N1s&t=275s)** — The statistics on heart disease are getting worse and worse and worse.
- **[04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23yNXtR-N1s&t=278s)** — What mainstream is recommending is not working.
- **[04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23yNXtR-N1s&t=280s)** — The best meal that you can eat to support a healthy artery, to help
- **[04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23yNXtR-N1s&t=286s)** — support a healthy heart.
- **[04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23yNXtR-N1s&t=288s)** — The first thing to know is we want to consume something that
- **[04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23yNXtR-N1s&t=291s)** — does not mess up our insulin.
- **[04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23yNXtR-N1s&t=293s)** — We're going to have to go low carb.
- **[04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23yNXtR-N1s&t=296s)** — Ketogenic is going to be best because with ketones, you can bypass
- **[05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23yNXtR-N1s&t=300s)** — this insulin resistance and feed that layer of the insulin, the artery,
- **[05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23yNXtR-N1s&t=305s)** — and make sure it gets enough fuel.
- **[05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23yNXtR-N1s&t=308s)** — The primary part of this meal is going to be red meat.
- **[05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23yNXtR-N1s&t=312s)** — The exact thing that they tell you not to eat.
- **[05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23yNXtR-N1s&t=314s)** — You can do a hamburger or something like that.
- **[05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23yNXtR-N1s&t=317s)** — I would just make sure it's grass fed.
- **[05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23yNXtR-N1s&t=319s)** — If you're going to have a burger, I would highly recommend
- **[05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23yNXtR-N1s&t=323s)** — you melt some cheese on it.
- **[05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23yNXtR-N1s&t=324s)** — I would find some raw cheese because raw cheese is higher in vitamin K2.
- **[05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23yNXtR-N1s&t=330s)** — Red meat is also loaded with zinc, which will directly
- **[05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23yNXtR-N1s&t=334s)** — improve your testosterone.
- **[05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23yNXtR-N1s&t=336s)** — As far as how much it could range anywhere from six ounces to eight ounces.
- **[05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23yNXtR-N1s&t=340s)** — The mistake that a lot of people make is they start going plant based
- **[05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23yNXtR-N1s&t=344s)** — protein that are not very bioavailable.
- **[05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23yNXtR-N1s&t=347s)** — We'll just think about what the heart is.
- **[05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23yNXtR-N1s&t=348s)** — It's like a muscle and we need to give it the raw material to
- **[05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23yNXtR-N1s&t=351s)** — help support it, to help heal it.
- **[05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23yNXtR-N1s&t=353s)** — Now let's get into the second part of this meal.
- **[05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23yNXtR-N1s&t=355s)** — And I'm going to recommend that you have a salad.
- **[05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23yNXtR-N1s&t=359s)** — I primarily do arugula, which also will increase nitric oxide.
- **[06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23yNXtR-N1s&t=362s)** — It also has vitamin C that's good for the arteries.
- **[06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23yNXtR-N1s&t=365s)** — It also has some vitamin E.
- **[06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23yNXtR-N1s&t=367s)** — The other thing that can help you is pumpkin seeds.
- **[06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23yNXtR-N1s&t=370s)** — Pumpkin seeds have high magnesium, high zinc and selenium.
- **[06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23yNXtR-N1s&t=375s)** — Pumpkin seeds can increase nitric oxide.
- **[06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23yNXtR-N1s&t=377s)** — Maybe just take a handful of pumpkin seeds with your meal.
- **[06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23yNXtR-N1s&t=380s)** — The last thing I want to bring up is vitamin D.
- **[06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23yNXtR-N1s&t=381s)** — To support a healthy heart, there's nothing more powerful than the vitamin D3.
- **[06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23yNXtR-N1s&t=386s)** — It's virtually impossible to get your vitamin D from food unless you're an
- **[06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23yNXtR-N1s&t=392s)** — you're eating all this seal fat, which you're probably not.
- **[06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23yNXtR-N1s&t=395s)** — So you're going to have to get it from the sun.
- **[06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23yNXtR-N1s&t=397s)** — When you're getting the sun, get a lot of it.
- **[06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23yNXtR-N1s&t=400s)** — Just don't get burnt.
- **[06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23yNXtR-N1s&t=400s)** — In the winter, you can't get it from the sun.
- **[06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23yNXtR-N1s&t=402s)** — So you're going to have to take it as a supplement.
- **[06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23yNXtR-N1s&t=404s)** — As a maintenance dosage, you need at least 10,000 I use every single day.
- **[06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23yNXtR-N1s&t=409s)** — That will greatly help your heart and many other things.
- **[06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23yNXtR-N1s&t=411s)** — Thanks for watching.
- **[06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23yNXtR-N1s&t=412s)** — And I will see you in the next video.

- **[00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4h75JTMGsAA&t=0s)** — I want to talk about the five mistakes that dieters make when they try to boost their metabolism.
- **[00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4h75JTMGsAA&t=7s)** — And when we talk about metabolism, I'm talking about the speed or rate at which you burn fat fuel.
- **[00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4h75JTMGsAA&t=13s)** — Okay, so that's the topic for today.
- **[00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4h75JTMGsAA&t=15s)** — So number one, the first mistake of trying to boost your metabolism is trying to boost your metabolism.
- **[00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4h75JTMGsAA&t=23s)** — Understand that a slow metabolism is not really a slow metabolism. It's an efficient metabolism.
- **[00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4h75JTMGsAA&t=29s)** — So when I talk about efficiency, I'm talking about some machine that can run on a smaller amount of fuel more efficiently.
- **[00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4h75JTMGsAA&t=36s)** — And that's exactly what a slow metabolism is. It's not necessarily turned down.
- **[00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4h75JTMGsAA&t=42s)** — It's just adapted to run on lesser amounts of fuel for a longer period of time.
- **[00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4h75JTMGsAA&t=47s)** — This is a good thing if you're trying to survive without food, but it's a bad thing if you're trying to lose weight.
- **[00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4h75JTMGsAA&t=53s)** — So stimulating metabolism with caffeine or some type of herbal stimulant or some drug is a very bad idea because you're going to burn out your metabolism.
- **[01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4h75JTMGsAA&t=62s)** — You're going to burn out your adrenals. And maybe you might lose initially a little bit, but in the long run, you'll end up having fatigue and having all sorts of issues.
- **[01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4h75JTMGsAA&t=72s)** — Alright, number two, the second mistake. Going on a diet. Okay. And I'm talking about a low calorie diet.
- **[01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4h75JTMGsAA&t=79s)** — All your body is going to do is going to adapt to lower amounts of calories and become more efficient.
- **[01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4h75JTMGsAA&t=86s)** — I will guarantee if you talk to anyone in their 40s, 50s, 60s with the appearance of a slow metabolism, they have a history of dieting.
- **[01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4h75JTMGsAA&t=94s)** — They have a history of going on a low calorie diet. And that really causes the metabolism to just work so efficiently that it doesn't take much fuel to run it.
- **[01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4h75JTMGsAA&t=103s)** — So maybe your spouse can actually eat a lot of food and not really gain weight.
- **[01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4h75JTMGsAA&t=107s)** — But with you, you just eat a little bit and you might gain weight because your body has adapted.
- **[01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4h75JTMGsAA&t=112s)** — Going on a diet or reducing the calories just trains the metabolism to just work more efficiently.
- **[01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4h75JTMGsAA&t=118s)** — Number three, you've probably heard of this before. Stoke the metabolic flame by consuming six meals through the day.
- **[02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4h75JTMGsAA&t=126s)** — And whatever you do, don't skip a meal because then you're going to slow your metabolism down, which is absolutely not true.
- **[02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4h75JTMGsAA&t=134s)** — Eating more food or eating more frequent foods does not stoke your metabolism fire.
- **[02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4h75JTMGsAA&t=139s)** — It doesn't stimulate your metabolism. It doesn't speed things up because every time you stoke that fire with eating, you trigger insulin.
- **[02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4h75JTMGsAA&t=147s)** — Insulin is the gatekeeper. It's the switch that determines what type of fuel that you want to burn.
- **[02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4h75JTMGsAA&t=156s)** — So if you don't already know this, when you're trying to burn fat, I think that would be the goal.
- **[02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4h75JTMGsAA&t=160s)** — Just to focus the body into only burning fat, not burn up your glucose reserves.
- **[02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4h75JTMGsAA&t=165s)** — So now you're hungry and you're starving and you're craving, right? It's to burn fat.
- **[02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4h75JTMGsAA&t=169s)** — So that way you're living on fat and you have a lot more of it and your appetite goes away and you go longer with that.
- **[02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4h75JTMGsAA&t=175s)** — To do that, you must lower insulin. You must lower your carbs.
- **[03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4h75JTMGsAA&t=180s)** — It's the only way to tap into the fat because insulin is one of the major fat storing hormones that even in small amounts can prevent you from tapping into that fat.
- **[03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4h75JTMGsAA&t=194s)** — So above all else, the lowering of your carbohydrates is going to be one of the most important things.
- **[03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4h75JTMGsAA&t=199s)** — And number four, you want to make sure you don't over train.
- **[03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4h75JTMGsAA&t=201s)** — Let me just tell you a quick story of a patient who came to see me and I'm not kidding. I'm not kidding.
- **[03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4h75JTMGsAA&t=208s)** — She would work out, I think six to seven hours a day at the gym, seven days a week.
- **[03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4h75JTMGsAA&t=213s)** — It was a full time job and all of a sudden she started gaining weight and she's freaking out because no matter what she does, she can't lose weight.
- **[03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4h75JTMGsAA&t=223s)** — I mean, even the thought of telling her to back off that exercise, it just make her more stressed out.
- **[03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4h75JTMGsAA&t=230s)** — She's a classic example of someone that's over training.
- **[03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4h75JTMGsAA&t=232s)** — Okay, over training never gives your body a chance to recover.
- **[03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4h75JTMGsAA&t=237s)** — And think about this, when you exercise, you're not really necessarily burning all your fat.
- **[04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4h75JTMGsAA&t=243s)** — The fat burning occurs in the recovery phase.
- **[04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4h75JTMGsAA&t=246s)** — I have another story to tell you. There was a lady who came to see me.
- **[04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4h75JTMGsAA&t=249s)** — She was a high 52, came in to try to lose weight and she decided not to work with me.
- **[04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4h75JTMGsAA&t=255s)** — Instead, she was going to go to the gym and work with her friend to exercise over a period of time to lose weight.
- **[04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4h75JTMGsAA&t=260s)** — Well, I saw her come back in my office a year later really depressed and she looked, if not the same, a little bit more overweight.
- **[04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4h75JTMGsAA&t=269s)** — And she basically told me she lifted, I don't know how many thousands of pounds of weight over a course of a year.
- **[04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4h75JTMGsAA&t=277s)** — I mean, like the workouts, I think there were three times a week, two hours a workout, just all this effort.
- **[04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4h75JTMGsAA&t=283s)** — Right. I think she said she lost a pound or two.
- **[04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4h75JTMGsAA&t=287s)** — But talk about depressing.
- **[04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4h75JTMGsAA&t=290s)** — Here's another example of someone that's overtraining and her real problem was that she wasn't able to sleep.
- **[04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4h75JTMGsAA&t=296s)** — So all that exercise never had a chance to create any benefit in the recovery phase because she just couldn't sleep.
- **[05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4h75JTMGsAA&t=302s)** — And her just she was overtraining and it was just terrible.
- **[05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4h75JTMGsAA&t=305s)** — All I did is help fix her sleep problem.
- **[05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4h75JTMGsAA&t=308s)** — And within three months, I think she she lost some major, major weight.
- **[05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4h75JTMGsAA&t=312s)** — And number five, those protein shakes that everyone says to go ahead and consume those to help stimulate your metabolism.
- **[05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4h75JTMGsAA&t=321s)** — Well, here's the data on protein.
- **[05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4h75JTMGsAA&t=323s)** — Yes, it is true that protein does stimulate three of the fat burning hormones.
- **[05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4h75JTMGsAA&t=329s)** — But the quality of protein is very, very important.
- **[05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4h75JTMGsAA&t=332s)** — These protein shakes many times are not the best quality.
- **[05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4h75JTMGsAA&t=335s)** — Usually there are some type of refined protein powder that doesn't come from nature.
- **[05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4h75JTMGsAA&t=340s)** — I mean, even the whey protein powder is not natural.
- **[05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4h75JTMGsAA&t=343s)** — They're taking out the fat. It's very, very lean.
- **[05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4h75JTMGsAA&t=346s)** — It's one of the highest things on the insulin index scale.
- **[05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4h75JTMGsAA&t=350s)** — The very hormone we're trying to avoid.
- **[05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4h75JTMGsAA&t=352s)** — So I would recommend instead of the protein shakes have real meat protein, animal protein.
- **[05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4h75JTMGsAA&t=357s)** — It's the best. There's also what's called the ideal protein.
- **[06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4h75JTMGsAA&t=361s)** — They use soy protein isolates. I'm very much against that.
- **[06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4h75JTMGsAA&t=364s)** — I do notice that some people lose weight, but they don't look good as they lose weight.
- **[06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4h75JTMGsAA&t=368s)** — They kind of look ragged. Their hair dries out.
- **[06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4h75JTMGsAA&t=370s)** — Their skin doesn't look vibrant.
- **[06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4h75JTMGsAA&t=372s)** — It's not the best way to help you lose weight.
- **[06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4h75JTMGsAA&t=375s)** — So here's a really important concept. It's not lose weight to get healthy.
- **[06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4h75JTMGsAA&t=379s)** — It's get healthy to lose weight.
- **[06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4h75JTMGsAA&t=381s)** — Okay, if you just focus on getting healthy and using fat as your fuel, you will lose weight.
- **[06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4h75JTMGsAA&t=388s)** — But realize in the process something has to happen first.
- **[06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4h75JTMGsAA&t=390s)** — You have to first convert your body into the state of ketosis.
- **[06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4h75JTMGsAA&t=393s)** — That could take a little bit of time.
- **[06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4h75JTMGsAA&t=395s)** — And the way that you know that you're in ketosis is that your appetite goes away.
- **[06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4h75JTMGsAA&t=399s)** — You're no longer craving for anything.
- **[06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4h75JTMGsAA&t=401s)** — Okay, you're able to do intermittent fasting.
- **[06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4h75JTMGsAA&t=404s)** — You go longer periods of time without eating.
- **[06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4h75JTMGsAA&t=406s)** — But because you have adapted to your fat, it's not going to create a stressful situation.
- **[06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4h75JTMGsAA&t=410s)** — It's not going to create a more efficient metabolism.
- **[06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4h75JTMGsAA&t=414s)** — So think about this. You have a very efficient car, right?
- **[06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4h75JTMGsAA&t=418s)** — Which is a person with a kind of a slow metabolism.
- **[07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4h75JTMGsAA&t=421s)** — Then maybe you have a Hummer, which is basically a fuel hog.
- **[07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4h75JTMGsAA&t=426s)** — It wastes fuel. That's what you want.
- **[07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4h75JTMGsAA&t=429s)** — You want to create a system that wastes a lot of fat so you can get this fat off your body.
- **[07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4h75JTMGsAA&t=435s)** — You don't want to create a more efficient system.
- **[07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4h75JTMGsAA&t=437s)** — Unless you're going to be in an environment where you're not going to have a lot of food, then maybe it's a good idea.
- **[07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4h75JTMGsAA&t=442s)** — Let's say for example in that series, Naked and Afraid, right?
- **[07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4h75JTMGsAA&t=445s)** — Where you have to get your own food, right?
- **[07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4h75JTMGsAA&t=447s)** — Well, someone with a very efficient metabolism would survive much better in that environment.
- **[07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4h75JTMGsAA&t=453s)** — So maybe having this efficient metabolism would be a really good thing if you enrolled in that TV program.
- **[07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4h75JTMGsAA&t=458s)** — But other than that, it's not the best idea.
- **[07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4h75JTMGsAA&t=460s)** — We want to waste fuel. We want to waste a lot of fat fuel.
- **[07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4h75JTMGsAA&t=463s)** — You can do that with ketosis by lowering your carbohydrates.
- **[07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4h75JTMGsAA&t=466s)** — You want to burn fat as fuel.
- **[07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4h75JTMGsAA&t=469s)** — Okay, so how do you do that?
- **[07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4h75JTMGsAA&t=470s)** — Moderate high quality protein will stimulate glucagon and growth hormone and testosterone.
- **[07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4h75JTMGsAA&t=477s)** — And if you do high intensity interval training with lots of rest and good recovery,
- **[08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4h75JTMGsAA&t=483s)** — that will stimulate adrenaline, which also can help you burn fat.
- **[08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4h75JTMGsAA&t=487s)** — But more importantly, it's to understand what to avoid.
- **[08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4h75JTMGsAA&t=492s)** — Okay, what to avoid is way more important than what to eat.
- **[08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4h75JTMGsAA&t=496s)** — Okay, because there are two fat making hormones.
- **[08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4h75JTMGsAA&t=499s)** — The big one is insulin and that's related to eating carbohydrates.
- **[08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4h75JTMGsAA&t=504s)** — So you have to keep your carbs low.
- **[08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4h75JTMGsAA&t=507s)** — And cortisol. Cortisol is another fat making hormone, especially in your midsection.
- **[08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4h75JTMGsAA&t=513s)** — It mobilizes even your proteins and turns that into sugar, which then is converted to fat.
- **[08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4h75JTMGsAA&t=518s)** — A lot of the fat making actions of cortisol happen because cortisol will eventually trigger insulin.
- **[08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4h75JTMGsAA&t=526s)** — And so keeping your stress low by exercising, walking, sleeping is vital.
- **[08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4h75JTMGsAA&t=532s)** — The other question is what do you actually eat to be healthy?
- **[08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4h75JTMGsAA&t=535s)** — Well, for that, just look at the dietary guidelines.
- **[08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4h75JTMGsAA&t=539s)** — You know, the dietary guidelines that are influenced by the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics, right?
- **[09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4h75JTMGsAA&t=545s)** — They are the source of science-based nutrition in food therapy.
- **[09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4h75JTMGsAA&t=550s)** — Most of them are dietitians. Others are assistants to dietitians.
- **[09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4h75JTMGsAA&t=553s)** — But the dietitian is the most influential individual involved in food policy that has given us this food pyramid.
- **[09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4h75JTMGsAA&t=562s)** — Or these dietary guidelines, right? Which are considered to be healthy.
- **[09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4h75JTMGsAA&t=567s)** — And what they say is that you should pretty much have half your plate grains
- **[09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4h75JTMGsAA&t=570s)** — and then the other half fruits and vegetables.
- **[09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4h75JTMGsAA&t=574s)** — And make sure you have low-fat proteins.
- **[09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4h75JTMGsAA&t=577s)** — If you go to the website called eatright.org, you will see right at the top,
- **[09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4h75JTMGsAA&t=580s)** — they are the most trusted, okay, in food and nutrition.
- **[09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4h75JTMGsAA&t=584s)** — But, you know, there's this one little tiny issue I have with that.
- **[09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4h75JTMGsAA&t=590s)** — There's a man by the name of Ruskin who requested some documents through the Freedom of Information Act.
- **[09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4h75JTMGsAA&t=595s)** — And he got 80,000 documents, emails, correspondence between the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics and the food industry.
- **[10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4h75JTMGsAA&t=605s)** — Quite a few cozy relationships between these two groups.
- **[10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4h75JTMGsAA&t=609s)** — I think the way I would use their site and information is I would see what they're recommending and do the exact opposite.
- **[10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4h75JTMGsAA&t=616s)** — And then you'll really discover what a truly healthy diet would look like.
- **[10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4h75JTMGsAA&t=620s)** — So to get that information on exactly what to eat that's healthy, you should check this video out right here.

## Full Transcript with Timestamps

*Click any timestamp to jump to that moment in the video*

- **[00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WRp_nuoO8FE&t=0s)** — What if I were to tell you, you could take one tablespoon of something and help yourself
- **[00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WRp_nuoO8FE&t=6s)** — lose more belly fat? Would you be interested? If so, there's a really great natural solution.
- **[00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WRp_nuoO8FE&t=11s)** — And this goes beyond the typical eat less, exercise more, etc. This talk is mainly for
- **[00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WRp_nuoO8FE&t=18s)** — the person that has a slow metabolism and they need an unfair advantage. But I need
- **[00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WRp_nuoO8FE&t=24s)** — to really clarify something because people that say they have a slow metabolism actually
- **[00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WRp_nuoO8FE&t=28s)** — don't have a slow metabolism. It's not that the metabolism is slow, it's just very efficient.
- **[00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WRp_nuoO8FE&t=37s)** — Okay, if we take a Hummer on the side versus a hybrid Camry, what would be the main difference?
- **[00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WRp_nuoO8FE&t=43s)** — Well, one is a gas guzzler and one is more efficient with its fuel, right? The Hummer gets
- **[00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WRp_nuoO8FE&t=48s)** — about 16 mpg and the hybrid Camry gets around 51 mpg. Huge difference. So with people that
- **[00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WRp_nuoO8FE&t=57s)** — have a difficult time losing weight, their real problem is deep in the motor. The motor is just
- **[01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WRp_nuoO8FE&t=63s)** — too efficient. They can go a longer period of time with less fuel compared to someone with a
- **[01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WRp_nuoO8FE&t=68s)** — so-called high metabolism. So the question is, how can we switch your motor over to
- **[01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WRp_nuoO8FE&t=74s)** — a system that is more of a gas guzzler and you're in a situation where you're wasting
- **[01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WRp_nuoO8FE&t=79s)** — more fuel? That would be a good goal, wouldn't it? This is probably going to be a new term for
- **[01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WRp_nuoO8FE&t=84s)** — you, but it's called mitochondrial uncoupling. Well, the mitochondria is the energy factory
- **[01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WRp_nuoO8FE&t=91s)** — that turns food into ATP, which is kind of like a storage form of energy. And I think the best
- **[01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WRp_nuoO8FE&t=97s)** — way to describe uncoupling related to the mitochondria to make it really simple is that
- **[01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WRp_nuoO8FE&t=101s)** — the mitochondria is going to make less ATP and more heat. So what's happening instead of making
- **[01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WRp_nuoO8FE&t=109s)** — this storage form of energy, it's basically just creating a lot of heat and that heat can be
- **[01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WRp_nuoO8FE&t=114s)** — wasted. So today's talk is about discovering what you can use as a mitochondrial uncoupler.
- **[02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WRp_nuoO8FE&t=122s)** — Now there's a certain weight loss drug, which I don't even think it's still in the market,
- **[02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WRp_nuoO8FE&t=125s)** — in the U.S. at least. It's called 2,4-dinitrophenol, but we're just going to
- **[02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WRp_nuoO8FE&t=130s)** — call it DNP. Okay, this is a drug. And if I'm not mistaken, it was taken off the market
- **[02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WRp_nuoO8FE&t=135s)** — because yes, it helped people lose weight very fast, but it created some pretty serious side
- **[02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WRp_nuoO8FE&t=143s)** — effects. It overheated the body. People were sweating extensively. Now aspirin, by the way,
- **[02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WRp_nuoO8FE&t=150s)** — is another mitochondrial uncoupler, which I'm not going to recommend that even though it may
- **[02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WRp_nuoO8FE&t=154s)** — help you lose a little weight because it's a drug and it causes side effects like, you know,
- **[02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WRp_nuoO8FE&t=159s)** — a bleeding ulcer. But other than that, it's perfectly fine. Now there's another drug called
- **[02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WRp_nuoO8FE&t=164s)** — which is a dewormer. And it's also been tested to help lose weight in mice studies. I don't think
- **[02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WRp_nuoO8FE&t=172s)** — they repurposed it for a weight loss medication, but it too does what's called mitochondrial
- **[02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WRp_nuoO8FE&t=178s)** — uncoupling. Now the question is, is there a natural mitochondrial uncoupler? And yes,
- **[03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WRp_nuoO8FE&t=184s)** — there is. The first thing that can help increase it is something called resveratrol.
- **[03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WRp_nuoO8FE&t=189s)** — Now what's interesting about resveratrol, resveratrol is in several things. It's in grapes,
- **[03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WRp_nuoO8FE&t=196s)** — cranberries, it's in blueberries, it's also in dark chocolate, it's in pistachios, and it's
- **[03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WRp_nuoO8FE&t=202s)** — especially in something called Japanese knockweed. They make that into a tea. And they do have
- **[03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WRp_nuoO8FE&t=207s)** — resveratrol in a powder. So if you were going to take a like tablespoon a day, that
- **[03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WRp_nuoO8FE&t=212s)** — could help you. But what's interesting about resveratrol and all the berries that I just
- **[03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WRp_nuoO8FE&t=217s)** — mentioned is that they're all polyphenols. And even in the chocolate, it's loaded with polyphenols.
- **[03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WRp_nuoO8FE&t=224s)** — Okay. Now remember when I talk about that drug 2,4-dinitrophenol? Apparently there's an
- **[03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WRp_nuoO8FE&t=230s)** — interesting connection between phenols, right? Polyphenols and just regular phenols. The
- **[03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WRp_nuoO8FE&t=235s)** — chemistry of phenols apparently can create a mitochondrial uncoupling effect. Now there's
- **[04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WRp_nuoO8FE&t=241s)** — some other things that can create this uncoupling as well. Ketones. This is probably
- **[04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WRp_nuoO8FE&t=246s)** — one of the reasons why people lose more weight when they do the ketogenic diet. And of course,
- **[04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WRp_nuoO8FE&t=251s)** — ketones actually help the mitochondria just work better in general. Then we have cold
- **[04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WRp_nuoO8FE&t=255s)** — therapy. Think about what happens when you do cold immersion or cold shower. The core
- **[04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WRp_nuoO8FE&t=260s)** — temperature needs to always be constant. And your body is going to fight like heck to
- **[04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WRp_nuoO8FE&t=265s)** — keep that core temperature at 98.6. So think about how much heat you'd have to generate
- **[04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WRp_nuoO8FE&t=270s)** — to do that. And when you're doing cold immersion, you're not exercising. You're not
- **[04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WRp_nuoO8FE&t=275s)** — eating differently. You're just experiencing a lot of uncomfortableness and you're generating
- **[04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WRp_nuoO8FE&t=281s)** — a tremendous amount of heat and you're burning a lot of fat. Then we have another one called
- **[04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WRp_nuoO8FE&t=285s)** — exercise. That's right. Exercise helps the mitochondria waste energy. Fasting is another
- **[04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WRp_nuoO8FE&t=292s)** — way of creating uncoupling. Green tea has a mild effect of mitochondrial uncoupling. And
- **[04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WRp_nuoO8FE&t=299s)** — even doing a sauna or a jacuzzi creates a similar effect to mitochondrial uncoupling.
- **[05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WRp_nuoO8FE&t=306s)** — Now on the flip side, what are some things that will block this mitochondrial uncoupling?
- **[05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WRp_nuoO8FE&t=311s)** — That would be important to know. Number one, excess calories. Think about it. When
- **[05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WRp_nuoO8FE&t=317s)** — you eat too much, and what I mean too much is I'm talking about you're eating
- **[05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WRp_nuoO8FE&t=321s)** — excess of what your mitochondria can burn, you inhibit this mitochondrial uncoupling
- **[05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WRp_nuoO8FE&t=326s)** — and you worsen the mitochondria. This could be eating way too many carbs, too much sugar like
- **[05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WRp_nuoO8FE&t=332s)** — the average person, but it can also mean eating too much fat. This is something I rarely talk
- **[05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WRp_nuoO8FE&t=337s)** — about, but I think it's important not to overeat because you're forcing your body to overload
- **[05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WRp_nuoO8FE&t=342s)** — that mitochondria and your body can't burn it off. Now if you exercise a lot, then you
- **[05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WRp_nuoO8FE&t=348s)** — need to eat more. But how many people are eating just too much for their activity level
- **[05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WRp_nuoO8FE&t=353s)** — and their age? This also includes the snacking. This is why intermittent fasting
- **[05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WRp_nuoO8FE&t=358s)** — is a really great strategy as well. Aging, as you get older, we have less mitochondrial
- **[06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WRp_nuoO8FE&t=364s)** — uncoupling. The more sedentary you are, the less effect you're going to create with this
- **[06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WRp_nuoO8FE&t=369s)** — uncoupling. The more you're exposed to heavy metals, that can also block the mitochondria.
- **[06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WRp_nuoO8FE&t=374s)** — And certain medications, especially statins, beta blockers, metformin, and antibiotics,
- **[06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WRp_nuoO8FE&t=383s)** — now if you want to know the details of exactly what to eat for the healthy version of the
- **[06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WRp_nuoO8FE&t=388s)** — ketogenic diet, it's in this video right here. Check it out.

- **[00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8kB4DY8cWYk&t=0s)** — Today we are going to talk about 11 bad habits that can severely affect your brain.
- **[00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8kB4DY8cWYk&t=6s)** — And most of these are going to be quite surprising. In fact, the last one I am going to talk about
- **[00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8kB4DY8cWYk&t=10s)** — is extremely interesting. Bad habit number one. Chronic exposure to bad news. So do you ever hear
- **[00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8kB4DY8cWYk&t=17s)** — any good things in the news? It's pretty much filled with a lot of fear, doom and gloom,
- **[00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8kB4DY8cWYk&t=24s)** — bad news. It's all going to end. You need to go in your house, go underneath your bed,
- **[00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8kB4DY8cWYk&t=28s)** — and hide because our environment is extremely dangerous to be in. Well, what do you think that
- **[00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8kB4DY8cWYk&t=33s)** — does for your health? Well, it drops your emotional state. Okay. If you were at one time happy and
- **[00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8kB4DY8cWYk&t=40s)** — kind of upbeat, now you're kind of grumpy. You're kind of in anxiety mode and you might
- **[00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8kB4DY8cWYk&t=45s)** — even be in depression. And there's some interesting data that talks about your state
- **[00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8kB4DY8cWYk&t=49s)** — of being can affect the structure and the physiology of your body. You actually lose neurons.
- **[00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8kB4DY8cWYk&t=56s)** — Your brain actually atrophies. So you might want to control the exposure to bad news. And it
- **[01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8kB4DY8cWYk&t=64s)** — also could be people giving you bad news too. We all know a certain personality that tends to
- **[01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8kB4DY8cWYk&t=71s)** — not just give us bad news, but turn good news into bad news. Number two, toxic personalities.
- **[01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8kB4DY8cWYk&t=78s)** — We have all been into these relationships, which basically lower our emotional state, which
- **[01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8kB4DY8cWYk&t=83s)** — would actually affect the physiology of our brains. So sometimes it's good to get a long list
- **[01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8kB4DY8cWYk&t=88s)** — of all the people that you're associated with and isolate those who are a bit toxic and just
- **[01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8kB4DY8cWYk&t=94s)** — put them to the side. You want people that bring you up. You want people that support you.
- **[01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8kB4DY8cWYk&t=99s)** — Number three, you are spending way too much time inside your house or a building.
- **[01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8kB4DY8cWYk&t=103s)** — It's not very healthy to be inside all the time. It's extremely therapeutic to be outside
- **[01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8kB4DY8cWYk&t=109s)** — in the fresh air. And the sun doesn't just necessarily give you vitamin D, which is
- **[01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8kB4DY8cWYk&t=113s)** — essential for brain health. It gives you infrared. Now what is infrared? It's a type of
- **[02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8kB4DY8cWYk&t=120s)** — spectral energy that can actually penetrate your body by actually two inches. It can actually
- **[02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8kB4DY8cWYk&t=125s)** — even go through your skull. And this infrared can stimulate melatonin. The type of melatonin
- **[02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8kB4DY8cWYk&t=132s)** — that's a little bit different than the melatonin that's running through your pituitary.
- **[02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8kB4DY8cWYk&t=136s)** — It's a type of melatonin that's in all of your cells that acts as an antioxidant that is even
- **[02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8kB4DY8cWYk&t=143s)** — more powerful than glutathione. It's the most powerful antioxidant that protects you against
- **[02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8kB4DY8cWYk&t=150s)** — so many things, including stress. So inside we have fluorescent lights, poor ventilation.
- **[02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8kB4DY8cWYk&t=156s)** — We have a lack of sun. And we also have an alteration of the light and dark cycles.
- **[02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8kB4DY8cWYk&t=161s)** — The majority of the population would greatly benefit by taking vitamin D before bed,
- **[02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8kB4DY8cWYk&t=169s)** — especially if they have problems sleeping, especially if they are inside way too much
- **[02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8kB4DY8cWYk&t=174s)** — and can't get outside. So vitamin D is really important for brain health. All right. Number
- **[02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8kB4DY8cWYk&t=179s)** — four, being on a low-fat, low-cholesterol diet. Now, how does that affect the brain?
- **[03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8kB4DY8cWYk&t=185s)** — Well, did you realize that 60% of your brain is fat? Here we have this organ that only makes up
- **[03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8kB4DY8cWYk&t=192s)** — 2% of your weight, yet utilizes 20% of all of your energy. And 60% of it is fat. In fact,
- **[03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8kB4DY8cWYk&t=201s)** — the brain is the fattiest organ of all your organs. You need this fat to make myelin to
- **[03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8kB4DY8cWYk&t=207s)** — help the conductivity of the neurons. The information that goes through your nerve cells
- **[03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8kB4DY8cWYk&t=213s)** — travel at a speed of 268 miles per hour. It's incredibly fast. And things that lower our fats
- **[03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8kB4DY8cWYk&t=221s)** — or cholesterol, like a low-fat diet or statin drugs, can greatly put us at risk for
- **[03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8kB4DY8cWYk&t=229s)** — dementia and a lowered emotional state, whether it's anxiety or even depression.
- **[03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8kB4DY8cWYk&t=234s)** — And one really important point is it takes cholesterol to make bile salts, which actually
- **[04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8kB4DY8cWYk&t=240s)** — you absorb vitamin A, D, E, and K. So without those fat-cycled vitamins,
- **[04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8kB4DY8cWYk&t=247s)** — as well as the other nutrient omega-3 fatty acid, your brain can greatly suffer.
- **[04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8kB4DY8cWYk&t=252s)** — All right, number five, the bad habit of being on a high-grain diet. The recommendation,
- **[04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8kB4DY8cWYk&t=258s)** — pretty much given by all the medical experts, you must consume at least 60% of your diet
- **[04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8kB4DY8cWYk&t=263s)** — in the form of whole grains. Well, there's a problem with whole grains. Okay, first of all,
- **[04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8kB4DY8cWYk&t=269s)** — it's not as nutritious as you might think. It's very high in omega-6. In the book Grain Brain,
- **[04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8kB4DY8cWYk&t=276s)** — there's a lot of new information talking about how grains affect our brains. Now,
- **[04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8kB4DY8cWYk&t=282s)** — when you eat refined grains, you deplete your brain of vitamin B1. And that can create a huge
- **[04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8kB4DY8cWYk&t=288s)** — consequence of atrophy in your hippocampus, the part of the brain that's involved with
- **[04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8kB4DY8cWYk&t=295s)** — cognitive function. Number six, consuming a lot of sugar. Out of all the things that will
- **[05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8kB4DY8cWYk&t=301s)** — destroy your brain, sugar is at the top of the list. It's going to eventually create
- **[05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8kB4DY8cWYk&t=307s)** — insulin resistance. And that is going to cause a starvation of the neurons. Because
- **[05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8kB4DY8cWYk&t=314s)** — when you have insulin resistance, we have the situation where we have this high glucose,
- **[05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8kB4DY8cWYk&t=318s)** — high insulin, but the resistance doesn't allow the insulin or glucose to feed the neurons.
- **[05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8kB4DY8cWYk&t=326s)** — And unless you have ketones floating around, the neurons will starve and you start having all
- **[05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8kB4DY8cWYk&t=332s)** — sorts of neurodegenerative problems. In fact, there's a condition called type 3 diabetes,
- **[05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8kB4DY8cWYk&t=338s)** — which is Alzheimer's, which occurs from severe insulin resistance, not to mention the
- **[05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8kB4DY8cWYk&t=345s)** — B1, which creates atrophy of your hippocampus. All right, number seven, and this might surprise
- **[05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8kB4DY8cWYk&t=349s)** — you too much low stress. If you don't have any stress at all, that can be very unhealthy
- **[05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8kB4DY8cWYk&t=354s)** — for your brain. Why? Because you're not exercising enough. You don't have enough physical
- **[06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8kB4DY8cWYk&t=360s)** — activity that is needed to activate genes for your brain. So there's something called hermetic
- **[06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8kB4DY8cWYk&t=364s)** — stress, which basically it's a moderate amount of stress that can cause the body to become
- **[06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8kB4DY8cWYk&t=370s)** — stronger and more resilient and adapt to a positive state. And that would include the
- **[06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8kB4DY8cWYk&t=375s)** — exercise, heat therapy, cold therapy, hypoxia, which is a lack of oxygen training at a higher
- **[06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8kB4DY8cWYk&t=382s)** — altitude. So there's a lot of therapy in a moderate amount of stress or kind of
- **[06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8kB4DY8cWYk&t=387s)** — intermittent doses of stress. And also intermittent fasting is a form of stress
- **[06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8kB4DY8cWYk&t=394s)** — because you're not feeding your body any food for certain periods of time can greatly
- **[06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8kB4DY8cWYk&t=400s)** — add a positive stress to allow the brain to actually grow neurons. Not enough stress
- **[06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8kB4DY8cWYk&t=407s)** — is just unhealthy as too much stress. And so number eight is high stress. If you're under a
- **[06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8kB4DY8cWYk&t=415s)** — chronic high stress, mainly mental stress, or you have a lot of losses or injuries,
- **[07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8kB4DY8cWYk&t=422s)** — it's very damaging to the brain because this activates certain genes in your brain that can
- **[07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8kB4DY8cWYk&t=427s)** — turn on dementia, degeneration, inflammation. And so high stress, high cortisol can create
- **[07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8kB4DY8cWYk&t=433s)** — atrophy of the hippocampus, the key part of the brain that's involved in cognition.
- **[07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8kB4DY8cWYk&t=440s)** — Okay. And also high stress, cortisol depletes you of B1, which also does the same thing.
- **[07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8kB4DY8cWYk&t=446s)** — All right. Number nine, snacking. Snacking relates to intermittent fasting. Intermittent
- **[07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8kB4DY8cWYk&t=457s)** — And they're unknowingly creating a lot of problems with their brain because in order to
- **[07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8kB4DY8cWYk&t=462s)** — strengthen the brain, especially as we age, we need to do things that can help regenerate
- **[07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8kB4DY8cWYk&t=468s)** — neurons. I would even venture to say that snacking is even worse than eating carbohydrates.
- **[07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8kB4DY8cWYk&t=478s)** — And why is that? Because not only does carbs increase insulin, but eating in general
- **[08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8kB4DY8cWYk&t=485s)** — increases insulin. And when you're eating so frequently, you have these little snacks,
- **[08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8kB4DY8cWYk&t=489s)** — and the mid-afternoon snack and the snack before you go to bed, what you're doing is
- **[08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8kB4DY8cWYk&t=493s)** — you're jacking up insulin, creating more insulin resistance, and you're going to
- **[08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8kB4DY8cWYk&t=496s)** — affect your brain cells. And you're going to find that that's a really bad habit.
- **[08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8kB4DY8cWYk&t=499s)** — And the reason I know that is when a person gives up snacking, boy, do they have a huge
- **[08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8kB4DY8cWYk&t=504s)** — positive change in so many things, including things like getting up in the middle of
- **[08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8kB4DY8cWYk&t=511s)** — night having to urinate. These people that have frequent urination really have insulin
- **[08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8kB4DY8cWYk&t=516s)** — resistance. And the most simple thing they can do is give up snacking, especially the
- **[08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8kB4DY8cWYk&t=521s)** — snacking or grazing late at night. And boom, they can sleep through the whole night. And
- **[08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8kB4DY8cWYk&t=526s)** — they just happen to miraculously get rid of the symptom of frequent urination. Number 10,
- **[08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8kB4DY8cWYk&t=532s)** — anything that decreases the microbes in your gut directly affect your brain, like antibiotics,
- **[09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8kB4DY8cWYk&t=540s)** — like glyphosate in the GMO food. Which by the way, Monsanto got a patent for glyphosate
- **[09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8kB4DY8cWYk&t=547s)** — as being an antibiotic. And unfortunately, the earlier you are exposed to antibiotics in
- **[09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8kB4DY8cWYk&t=553s)** — your life, like as a baby, the worse things are. But that's a completely different topic.
- **[09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8kB4DY8cWYk&t=558s)** — There's a huge connection between your gut and your brain. Whatever happens down here
- **[09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8kB4DY8cWYk&t=563s)** — directly affects here. And you do have a nerve that connects the two, and that's called
- **[09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8kB4DY8cWYk&t=567s)** — vagus nerve. One of the side effects from antibiotics is dementia. Not to mention
- **[09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8kB4DY8cWYk&t=575s)** — the great majority of your neurotransmitters. Okay, many of the B vitamins that are necessary
- **[09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8kB4DY8cWYk&t=581s)** — for brain health are made by these microbes. And number 11, and this is what you've been
- **[09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8kB4DY8cWYk&t=587s)** — waiting for, consuming grain fed animal products versus the grass fed grass finish
- **[09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8kB4DY8cWYk&t=594s)** — animal products. Now you're saying, wait a second, where did you get that, Dr. Burke? Well,
- **[10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8kB4DY8cWYk&t=600s)** — there's some very interesting data that I want to share with you. I just participated in a
- **[10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8kB4DY8cWYk&t=604s)** — very interesting beef nutrient density study. When we send off our beef from my farm,
- **[10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8kB4DY8cWYk&t=611s)** — and they analyze the beef and compared it to many farms across the country. And what this was,
- **[10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8kB4DY8cWYk&t=617s)** — a study comparing the grass fed beef to the grain fed beef, as far as factors that can
- **[10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8kB4DY8cWYk&t=625s)** — contribute to your health and factors that can contribute to disease. Okay, so I want to
- **[10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8kB4DY8cWYk&t=631s)** — show you this. Check this out. In this first slide, you'll see total phytochemicals. These
- **[10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8kB4DY8cWYk&t=636s)** — are phytonutrients. These are plant based chemicals, okay, that are in beef. And it
- **[10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8kB4DY8cWYk&t=646s)** — dominated most other even grass fed samples, which is quite remarkable. And I'm going to share
- **[10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8kB4DY8cWYk&t=652s)** — why I think that is in a minute. So stay tuned. This is going to be interesting. You can see
- **[10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8kB4DY8cWYk&t=656s)** — the grain fed is very low on the phytonutrients. Okay. So in general, phytonutrients
- **[11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8kB4DY8cWYk&t=661s)** — are antioxidants. They have all sorts of amazing properties. They're anti-inflammatory,
- **[11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8kB4DY8cWYk&t=666s)** — anti-cancer, et cetera, et cetera. Here's another slide that shows the fatty acid ratio,
- **[11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8kB4DY8cWYk&t=672s)** — the omega-6 to omega-3 ratios. Okay. And on average, grass fed beef would produce a three to
- **[11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8kB4DY8cWYk&t=680s)** — one. That means there's three times as much omega-6 to omega-3. And the grain fed beef on
- **[11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8kB4DY8cWYk&t=687s)** — average is an eight to one. That's eight times the omega-6 fatty acid to omega-3 fatty acid.
- **[11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8kB4DY8cWYk&t=694s)** — Well, it just so happens that the beef that I sent in there had a 1.5 omega-6 to
- **[11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8kB4DY8cWYk&t=701s)** — one omega-3. And it just so happens that grain fed meats are high in omega-6. And so that
- **[11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8kB4DY8cWYk&t=708s)** — would increase the risk of inflammation. And by the way, salmon, which is high in omega-3,
- **[11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8kB4DY8cWYk&t=715s)** — has a one-to-one ratio of omega-6 to omega-3. And I want to show you a couple other slides
- **[11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8kB4DY8cWYk&t=719s)** — that are very interesting in relationship to what they found in the study with our cattle.
- **[12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8kB4DY8cWYk&t=724s)** — Look at vitamin B3. Just incredible amounts compared to the grass fed as well as the
- **[12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8kB4DY8cWYk&t=732s)** — grain fed. Wow. Interesting. Now I want to show you two other graphs, which are very,
- **[12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8kB4DY8cWYk&t=737s)** — very interesting. In this next graph, you'll see that this value with Dr. Berg's beef is
- **[12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8kB4DY8cWYk&t=742s)** — very low. Okay. And that is because this identifies advanced glycation end products.
- **[12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8kB4DY8cWYk&t=750s)** — This is something that's very, very negative. This is something that contributes to chronic
- **[12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8kB4DY8cWYk&t=754s)** — disease of your brain, of the heart. This is what you see in diabetes. So what does this mean?
- **[12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8kB4DY8cWYk&t=760s)** — It means that if you are consuming animal products that are higher in advanced glycation
- **[12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8kB4DY8cWYk&t=767s)** — end products, this can contribute to a worsening of your health. And the last slide is
- **[12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8kB4DY8cWYk&t=774s)** — homocysteine. Now homocysteine is another biomarker for heart disease risk. Check out
- **[13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8kB4DY8cWYk&t=781s)** — how low homocysteine is in the sample that I provided as well as grass fed, then compare
- **[13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8kB4DY8cWYk&t=786s)** — that to grain fed. Interesting. So this is just another reason why you should consume
- **[13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8kB4DY8cWYk&t=794s)** — grass fed, grass finished. Another name for that would be a hundred percent grass fed. This
- **[13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8kB4DY8cWYk&t=799s)** — is all about the ratios. You see, we're trying to get more omega-3 fatty acids into
- **[13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8kB4DY8cWYk&t=804s)** — our brain, especially because out of all the fats, 20% is in the form of omega-3, DHA,
- **[13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8kB4DY8cWYk&t=813s)** — and especially the gray matter. And so when you have a high ratio of omega-6,
- **[13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8kB4DY8cWYk&t=818s)** — it's competing for the omega-3. So even though you might be consuming like cod liver oil or
- **[13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8kB4DY8cWYk&t=825s)** — omega-3 fatty acids in your diet, if your omega-6 is too high, it's not going to go
- **[13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8kB4DY8cWYk&t=832s)** — And so this is why it's so important to really beef up, no pun intended, the omega-3 fatty acids.
- **[14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8kB4DY8cWYk&t=840s)** — And this could potentially lower inflammation in your brain and greatly support your brain
- **[14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8kB4DY8cWYk&t=845s)** — health. Now here's the question that you might be wondering right now. Why are there
- **[14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8kB4DY8cWYk&t=848s)** — so many phytonutrients in the beef that we have compared to the typical grass fed?
- **[14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8kB4DY8cWYk&t=853s)** — And that is this. The pastures that I raise in my chalaza have a much lower ratio of grass.
- **[14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8kB4DY8cWYk&t=860s)** — They have a much higher ratio of weeds. That's right. And diversity of weeds. I have many
- **[14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8kB4DY8cWYk&t=868s)** — different types of weeds and I have a smaller amount of grass as compared to a typical pasture
- **[14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8kB4DY8cWYk&t=874s)** — with cattle. You're going to have more grasses. And so if you think about it, the more
- **[14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8kB4DY8cWYk&t=881s)** — biodiversity that these cows get to feed on, the more different types of weeds and plants
- **[14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8kB4DY8cWYk&t=887s)** — that have their own microbiome, the more diversified microbiome they're going to
- **[14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8kB4DY8cWYk&t=893s)** — have in their guts. And a lot of these phytochemicals and vitamins are made by
- **[14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8kB4DY8cWYk&t=897s)** — the microbiome. And so my theory, and I'm going to do some studies on this to find out for
- **[15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8kB4DY8cWYk&t=902s)** — sure, it's the diversity of different plants that really created this profile right here,
- **[15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8kB4DY8cWYk&t=908s)** — which could relate to humans. If you were to have a salad and you had the same iceberg
- **[15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8kB4DY8cWYk&t=913s)** — lettuce every single day, that probably wouldn't be good. You might want to try to increase the
- **[15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8kB4DY8cWYk&t=917s)** — range of types of plants in your diet, whether in your salad or on your plate. And there is
- **[15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8kB4DY8cWYk&t=925s)** — some great research on the relationship between the diversity of plants and the diversity of
- **[15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8kB4DY8cWYk&t=930s)** — your own microbiome that can greatly help your health. Now, that being said, since we're on
- **[15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8kB4DY8cWYk&t=935s)** — the topic of brain health, if you haven't seen my other video on the brain, you should
- **[15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8kB4DY8cWYk&t=940s)** — it out. It's really cool. I put it up right here.

- **[00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VInAKJTTtYE&t=0s)** — Now, out of all the things that can affect your state of well-being and your health,
- **[00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VInAKJTTtYE&t=4s)** — sleep is at the top of the list. And people don't even appreciate a good night's sleep until they
- **[00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VInAKJTTtYE&t=9s)** — don't sleep. There was a period of my life, actually 12 years, where I had terrible,
- **[00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VInAKJTTtYE&t=15s)** — terrible sleep. There were nights where I didn't even sleep one minute. So I really appreciate
- **[00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VInAKJTTtYE&t=19s)** — sleep. And I have 12 things today I'm going to share with you about sleep based on first-hand
- **[00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VInAKJTTtYE&t=25s)** — There is a direct correlation with your sleep and your overall heart function and your longevity.
- **[00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VInAKJTTtYE&t=33s)** — And if you don't sleep, it can affect your cravings. You can actually develop an alteration
- **[00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VInAKJTTtYE&t=39s)** — in your blood sugars from just not sleeping that well. Your appetite will increase,
- **[00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VInAKJTTtYE&t=44s)** — your cortisol will increase, your mood will go down if you don't get enough sleep. But boy,
- **[00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VInAKJTTtYE&t=48s)** — when you sleep good, everything is great. So the first thing we're talking about is cortisol.
- **[00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VInAKJTTtYE&t=53s)** — Cortisol is an adrenal hormone and that can keep you up at night, especially around
- **[00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VInAKJTTtYE&t=59s)** — 2 to 2 30 in the middle of the night. You want to take more vitamin B1. Make sure it's
- **[01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VInAKJTTtYE&t=66s)** — a natural version, but it can actually greatly reduce your cortisol. You want to put a lot
- **[01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VInAKJTTtYE&t=70s)** — of attention on long walks every day, just to kind of get rid of this stress. Because
- **[01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VInAKJTTtYE&t=75s)** — obviously stress is activating the cortisol release. So you want to do a lot of things to
- **[01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VInAKJTTtYE&t=81s)** — focus in on what's really underneath the stress. Is it that you're watching too many
- **[01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VInAKJTTtYE&t=86s)** — YouTube videos on the news and bad news? And that can play a huge role. And I know
- **[01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VInAKJTTtYE&t=91s)** — people want to be informed of what's going on, but you have to limit or curb how much
- **[01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VInAKJTTtYE&t=97s)** — of that you can take during the given day. The second really important thing about sleep
- **[01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VInAKJTTtYE&t=101s)** — is getting enough vitamin D. If you don't have enough vitamin D, your circadian waves
- **[01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VInAKJTTtYE&t=106s)** — won't work that well. If you get jet lag, for example, vitamin D is the greatest antidote
- **[01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VInAKJTTtYE&t=112s)** — to jet lag. It can quickly reset your circadian rhythms pretty quick within a day or two.
- **[01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VInAKJTTtYE&t=118s)** — You kind of need a lot. You need between 40,000 to 50,000 IUs of vitamin D3. But
- **[02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VInAKJTTtYE&t=123s)** — vitamin D, even taken right before bed, sometimes can greatly help you sleep. Especially
- **[02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VInAKJTTtYE&t=129s)** — if you have sleep apnea. All right, the next thing, and that is calcium. If you're
- **[02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VInAKJTTtYE&t=134s)** — trying to go to bed at night and your muscles are kind of crampy and things, it could be
- **[02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VInAKJTTtYE&t=138s)** — magnesium, which I will cover, but it could also be a calcium deficiency. So calcium is
- **[02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VInAKJTTtYE&t=143s)** — involved with the muscles. But also a calcium deficiency will cause you to be tired. I don't
- **[02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VInAKJTTtYE&t=150s)** — know if you've ever been really, really exhausted and so tired that you can't sleep.
- **[02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VInAKJTTtYE&t=155s)** — Well, calcium is the remedy for that. There's a couple ways you can get the calcium. One is
- **[02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VInAKJTTtYE&t=159s)** — with a calcium supplement, maybe a calcium magnesium supplement, maybe calcium lactate,
- **[02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VInAKJTTtYE&t=165s)** — which is a good one. Another thing you can do is consume more cheese during the day. Make sure
- **[02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VInAKJTTtYE&t=170s)** — it's a high quality cheese. I like European cheese, especially if it's raw. Let's talk
- **[02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VInAKJTTtYE&t=174s)** — about milk for a second. Is milk okay? Well, if you can find some raw milk, that would be
- **[02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VInAKJTTtYE&t=179s)** — the ideal situation right before bed. There is also something called nighttime milk, and you
- **[03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VInAKJTTtYE&t=191s)** — can get it when you milk cows at night, which enhances your tryptophan in the milk
- **[03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VInAKJTTtYE&t=197s)** — and the melatonin in the milk. But if you really can't find that, there's something else
- **[03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VInAKJTTtYE&t=201s)** — that I would recommend. Kefir, like from goat's milk before bed, plain, seems to work good.
- **[03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VInAKJTTtYE&t=209s)** — And if you're concerned about it breaking your keto or your fasting, just take it right
- **[03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VInAKJTTtYE&t=214s)** — after the meal. That can give you some probiotics, which will help your sleep,
- **[03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VInAKJTTtYE&t=218s)** — as well as the calcium. And also what's in milk is high levels of tryptophan, which turn into
- **[03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VInAKJTTtYE&t=226s)** — serotonin and melatonin, which can help you sleep. And so now let's talk about magnesium.
- **[03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VInAKJTTtYE&t=231s)** — Magnesium will help reduce that cortisol too. It'll help relax you, especially before bed.
- **[03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VInAKJTTtYE&t=239s)** — It can help with muscle cramps, which can keep you up. Some people take like a hot bath
- **[04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VInAKJTTtYE&t=244s)** — with Epsom salts, which is magnesium sulfate. That's another tip with magnesium. And there's
- **[04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VInAKJTTtYE&t=250s)** — other types of magnesium massage oils that you can have someone work on your back and muscles
- **[04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VInAKJTTtYE&t=255s)** — that are tight. The next thing on the list is making sure you have enough potassium in your
- **[04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VInAKJTTtYE&t=259s)** — diet. Potassium is kind of like a physiological tranquilizer. It calms the nervous system.
- **[04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VInAKJTTtYE&t=268s)** — A lot of the potassium is used in your muscles and your nervous system. And so if
- **[04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VInAKJTTtYE&t=272s)** — you're deficient, you may notice that your muscles are not relaxing properly. And your heart,
- **[04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VInAKJTTtYE&t=278s)** — you might have palpitations or an arrhythmia, which can keep you up, as well as a higher pulse
- **[04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VInAKJTTtYE&t=283s)** — rate. So potassium is key in keeping your pulse rate lowered. And if you ever consumed a lot
- **[04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VInAKJTTtYE&t=290s)** — of refined carbs or sugar, you're going to notice that you end up with a potassium
- **[04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VInAKJTTtYE&t=294s)** — deficiency. It can even create this like pounding sensation in your inner ear right
- **[04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VInAKJTTtYE&t=299s)** — before sleep. That means you need more potassium. And the way you can get more potassium and
- **[05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VInAKJTTtYE&t=304s)** — magnesium is through eating more leafy greens in your diet. I normally have between seven and
- **[05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VInAKJTTtYE&t=311s)** — ten cups. So if you can work up to like seven cups of salad per day, that will give you
- **[05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VInAKJTTtYE&t=316s)** — your potassium and magnesium requirements. Potassium is also really good to help lower
- **[05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VInAKJTTtYE&t=322s)** — anxiety. So if your diet is like really heavy with meat, which is kind of stimulating,
- **[05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VInAKJTTtYE&t=328s)** — and you don't have the offsetting minerals like magnesium and calcium from the greens,
- **[05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VInAKJTTtYE&t=333s)** — you may find that your nervous system is more accelerated and you don't have the break pads
- **[05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VInAKJTTtYE&t=338s)** — that magnesium and potassium provide. Now let's talk about your environment in your room. You
- **[05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VInAKJTTtYE&t=344s)** — have your pillow, you have your mattress. If your pillow is not the right the height of
- **[05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VInAKJTTtYE&t=350s)** — your head, so your head's too low or too high, that can be an issue. So it's really
- **[05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VInAKJTTtYE&t=355s)** — worth investing in a good quality pillow, not a cheap pillow that can hurt your neck,
- **[06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VInAKJTTtYE&t=362s)** — as well as a good mattress because you basically spend one third of your life in bed. I suggest
- **[06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VInAKJTTtYE&t=367s)** — go to a mattress store and test things out and see what you like best. And also you have
- **[06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VInAKJTTtYE&t=372s)** — the room, right? If your room is like in the winter and it's cold outside, you can't keep
- **[06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VInAKJTTtYE&t=377s)** — the window open, so you don't get as much oxygen. You might have too much CO2. And if
- **[06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VInAKJTTtYE&t=384s)** — you have too much CO2 and not enough oxygen, that alone can keep you up. But you can simply
- **[06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VInAKJTTtYE&t=389s)** — just get a couple plants in your room to help reverse that. But I always sleep better with the
- **[06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VInAKJTTtYE&t=394s)** — window open if possible. And also with your temperature, people tend to sleep better if
- **[06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VInAKJTTtYE&t=400s)** — the room is a bit cooler. So I keep the temperature in my room about 68 and then I
- **[06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VInAKJTTtYE&t=406s)** — seem to sleep better. Now what about taking melatonin? Is that a good thing? I don't
- **[06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VInAKJTTtYE&t=409s)** — recommend it because melatonin helps you get the sleep. It doesn't help you stay asleep.
- **[06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VInAKJTTtYE&t=416s)** — And melatonin is a hormone produced by the pineal gland. And anytime you take melatonin,
- **[07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VInAKJTTtYE&t=421s)** — potentially it could create a problem with the gland that's supposed to make it. So instead,
- **[07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VInAKJTTtYE&t=427s)** — you can increase your melatonin through foods as well as through light. The sun,
- **[07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VInAKJTTtYE&t=434s)** — over 50% of the sun's rays are infrared, which will naturally increase melatonin inside your
- **[07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VInAKJTTtYE&t=442s)** — body, believe it or not. And this melatonin has a different function to the with the pineal
- **[07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VInAKJTTtYE&t=447s)** — crates. Melatonin is a very potent antioxidant. And I will put a video on that down below.
- **[07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VInAKJTTtYE&t=454s)** — And so melatonin can be increased through this infrared, which actually can even penetrate
- **[07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VInAKJTTtYE&t=459s)** — your clothes. So especially like a sunrise or a sunset, you can get some really good
- **[07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VInAKJTTtYE&t=466s)** — infrared from that. And even like sitting in front of a fireplace or a candle or a campfire,
- **[07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VInAKJTTtYE&t=474s)** — or even having an infrared device. So you can see I have one right here. You can get one of
- **[07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VInAKJTTtYE&t=478s)** — these devices and to increase your infrared. And you can also use that for various other
- **[08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VInAKJTTtYE&t=483s)** — things like controlling pain and inflammation. And the other thing to know about that topic
- **[08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VInAKJTTtYE&t=487s)** — is that if you have fluorescent lighting, or you're in front of your
- **[08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VInAKJTTtYE&t=492s)** — screens a lot, or your cell phone, or the TV, all of that puts out this blue light,
- **[08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VInAKJTTtYE&t=499s)** — which interferes with your sleep cycles. Not to mention the other thing that's involved
- **[08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VInAKJTTtYE&t=503s)** — with the cell phone in the computer screens. That's called EMF, electromagnetic fields. Boy,
- **[08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VInAKJTTtYE&t=511s)** — that can really affect your ability to sleep, especially if you're doing that right before
- **[08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VInAKJTTtYE&t=515s)** — bed, or you spend a lot of time on it, or there's some type of device close to your head while
- **[08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VInAKJTTtYE&t=520s)** — you're sleeping. The next thing I want to talk about is vitamin B12. B12 is really good to
- **[08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VInAKJTTtYE&t=525s)** — help prevent things like sleep apnea. B12 is also involved in the creation of melatonin. And
- **[08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VInAKJTTtYE&t=531s)** — so if you're deficient in B12, for various reasons, that can keep you up as well. The
- **[08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VInAKJTTtYE&t=537s)** — next nutrient is vitamin B1. Vitamin B1 specifically helps that brain chatter,
- **[09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VInAKJTTtYE&t=542s)** — that excessive thinking before bed. And I recommend getting a natural one, because a B1
- **[09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VInAKJTTtYE&t=548s)** — deficiency is so common with so many people. And if you haven't ever experimented with it,
- **[09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VInAKJTTtYE&t=554s)** — taking it when you have anxiety or nervous tension, within minutes, you just feel calm
- **[09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VInAKJTTtYE&t=560s)** — and relaxed, and you can drift off into a wonderful sleep. B1 is essential for the brain
- **[09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VInAKJTTtYE&t=566s)** — stem function, which has a lot to do with your breathing. And you may find that your
- **[09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VInAKJTTtYE&t=572s)** — especially at night, if you don't have enough B1. So you might catch yourself like breathing
- **[09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VInAKJTTtYE&t=578s)** — very shallow. And what causes a B1 deficiency is the stress, sugar, refined carbs, and drinking
- **[09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VInAKJTTtYE&t=585s)** — too much coffee or tea. B1 is also really good to remedy nightmares. And that brings us to
- **[09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VInAKJTTtYE&t=592s)** — the next part of this, which is carbs, right? If you're consuming a lot of carbs, if you're
- **[09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VInAKJTTtYE&t=597s)** — consuming a lot of sugar or alcohol, you're going to deplete your B1. And that's going to
- **[10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VInAKJTTtYE&t=603s)** — increase what's called the fight or flight mechanism or the sympathetic nervous system,
- **[10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VInAKJTTtYE&t=607s)** — which is going to keep you up at night, not just with cortisol, but with adrenaline. Try
- **[10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VInAKJTTtYE&t=612s)** — to sleep if you're being chased by a tiger. It doesn't work. So the more carbs and more
- **[10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VInAKJTTtYE&t=617s)** — sugars, the more insulin resistance that you develop. And guess what else happens when you
- **[10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VInAKJTTtYE&t=623s)** — insulin resistance? You start having frequent urination at night. So all these people that
- **[10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VInAKJTTtYE&t=628s)** — have to get up through the night, and some people I know it's like 12 times a night. It's
- **[10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VInAKJTTtYE&t=633s)** — crazy. What they need to do is fix insulin resistance because insulin resistance, as well
- **[10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VInAKJTTtYE&t=639s)** — as pre-diabetes and diabetes, causes a situation where you have this excessive urine at night
- **[10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VInAKJTTtYE&t=647s)** — that will just force you to get out of bed. And it's so easy to fix that if you just change
- **[10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VInAKJTTtYE&t=654s)** — your diet. Another nutrient to help you sleep is zinc. Zinc tends to be intimately involved in
- **[11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VInAKJTTtYE&t=661s)** — the circadian rhythms and the REM sleep, as well as increasing tryptophan, which turns in the
- **[11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VInAKJTTtYE&t=667s)** — serotonin and then melatonin. So sometimes taking zinc before bed can greatly help your
- **[11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VInAKJTTtYE&t=680s)** — If you're consuming caffeine, boy, that'll keep you up. So I would really look at that as well. I
- **[11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VInAKJTTtYE&t=686s)** — have just a very small cup of coffee in the mornings and that's it. I don't have any more.
- **[11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VInAKJTTtYE&t=690s)** — And I find if I do that, I can sleep really good. Your liver has to detoxify that caffeine.
- **[11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VInAKJTTtYE&t=696s)** — And if you have any problem with your liver, then you might just tend to retain that
- **[11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VInAKJTTtYE&t=701s)** — longer than you should. I always focus on my breathing to help me get to sleep. And also,
- **[11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VInAKJTTtYE&t=707s)** — if I get up in the middle of the night and I can't get back to sleep, I notice that I'm
- **[11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VInAKJTTtYE&t=711s)** — catching my breath. So slow, even breaths, making sure that your inhalation equals the
- **[11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VInAKJTTtYE&t=718s)** — exhalation. Breathing through your nose, breathing through your stomach, focusing on
- **[12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VInAKJTTtYE&t=723s)** — the breath can greatly help you sleep. And the last point is not eating too late or overeating
- **[12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VInAKJTTtYE&t=729s)** — because if your digestion is stressed or you're bloated, you will not be able to sleep. So try
- **[12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VInAKJTTtYE&t=734s)** — to have that last meal as early as possible. And especially if you have insomnia, you may just find
- **[12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VInAKJTTtYE&t=741s)** — that can create a huge difference. Now, because of the censoring and the suppressing of the
- **[12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VInAKJTTtYE&t=746s)** — algorithms on YouTube, it's becoming more difficult to find my content. And there's
- **[12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VInAKJTTtYE&t=751s)** — a lot of content that I cannot put on YouTube, unfortunately. So to make sure you have full

- **[00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_aUWIBf2VE&t=0s)** — Okay, we are at the last video. Let's tie everything together.
- **[00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_aUWIBf2VE&t=2s)** — Our goal is to get you to one meal a day.
- **[00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_aUWIBf2VE&t=6s)** — That way you fast for the entire 23 hours and then have that last meal.
- **[00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_aUWIBf2VE&t=12s)** — And you can spread that meal, you know, maybe for two hours.
- **[00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_aUWIBf2VE&t=15s)** — But the point is that this will allow you to really spike that growth hormone
- **[00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_aUWIBf2VE&t=19s)** — to the extreme... to tap into some serious fat loss. Okay?
- **[00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_aUWIBf2VE&t=24s)** — So we are going to do 5% of your calories carbs. So it's like 20 grams or less.
- **[00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_aUWIBf2VE&t=29s)** — We already covered what to eat.
- **[00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_aUWIBf2VE&t=31s)** — And then 9 ounces of protein. Maybe it's going to be 8.
- **[00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_aUWIBf2VE&t=34s)** — But realize we need... we don't want too much.
- **[00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_aUWIBf2VE&t=37s)** — But then again, we don't want a deficiency of protein because your body,
- **[00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_aUWIBf2VE&t=41s)** — even though it recycles it, it's definitely something that
- **[00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_aUWIBf2VE&t=46s)** — we need to build the proteins that build the hair, the nails, the skin and all that.
- **[00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_aUWIBf2VE&t=50s)** — So we need some protein. High quality. More fatty, if possible.
- **[00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_aUWIBf2VE&t=55s)** — Healthy fats. We talked about that.
- **[00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_aUWIBf2VE&t=57s)** — In the beginning, you're going to need a little bit more.
- **[00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_aUWIBf2VE&t=59s)** — And as you do this, you need a little less because your body is adapted.
- **[01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_aUWIBf2VE&t=63s)** — The way that you know you're adapted is you crave nothing anymore.
- **[01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_aUWIBf2VE&t=67s)** — It's amazing. You have no cravings. And also you're not hungry nearly as much.
- **[01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_aUWIBf2VE&t=72s)** — Okay? Compound exercise. You want to add that in when you can.
- **[01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_aUWIBf2VE&t=77s)** — You want to gradually go into it. I do recommend a personal trainer.
- **[01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_aUWIBf2VE&t=80s)** — Compound exercise is working multiple muscle groups.
- **[01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_aUWIBf2VE&t=83s)** — I like to start with your own body weight for a period of months,
- **[01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_aUWIBf2VE&t=86s)** — maybe even a year until you can start adding weights.
- **[01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_aUWIBf2VE&t=89s)** — But working the full body, higher intensity with lots of rest in between,
- **[01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_aUWIBf2VE&t=93s)** — will just... it's the icing on the cake.
- **[01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_aUWIBf2VE&t=95s)** — I'm not going to talk about cake right now, but it's the meat and potatoes of...
- **[01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_aUWIBf2VE&t=99s)** — now I'm not going to mention potatoes, sorry.
- **[01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_aUWIBf2VE&t=102s)** — We just want to do this to increase and maximize even more growth hormone.
- **[01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_aUWIBf2VE&t=107s)** — Okay? Compound exercise. Twice a week.
- **[01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_aUWIBf2VE&t=111s)** — Give your time to recover between that and spread it out.
- **[01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_aUWIBf2VE&t=114s)** — Ideally it'd be Monday and Friday. That would be awesome.
- **[01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_aUWIBf2VE&t=116s)** — Or maybe Tuesday and Friday. Something like that.
- **[01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_aUWIBf2VE&t=119s)** — Sleep. Work on the sleep.
- **[02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_aUWIBf2VE&t=121s)** — If you have problems sleeping, get this right here.
- **[02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_aUWIBf2VE&t=124s)** — This is what I take. Take one of these 15 minutes before you go to bed
- **[02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_aUWIBf2VE&t=127s)** — and you will just go, bam, go to sleep. So that's sleep aid.
- **[02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_aUWIBf2VE&t=131s)** — Okay? So you can do that.
- **[02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_aUWIBf2VE&t=133s)** — That's going to enhance more growth hormone.
- **[02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_aUWIBf2VE&t=135s)** — Growth hormone is triggered by quality sleep, exercise, and low carbs.
- **[02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_aUWIBf2VE&t=142s)** — Then the nutrients. So we want more potassium, B1, B5, magnesium, and trace minerals.
- **[02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_aUWIBf2VE&t=149s)** — All of these are really key to lowering insulin and improving insulin resistance.
- **[02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_aUWIBf2VE&t=156s)** — A lot of people are using this right here in my electrolytes.
- **[02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_aUWIBf2VE&t=158s)** — And this has the potassium and a thousand milligrams of magnesium.
- **[02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_aUWIBf2VE&t=162s)** — It has the trace minerals. Okay? Trace minerals like zinc and chromium,
- **[02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_aUWIBf2VE&t=168s)** — which actually help the cells that make insulin.
- **[02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_aUWIBf2VE&t=170s)** — That will actually help you right there.
- **[02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_aUWIBf2VE&t=172s)** — And there's also something else I have. It's called nutritional yeast tablets.
- **[02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_aUWIBf2VE&t=176s)** — That's in my keto kit. So you might want to check it out. I put a link down below.
- **[03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_aUWIBf2VE&t=180s)** — But that way you get all the B vitamins. So everything is smooth. You have the minerals.
- **[03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_aUWIBf2VE&t=184s)** — And then it comes with this too, the raw wheatgrass juice.
- **[03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_aUWIBf2VE&t=188s)** — And this basically will help in the calc shake, give you extra nutrients.
- **[03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_aUWIBf2VE&t=192s)** — And it comes with the book. Okay?
- **[03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_aUWIBf2VE&t=195s)** — Last thing is the outside of vinegar. Make sure you consume that with a meal.
- **[03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_aUWIBf2VE&t=198s)** — So your stomach is really, really acidic and you can digest the protein.
- **[03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_aUWIBf2VE&t=202s)** — It's going to make a big difference with blood sugars. Okay?
- **[03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_aUWIBf2VE&t=206s)** — All right. So you made it. So the next step is to get started and send me your success stories.

- **[00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mTzY9qUkIs&t=0s)** — Now, I've done a lot of videos on cortisol, especially as it relates to the adrenal body type or the adrenal gland.
- **[00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mTzY9qUkIs&t=6s)** — But I haven't done any videos on how to lower it with foods. So that's the topic of today.
- **[00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mTzY9qUkIs&t=12s)** — I'm not going to get into the benefits of lowering cortisol because you probably already know that.
- **[00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mTzY9qUkIs&t=15s)** — You wouldn't be here if you didn't know about cortisol.
- **[00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mTzY9qUkIs&t=18s)** — But cortisol is the main stress hormone. There's another hormone like a compound called adrenaline.
- **[00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mTzY9qUkIs&t=23s)** — It's not a true hormone. It's a neurotransmitter. And both adrenaline and cortisol work together.
- **[00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mTzY9qUkIs&t=29s)** — And so if you ever look at the adrenal gland, you have an inside and an outside.
- **[00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mTzY9qUkIs&t=32s)** — The inside releases adrenaline and the outside releases cortisol.
- **[00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mTzY9qUkIs&t=37s)** — And both of those compounds have crossover functions.
- **[00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mTzY9qUkIs&t=41s)** — But in summary, they adapt the body to a stress state.
- **[00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mTzY9qUkIs&t=45s)** — Now, the thing you need to know is that the body does not know the difference between mental stress and physical stress.
- **[00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mTzY9qUkIs&t=53s)** — It reacts with these hormones and all the adaptations that occur with it for all stresses.
- **[00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mTzY9qUkIs&t=58s)** — But mental stress and physical stress are not necessarily differentiated.
- **[01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mTzY9qUkIs&t=62s)** — So nowadays we're not being chased by a tiger, right? Trying to get our food.
- **[01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mTzY9qUkIs&t=67s)** — We are hit with a lot of chronic mental stress, which creates the same effect on these two hormones.
- **[01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mTzY9qUkIs&t=74s)** — And yes, you can do a blood test or a saliva test for cortisol, which is quite extensive because you would have to test it every four hours.
- **[01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mTzY9qUkIs&t=83s)** — So you're basically getting up in the middle of the night and you're putting your saliva in this little tube.
- **[01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mTzY9qUkIs&t=88s)** — Then you have to send it out to the lab.
- **[01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mTzY9qUkIs&t=89s)** — There is a much better way of indirectly getting an idea of where your cortisol is at using something called heart rate variability, which measures the autonomic nervous system.
- **[01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mTzY9qUkIs&t=101s)** — I may have information on that, on how you can actually have your own device and how to measure yourself.
- **[01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mTzY9qUkIs&t=106s)** — But today we're just going to talk about what foods you should be eating or avoiding to really optimize your stress hormones.
- **[01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mTzY9qUkIs&t=113s)** — When we're dealing with the autonomic nervous system, we're dealing with a system that is on automatic and it's composed of mainly two things.
- **[02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mTzY9qUkIs&t=122s)** — The sympathetic fight or flight and the parasympathetic, which is rest and digest.
- **[02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mTzY9qUkIs&t=128s)** — Anytime that sympathetic system is activated by anything like mental stress, cortisol also gets activated.
- **[02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mTzY9qUkIs&t=136s)** — So probably one of the most important things to know before we even dive into this is the condition called diabetic dysautonomia,
- **[02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mTzY9qUkIs&t=145s)** — which basically means your autonomic nervous system is messed up because of this high level of sugar in your bloodstream.
- **[02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mTzY9qUkIs&t=152s)** — And that creates a lot of problems with all the different autonomic nerves, especially the peripheral nerves, the nerves in your feet, in your hands,
- **[02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mTzY9qUkIs&t=162s)** — and other nerves too, like your vagus nerve that goes to your digestive system.
- **[02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mTzY9qUkIs&t=165s)** — And so there's a lot of fancy words to describe those conditions too, like one being gastroparesis, another being diabetic autonomic neuropathy.
- **[02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mTzY9qUkIs&t=175s)** — All that means is your nerves are getting messed up because you have high blood sugars because you are diabetic.
- **[03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mTzY9qUkIs&t=180s)** — So the first thing to know is that sugar and starches really mess up that autonomic nervous system and they alter for the worse your cortisol as well as adrenaline.
- **[03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mTzY9qUkIs&t=192s)** — In other words, sugar and starches keep you in a stress mode.
- **[03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mTzY9qUkIs&t=194s)** — Now, of course, if you look at the opposite diet to a high sugar, high starch diet, that would be a ketogenic diet.
- **[03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mTzY9qUkIs&t=201s)** — And there's an interesting study, I think it's the only study out there, that looked at very low calorie and a low carb ketogenic plan.
- **[03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mTzY9qUkIs&t=210s)** — And so they combine a low calorie, which could describe doing like OMAD one meal a day, and you're also doing low carb.
- **[03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mTzY9qUkIs&t=217s)** — You greatly support the autonomic nervous system.
- **[03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mTzY9qUkIs&t=221s)** — So in other words, if you have too much sympathetic nervous system, it can help balance it out.
- **[03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mTzY9qUkIs&t=227s)** — There's some other research that shows how fasting can support the parasympathetic nervous system.
- **[03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mTzY9qUkIs&t=232s)** — And this is probably why people feel very calm when they start getting into this wonderful fasting state because the parasympathetic nervous system is kicked in.
- **[04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mTzY9qUkIs&t=243s)** — And so when you go on a ketogenic diet and you cut out the carbs and you also combine fasting, your mood changes.
- **[04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mTzY9qUkIs&t=250s)** — You can go from an irritable state or an anxiety state to a calm state because the shift in this parasympathetic sympathetic balance as well as the cortisol being lowered.
- **[04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mTzY9qUkIs&t=261s)** — In fact, my cortisol was very, very high at one time.
- **[04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mTzY9qUkIs&t=263s)** — And that was at the peak of when I was doing all the carbs.
- **[04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mTzY9qUkIs&t=266s)** — Okay, like I'm talking massive carbs.
- **[04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mTzY9qUkIs&t=269s)** — To support this autonomic nervous system to help balance the stress state, you definitely need B12.
- **[04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mTzY9qUkIs&t=276s)** — And what foods would be high in B12?
- **[04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mTzY9qUkIs&t=279s)** — All the animal products. Red meats, fish and organ meats.
- **[04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mTzY9qUkIs&t=283s)** — Because a B12 deficiency can cause a problem with that part of the autonomic nervous system.
- **[04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mTzY9qUkIs&t=289s)** — The next thing to talk about is this parasympathetic nervous system.
- **[04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mTzY9qUkIs&t=293s)** — That's your recovery system.
- **[04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mTzY9qUkIs&t=296s)** — The system that controls sleeping and digesting and being calm.
- **[05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mTzY9qUkIs&t=302s)** — And the neurotransmitter behind that system is called acetylcholine.
- **[05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mTzY9qUkIs&t=307s)** — And so the precursor for acetylcholine is choline.
- **[05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mTzY9qUkIs&t=311s)** — And guess what food has the highest amount of choline?
- **[05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mTzY9qUkIs&t=314s)** — You guessed it. Egg yolks.
- **[05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mTzY9qUkIs&t=315s)** — So eggs would be a really good thing to consume to support the lowering of the stress
- **[05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mTzY9qUkIs&t=322s)** — and the lowering of cortisol and adrenaline.
- **[05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mTzY9qUkIs&t=324s)** — But also you can get choline in organ meats, okay?
- **[05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mTzY9qUkIs&t=327s)** — Like liver, etc.
- **[05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mTzY9qUkIs&t=329s)** — Other two key nutrients to support acetylcholine would be vitamin B1 and vitamin B5.
- **[05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mTzY9qUkIs&t=337s)** — Both of them.
- **[05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mTzY9qUkIs&t=338s)** — And you can get both of those naturally from nutritional yeast,
- **[05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mTzY9qUkIs&t=342s)** — as well as sunflower seeds and many other foods.
- **[05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mTzY9qUkIs&t=345s)** — And this is why when people have that nutritional yeast,
- **[05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mTzY9qUkIs&t=347s)** — maybe they put it on their salad as part of the dressing with olive oil and a vinaigrette or ranch whatever.
- **[05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mTzY9qUkIs&t=354s)** — Or they might just consume it in a tablet form.
- **[05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mTzY9qUkIs&t=356s)** — But when they consume that nutritional yeast, they feel calmer about four or five minutes later.
- **[06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mTzY9qUkIs&t=361s)** — But to have enough acetylcholine for your parasympathetics,
- **[06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mTzY9qUkIs&t=365s)** — you need B1, B5 and choline.
- **[06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mTzY9qUkIs&t=367s)** — The other two key minerals that support the parasympathetics
- **[06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mTzY9qUkIs&t=373s)** — as well as calming down the sympathetics, as well as lowering cortisol,
- **[06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mTzY9qUkIs&t=379s)** — is both potassium and magnesium.
- **[06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mTzY9qUkIs&t=382s)** — Both of these minerals are physiological relaxers.
- **[06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mTzY9qUkIs&t=386s)** — Okay, so they calm the body down.
- **[06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mTzY9qUkIs&t=388s)** — And it just so happens when people go through a lot of stress,
- **[06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mTzY9qUkIs&t=392s)** — all that stress can actually deplete these two minerals, leaving you deficient.
- **[06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mTzY9qUkIs&t=396s)** — And so does sugar as well.
- **[06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mTzY9qUkIs&t=398s)** — But taking more potassium and magnesium can calm you down.
- **[06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mTzY9qUkIs&t=403s)** — It will help the restate. It helps lower cortisol.
- **[06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mTzY9qUkIs&t=405s)** — So the food that has the most potassium and magnesium together are deep leafy green vegetables,
- **[06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mTzY9qUkIs&t=412s)** — as in big salads, as in what I recommend in a healthy keto plan.
- **[06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mTzY9qUkIs&t=417s)** — All right, the next nutrient that if deficient can create a big problem on the autonomic nervous system is vitamin D3.
- **[07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mTzY9qUkIs&t=423s)** — So you can get vitamin D3 free from the sun, okay.
- **[07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mTzY9qUkIs&t=427s)** — You can also get it from fatty fish like salmon while caught.
- **[07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mTzY9qUkIs&t=432s)** — But what's unique about vitamin D in cortisol is this.
- **[07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mTzY9qUkIs&t=436s)** — Vitamin D is not really a vitamin.
- **[07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mTzY9qUkIs&t=438s)** — It's like a hormone. And it has very similar functions to cortisol.
- **[07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mTzY9qUkIs&t=443s)** — And when you raise cortisol, you tend to deplete vitamin D.
- **[07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mTzY9qUkIs&t=446s)** — People that have high cortisol levels where they're stressed out usually have low vitamin D.
- **[07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mTzY9qUkIs&t=451s)** — And so to create a very similar effect, okay, for stress, for inflammation, for sleeping, you can take vitamin D.
- **[07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mTzY9qUkIs&t=461s)** — So vitamin D can help modulate or regulate that cortisol.
- **[07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mTzY9qUkIs&t=465s)** — Now, when we talked about the parasympathetic nervous system, that is part of the vagus nerve.
- **[07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mTzY9qUkIs&t=471s)** — And the vagus nerve connects from your brain to your digestive system and other visceral organs as well.
- **[07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mTzY9qUkIs&t=478s)** — So you can actually support and improve that vagus nerve by doing something to your gut, by fortifying it with probiotics, okay,
- **[08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mTzY9qUkIs&t=489s)** — probiotic foods, which I will put some research down below in the description.
- **[08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mTzY9qUkIs&t=494s)** — But sauerkraut, kefir, pickles, kimchi, and probiotic supplements for the gut.
- **[08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mTzY9qUkIs&t=501s)** — And that can support the parasympathetic, which could explain why some people sleep really good
- **[08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mTzY9qUkIs&t=505s)** — after they consume a probiotic or kefir before bed.
- **[08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mTzY9qUkIs&t=510s)** — So that was six foods that support lowering cortisol and adrenaline to help you cope.
- **[08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mTzY9qUkIs&t=515s)** — Now, because of the censoring and the suppressing of the algorithms on YouTube, it's becoming more difficult to find my content.
- **[08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mTzY9qUkIs&t=522s)** — And there's a lot of content that I cannot put on YouTube, unfortunately.
- **[08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mTzY9qUkIs&t=526s)** — So to make sure you have full access of all my information, go to DrBurgon.com
- **[08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mTzY9qUkIs&t=530s)** — and subscribe to my newsletter by clicking the link down below in the description.
- **[08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mTzY9qUkIs&t=536s)** — I will see you on the other side. Now, to be complete about this topic, there are other things you need to do to lower stress.
- **[09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mTzY9qUkIs&t=542s)** — And if you haven't seen this very popular video on how to reduce cortisol using other methods than food, watch it.
- **[09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mTzY9qUkIs&t=549s)** — I put it up right here.

## Full Transcript with Timestamps

*Click any timestamp to jump to that moment in the video*

- **[00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GcRNVf9XU-M&t=0s)** — Let's talk about the seven foods that destroy your kidneys.
- **[00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GcRNVf9XU-M&t=3s)** — Your kidneys are simply amazing. Each kidney has about a million little tiny filters.
- **[00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GcRNVf9XU-M&t=9s)** — They're called nephrons. And they have the ability to selectively get rid of certain bad stuff
- **[00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GcRNVf9XU-M&t=14s)** — and retain certain good things. And with the two million nephrons you have, you filter out
- **[00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GcRNVf9XU-M&t=19s)** — 50 gallons of blood every single day. And so these kidneys recycle 99% of all of your blood.
- **[00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GcRNVf9XU-M&t=27s)** — So only a little bit is released. And one of the big problems with your kidney is high blood pressure.
- **[00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GcRNVf9XU-M&t=33s)** — Because if you have chronic high blood pressure, that can really destroy those little tiny filters.
- **[00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GcRNVf9XU-M&t=38s)** — Another thing that's even more destructive than blood pressure to your kidneys is high levels of
- **[00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GcRNVf9XU-M&t=44s)** — sugar, as in diabetes. So all the sugar that's in your blood has to go through these little
- **[00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GcRNVf9XU-M&t=48s)** — tiny filters. And then what happens when it interacts with the filters is it makes those
- **[00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GcRNVf9XU-M&t=53s)** — little filters smaller. So now it can't filter. So now you're going to be losing sugar and losing
- **[00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GcRNVf9XU-M&t=59s)** — protein in the urine. A couple simple ways to determine if there is a damage to the kidney is,
- **[01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GcRNVf9XU-M&t=65s)** — number one, do you have sugar in the urine? And number two, do you have protein in the
- **[01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GcRNVf9XU-M&t=70s)** — urine? Because if you do, that can mean kidney damage. And also the color of your urine is
- **[01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GcRNVf9XU-M&t=76s)** — important too, because when the kidneys stop filtering, the color of the urine is no longer
- **[01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GcRNVf9XU-M&t=80s)** — amber yellow. It can get darker and it can turn actually a lot of different colors. But one of
- **[01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GcRNVf9XU-M&t=86s)** — the most important things that the kidney does is activate vitamin D. And if there's damage with
- **[01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GcRNVf9XU-M&t=92s)** — the kidney, you're not going to be able to activate vitamin D. And that could be one reason
- **[01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GcRNVf9XU-M&t=96s)** — why people are very, very deficient. So we need strong, healthy kidneys to get rid of waste
- **[01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GcRNVf9XU-M&t=100s)** — and to even retain nutrients. All right, let's start with food number one, instant noodles,
- **[01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GcRNVf9XU-M&t=106s)** — like ramen noodles. So it is true that these noodles are loaded with sodium, but there's
- **[01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GcRNVf9XU-M&t=111s)** — something more damaging about these noodles. It's actually a preservative. It's called TBHQ.
- **[01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GcRNVf9XU-M&t=117s)** — This preservative is very toxic to the kidneys. It can actually cause the kidneys
- **[02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GcRNVf9XU-M&t=121s)** — to work harder, where you actually enlarge your kidney. And it also has the ability,
- **[02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GcRNVf9XU-M&t=126s)** — in some cases, to produce cancer in your kidneys. Now, I just want to bring up sodium
- **[02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GcRNVf9XU-M&t=130s)** — for a second, because sodium definitely is a problem with blood pressure. When you go to
- **[02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GcRNVf9XU-M&t=135s)** — the doctor, they might say that you're salt sensitive, so you have to reduce your sodium.
- **[02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GcRNVf9XU-M&t=140s)** — But the question is, do we really need to reduce sodium? Or do we need to increase
- **[02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GcRNVf9XU-M&t=145s)** — potassium, which is more protective? Because there's just as many problems with too much
- **[02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GcRNVf9XU-M&t=151s)** — sodium as there is with a deficiency of sodium. There's a condition where a person is drinking
- **[02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GcRNVf9XU-M&t=156s)** — a lot of water, but not consuming enough salt. And that's called hyponatremia. With that
- **[02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GcRNVf9XU-M&t=162s)** — condition, you can even create fluid retention in your body, which puts a lot of strain
- **[02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GcRNVf9XU-M&t=166s)** — on the kidney. And also just drinking more water puts a big strain on the kidney,
- **[02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GcRNVf9XU-M&t=170s)** — getting rid of all this extra fluid. So when people think, oh yeah, what's good for the
- **[02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GcRNVf9XU-M&t=174s)** — kidney? Oh, drink a lot of water. Not necessarily. You want to drink when you're
- **[02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GcRNVf9XU-M&t=178s)** — thirsty. But forcing yourself to drink tons of water without the electrolytes could create
- **[03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GcRNVf9XU-M&t=182s)** — problems in the kidneys. And anytime you consume salt, always consume sea salt.
- **[03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GcRNVf9XU-M&t=187s)** — All right. Number two, skittles or things like this. And I'm talking about things that
- **[03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GcRNVf9XU-M&t=194s)** — contain a lot of food dyes. These artificial dyes are very hard on the kidney. The kidney
- **[03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GcRNVf9XU-M&t=200s)** — has to get rid of them. Now also realize at first, the kidney is going to recycle a lot of
- **[03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GcRNVf9XU-M&t=204s)** — that dye. And it's going to kind of go through your bloodstream over and over and over
- **[03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GcRNVf9XU-M&t=207s)** — again. You don't want artificial dyes going through your body like that. All right. Next
- **[03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GcRNVf9XU-M&t=211s)** — is fried chicken. I'm talking about the fried chicken that you would get at a fast food
- **[03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GcRNVf9XU-M&t=216s)** — restaurant. You put in seed oils at very high heats. So anytime you heat a protein
- **[03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GcRNVf9XU-M&t=223s)** — with a carbohydrate, as in all that flour breading, you get something called glycation.
- **[03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GcRNVf9XU-M&t=230s)** — Let me explain what glycation is. Here's some protein. Here's a carbohydrate. And they get
- **[03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GcRNVf9XU-M&t=236s)** — connected and they bind under high heats. So now this sugar molecule is stuck to the protein.
- **[04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GcRNVf9XU-M&t=242s)** — Now this protein in your body can't work anymore. That's what glycation is. So let's say,
- **[04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GcRNVf9XU-M&t=247s)** — for example, you took a test for diabetes called A1C. What they're measuring is the
- **[04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GcRNVf9XU-M&t=251s)** — amount of glucose that's stuck to the protein, your hemoglobin, your protein, your blood.
- **[04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GcRNVf9XU-M&t=258s)** — And it's making that no longer available to do its job. So if you have higher amounts of
- **[04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GcRNVf9XU-M&t=264s)** — A1C, you have higher amounts of sugar that's connected to your protein to the point where
- **[04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GcRNVf9XU-M&t=270s)** — you start getting all sorts of complications from diabetes, where things don't work. Because when
- **[04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GcRNVf9XU-M&t=276s)** — the glucose gets stuck to the hemoglobin or the protein or any protein in your body,
- **[04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GcRNVf9XU-M&t=280s)** — it clogs everything up, especially in the kidneys. And so when you consume something that's
- **[04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GcRNVf9XU-M&t=285s)** — fried, what you're going to get is this junk that just clogs everything up. The next one is
- **[04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GcRNVf9XU-M&t=291s)** — commercial bread. Now the expiration on this was mid-July. Right now, it's September. And look
- **[04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GcRNVf9XU-M&t=299s)** — at it. It's not even going bad. It's still soft. How can that be? Because it has preservatives
- **[05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GcRNVf9XU-M&t=306s)** — and it also has something called potassium bromate. Potassium bromate is really harmful on
- **[05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GcRNVf9XU-M&t=311s)** — the kidneys. In fact, it's banned in a lot of countries, except the U.S. and I think Japan.
- **[05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GcRNVf9XU-M&t=316s)** — And apparently it's carcinogenic in our bodies, especially with kidney cancer.
- **[05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GcRNVf9XU-M&t=320s)** — The next one is soda. What's in the soda that's harmful for the kidneys? Phosphoric acid.
- **[05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GcRNVf9XU-M&t=328s)** — Phosphoric acid is destructive on the kidneys, not just from the phosphoric acid, but from the
- **[05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GcRNVf9XU-M&t=333s)** — added sugar as well. And by the way, the number one cause of kidney damage is diabetes.
- **[05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GcRNVf9XU-M&t=339s)** — Now what's diabetes? Diabetes means the person has too much sugar in the blood.
- **[05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GcRNVf9XU-M&t=344s)** — Well, isn't there some sugar in here? Yes, there is. And then also, why do they put the
- **[05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GcRNVf9XU-M&t=349s)** — phosphoric acid in there? Well, number one, it's cheaper than other types of acid like citric acid.
- **[05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GcRNVf9XU-M&t=354s)** — It can act as a preservative. It helps retain the carbonation and it's an overall flavor
- **[06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GcRNVf9XU-M&t=360s)** — enhancer. All right, number six is agave syrup. Agave syrup has been known to be even keto
- **[06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GcRNVf9XU-M&t=367s)** — friendly, which it's totally bogus because 80% of agave syrup is fructose. Even high fructose
- **[06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GcRNVf9XU-M&t=376s)** — is a very high fructose. And corn syrup is like 55% fructose. Agave is 80, even in some reports,
- **[06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GcRNVf9XU-M&t=382s)** — 90% fructose. And yes, fructose is low in the glycemic index, but all the fructose is metabolized
- **[06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GcRNVf9XU-M&t=388s)** — different in the body. It goes to the liver and it overloads the liver with a lot of stress.
- **[06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GcRNVf9XU-M&t=393s)** — So why is that so damaging? Because the metabolism of fructose is similar to alcohol.
- **[06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GcRNVf9XU-M&t=397s)** — It also creates a lot of problems with insulin resistance, which is the precursor to
- **[06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GcRNVf9XU-M&t=402s)** — diabetes and then diabetes. And since diabetes is the number one cause of chronic kidney disease,
- **[06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GcRNVf9XU-M&t=409s)** — then agave nectar is right up there at the very top level of irritating the kidney.
- **[06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GcRNVf9XU-M&t=414s)** — All right, last one, cereals. Even instant cereals. Why? Not just because of the seed
- **[07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GcRNVf9XU-M&t=420s)** — oils and the refined sugars and the refined starches, but glyphosate. It's not going to be
- **[07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GcRNVf9XU-M&t=425s)** — listed as one of the ingredients because legally they don't have to put it on the label, but
- **[07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GcRNVf9XU-M&t=429s)** — can volunteer using a different name. Bioengineered ingredients. You might see that.
- **[07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GcRNVf9XU-M&t=436s)** — That means glyphosate. Now in certain parts of the world where they use a lot of glyphosate
- **[07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GcRNVf9XU-M&t=442s)** — in agriculture, the workers who work the fields have a much higher risk of chronic kidney
- **[07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GcRNVf9XU-M&t=448s)** — disease because of the heavy exposure to this glyphosate. The other thing to know is that
- **[07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GcRNVf9XU-M&t=453s)** — anything GMO like soy, corn, cottonseed is going to have glyphosate in it, but also
- **[07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GcRNVf9XU-M&t=459s)** — things that are not GMO like oats and wheat because they use glyphosate to dry out these
- **[07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GcRNVf9XU-M&t=466s)** — grains during the processing of them. And so even though it's not GMO, they're still using
- **[07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GcRNVf9XU-M&t=471s)** — them. So we talked about all the foods to avoid. Okay, but now the question is what to
- **[07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GcRNVf9XU-M&t=476s)** — eat to improve kidney function? And for that information, you should watch this video right here.

- **[00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_ffrE7An-8&t=0s)** — These are my top 7 health tips based on science. Most doctors ignore these.
- **[00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_ffrE7An-8&t=5s)** — This first risk factor is equivalent to smoking. Not just one cigarette a day.
- **[00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_ffrE7An-8&t=11s)** — 15 cigarettes every single day. Can you guess what it is? Loneliness.
- **[00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_ffrE7An-8&t=15s)** — That is a major stress on our bodies. Of course, there's different levels of loneliness.
- **[00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_ffrE7An-8&t=20s)** — You have a very severe level where you just lost a loved one, which is going to make you very lonely.
- **[00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_ffrE7An-8&t=25s)** — Social isolation. It will keep the chronic elevation of cortisol going on.
- **[00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_ffrE7An-8&t=30s)** — A lot of inflammation occurs with this. This is why they're at risk for heart disease, stroke, and definitely high blood pressure.
- **[00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_ffrE7An-8&t=36s)** — Loneliness also shuts down certain genes to your immune system, making you more vulnerable to developing cancer and getting viral infections.
- **[00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_ffrE7An-8&t=45s)** — Humans are very social beings, and when they don't have that social aspect, all sorts of health problems occur.
- **[00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_ffrE7An-8&t=50s)** — What would be the health tip that would come from that?
- **[00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_ffrE7An-8&t=52s)** — Quality relationships. At least three. That will lift you up is super therapeutic.
- **[00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_ffrE7An-8&t=57s)** — Where you have a regular social engagement.
- **[01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_ffrE7An-8&t=61s)** — Another thing to do is volunteer and help some group or some person.
- **[01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_ffrE7An-8&t=66s)** — Because it's very therapeutic to help another. Let's go to number two.
- **[01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_ffrE7An-8&t=70s)** — Lack of sleep. Getting less than five hours of sleep will increase your risk for early death by 30%.
- **[01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_ffrE7An-8&t=76s)** — It two to three X's the risk of gaining weight, craving foods, developing diabetes.
- **[01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_ffrE7An-8&t=83s)** — It was revealed that there's brain aging with people that don't sleep. What's the tip on that one?
- **[01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_ffrE7An-8&t=89s)** — Get at least seven hours of sleep. Let's get to number three. Refine sugar.
- **[01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_ffrE7An-8&t=94s)** — That would be maltodextrin, modified food starch, modified corn starch, wheat flour, rice flour. That's all hidden sugar.
- **[01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_ffrE7An-8&t=101s)** — It's one of the key drivers for developing liver fat and obesity and Alzheimer's.
- **[01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_ffrE7An-8&t=106s)** — One of the biggest things that this refined sugar does and refined starch is making you old really quick and keeping your body inflamed.
- **[01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_ffrE7An-8&t=114s)** — What do you think the best tip to counter that would be?
- **[01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_ffrE7An-8&t=117s)** — Low carb ketogenic diet. There's a really cool app that I came up with. It's called Dr. Berg Junk Food Meter.
- **[02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_ffrE7An-8&t=124s)** — It's a free app if you have an Apple or an Android phone.
- **[02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_ffrE7An-8&t=126s)** — It allows you to quickly scan any food, any barcode, or even the picture of the label and focus in on the key three ingredients in most junk foods.
- **[02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_ffrE7An-8&t=136s)** — Sugars, starches, and seed oils. Most people have no idea how much of those three ingredients that they're consuming in the refrigerator or the pantry.
- **[02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_ffrE7An-8&t=145s)** — Let me show you what I'm talking about before we get to number four.
- **[02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_ffrE7An-8&t=147s)** — All you have to do is download it. It's free. Pull up a food. Hover over the barcode and start scanning.
- **[02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_ffrE7An-8&t=154s)** — And it quickly scans and shows you how much starch, seed oil, and sugar.
- **[02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_ffrE7An-8&t=158s)** — You can see in this one there's 19 grams of sugar in this yogurt. Crazy amounts. And there's some starch as well.
- **[02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_ffrE7An-8&t=163s)** — Let's pick another food. Pop-Tart. Holy mackerel. Look at it. You have starch, 39 grams. Got some seed oils in there. And you got sugar in there.
- **[02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_ffrE7An-8&t=172s)** — You can see the junk food score at the top is a 10, which means it's really, really bad.
- **[02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_ffrE7An-8&t=178s)** — It tells you what kind of ingredients that we're reading.
- **[03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_ffrE7An-8&t=181s)** — Let's do another food. Hot dog. This one has starch. So there's hidden starch. What kind of starch?
- **[03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_ffrE7An-8&t=187s)** — They're putting corn syrup in there and modified food starch. Not too healthy.
- **[03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_ffrE7An-8&t=191s)** — Can you take a while to guess what number four is? Industrial seed oils.
- **[03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_ffrE7An-8&t=196s)** — I'm talking about what most people fry their food in. They're going to create a lot of inflammation in the body because
- **[03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_ffrE7An-8&t=202s)** — seed oils are an unsaturated fat, which means they're very vulnerable to oxygen, heat, and light.
- **[03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_ffrE7An-8&t=208s)** — How is it that you can keep these oils right in your cupboard without having to refrigerate them to keep them shelf stable?
- **[03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_ffrE7An-8&t=215s)** — Because it builds up over time, it's a slow poison.
- **[03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_ffrE7An-8&t=218s)** — The health tip based on that is to start cooking with healthy oils. Extra virgin olive oil.
- **[03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_ffrE7An-8&t=225s)** — Grass-fed butter. Halo. Lard. Only use those oils in your food as well as cooking things.
- **[03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_ffrE7An-8&t=233s)** — This next risk factor. Visceral fat, the fat around the organs, really will tell you a lot about how long you're going to live or if you're going to have a health problem.
- **[04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_ffrE7An-8&t=244s)** — You can literally look down at your belly right now. If it sticks out, we know you have not just visceral fat, you have liver fat too.
- **[04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_ffrE7An-8&t=251s)** — It's one of the best indicators of heart disease. This is the heart right here. And this is the epicardial fat. It goes directly into the coronary arteries.
- **[04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_ffrE7An-8&t=262s)** — Did you realize that even children that are four years old are starting to get visceral fat? So it's not just happening as we get older.
- **[04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_ffrE7An-8&t=272s)** — There's no drug or no diagnosis code that can get rid of it. The only way to get rid of it is through your lifestyle changes.
- **[04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_ffrE7An-8&t=279s)** — The biggest top two things to do are intermittent fasting and lowering your carbohydrates and sugars. That's called a low carb diet or the ketogenic diet.
- **[04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_ffrE7An-8&t=290s)** — Let's get to number six. Constant eating or snacking. You're just basically eating too much of the wrong food and you're eating too many meals.
- **[04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_ffrE7An-8&t=299s)** — I'm not even talking about eating candy bars. I'm talking about eating anything. Chronic eating or snacking completely and utterly shuts down the self cleaning of old damaged cells.
- **[05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_ffrE7An-8&t=310s)** — Your body fills up with dirty damaged tissue. You age a lot faster than you should. For this tip, cutting out snacking is a super valuable tip for everyone.
- **[05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_ffrE7An-8&t=322s)** — For most people, what I'm going to recommend is a very simple tip. Only eat when you're hungry and don't eat when you're not. Be super powerful for anti-aging and to make you feel a lot better.
- **[05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_ffrE7An-8&t=334s)** — The last factor that creates a lot of problems has to do with three specific nutrient deficiencies. A magnesium deficiency.
- **[05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_ffrE7An-8&t=342s)** — When you're deficient, people tend to get high blood pressure. They might get arrhythmias, muscle cramps. What has magnesium? Lethe greens, pumpkin seeds, or you could take magnesium glycinate as a supplement.
- **[05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_ffrE7An-8&t=355s)** — Next nutrient is vitamin D. It said 40% of people are deficient in vitamin D. I think it's more like 90%.
- **[06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_ffrE7An-8&t=362s)** — When you're deficient in vitamin D, you get early risk of dying. You get a lot of inflammation. You get depressed.
- **[06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_ffrE7An-8&t=368s)** — You need at least 10,000 IUs of vitamin D3 every single day. This third nutrient is going to surprise you. And it's choline. A lack of choline will cause the fatty liver.
- **[06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_ffrE7An-8&t=382s)** — You could have problems with memory and cognitive function. Normally our bodies need about 550 mg per day of choline. The best source of choline is egg yolk and liver.
- **[06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_ffrE7An-8&t=393s)** — Now that you know the top 7 tips to better your health, there's a twist. None of this will really work unless you know the one most important food that will create health.
- **[06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_ffrE7An-8&t=405s)** — Trust me, you're going to be shocked. This is the video that you should watch right now. Click it.

- **[00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ESbprbvHKmE&t=0s)** — This is not how to create energy. Okay? I used to do this. I don't do it anymore because both of these items have made me very tired.
- **[00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ESbprbvHKmE&t=9s)** — Today we're going to show you seven ways to boost your energy in a big way.
- **[00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ESbprbvHKmE&t=13s)** — But I'm talking about generating true energy, not stimulating your body with certain types of stimulants like coffee and things like that.
- **[00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ESbprbvHKmE&t=22s)** — I'm talking about truly giving you the energy that gives you this sustained feeling that you have endurance and you're very awake and every part of your body is working.
- **[00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ESbprbvHKmE&t=32s)** — You see, things like caffeine don't really give you energy. They get rid of the fatigue molecule so you're less tired, but they don't actually boost your energy.
- **[00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ESbprbvHKmE&t=43s)** — Glucose or sugar might appear to give you energy, but in reality it's going to make you tired after you consume the sugar.
- **[00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ESbprbvHKmE&t=50s)** — Both of these have over 50 grams of sugar in them. That's like 12 and a half teaspoons of sugar.
- **[00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ESbprbvHKmE&t=58s)** — So let's dive right into those seven different ways. Okay? The first thing is using magnesium.
- **[01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ESbprbvHKmE&t=63s)** — Magnesium is the cofactor to make ATP. You can look at ATP like a battery. Okay? So if you don't have magnesium, you can't make ATP.
- **[01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ESbprbvHKmE&t=73s)** — So the number one symptom of a magnesium deficiency is, you guessed it, fatigue. So the question is how do you get magnesium?
- **[01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ESbprbvHKmE&t=82s)** — Spinach, almonds, avocado, fish.
- **[01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ESbprbvHKmE&t=87s)** — Number two, there's something called the sodium potassium pump. Okay? You have millions and millions of these in all of your cells.
- **[01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ESbprbvHKmE&t=95s)** — But the sodium potassium pump is very interesting because it allows you to generate electrical current and charge in your cells like a battery.
- **[01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ESbprbvHKmE&t=104s)** — That powers your muscle and your nervous system. And this is why when you're on the ketogenic diet, for example, or you're doing fasting, a lot of people don't consume enough sodium.
- **[01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ESbprbvHKmE&t=114s)** — Potassium is another mineral that a lot of people don't get because you need so much of it. You need like 4,700 milligrams per day.
- **[02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ESbprbvHKmE&t=122s)** — I mean, where are you going to get that from? Vegetable, salad, right? But you would have to consume a lot of salad to get that much potassium.
- **[02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ESbprbvHKmE&t=130s)** — And a lot of people don't. So they substitute or enhance it with electrolyte powder.
- **[02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ESbprbvHKmE&t=136s)** — Alright, number three, just basically generating more mitochondria. It's called mitochondria biogenesis.
- **[02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ESbprbvHKmE&t=143s)** — The number one way to do it is through consistent exercise. Doing it over time where your body can adapt and adjust to the workload by generating more mitochondria.
- **[02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ESbprbvHKmE&t=152s)** — Both endurance type of exercise as well as resistance type exercise. So this is why it's important to mix it up.
- **[02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ESbprbvHKmE&t=159s)** — Also fasting and intermittent fasting can increase more mitochondria. This is why we always recommend you do intermittent fasting with your keto plan, which I'm going to cover next.
- **[02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ESbprbvHKmE&t=168s)** — Cold therapy can actually increase more mitochondria because you're shocking the body in this cold state where the body has to generate a tremendous amount of heat to compensate for the loss of this heat.
- **[03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ESbprbvHKmE&t=181s)** — The body must maintain 98.6 to the core. So you can imagine there's a tremendous amount of stress on those mitochondria to start generating heat.
- **[03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ESbprbvHKmE&t=191s)** — I do know this. When I do cold therapy, boy, it just definitely gives me more energy during the day.
- **[03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ESbprbvHKmE&t=196s)** — Another thing that can help mitochondria is something called polyphenols. So this could be in just like eating certain vegetables, herbs, certain supplements of polyphenols like blueberries or other berries can give you polyphenols.
- **[03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ESbprbvHKmE&t=210s)** — Dark chocolate can give you polyphenols. And number four is ketones. This is going on the low carb diet.
- **[03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ESbprbvHKmE&t=217s)** — If we compare ketones to glucose as a fuel, the ketones will give you like 10.5 kilograms of ATP versus the glucose only gives you 8.7 kilograms of ATP.
- **[03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ESbprbvHKmE&t=230s)** — So low carb is definitely the way to go to get more energy.
- **[03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ESbprbvHKmE&t=233s)** — Next one, carnitine. Okay, carnitine. What is that? That is a compound that can help transport your fat into your energy factory called the mitochondria.
- **[04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ESbprbvHKmE&t=245s)** — It can help you increase endurance while you exercise. It delays the fatigue factor. It can even act as an antioxidant to decrease the damage in your muscles.
- **[04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ESbprbvHKmE&t=255s)** — Now take a wild guess what food has the most carnitine of any food there is on the planet. And that is red meat. This is why probably when you consume red meat you have more energy. That's one of the reasons.
- **[04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ESbprbvHKmE&t=270s)** — And it's interesting because apple cider vinegar is an acid and it can be used by your mitochondria as fuel. Add a tablespoon and a glass of water each day.
- **[04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ESbprbvHKmE&t=281s)** — And number seven, B vitamins. I like to get my B vitamins from nutritional yeast. But B vitamins are intimately involved with every part of your mitochondria that generates food into ATP.
- **[04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ESbprbvHKmE&t=295s)** — This is why a vitamin B deficiency can make you tired despite eating all this food. You just don't have the conversion.
- **[05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ESbprbvHKmE&t=301s)** — So now that you know how to get energy, the next thing to know is how to sleep. And for that information I put this video up right here. Check it out.

- **[00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYmq9JMlFRA&t=0s)** — Today we're going to talk about eight different ways that you can heal your trauma.
- **[00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYmq9JMlFRA&t=4s)** — I'm talking about physical trauma without medication.
- **[00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYmq9JMlFRA&t=7s)** — I stumbled on one therapy that I've never heard about even in practice.
- **[00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYmq9JMlFRA&t=13s)** — And it was amazing. And I wish I would have known about this when I was in practice,
- **[00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYmq9JMlFRA&t=18s)** — because I could have helped a lot more people.
- **[00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYmq9JMlFRA&t=21s)** — At the heart of trauma, okay, we are dealing with inflammation.
- **[00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYmq9JMlFRA&t=25s)** — Inflammation is part of the healing response. You can't heal without it.
- **[00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYmq9JMlFRA&t=30s)** — But the problem is when it crosses over into chronic inflammation,
- **[00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYmq9JMlFRA&t=34s)** — which I am an expert at that because I have a lot of old injuries.
- **[00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYmq9JMlFRA&t=39s)** — And I think to be an expert in anything, you'd have to have results in it.
- **[00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYmq9JMlFRA&t=43s)** — And relating to inflammation, I do have that.
- **[00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYmq9JMlFRA&t=46s)** — But I want to deviate just for a minute on this topic of inflammation and cancer,
- **[00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYmq9JMlFRA&t=52s)** — because inflammation is the most potent carcinogen, which is really interesting.
- **[00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYmq9JMlFRA&t=58s)** — You know, when people think about carcinogens, they think about smoking or junk foods.
- **[01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYmq9JMlFRA&t=62s)** — But the common theme of a lot of things that can turn into cancer involve inflammation.
- **[01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYmq9JMlFRA&t=68s)** — In fact, cancer spreads into areas of inflammation.
- **[01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYmq9JMlFRA&t=74s)** — But there's something called the Warburg effect.
- **[01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYmq9JMlFRA&t=78s)** — So cancer came from a normal cell. Something about that cell became damaged.
- **[01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYmq9JMlFRA&t=82s)** — And then the cell had a plan B and shifted to a different type of metabolism,
- **[01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYmq9JMlFRA&t=87s)** — which involves the fermentation of glucose.
- **[01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYmq9JMlFRA&t=91s)** — Now, immune cells also follow the same pathway.
- **[01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYmq9JMlFRA&t=96s)** — In fact, a lot of chronic disease type conditions are also using this Warburg effect.
- **[01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYmq9JMlFRA&t=102s)** — And I don't even know this until recently. And I found it very interesting.
- **[01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYmq9JMlFRA&t=106s)** — Now, there's a certain test that you can do for cancer called a PET scan,
- **[01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYmq9JMlFRA&t=110s)** — where they're scanning the body for areas of high metabolism of glucose
- **[01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYmq9JMlFRA&t=115s)** — to locate where cancer cells are growing, but it also identifies inflammation as well.
- **[01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYmq9JMlFRA&t=119s)** — So my question is, how do you differentiate between inflammation and cancer cells?
- **[02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYmq9JMlFRA&t=124s)** — And I haven't found that information yet. I'll be looking into that.
- **[02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYmq9JMlFRA&t=127s)** — But just the fact that it can pick up inflammation is interesting.
- **[02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYmq9JMlFRA&t=131s)** — So what actually is inflammation?
- **[02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYmq9JMlFRA&t=133s)** — OK, at the cellular level, inflammation is where the cell is leaking protein.
- **[02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYmq9JMlFRA&t=142s)** — And now we have a higher concentration of protein outside the cell.
- **[02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYmq9JMlFRA&t=147s)** — You have fluid retention, right?
- **[02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYmq9JMlFRA&t=149s)** — And so when we're talking about fluid retention, we're really talking about something called an osmotic pressure.
- **[02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYmq9JMlFRA&t=155s)** — So edema fluid retention is really just like this pressure.
- **[02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYmq9JMlFRA&t=159s)** — And apparently that pressure causes this Warburg effect.
- **[02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYmq9JMlFRA&t=164s)** — So maybe it's because of the damage on the mitochondria. I don't know.
- **[02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYmq9JMlFRA&t=168s)** — So I just wanted you to remember that as we go through these different ways of helping the body heal from trauma.
- **[02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYmq9JMlFRA&t=175s)** — And of course, we really need inflammation. It's part of the healing process.
- **[02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYmq9JMlFRA&t=178s)** — But what we don't need is chronic inflammation, because chronic inflammation turns into scar tissue and fibrosis,
- **[03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYmq9JMlFRA&t=186s)** — which then can increase your risk for cancer.
- **[03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYmq9JMlFRA&t=189s)** — I mean, let's just take hepatitis or an inflamed liver that then turns into chronic cirrhosis of the liver.
- **[03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYmq9JMlFRA&t=197s)** — The next phase of that is liver cancer.
- **[03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYmq9JMlFRA&t=201s)** — The same thing with the lung.
- **[03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYmq9JMlFRA&t=202s)** — When you get inflammation in the lung through, you know, smoking for many years, you get scar tissue, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
- **[03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYmq9JMlFRA&t=210s)** — And now the risk for cancer goes way, way up.
- **[03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYmq9JMlFRA&t=213s)** — I mean, even like with diabetes, you're getting all this high levels of sugar and you're getting inflammation and you're going to be at risk for cancer.
- **[03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYmq9JMlFRA&t=222s)** — Anything that involves chronic inflammation can increase risk for cancer.
- **[03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYmq9JMlFRA&t=227s)** — And so you have a chronic consumption of alcohol that can do it.
- **[03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYmq9JMlFRA&t=230s)** — Eating junk foods, even having a chronic infection could create the same problem.
- **[03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYmq9JMlFRA&t=236s)** — Having a long term autoimmune disease.
- **[04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYmq9JMlFRA&t=240s)** — So when we're dealing with healing physical trauma, we're really dealing with trying to fix this chronic inflammatory state.
- **[04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYmq9JMlFRA&t=248s)** — And so when you develop scar tissue or calcification that occurs, things get stiff and then you get lack of circulation.
- **[04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYmq9JMlFRA&t=257s)** — And so these eight different methods are going to do one or more of what I just talked about.
- **[04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYmq9JMlFRA&t=262s)** — Now, of course, the first thing is just the elimination of the thing that is triggering this inflammation,
- **[04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYmq9JMlFRA&t=269s)** — whether it's a food or a bad habit like smoking or drinking alcohol, things like that, isolating what that is, eliminating it.
- **[04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYmq9JMlFRA&t=278s)** — I mean, so many people are consuming something that they know they shouldn't or maybe they're not even aware of it.
- **[04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYmq9JMlFRA&t=284s)** — And they might not even realize that that food is creating inflammation.
- **[04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYmq9JMlFRA&t=288s)** — They're experiencing maybe gas or bloating or something like that, but they don't know what's really happening deep inside.
- **[04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYmq9JMlFRA&t=297s)** — So this is one benefit of going on carnivore for a few weeks, especially if you have anything related to inflammation in your gut
- **[05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYmq9JMlFRA&t=305s)** — or at the very least doing keto, eliminating a lot of the refined sugars and carbs and correcting some bad habits.
- **[05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYmq9JMlFRA&t=312s)** — So that's number one. That's the most important foundation.
- **[05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYmq9JMlFRA&t=315s)** — Number two, a combination between heat and cold, like a hot shower or a cold shower or a sauna or a whirlpool or a cold immersion tank back and forth.
- **[05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYmq9JMlFRA&t=326s)** — What is that going to do? It's going to increase circulation in your lymphatic system.
- **[05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYmq9JMlFRA&t=330s)** — It's going to remove waste. It's going to stimulate healing at the cellular level.
- **[05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYmq9JMlFRA&t=334s)** — So sometimes you have to add trauma or on a microscopic level intermittently to stimulate the healing process.
- **[05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYmq9JMlFRA&t=342s)** — Alright, number three, this is an important one, exercise. Oh my gosh.
- **[05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYmq9JMlFRA&t=345s)** — This is one of the most potent things you can do for trauma because what's happened with chronic inflammation in scar tissue and an injured body part is you have now a lack of motion.
- **[06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYmq9JMlFRA&t=360s)** — And so when you put your body into motion, you automatically create all sorts of healing at many different levels, at the cellular level, at the muscle level, at the joint level.
- **[06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYmq9JMlFRA&t=371s)** — It's when we stop moving, we start to die.
- **[06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYmq9JMlFRA&t=375s)** — You know, so if you can just keep yourself going and keep moving, you're going to extend your life.
- **[06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYmq9JMlFRA&t=380s)** — Then we get actual stretching. I've done a tremendous amount of stretching and stretching can help you sleep.
- **[06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYmq9JMlFRA&t=386s)** — It can help with motion in the joints. It can help with posture.
- **[06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYmq9JMlFRA&t=390s)** — It can help break up the scar tissue that is interfering with your motion that's creating more inflammation.
- **[06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYmq9JMlFRA&t=396s)** — And then we have number five, taking high levels of vitamin D to remodel the tissues in your joints and other tissues.
- **[06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYmq9JMlFRA&t=406s)** — And then you have the famous omega-3 fatty acids, right? In olive oil, fish oil, things like that.
- **[06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYmq9JMlFRA&t=411s)** — You also have vitamin B3. There's two forms. One is niacin, another is niacinamide.
- **[06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYmq9JMlFRA&t=417s)** — You need to take the niacinamide version. I did a recent video on that and I will put that link down below so you'll figure out the dosages.
- **[07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYmq9JMlFRA&t=423s)** — And then you get polyphenols. In all the herbal remedies, curcumin, intermaric, green tea, they're in stinging nettle root.
- **[07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYmq9JMlFRA&t=433s)** — There's another great remedy that I talked about in a video called methylene blue.
- **[07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYmq9JMlFRA&t=438s)** — Methylene blue is the first synthetic drug that was ever created even before aspirin.
- **[07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYmq9JMlFRA&t=445s)** — And it used to be used for all sorts of infections, TB, malaria, as an antimicrobial.
- **[07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYmq9JMlFRA&t=454s)** — But it's also a pretty good anti-inflammatory, fairly non-toxic if you take it in small dosages.
- **[07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYmq9JMlFRA&t=461s)** — But what's really cool about methylene blue is that it helps you at the cellular level, at the level of the mitochondria.
- **[07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYmq9JMlFRA&t=469s)** — All right, number six is what I call the opposite technique. I have a lot of videos on this.
- **[07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYmq9JMlFRA&t=474s)** — If you haven't seen these, you need to check them out. The way that you want to treat it is working on the opposite side.
- **[08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYmq9JMlFRA&t=481s)** — Wherever you hurt on the left side, you work on the right side. If you hurt on the back, you work on the front side.
- **[08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYmq9JMlFRA&t=487s)** — I know this sounds weird, but I use this in practice as the most successful way to eliminate pain and reduce inflammation.
- **[08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYmq9JMlFRA&t=498s)** — How does it work? Probably has something to do with the nerve circuits. And you can also use this on old injuries as well.
- **[08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYmq9JMlFRA&t=505s)** — Number seven is fasting. Fasting is another potent way to drop inflammation and pain.
- **[08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYmq9JMlFRA&t=510s)** — It causes your body to adapt and survive better and turn off inflammation. It's quite amazing.
- **[08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYmq9JMlFRA&t=517s)** — And lastly, shock wave therapy. And I'm not talking about shock therapy, okay?
- **[08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYmq9JMlFRA&t=523s)** — No, I'm very much against that. I'm talking about shock wave therapy.
- **[08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYmq9JMlFRA&t=527s)** — Now they use shock wave therapy to break up kidney stones, even gallstones called lithotripsy.
- **[08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYmq9JMlFRA&t=533s)** — But they also have units that are not so focused on something small.
- **[09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYmq9JMlFRA&t=540s)** — In fact, I think pretty much every sports team at a high level uses this on their athletes.
- **[09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYmq9JMlFRA&t=546s)** — I had no idea. So I went to get some treatments. I was blown away.
- **[09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYmq9JMlFRA&t=553s)** — This technique just literally breaks up the cement. It doesn't hurt. It breaks up scar tissue.
- **[09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYmq9JMlFRA&t=560s)** — It increases healing. Now, of course, they do have home units, but I would recommend going to someone with the right frequency range that knows how to use this.
- **[09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYmq9JMlFRA&t=569s)** — It will stimulate more blood vessels to grow in a certain area. You can help reverse calcified tendonitis.
- **[09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYmq9JMlFRA&t=578s)** — I fractured my left elbow in 30 pieces. They had to reattach my tendon underneath the tricep, which is completely messed up.
- **[09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYmq9JMlFRA&t=590s)** — So when they did this therapy on that, it just like almost gave me a brand new elbow.
- **[09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYmq9JMlFRA&t=597s)** — I was like, what the heck? Why haven't I heard about this before? It's great on sciatica.
- **[10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYmq9JMlFRA&t=603s)** — So anyway, I just wanted to create this one video of all the therapies that I think could help a person recover a lot better from physical trauma.
- **[10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYmq9JMlFRA&t=614s)** — Now, I did mention this Methylene Blue, and if you haven't seen this video, I think it would be a really good next video for you to watch. Check it out.

- **[00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ozpg9J3qUkU&t=0s)** — Anytime you understand warning signs to predict what's going to happen to your body
- **[00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ozpg9J3qUkU&t=4s)** — before it happens is a very valuable thing. There's a great book, one of my favorite books,
- **[00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ozpg9J3qUkU&t=10s)** — called The Technology of War. It's by Sun Tzu. Having advanced knowledge so you can predict
- **[00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ozpg9J3qUkU&t=16s)** — things. Now this book, they're talking about advanced knowledge of an enemy coming so you
- **[00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ozpg9J3qUkU&t=20s)** — have knowledge about if you want to go to battle with them or not. But what I like
- **[00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ozpg9J3qUkU&t=24s)** — to apply this to is your body. Having advanced knowledge of what's going on and reading
- **[00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ozpg9J3qUkU&t=29s)** — different indicators of your body is so important. The problem in health care is when you go to the
- **[00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ozpg9J3qUkU&t=34s)** — doctor and you have these clues or symptoms, whatever, they treat them directly. They don't
- **[00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ozpg9J3qUkU&t=40s)** — use them to understand what's going on. But what if you were to use these indicators
- **[00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ozpg9J3qUkU&t=45s)** — differently to help understand what the body really needs? So I'm going to go through
- **[00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ozpg9J3qUkU&t=51s)** — eight diseases and give you some of the warning signs that your body is trying to
- **[00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ozpg9J3qUkU&t=57s)** — There's a problem so you can do something and prevent this problem from occurring. So let's
- **[01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ozpg9J3qUkU&t=62s)** — start with the first one, heart attack or cardiovascular disease. So the warning signs
- **[01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ozpg9J3qUkU&t=67s)** — for that are usually chest pain, pain in your left jaw, pain in your left shoulder,
- **[01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ozpg9J3qUkU&t=74s)** — or pain that goes down the left arm. Or maybe when you climb stairs or go anything up an
- **[01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ozpg9J3qUkU&t=80s)** — incline, you don't feel right. Something feels off, whether it's you feel out of breath,
- **[01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ozpg9J3qUkU&t=85s)** — dizzy. This could be the beginning of a heart attack and one really good test to get is called
- **[01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ozpg9J3qUkU&t=91s)** — the CAC test. This is a relatively quick test that can measure the calcification
- **[01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ozpg9J3qUkU&t=96s)** — inside your arteries, which is a really good predictor of whether you're going to have
- **[01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ozpg9J3qUkU&t=102s)** — heart attack or not. One of the best things to take as a natural remedy is vitamin E in
- **[01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ozpg9J3qUkU&t=110s)** — of tokatrinols. Another good remedy is vitamin K2 because that helps remove calcium in the
- **[01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ozpg9J3qUkU&t=116s)** — arteries and of course radically change your diet. Alright, number two, stroke. Some of the early
- **[02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ozpg9J3qUkU&t=122s)** — warning signs of a stroke or that you're getting a stroke could be anything on one side of your
- **[02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ozpg9J3qUkU&t=128s)** — body being a problem. Let's say you smile and the left side of your face just doesn't
- **[02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ozpg9J3qUkU&t=133s)** — quite move or you raise both of your arms up and one arm doesn't go up. Those are classic
- **[02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ozpg9J3qUkU&t=138s)** — examples that you could be having a stroke. Another one is your speech is slurred. So when
- **[02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ozpg9J3qUkU&t=145s)** — you have a stroke there's always this short period of time where you can do something about
- **[02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ozpg9J3qUkU&t=150s)** — it quickly and they can give you a certain medication that thins the blood to get rid of
- **[02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ozpg9J3qUkU&t=155s)** — the clotting because the problem with a stroke is a lack of oxygen in a certain part of
- **[02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ozpg9J3qUkU&t=161s)** — your brain. It's called epoxy. And the longer that your brain goes without oxygen the more
- **[02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ozpg9J3qUkU&t=166s)** — that can occur. So the best thing to do is to go to the emergency room and get that checked out.
- **[02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ozpg9J3qUkU&t=171s)** — Alright, number three, an infection. Some of the early warning signs would be like a little
- **[02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ozpg9J3qUkU&t=175s)** — tickle in your throat, this irritating cough that won't go away, or maybe it's your
- **[03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ozpg9J3qUkU&t=180s)** — excessively sneezing or you might have a runny nose. All of these can be indicators that
- **[03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ozpg9J3qUkU&t=185s)** — your body is coming down with something. The most important thing to do would be to take
- **[03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ozpg9J3qUkU&t=190s)** — vitamin D3 in large amounts. I'm talking about 50,000 IUs. Adding some zinc and vitamin C would
- **[03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ozpg9J3qUkU&t=197s)** — also be helpful. If you have any echinacea around that's another good one. And then also just
- **[03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ozpg9J3qUkU&t=202s)** — to stay really hot and warm to the point where you're sweating so if you can generate
- **[03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ozpg9J3qUkU&t=209s)** — a fever that can actually quickly kill it off. Versus what a lot of people do is they'll
- **[03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ozpg9J3qUkU&t=213s)** — take some medication to suppress the fever which is the very thing that's going to help
- **[03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ozpg9J3qUkU&t=219s)** — overcome the virus. In fact, when people take aspirin to cut the fever down,
- **[03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ozpg9J3qUkU&t=225s)** — now the duration of the infection is longer. All right, number four, fatty liver disease.
- **[03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ozpg9J3qUkU&t=230s)** — One of the warning signs for that would be like a full feeling or maybe even a tender or
- **[03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ozpg9J3qUkU&t=236s)** — tightness underneath the right rib cage. That sometimes refers to the right shoulder, this
- **[04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ozpg9J3qUkU&t=243s)** — muscle right here. Or it could even go back into the rhomboid. All of that is more
- **[04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ozpg9J3qUkU&t=250s)** — liver, gallbladder, kind of swollen. Could be a fatty liver. But one of the big indications
- **[04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ozpg9J3qUkU&t=254s)** — of a fatty liver is that your stomach is protruding. You have belly fat. The extra is
- **[04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ozpg9J3qUkU&t=259s)** — spilling off into and around the organs in your midsection in the lower part of your body.
- **[04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ozpg9J3qUkU&t=264s)** — Other symptoms of fatty liver could be itchy skin. The solution for that is to go on a
- **[04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ozpg9J3qUkU&t=271s)** — healthy ketogenic diet with intermittent fasting. And you're going to have to definitely
- **[04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ozpg9J3qUkU&t=276s)** — avoid alcohol, eating frequently like snacks. And you may even want to take some choline,
- **[04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ozpg9J3qUkU&t=282s)** — which actually can help strip off fat from the liver. All right, number five, gallstones.
- **[04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ozpg9J3qUkU&t=287s)** — Some of the warning signs for a gallstone would be your urine is darker, your stool
- **[04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ozpg9J3qUkU&t=293s)** — floats, your stool is light colored, or you might have constipation. All of those items
- **[04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ozpg9J3qUkU&t=299s)** — I mentioned are a symptom of low bile salts. Bile salts are made by the liver,
- **[05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ozpg9J3qUkU&t=307s)** — stored in the gallbladder. And when you don't have enough bile, you start developing
- **[05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ozpg9J3qUkU&t=312s)** — a super concentrated crystal form of cholesterol. If you had enough bile,
- **[05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ozpg9J3qUkU&t=320s)** — it would dissolve all that cholesterol. But you don't. So now you get these cholesterol
- **[05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ozpg9J3qUkU&t=324s)** — stones that are developing because you don't have enough bile. So the solution for this
- **[05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ozpg9J3qUkU&t=329s)** — is to add more bile salts and then do that for a period of time. Next disease I want to talk
- **[05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ozpg9J3qUkU&t=334s)** — about is kidney stones. One of the early warning signs of a kidney stone is a kind of a deep
- **[05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ozpg9J3qUkU&t=339s)** — pain that is either on the left abdominal area or the right side. Or it could be in the back
- **[05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ozpg9J3qUkU&t=347s)** — part called flank pain, which is usually going to be like a dull, achy like pain on one side.
- **[05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ozpg9J3qUkU&t=353s)** — There's this little tube between your kidney and then the bladder called a ureter. And a lot
- **[05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ozpg9J3qUkU&t=359s)** — of times if the stone is stuck in there or right before that at the level of the kidney,
- **[06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ozpg9J3qUkU&t=364s)** — that can back up pressure and you can feel pain, especially in the deeper part of your
- **[06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ozpg9J3qUkU&t=371s)** — abdomen. So if you have this, what I would recommend is you start doing lemon juice, like
- **[06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ozpg9J3qUkU&t=376s)** — at least two ounces with water. You can drink it down, fresh lemon or just lemon juice,
- **[06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ozpg9J3qUkU&t=381s)** — because you need that citric acid to help it combine with the oxalates, which are the most
- **[06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ozpg9J3qUkU&t=386s)** — common stone. Combine with that at least two and a half liters of fluid a day, because that
- **[06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ozpg9J3qUkU&t=391s)** — way you can prevent the super saturation from happening. Another really good thing to take would
- **[06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ozpg9J3qUkU&t=395s)** — be magnesium. I would take magnesium glycinate and I would also avoid foods high in oxalates.
- **[06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ozpg9J3qUkU&t=401s)** — Okay, that would be almonds and almond flour, chocolate and spinach. All right, number seven,
- **[06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ozpg9J3qUkU&t=409s)** — what kind of early warning signs would be an ulcer? Well, there's not really any early warning
- **[06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ozpg9J3qUkU&t=415s)** — signs, but there are signs because most of the time it's asymptomatic. If you have an ulcer,
- **[07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ozpg9J3qUkU&t=421s)** — you're going to have pain or burning pain in your stomach area. You'll feel better when you
- **[07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ozpg9J3qUkU&t=427s)** — eat. Now, if you eat and you get stomach pain, usually that's not an ulcer. That's indigestion
- **[07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ozpg9J3qUkU&t=433s)** — because you don't have enough stomach acid. And the remedy for that would be betaine
- **[07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ozpg9J3qUkU&t=437s)** — hydrochloride. But if you have pain on an empty stomach and you have an ulcer, if you added
- **[07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ozpg9J3qUkU&t=442s)** — betaine hydrochloride, which is an acid, that's going to make it worse, which then you'll know
- **[07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ozpg9J3qUkU&t=446s)** — it's an acid, right? And the remedy for that would be wheatgrass juice powder with water,
- **[07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ozpg9J3qUkU&t=452s)** — and then drink that down as a chlorophyll healing agent. Another good remedy would be zinc
- **[07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ozpg9J3qUkU&t=458s)** — carnosine, whether you have an ulcer in the stomach or the small intestine. And then number
- **[07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ozpg9J3qUkU&t=464s)** — diabetes. Okay, what are some early warning signs of diabetes? It's very difficult for you to skip
- **[07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ozpg9J3qUkU&t=470s)** — a meal without being really super hungry. You may be hangry, which is kind of a combination of
- **[07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ozpg9J3qUkU&t=475s)** — hungry and angry, irritated when you don't eat, and then you feel better or you're nicer to
- **[08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ozpg9J3qUkU&t=481s)** — be around when you eat. You may also crave carbs. You may need a nap after you eat. You
- **[08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ozpg9J3qUkU&t=492s)** — start to have this urinary frequency thing where you start to urinate more and you're more
- **[08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ozpg9J3qUkU&t=497s)** — thirsty. And it just blows my mind what the medical profession does for diabetes. I mean,
- **[08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ozpg9J3qUkU&t=502s)** — they give you a medication to lower your blood sugar, but they don't change your diet. You
- **[08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ozpg9J3qUkU&t=507s)** — need to get off carbs. You need to go low carb and you don't want to be eating all these
- **[08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ozpg9J3qUkU&t=512s)** — snacks. We want to do intermittent fasting and the healthy version of the ketogenic diet. Now,
- **[08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ozpg9J3qUkU&t=517s)** — I've done a lot of videos on how to use various clues to figure things out.
- **[08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ozpg9J3qUkU&t=523s)** — If you have not seen this video, I think you'll be very interested in it.

- **[00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zW8Cu4vcReY&t=0s)** — Over 80% of heart attacks and strokes are not plaque, cholesterol, or calcium that's blocking your arteries.
- **[00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zW8Cu4vcReY&t=7s)** — Most of the time when someone has a heart attack or a stroke, they die from a clot.
- **[00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zW8Cu4vcReY&t=13s)** — This is not the same and it's very different than a buildup of cholesterol or calcium or plaque.
- **[00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zW8Cu4vcReY&t=19s)** — If someone told you the reason why you die is your arteries fill up with cholesterol,
- **[00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zW8Cu4vcReY&t=23s)** — they are lying to you. That's usually not what kills you. It's the clot that can form in less
- **[00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zW8Cu4vcReY&t=28s)** — than five seconds. What we're going to do today is we're going to really dissect a clot and
- **[00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zW8Cu4vcReY&t=33s)** — understand what it is and give you a solution to prevent clots because a clot is a very
- **[00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zW8Cu4vcReY&t=39s)** — necessary thing. A clot is a response to injury and the way it's supposed to work is the body
- **[00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zW8Cu4vcReY&t=44s)** — is supposed to form a clot, fix the hole in the artery, and then dissolve it. The real problem
- **[00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zW8Cu4vcReY&t=51s)** — that we need to focus on is the hole in the artery, but the biggest trigger to a clot is not
- **[00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zW8Cu4vcReY&t=56s)** — it's not calcium. Number one, and people know this, is the inhalation of smoke from
- **[01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zW8Cu4vcReY&t=62s)** — cigarette smoke. Now your arteries are exposed to all these chemicals and it's going to create
- **[01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zW8Cu4vcReY&t=66s)** — inflammation. Also, pollution or being around any type of chemicals in the environment can do
- **[01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zW8Cu4vcReY&t=71s)** — that as well. A solution is not to do vaping. Okay, you need to just stop smoking. Alcohol is
- **[01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zW8Cu4vcReY&t=77s)** — another one. You're drinking alcohol. It's considered a poison to the liver. It gets into
- **[01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zW8Cu4vcReY&t=81s)** — the bloodstream and that also can create problems in the inside of the arteries. Believe
- **[01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zW8Cu4vcReY&t=85s)** — it or not, birth control pills or hormone replacement therapy is another thing that can
- **[01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zW8Cu4vcReY&t=90s)** — actually affect the arteries because of the hormonal interaction, increasing the risk of
- **[01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zW8Cu4vcReY&t=95s)** — a stroke and heart attacks. Then you have stress and this is an interesting one because
- **[01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zW8Cu4vcReY&t=100s)** — there's something called the broken heart syndrome where someone has a loss of a loved
- **[01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zW8Cu4vcReY&t=106s)** — one and their risk of having a heart attack goes up by 2000 percent, which by the way
- **[01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zW8Cu4vcReY&t=111s)** — triggers the clotting action. Anything that increases stress can increase the clotting
- **[01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zW8Cu4vcReY&t=116s)** — action. But also surgery. Okay, surgery is a very stressful thing to the body and
- **[02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zW8Cu4vcReY&t=122s)** — endurance sports, marathons. It's a tremendous stress in your body and refined starches.
- **[02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zW8Cu4vcReY&t=128s)** — That's just like pure inflammation going to your arteries and this is why diabetics are
- **[02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zW8Cu4vcReY&t=133s)** — at four to five times the risk for getting clots, not just in the heart but in the brain
- **[02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zW8Cu4vcReY&t=137s)** — The last thing that can trigger these clots is an infection. It could come from an infection
- **[02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zW8Cu4vcReY&t=144s)** — in your tooth from a failed root canal where you have this abscess that's leaking bacteria
- **[02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zW8Cu4vcReY&t=150s)** — into the body or it can come from some other chronic infection. I think for most people it's
- **[02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zW8Cu4vcReY&t=155s)** — going to be the high levels of sugar that's flowing through their bloodstream that's
- **[02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zW8Cu4vcReY&t=159s)** — creating the problem because of their diet and it makes their blood really sticky. Also it
- **[02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zW8Cu4vcReY&t=163s)** — chronically elevates inflammation. Inflammation is one of the most potent things for clotting.
- **[02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zW8Cu4vcReY&t=169s)** — There's another trigger for this clot as well. An excess amount of calcium in the arteries.
- **[02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zW8Cu4vcReY&t=175s)** — Now let me explain this because in certain studies involving post-menopausal women who
- **[02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zW8Cu4vcReY&t=179s)** — take high amounts of calcium for their bones, they have an increased risk of getting
- **[03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zW8Cu4vcReY&t=184s)** — this clot because calcium is involved in over 15 different clotting factors. I'm talking about
- **[03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zW8Cu4vcReY&t=191s)** — excess calcium. Excess calcium is just not good for the heart. It can cause excessive
- **[03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zW8Cu4vcReY&t=195s)** — calcification in the soft tissues especially in the arteries. As the antidote and the thing that
- **[03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zW8Cu4vcReY&t=200s)** — kind of counters this clotting, there's two things that are very very important to know.
- **[03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zW8Cu4vcReY&t=205s)** — Number one is vitamin K2. The purpose of vitamin K2 is to keep the calcium from building
- **[03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zW8Cu4vcReY&t=210s)** — up in the soft tissue. K2 is all about keeping the calcium out of the arteries and
- **[03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zW8Cu4vcReY&t=216s)** — the arteries. And guess where vitamin K2 comes from? Dairy, butter, it comes from fatty foods.
- **[03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zW8Cu4vcReY&t=221s)** — The exact things that they tell you to avoid because of the cholesterol. You should always
- **[03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zW8Cu4vcReY&t=225s)** — take vitamin D with vitamin K2 simply because vitamin D is super important as an anti-inflammatory
- **[03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zW8Cu4vcReY&t=232s)** — in the inside of the arteries and it works together with vitamin K2. Magnesium is another
- **[03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zW8Cu4vcReY&t=237s)** — very important calcium regulator and it prevents calcium from going inside the tissues. Magnesium
- **[04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zW8Cu4vcReY&t=245s)** — helps prevent arrhythmias especially atrial fibrillation which by the way causes an arrhythmic
- **[04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zW8Cu4vcReY&t=251s)** — problem in the heart that can cause pooling of the blood that can increase your risk of
- **[04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zW8Cu4vcReY&t=257s)** — getting a clot. What turns down clotting? The big one is something called nitric oxide. Here are
- **[04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zW8Cu4vcReY&t=265s)** — some things that can increase nitric oxide. Vitamin D. L-Arginine is an amino acid that
- **[04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zW8Cu4vcReY&t=270s)** — nitric oxide and one of the best sources of L-Arginine is meat and liver. The exact things
- **[04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zW8Cu4vcReY&t=278s)** — that they tell you not to eat. There's something else that increases nitric oxide,
- **[04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zW8Cu4vcReY&t=283s)** — sunlight that can penetrate deep into the body and help increase nitric oxide in the inside
- **[04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zW8Cu4vcReY&t=289s)** — of the arteries. This is why getting sun is so valuable in so many different ways. Not just
- **[04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zW8Cu4vcReY&t=296s)** — but other ways as well. What's happened since 1980 is we become sun phobic because we're
- **[05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zW8Cu4vcReY&t=301s)** — afraid of getting melanoma which is an absolute lie. You want to get regular doses of sun.
- **[05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zW8Cu4vcReY&t=307s)** — Very therapeutic to the heart. Other things that can help you is polyphenols and natural
- **[05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zW8Cu4vcReY&t=313s)** — herbs and vegetables. Vitamin C. Omega 3. Omega 3 fatty acids naturally thin the blood. Also,
- **[05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zW8Cu4vcReY&t=321s)** — when people consume leafy green vegetables that are high in vitamin K1, they think,
- **[05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zW8Cu4vcReY&t=325s)** — oh that's a lot of vitamin K1 that's gonna cause clotting. It's gonna thicken my blood.
- **[05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zW8Cu4vcReY&t=330s)** — No, it's not going to create thickening more than normal. It's just gonna bring you to a
- **[05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zW8Cu4vcReY&t=335s)** — normal level. It's not gonna create excessive amount of clotting. Fasting is another potent
- **[05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zW8Cu4vcReY&t=340s)** — way to help reduce the risk of clotting. Fasting is also anti-inflammatory. Ketones,
- **[05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zW8Cu4vcReY&t=347s)** — getting on the ketogenic diet, a low-carb diet, is also anti-inflammatory to your arteries.
- **[05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zW8Cu4vcReY&t=352s)** — Regular exercise, and I'm not talking about like high stressful exercise where you're
- **[05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zW8Cu4vcReY&t=358s)** — doing marathons, but regular good exercise with good recovery is extremely important
- **[06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zW8Cu4vcReY&t=364s)** — in preventing this clotting. Garlic and onion. Super important in preventing clotting. As far
- **[06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zW8Cu4vcReY&t=371s)** — as supplements go, there's three that are really powerful. Natokinase is a natural
- **[06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zW8Cu4vcReY&t=377s)** — enzyme that helps prevent clotting. You also have another enzyme called seropeptase. That's
- **[06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zW8Cu4vcReY&t=382s)** — an extract from silkworms. And then bromelain from pineapple. When you take those enzymes to
- **[06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zW8Cu4vcReY&t=387s)** — help reduce clotting, and I'm not even recommending you take them unless you have a
- **[06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zW8Cu4vcReY&t=392s)** — clotting problem, but they're a great natural source that's not endorsed by big pharma
- **[06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zW8Cu4vcReY&t=397s)** — because they're competitive, you want to take those on an empty stomach so it can actually
- **[06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zW8Cu4vcReY&t=401s)** — work on the factors in your blood that's maybe too excessive. Now you know the basics of what
- **[06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zW8Cu4vcReY&t=408s)** — really is behind most heart attacks and strokes. Follow the advice. I hope you took notes and
- **[06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zW8Cu4vcReY&t=413s)** — implement the data that I showed you in this video. Thanks for watching and I will see you

- **[00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qS_GSDbxCbE&t=0s)** — Today we are going to talk about how to block the effects of sugar and other carbs and other things as well.
- **[00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qS_GSDbxCbE&t=7s)** — If the person is on a ketogenic diet and they somehow come off the ketogenic diet and they eat something that they shouldn't be eating,
- **[00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qS_GSDbxCbE&t=13s)** — how do they neutralize the effects of that? That's what we are going to talk about.
- **[00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qS_GSDbxCbE&t=17s)** — Alright, so let's start with number one, sugar. Your friend has just eaten some sugar.
- **[00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qS_GSDbxCbE&t=22s)** — What should they do to counteract the effects of the sugar?
- **[00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qS_GSDbxCbE&t=25s)** — Now, the damaging part of sugar is that it tends to act like rust in your arteries, destroys your energy factories, your mitochondria.
- **[00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qS_GSDbxCbE&t=34s)** — You have something called the glycemic index of foods. So you eat a certain food and the higher the sugar, the higher the spike.
- **[00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qS_GSDbxCbE&t=41s)** — And it creates damage. And so each carbohydrate has an index from high to low.
- **[00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qS_GSDbxCbE&t=47s)** — And you also have something else called the glycemic load. And that's looking at the carbohydrate in food.
- **[00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qS_GSDbxCbE&t=52s)** — But it's also taking into consideration fiber. Because fiber tends to buffer and inhibit this sugar spike.
- **[01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qS_GSDbxCbE&t=62s)** — And so out of all the carbohydrates, fiber, which is a carbohydrate, has no effect on insulin.
- **[01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qS_GSDbxCbE&t=69s)** — So other carbohydrates will raise insulin, but not fiber. So it's neutral.
- **[01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qS_GSDbxCbE&t=73s)** — And so the more something has fiber in it, the less the sugar effects. Like carrots, for example, are loaded with fiber.
- **[01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qS_GSDbxCbE&t=80s)** — And so it's really hard to spike the blood sugar if you're consuming a carrot.
- **[01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qS_GSDbxCbE&t=85s)** — Unless you juice the carrot and just drink the juice, right? Carrot juice, which I used to do a long time ago.
- **[01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qS_GSDbxCbE&t=90s)** — So what you need to understand if your friend consumes some sugar is to recommend that they start consuming some fiber right away.
- **[01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qS_GSDbxCbE&t=99s)** — And if there's fiber in a salad, that would be the best thing, because that will buffer or slow the effect of this spike.
- **[01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qS_GSDbxCbE&t=105s)** — The other thing to know about sugar is that sugar, especially refined sugar, depletes you of potassium, B1, zinc, and magnesium.
- **[01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qS_GSDbxCbE&t=115s)** — And so if you were to take some electrolytes and B vitamins and trace minerals, that will counteract the deficiencies that you just created from that sugar.
- **[02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qS_GSDbxCbE&t=126s)** — So that's just a way of kind of minimizing the side effects from that.
- **[02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qS_GSDbxCbE&t=133s)** — And there's different things about grains that you need to know. Number one, you have the refined grains, right?
- **[02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qS_GSDbxCbE&t=138s)** — So if you're consuming refined grains, it's going to deplete you of certain nutrients.
- **[02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qS_GSDbxCbE&t=143s)** — Because when you refine the grain, it's like empty of nutrients.
- **[02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qS_GSDbxCbE&t=147s)** — So when you consume that, your body starts to metabolize it.
- **[02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qS_GSDbxCbE&t=151s)** — And then it needs to pull from its reserve certain nutrients to burn it up.
- **[02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qS_GSDbxCbE&t=156s)** — And so this is why the more refined grains or even sugar that you consume, the more of certain nutrients that you need.
- **[02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qS_GSDbxCbE&t=164s)** — Because refined foods does not come with these nutrients.
- **[02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qS_GSDbxCbE&t=167s)** — So you have to tap into your own reserves to be able to process them or digest them.
- **[02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qS_GSDbxCbE&t=172s)** — So refined grains have their own issues, but then you have the whole grains.
- **[02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qS_GSDbxCbE&t=176s)** — Whole grains has some nutrients, not as much as you might think, but it also has something called phytic acid and other anti-nutrients.
- **[03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qS_GSDbxCbE&t=184s)** — So the phytic acid actually blocks you from absorbing certain minerals.
- **[03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qS_GSDbxCbE&t=188s)** — So if you're consuming whole grains, you might want to consume an oyster or some shellfish to get those minerals back.
- **[03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qS_GSDbxCbE&t=196s)** — Because shellfish, especially oysters, are loaded with zinc.
- **[03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qS_GSDbxCbE&t=199s)** — The other big problem with grains is the gluten. That's the protein in the wheat or some other grain.
- **[03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qS_GSDbxCbE&t=204s)** — So you can have a gluten allergy, you can have a gluten intolerance, but it can really tear up and create inflammation in your gut.
- **[03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qS_GSDbxCbE&t=210s)** — And so many people, especially because they've did hybrids of grains, especially wheat, and they don't just come with more carbs, they come with more protein in some cases.
- **[03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qS_GSDbxCbE&t=221s)** — And that protein can do some interesting things to your gut.
- **[03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qS_GSDbxCbE&t=224s)** — It can even mimic a bit of morphine, which numbs the pain that it creates, making you think it's totally fine to consume.
- **[03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qS_GSDbxCbE&t=233s)** — So you keep eating it, and then sometime down the road you have this gut inflammation that creates all sorts of other additional problems that you didn't suspect.
- **[04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qS_GSDbxCbE&t=243s)** — So just as a side note, to counter inflammation in your gut, let's say you want to counter that, you can take glutamine or consume foods high in glutamine.
- **[04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qS_GSDbxCbE&t=255s)** — What would that be? Meat.
- **[04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qS_GSDbxCbE&t=257s)** — And this is why when someone goes on a meat diet or a carnivore diet and gets all this glutamine from that, they tend to heal their guts, as long as they're not consuming at the same time the sugar and the grains and the starches, things like that.
- **[04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qS_GSDbxCbE&t=272s)** — So this video is all about neutralizing the effects of some of these carbs and other things as well.
- **[04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qS_GSDbxCbE&t=277s)** — The other thing refined grains depletes is vitamin E.
- **[04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qS_GSDbxCbE&t=281s)** — And there's a big correlation between a vitamin E deficiency and angina, because the heart needs that vitamin E.
- **[04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qS_GSDbxCbE&t=289s)** — In fact, if you're low in vitamin E, your muscles, including your heart muscle, will work harder and you might have more weakness within the muscle.
- **[04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qS_GSDbxCbE&t=297s)** — So when you think of eating refined grains or your friend eating refined grains, think of deficiencies in the B complex, especially B1 and other B vitamins, as well as vitamin E.
- **[05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qS_GSDbxCbE&t=310s)** — So you want to put those back to neutralize the effects. You can even consume some nutritional yeast to kind of get your natural Bs.
- **[05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qS_GSDbxCbE&t=318s)** — Just make sure that they're not enriched with synthetic B vitamins.
- **[05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qS_GSDbxCbE&t=322s)** — Also, I want to mention if you're consuming grain foods like breads, pasta, things like that in Europe, people have less bloating because they ferment the grains longer,
- **[05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qS_GSDbxCbE&t=335s)** — which actually tends to break down more carbs because the microbes eat the carbs.
- **[05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qS_GSDbxCbE&t=339s)** — And also it can actually break down a lot of the gluten as well.
- **[05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qS_GSDbxCbE&t=343s)** — And all that enrichment of iron and synthetic vitamins will tend to make your gut feel very heavy.
- **[05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qS_GSDbxCbE&t=349s)** — The other thing about grains is a lot of times they'll use Roundup Ready or called glyphosate, which is a herbicide to kind of dry out these grains.
- **[06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qS_GSDbxCbE&t=361s)** — So now you're consuming this grain that has these chemicals in it, which is not good.
- **[06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qS_GSDbxCbE&t=366s)** — So make sure you have an organic grain if you're going to do grains.
- **[06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qS_GSDbxCbE&t=369s)** — As another side note, I want to mention the chemistry of glucose is very similar to the chemistry of vitamin C.
- **[06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qS_GSDbxCbE&t=376s)** — So if you're eating sugar, right, don't expect any vitamin C absorption because it's competitive.
- **[06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qS_GSDbxCbE&t=384s)** — And this is why when people take like those vitamin C gummies, I mean, they're just loaded with sugar.
- **[06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qS_GSDbxCbE&t=390s)** — You're not getting any vitamin C. So just realize that glucose blocks vitamin C.
- **[06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qS_GSDbxCbE&t=396s)** — So one thing you need to do or tell your friend when they consume this carb or sugar to have more vitamin C foods.
- **[06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qS_GSDbxCbE&t=403s)** — The food that has the most vitamin C is the sauerkraut. But then you also have bell peppers, lemons, or really any of the leafy greens has a good amount of vitamin C.
- **[06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qS_GSDbxCbE&t=412s)** — And I also want to mention berries. Any of the berries are a good source of vitamin C.
- **[06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qS_GSDbxCbE&t=417s)** — When you start consuming fruit, OK, people always ask me about fruit. Is fruit bad?
- **[07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qS_GSDbxCbE&t=422s)** — Well, yeah, it's high in sugar and our bodies were designed to consume moderate amounts of fruit that wasn't genetically made sweeter.
- **[07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qS_GSDbxCbE&t=429s)** — But nowadays they are produced with more carbs and sugar contents.
- **[07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qS_GSDbxCbE&t=432s)** — But also fruit is seasonal, right? But we have it all year round.
- **[07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qS_GSDbxCbE&t=436s)** — But is there a big difference between fruit and high fructose corn syrup? Yes, there's a huge difference.
- **[07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qS_GSDbxCbE&t=443s)** — The fruit has the fiber. OK, high fructose corn syrup is like drinking this pure fructose or an end glucose.
- **[07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qS_GSDbxCbE&t=451s)** — And it's just it creates a completely different effect than if you were to even like get your fructose from the juice from a fruit because you have the antioxidants.
- **[07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qS_GSDbxCbE&t=461s)** — You see, if someone's a diabetic, right, and they have high levels of sugar in the blood, and if you're a diabetic, you should know this.
- **[07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qS_GSDbxCbE&t=468s)** — You have all these side effects, these complications from diabetes.
- **[07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qS_GSDbxCbE&t=471s)** — You can greatly neutralize a lot of those side effects by just consuming antioxidants from vegetables and also things like benfotamine is a really good one.
- **[08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qS_GSDbxCbE&t=484s)** — I mean, a lot of diabetics get like peripheral neuropathy of their feet where their feet are numb or painful.
- **[08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qS_GSDbxCbE&t=492s)** — If they just took some benfotamine or alpha lipoic acid, they would at least not feel that pain anymore because it decreases the complications of diabetes.
- **[08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qS_GSDbxCbE&t=501s)** — Diabetes affects four areas, your brain and nervous system, your vascular, your arteries, and the eyes and the kidneys.
- **[08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qS_GSDbxCbE&t=509s)** — So of course, changing your diet is the ultimate solution.
- **[08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qS_GSDbxCbE&t=512s)** — But also just to counteract or neutralize some of these other effects, you can just start eating these high antioxidant foods.
- **[08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qS_GSDbxCbE&t=521s)** — And you can also exercise. You may have high blood glucose, not necessarily from eating carbs, but it can come from stress.
- **[08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qS_GSDbxCbE&t=529s)** — It can come from not sleeping. It can come from various reasons.
- **[08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qS_GSDbxCbE&t=533s)** — Let's say you're on the ketogenic diet and you haven't transitioned and your body's still producing sugar because it has really bad insulin resistance.
- **[09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qS_GSDbxCbE&t=542s)** — You can counteract a lot of that just by exercising every single day because that burns off the sugar and it actually strengthens the mitochondria.
- **[09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qS_GSDbxCbE&t=551s)** — It actually makes new mitochondria.
- **[09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qS_GSDbxCbE&t=553s)** — And then there's another thing you can do. Like a lot of people run metformin being a diabetic.
- **[09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qS_GSDbxCbE&t=558s)** — If you were to take berberine, for example, it's a natural remedy.
- **[09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qS_GSDbxCbE&t=564s)** — There's studies that show that it can create a similar effect, but with less side effects.
- **[09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qS_GSDbxCbE&t=569s)** — Cinnamon is another thing you can take. Just put some cinnamon on your toast and sugar in your butter where you make this cinnamon toast.
- **[09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qS_GSDbxCbE&t=577s)** — I'm just being sarcastic.
- **[09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qS_GSDbxCbE&t=579s)** — But cinnamon actually can help stabilize blood sugars.
- **[09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qS_GSDbxCbE&t=583s)** — And so can apple cider vinegar that helps to neutralize some of the effects of consuming sugar and refined carbs.
- **[09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qS_GSDbxCbE&t=591s)** — One from acidifying the stomach, another from just helping your blood sugars.
- **[09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qS_GSDbxCbE&t=596s)** — So you'll find that if you have some outside of vinegar in the morning when you wake up, if you did have some carbs, your sugars will be a little bit better from the outside of vinegar.
- **[10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qS_GSDbxCbE&t=605s)** — And the other point I want to bring about that, because since we're on the topic of your blood sugars, is that if you consume lean protein, as in whey protein powder, you can actually spike insulin.
- **[10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qS_GSDbxCbE&t=619s)** — That's the thing that helps to control blood glucose.
- **[10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qS_GSDbxCbE&t=622s)** — Now, there's something called the insulin index, and that is looking at all the non carbohydrate things that can increase insulin that go beyond just like sugar and things like that.
- **[10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qS_GSDbxCbE&t=632s)** — So the thing that really spikes the insulin is the whey protein, because there's absolutely no fat in there.
- **[10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qS_GSDbxCbE&t=638s)** — So this leads us to the next point. Fat has one of the least effects on insulin, like fiber and fat.
- **[10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qS_GSDbxCbE&t=646s)** — They don't trigger insulin too much. So fat is a way to buffer the insulin response.
- **[10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qS_GSDbxCbE&t=652s)** — So if you have the choice between egg whites and the whole egg, always have the whole egg.
- **[10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qS_GSDbxCbE&t=657s)** — Or a fatty hamburger versus a lean piece of meat, do the fatty hamburger.
- **[11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qS_GSDbxCbE&t=663s)** — If you have the choice between a fatty nut like macadamia nuts or maybe pecans, those are much better than the nuts that are leaner.
- **[11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qS_GSDbxCbE&t=671s)** — Or a whole fat kefir or cheese versus low fat or no fat cheese, huge difference. Go for the fat.
- **[11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qS_GSDbxCbE&t=679s)** — The fat will buffer the insulin response from the protein.
- **[11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qS_GSDbxCbE&t=682s)** — Another thing that will help you neutralize the bad effects from sugar is fasting.
- **[11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qS_GSDbxCbE&t=688s)** — If you fast, definitely do regular intermittent fasting, but a periodic prolonged fast will greatly help reduce the damage that that sugar has done to yourselves.
- **[11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qS_GSDbxCbE&t=697s)** — I think if we combine certain things, we can create a cool effect. Let's say you had a salad, right? You have the fiber in there.
- **[11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qS_GSDbxCbE&t=703s)** — Doesn't have a lot of sugar in there. We add the apple cider vinegar to it.
- **[11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qS_GSDbxCbE&t=708s)** — And then we add the olive oil. We have fat, we have the vinegar, we have the fiber.
- **[11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qS_GSDbxCbE&t=715s)** — So the oil actually helps pull the fat soluble nutrients out of the salad.
- **[12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qS_GSDbxCbE&t=721s)** — And this combination is kind of a nice compounding effect of one meal to help counter maybe some bad things that a person ate.
- **[12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qS_GSDbxCbE&t=728s)** — Now I talked about sugar, I talked about grains. Now I want to talk about alcohol a bit.
- **[12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qS_GSDbxCbE&t=732s)** — Alcohol is from grains and alcohol depletes you a B1.
- **[12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qS_GSDbxCbE&t=737s)** — Alcohol is detoxified from the liver as a toxin.
- **[12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qS_GSDbxCbE&t=741s)** — So it takes priority and it creates damage to your liver and inflammation, etc.
- **[12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qS_GSDbxCbE&t=746s)** — So if you happen to have known of someone who has drank some alcohol, tell them to counter it by consuming B1, vitamin B1, or nutritional yeast.
- **[12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qS_GSDbxCbE&t=757s)** — But B1 is a good one. They probably won't have a hangover from that.
- **[12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qS_GSDbxCbE&t=761s)** — Pickled juice also is a good kind of an electrolyte that can help counter that.
- **[12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qS_GSDbxCbE&t=766s)** — Or just taking electrolytes in general can help reduce the effects of a hangover, which is the toxicity that you're feeling of what's happening in the liver.
- **[12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qS_GSDbxCbE&t=776s)** — And anything that you take to damage the liver, milk thistle is a good antidote or neutralization factor.
- **[13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qS_GSDbxCbE&t=784s)** — Milk thistle is good for anything poisonous, whether you had a snake bite or consumed a poisonous mushroom, or you drank alcohol or took Tylenol.
- **[13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qS_GSDbxCbE&t=794s)** — Or the next thing on the issue, which is drugs. If you're on certain drugs, they can damage the liver, take some milk thistle.
- **[13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qS_GSDbxCbE&t=801s)** — That will help counter or neutralize some of the bad effect.
- **[13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qS_GSDbxCbE&t=805s)** — If you're on a statin drug, make sure you take coenzyme Q10 or you may end up with some muscle damage.
- **[13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qS_GSDbxCbE&t=811s)** — If you're a diabetic and you take metformin, make sure you take B1 and B12.
- **[13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qS_GSDbxCbE&t=818s)** — And if you're on an antibiotic, make sure you take a probiotic.
- **[13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qS_GSDbxCbE&t=822s)** — If you're on an antacid, really you just need to take butane hydrochloride.
- **[13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qS_GSDbxCbE&t=827s)** — Because that antacid is going to get rid of acid in your stomach.
- **[13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qS_GSDbxCbE&t=830s)** — And usually the true cause of an acidic stomach is a lack of acid.
- **[13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qS_GSDbxCbE&t=835s)** — So a lot of times you'll go from bad to worse.
- **[13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qS_GSDbxCbE&t=838s)** — So if you start to add more acid in there, it will actually help neutralize some of the side effects that it's creating.
- **[14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qS_GSDbxCbE&t=847s)** — Which is a lack of stomach acid.
- **[14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qS_GSDbxCbE&t=850s)** — Number four is, let's say you consumed a lot of salt or like sodium.
- **[14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qS_GSDbxCbE&t=856s)** — And you basically, you started retaining sodium and you wanted to neutralize some of the effects.
- **[14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qS_GSDbxCbE&t=863s)** — Let's say it affected your blood pressure. Just take potassium.
- **[14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qS_GSDbxCbE&t=866s)** — Potassium helps counter the bad effects of sodium.
- **[14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qS_GSDbxCbE&t=871s)** — So you're going to get rid of fluid retention. You're going to feel less bloated.
- **[14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qS_GSDbxCbE&t=876s)** — And potassium is really good to help maintain blood pressure too.
- **[14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qS_GSDbxCbE&t=879s)** — So have a big salad or some high potassium food.
- **[14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qS_GSDbxCbE&t=883s)** — And the same thing goes with like sugar. If you eat a lot of sugar, you deplete potassium.
- **[14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qS_GSDbxCbE&t=887s)** — And then without potassium, your pulse rate starts going higher and higher and higher.
- **[14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qS_GSDbxCbE&t=891s)** — And so again, an antidote for a high pulse rate would be that potassium.
- **[14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qS_GSDbxCbE&t=895s)** — Number five is not a carbohydrate, but it's called oxalates.
- **[14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qS_GSDbxCbE&t=899s)** — And since we're on the topic of kind of neutralizing things, I just want to mention it.
- **[15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qS_GSDbxCbE&t=905s)** — When someone gets on the ketogenic diet, they usually are doing spinach.
- **[15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qS_GSDbxCbE&t=909s)** — And they're usually doing some chocolate, like some no sugar chocolate and almonds or almond flour.
- **[15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qS_GSDbxCbE&t=915s)** — All of those are a bit high in oxalates.
- **[15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qS_GSDbxCbE&t=917s)** — So if you were to consume some cheese with any one of those,
- **[15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qS_GSDbxCbE&t=922s)** — you would help to minimize the bad effects of that.
- **[15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qS_GSDbxCbE&t=925s)** — And also, I almost forgot magnesium.
- **[15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qS_GSDbxCbE&t=928s)** — Magnesium will also reduce the effects of that as well.
- **[15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qS_GSDbxCbE&t=932s)** — Now, since I mentioned salt or sodium, let's also mention the drinking too much water.
- **[15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qS_GSDbxCbE&t=937s)** — Let's say you drink a lot of water.
- **[15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qS_GSDbxCbE&t=940s)** — And just so you know, drinking too much water can dilute the blood of sodium.
- **[15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qS_GSDbxCbE&t=947s)** — And it can create some serious problems called hyponatremia.
- **[15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qS_GSDbxCbE&t=950s)** — And your brain can swell.
- **[15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qS_GSDbxCbE&t=953s)** — People have died by consuming a gallon of water in a short period of time, like three hours.
- **[15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qS_GSDbxCbE&t=959s)** — So you want to drink when you're thirsty and make sure you don't over drink.
- **[16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qS_GSDbxCbE&t=964s)** — But the solution, the antidote, is just to take some salt.
- **[16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qS_GSDbxCbE&t=967s)** — If you drink too much water and other electrolytes as well.
- **[16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qS_GSDbxCbE&t=971s)** — Number seven, if someone goes on the ketogenic diet and they do intermittent fasting,
- **[16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qS_GSDbxCbE&t=977s)** — what happens is the demand for minerals and B vitamins goes up.
- **[16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qS_GSDbxCbE&t=984s)** — So some people, if they're not taking electrolytes or B vitamins or eating foods high in those nutrients,
- **[16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qS_GSDbxCbE&t=992s)** — they can end up with some side effects like keto rash, keto fatigue, things like that.
- **[16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qS_GSDbxCbE&t=997s)** — Number eight is not food, but I think it's kind of important just to bring up. It's just stress.
- **[16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qS_GSDbxCbE&t=1002s)** — Okay, how do you neutralize the effects of stress? Well, what does stress do?
- **[16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qS_GSDbxCbE&t=1007s)** — It can deplete you of zinc, B1, magnesium.
- **[16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qS_GSDbxCbE&t=1012s)** — So of course, taking B1 would be very good to help counter stress.
- **[16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qS_GSDbxCbE&t=1016s)** — You will find if you take B1, your anxiety will go away. You'll feel less anxious.
- **[17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qS_GSDbxCbE&t=1023s)** — A magnesium deficiency will cause cramping in the legs and fatigue.
- **[17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qS_GSDbxCbE&t=1027s)** — If you take magnesium, you'll have more energy, you have more endurance, and you have less leg cramps.
- **[17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qS_GSDbxCbE&t=1031s)** — And stress also depletes zinc. So when you're low on zinc, you may find your testosterone goes down,
- **[17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qS_GSDbxCbE&t=1038s)** — your immune system goes down, and if you're very deficient, you might even notice your smell and taste go away as well.
- **[17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qS_GSDbxCbE&t=1045s)** — And another way to counter the bad effects of stress is exercise, long walks, and physical work.
- **[17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qS_GSDbxCbE&t=1052s)** — You want to do something that just pulls you out of your head and sleep as well.
- **[17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qS_GSDbxCbE&t=1056s)** — Sleep is the antidote to stress. Now because of the censoring and the suppressing of the algorithms on YouTube,
- **[17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qS_GSDbxCbE&t=1064s)** — it's becoming more difficult to find my content. And there's a lot of content that I cannot put on YouTube, unfortunately.

## Video 15: A Better Way to Eliminate Candida for Good

**Watch on YouTube:** [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RzSoPyA30O8](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RzSoPyA30O8)

## Full Transcript with Timestamps

*Click any timestamp to jump to that moment in the video*

- **[00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RzSoPyA30O8&t=0s)** — Recently, I stumbled on something very fascinating relating to Candida. I want to share this with you.
- **[00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RzSoPyA30O8&t=6s)** — Now, Candida is a fungal infection. It's kind of like a yeast infection. And people can get it in
- **[00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RzSoPyA30O8&t=11s)** — their mouth. They can get it in their private parts, toenails. And it usually comes after
- **[00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RzSoPyA30O8&t=17s)** — an antibiotic as a side effect because you have all these bacteria that keep the yeast and fungus
- **[00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RzSoPyA30O8&t=23s)** — and molds in check. The great majority of your microbiome in your gut is bacteria. But you
- **[00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RzSoPyA30O8&t=29s)** — have a small percentage of this yeast and fungus and friendly Candida. So everything is in balance.
- **[00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RzSoPyA30O8&t=35s)** — But when you wipe out a lot of your bacteria, you create more space for this Candida to grow
- **[00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RzSoPyA30O8&t=42s)** — and become a bit pathogenic. So you get itchiness, burning, fatigue, and various symptoms from them.
- **[00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RzSoPyA30O8&t=50s)** — You can even get cracks in the corner of your mouth. About 20% of the time, that's Candida.
- **[00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RzSoPyA30O8&t=54s)** — And when I was in practice, I would notice that certain patients coming in had this odor of ammonia.
- **[01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RzSoPyA30O8&t=61s)** — And that's usually coming from this Candida overgrowth. It'll change your pH. Okay? It releases
- **[01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RzSoPyA30O8&t=70s)** — ammonia from the breakdown products of simple sugars. When you go up on the pH, you make
- **[01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RzSoPyA30O8&t=76s)** — things more alkaline. And it can survive more. So Candida can actually survive more of an
- **[01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RzSoPyA30O8&t=82s)** — alkaline environment versus an acidic environment. And this is why when you have this good balance
- **[01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RzSoPyA30O8&t=86s)** — of microbes in your large intestine, it's on the acidic side. But Candida changes the pH.
- **[01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RzSoPyA30O8&t=92s)** — And so it does it through its primary fuel, which is sugar. Okay? I'm going to come back to
- **[01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RzSoPyA30O8&t=97s)** — that at the end, but I want to share something very interesting. There's other conditions that
- **[01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RzSoPyA30O8&t=102s)** — lower your immune system that cause this overgrowth as well. HIV or AIDS, if you have
- **[01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RzSoPyA30O8&t=110s)** — prednisone, like steroids, if you're pregnant, or if you eat a lot of sugar, especially fructose.
- **[01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RzSoPyA30O8&t=119s)** — All of them either create or have at the same time a vitamin D deficiency. So when I was
- **[02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RzSoPyA30O8&t=126s)** — looking at vitamin D, I noticed that it had an antifungal property. And when I looked into
- **[02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RzSoPyA30O8&t=132s)** — it a little bit more, I found out it's a really good, effective, broad spectrum
- **[02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RzSoPyA30O8&t=138s)** — antimicrobial. Now probably because it really helps build up your immune system, your defenses,
- **[02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RzSoPyA30O8&t=143s)** — and all of those items I mentioned really have an effect on the immune system.
- **[02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RzSoPyA30O8&t=148s)** — If you have Candida, there's three things you need to do. Start taking vitamin D.
- **[02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RzSoPyA30O8&t=153s)** — Maybe 20, 30,000 IUs immediately. Number two, cut out the fuel for Candida.
- **[02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RzSoPyA30O8&t=160s)** — Its primary fuel is glucose. If you stop eating sugar right now, go on keto,
- **[02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RzSoPyA30O8&t=167s)** — you can starve it to death. And three, start consuming probiotic foods like a little
- **[02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RzSoPyA30O8&t=172s)** — sauerkraut, kimchi, fermented pickles, or maybe a little non-sweetened kefir. So I just wanted
- **[03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RzSoPyA30O8&t=180s)** — to keep this video real simple, short, to the point. Great remedy to help someone if they're
- **[03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RzSoPyA30O8&t=185s)** — struggling with Candida. And if you're not signed up on my private email on my website,
- **[03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RzSoPyA30O8&t=190s)** — drberg.com, I give away a lot of content that's not on YouTube. If you want to check it out,

## Video 16: A Carrot a Day Keeps the Doctor Away

**Watch on YouTube:** [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jgbv2ZrC1xM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jgbv2ZrC1xM)

## Full Transcript with Timestamps

*Click any timestamp to jump to that moment in the video*

- **[00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jgbv2ZrC1xM&t=0s)** — You know, when we're dealing with creating health and fighting off health problems,
- **[00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jgbv2ZrC1xM&t=5s)** — it's not just one food. It's a combination of foods. So today we're going to talk about
- **[00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jgbv2ZrC1xM&t=9s)** — one additional food that I think you should add to your daily salads and that is the lonely
- **[00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jgbv2ZrC1xM&t=15s)** — carrot. Now, I've done past videos on carrots relating to the ketogenic diet, but not necessarily
- **[00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jgbv2ZrC1xM&t=21s)** — the health properties of carrots. And I recently stumbled on some data that is quite fascinating.
- **[00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jgbv2ZrC1xM&t=27s)** — Carrots can actually do more for your health than you might think. Now, the first thing that usually
- **[00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jgbv2ZrC1xM&t=32s)** — comes up with a carrot is that it's generally sweet, so people are avoiding those because
- **[00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jgbv2ZrC1xM&t=38s)** — they're trying to avoid carbs on the ketogenic diet. And it is true that the glycemic index
- **[00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jgbv2ZrC1xM&t=44s)** — of a carrot is about 72. So high is starting at 70. So it's 72. So yeah, it's a little bit high.
- **[00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jgbv2ZrC1xM&t=52s)** — But because it's so filled with fiber, and the net carbs for one medium carrot
- **[01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jgbv2ZrC1xM&t=61s)** — is only 4.3 carbs, and you're allowed like 50 carbs, it falls in the category of something
- **[01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jgbv2ZrC1xM&t=68s)** — is pretty safe because the glycemic load, which is a little different than the glycemic
- **[01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jgbv2ZrC1xM&t=73s)** — index, is a different formula. It's basically the amount of carbs because we're deducting
- **[01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jgbv2ZrC1xM&t=79s)** — all this fiber. Brings the carrot down to like 2.8 on the glycemic load scale. I mean,
- **[01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jgbv2ZrC1xM&t=85s)** — think about this. Anything less than 10 is low. It's pretty low on the glycemic load. So you're
- **[01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jgbv2ZrC1xM&t=92s)** — not going to bump yourself out of ketosis by eating a carrot a day. Carrots typically are
- **[01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jgbv2ZrC1xM&t=97s)** — thought of improving your eyesight because they're loaded with the precursor to vitamin A.
- **[01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jgbv2ZrC1xM&t=104s)** — And beta carotene, which is the precursor, is not a retinol, the active form of vitamin A,
- **[01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jgbv2ZrC1xM&t=109s)** — even though they call it vitamin A. It's a precursor. It has to be converted. And there's
- **[01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jgbv2ZrC1xM&t=113s)** — a small percentage that can convert to retinol. It's not that high, but it's something. Now,
- **[01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jgbv2ZrC1xM&t=119s)** — there are a lot of other things in carrots. You have all sorts of phytonutrients that help
- **[02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jgbv2ZrC1xM&t=123s)** — as a general antioxidant. So let's get into it. Number one, the fiber in carrots that we
- **[02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jgbv2ZrC1xM&t=130s)** — can't digest, but our microbes can, can greatly help you detoxify estrogen. And so if you're
- **[02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jgbv2ZrC1xM&t=138s)** — estrogen dominant, it can help balance that. Now, what are the risk factors of estrogen dominance?
- **[02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jgbv2ZrC1xM&t=144s)** — Well, problems with your menstrual cycle, heavy periods, waking in a lower section of your
- **[02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jgbv2ZrC1xM&t=149s)** — body, increased risk of cancer. And so anything that can actually buffer this estrogen is a good
- **[02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jgbv2ZrC1xM&t=154s)** — thing. Number two, it lessens the activation of procarcinogens. Those are things that are like
- **[02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jgbv2ZrC1xM&t=162s)** — carcinogenic, things that can cause cancer. Well, they lessen the activation of that. Number
- **[02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jgbv2ZrC1xM&t=167s)** — three, it's an antioxidant. Number four, it's anti-angiogenic. What does that mean?
- **[02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jgbv2ZrC1xM&t=172s)** — Well, when a cancer cell grows, it needs blood supply. And so there are various
- **[02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jgbv2ZrC1xM&t=177s)** — vegetables, definitely the cruciferous vegetables, but also carrots, that can inhibit
- **[03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jgbv2ZrC1xM&t=183s)** — these new blood vessels to tumors. Thus are called anti-angiogenic. Carrots also have
- **[03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jgbv2ZrC1xM&t=191s)** — anti-clotting properties. They also have properties that can help fight mycoplasmas,
- **[03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jgbv2ZrC1xM&t=196s)** — which are bacteria without the cell wall. But I think one of the biggest benefits of carrots
- **[03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jgbv2ZrC1xM&t=203s)** — is related to this other phytonutrient. And it's called fall carinol. Now, there is some
- **[03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jgbv2ZrC1xM&t=213s)** — related synergistic compounds, but nonetheless, if you eat a raw carrot a day, you're going to
- **[03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jgbv2ZrC1xM&t=219s)** — get a good amount of this fall carinol. And fall carinol is a natural pesticide
- **[03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jgbv2ZrC1xM&t=226s)** — and fungicide. Fall carinol is also in fennel, it's in celery, it's in ginseng,
- **[03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jgbv2ZrC1xM&t=233s)** — it's in parsley. But there's a lot of it in carrots. Now, even though it's a natural
- **[03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jgbv2ZrC1xM&t=238s)** — pesticide, it's not harmful to our bodies. So you don't have to worry about it. In fact,
- **[04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jgbv2ZrC1xM&t=243s)** — it may help you if you have any pathogenic funguses growing in your body. But the big
- **[04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jgbv2ZrC1xM&t=247s)** — thing that fall carinol does is what it can do for cancer. Apparently, the research shows
- **[04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jgbv2ZrC1xM&t=254s)** — that it can significantly decrease the risk of cancer, especially breast cancer and prostate
- **[04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jgbv2ZrC1xM&t=260s)** — cancer and gastric cancer and maybe even other cancers. And this other function may relate to
- **[04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jgbv2ZrC1xM&t=267s)** — or just in general, it just may help you with inflammation because fall carinol is a potent
- **[04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jgbv2ZrC1xM&t=274s)** — inhibitor of intestinal inflammation, even more than sulforaphane. And I've done videos on this
- **[04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jgbv2ZrC1xM&t=280s)** — where I talked about sulforaphane helping with gastritis and all sorts of inflammation in your
- **[04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jgbv2ZrC1xM&t=287s)** — gut. And sulforaphane is in broccoli and broccoli sprouts. But we don't want to forget
- **[04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jgbv2ZrC1xM&t=291s)** — Okay, so I would recommend eating one, at least one medium-sized raw carrot,
- **[04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jgbv2ZrC1xM&t=297s)** — organic raw carrot in your salad or just in general each day. And one of the ways that it
- **[05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jgbv2ZrC1xM&t=302s)** — can do this is through stimulating the tumor suppressor genes. And these are things that
- **[05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jgbv2ZrC1xM&t=308s)** — can actually suppress the genetics that relate to growing tumors. In some of these studies,
- **[05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jgbv2ZrC1xM&t=314s)** — which I'll list down below, you get a slower development of the cancer. You get inhibition
- **[05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jgbv2ZrC1xM&t=320s)** — of the aggressive cancer cells. You also get induction of apoptosis. What does that mean?
- **[05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jgbv2ZrC1xM&t=326s)** — It means that it triggers the cancer cells to die. Now, since we're on the topic of cancer,
- **[05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jgbv2ZrC1xM&t=332s)** — okay, in foods, you should definitely see this video that related to other foods you should be
- **[05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jgbv2ZrC1xM&t=337s)** — eating to lower your risk of cancer. And I put that up right here.

- **[00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6jyAbqak0xk&t=0s)** — Now I have a question. Would you buy this product if I added multodextrin to it?
- **[00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6jyAbqak0xk&t=7s)** — Chances are you probably wouldn't. Okay? I'm going to teach you a scientific,
- **[00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6jyAbqak0xk&t=11s)** — simple, quick test that you can apply to any food or supplement to determine
- **[00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6jyAbqak0xk&t=18s)** — if there is hidden starches, okay? Like multodextrin by simply adding a little iodine.
- **[00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6jyAbqak0xk&t=26s)** — Check this out. All right. I'm going to show you an experiment. This test is to determine if there
- **[00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6jyAbqak0xk&t=32s)** — are carbohydrates in your supplements or even your food, okay? And primarily I'm going to focus
- **[00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6jyAbqak0xk&t=38s)** — on multodextrin because that's the hidden carb, which is really a sugar, in a lot of
- **[00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6jyAbqak0xk&t=45s)** — supplements, especially in flavors. Now, the works like this. All you need is some iodine,
- **[00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6jyAbqak0xk&t=51s)** — okay? If you combine iodine with the starch, it turns the color blue. Now, if we take just normal
- **[00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6jyAbqak0xk&t=58s)** — water, okay? I'm just going to take water. We just take a drop or two of iodine in just
- **[01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6jyAbqak0xk&t=69s)** — regular water, tap water. You can see it doesn't turn blue. It stays kind of gold and yellow,
- **[01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6jyAbqak0xk&t=76s)** — okay? But if we take some iodine on some wonderful bread, you can see it will turn it blue,
- **[01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6jyAbqak0xk&t=87s)** — okay? That's the chemical reaction that occurs, which I'm not going to get into why, but
- **[01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6jyAbqak0xk&t=91s)** — it just does that. Now, if we take pure multodextrin, for example, and put it in some
- **[01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6jyAbqak0xk&t=97s)** — water right here, okay? Mix it up. Put a couple drops of iodine in it. You can see
- **[01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6jyAbqak0xk&t=110s)** — the color blue or purple. Okay, that's pure multodextrin. Now, let's take this other
- **[02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6jyAbqak0xk&t=120s)** — electrolyte powder, which is a competitor's brand, which has a very similar formula to
- **[02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6jyAbqak0xk&t=127s)** — a copycat formula. They state that this is without sugar or multodextrin. Okay, cool.
- **[02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6jyAbqak0xk&t=137s)** — Okay, so let's add a scoop of that and a couple drops of iodine. Let's see if it has
- **[02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6jyAbqak0xk&t=145s)** — multodextrin in there. Whoa! Turns purple blue. Apparently it does.
- **[02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6jyAbqak0xk&t=159s)** — All right, now let's take my electrolyte powder. Let's see if it has any multodextrin in there or
- **[02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6jyAbqak0xk&t=164s)** — or carbs, starches, I mean. Okay, mix it here. Let's put a couple drops of iodine in there.
- **[02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6jyAbqak0xk&t=178s)** — No purple, no multodextrin. In fact, let's put some even more iodine in there.
- **[03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6jyAbqak0xk&t=185s)** — See if it eventually turns it purple. And the answer is no. It stays yellow gold.
- **[03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6jyAbqak0xk&t=194s)** — And you can try this with anything. Okay, so you just need some iodine and you can add it to
- **[03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6jyAbqak0xk&t=200s)** — the food or put it in some liquid if there's a powder. And you can detect hidden multodextrin
- **[03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6jyAbqak0xk&t=206s)** — and other starches in your supplements and food. As I went ahead and did the iodine tests
- **[03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6jyAbqak0xk&t=211s)** — on every single one of my products. And I also learned something new about this iodine test or
- **[03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6jyAbqak0xk&t=219s)** — starch test. And that is this iodine will also react against chlorophyll. And so if a product
- **[03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6jyAbqak0xk&t=225s)** — has chlorophyll like a wheatgrass juice powder or cruciferous or a leafy green, because of the
- **[03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6jyAbqak0xk&t=231s)** — pigment chlorophyll in interacting with iodine, it will turn the substance a little bit brown.
- **[03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6jyAbqak0xk&t=237s)** — Not purple, but brown. We also learned that if a product has inulin, it can also alter the color.
- **[04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6jyAbqak0xk&t=246s)** — So I just wanted to bring that up because it's not just multodextrin or other starches
- **[04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6jyAbqak0xk&t=251s)** — that can turn things a different color. All right, so now that you know how to determine
- **[04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6jyAbqak0xk&t=255s)** — if there are hidden starches in your products that you buy. Let's talk a little bit more about
- **[04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6jyAbqak0xk&t=262s)** — hidden starches. And the main starch that is put in so many of these products is multodextrin.
- **[04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6jyAbqak0xk&t=269s)** — It's a nearly four billion dollar industry. Where are they putting all this multodextrin?
- **[04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6jyAbqak0xk&t=275s)** — Well, they use it as a bulking agent, a thickening agent, a carrier for various things
- **[04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6jyAbqak0xk&t=282s)** — like flavorings. They use it to add certain texture. They use it to increase shelf life.
- **[04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6jyAbqak0xk&t=289s)** — They promote it as being plant-based and something that's very, very inexpensive.
- **[04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6jyAbqak0xk&t=294s)** — One metric ton of this stuff is like only $520. So if a manufacturing company wants to use it
- **[05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6jyAbqak0xk&t=302s)** — to add something as a filler, maybe add some texture, they're only spending pennies. Okay,
- **[05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6jyAbqak0xk&t=307s)** — so the profit can go very, very high. There's some other sneaky added benefits
- **[05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6jyAbqak0xk&t=311s)** — to a company that you should know about. Number one, multodextrin can be classified
- **[05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6jyAbqak0xk&t=317s)** — on the label as a carbohydrate, but not as a sugar. Despite behaving like a sugar,
- **[05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6jyAbqak0xk&t=325s)** — I mean on the glycemic index, you have table sugar, 65. Glucose, 100. Multodextrin is
- **[05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6jyAbqak0xk&t=335s)** — between 105 and 185. I mean, when that stuff hits your bloodstream, you are majorly spiking
- **[05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6jyAbqak0xk&t=341s)** — your blood sugars and majorly increasing insulin. And what's wild is there's a
- **[05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6jyAbqak0xk&t=347s)** — carbohydrate and not as a sugar. In fact, and also when multodextrin is .5 grams per
- **[05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6jyAbqak0xk&t=356s)** — serving size, they don't have to list multodextrin on the label. And it's usually
- **[06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6jyAbqak0xk&t=362s)** — made from corn, but it's also made from wheat, rice, potato. But many of the supplements
- **[06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6jyAbqak0xk&t=368s)** — that you are probably taking right now have it in there as a hidden ingredient
- **[06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6jyAbqak0xk&t=371s)** — for various reasons. One, as a kind of a carrier or a conversion of liquid
- **[06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6jyAbqak0xk&t=378s)** — flavoring to powdered flavoring. In fact, it was very, very difficult for me to find
- **[06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6jyAbqak0xk&t=384s)** — a flavoring company that did not use multodextrin. And unfortunately, many of
- **[06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6jyAbqak0xk&t=387s)** — the supplement companies out there are developed and formulated by marketers who don't really
- **[06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6jyAbqak0xk&t=393s)** — care about the quality. But you have flavorings, you have supplements, you have energy gels
- **[06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6jyAbqak0xk&t=399s)** — that are used for long distance runners that actually even have in the label like sugar free,
- **[06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6jyAbqak0xk&t=405s)** — but it's just filled with hidden sugars as carbohydrates. They're even going after the
- **[06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6jyAbqak0xk&t=412s)** — baby formulas. Yeah, baby formula, loaded with multodextrin. And definitely the sports
- **[06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6jyAbqak0xk&t=419s)** — products in muscle building, powders, energy drinks, etc. But unfortunately, a lot of
- **[07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6jyAbqak0xk&t=427s)** — people don't know about this. It's that little dirty secret that if people found out,
- **[07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6jyAbqak0xk&t=432s)** — they wouldn't buy a product that has this very, very high glycemic index sugar in it.
- **[07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6jyAbqak0xk&t=437s)** — If you're going to exercise, right, and you're going to take a sports drink or sports gel,
- **[07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6jyAbqak0xk&t=442s)** — would it help to have that be candy or sugar? Does that improve your performance? Really? No,
- **[07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6jyAbqak0xk&t=449s)** — it's going to spike your blood sugars and it's going to come down and you're going to
- **[07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6jyAbqak0xk&t=457s)** — suppose to be keto friendly. They're not very keto friendly. And this could definitely be one
- **[07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6jyAbqak0xk&t=463s)** — reason why people might try keto with some of these products, unknowingly not able to get
- **[07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6jyAbqak0xk&t=469s)** — into keto because of the amount of hidden multodextrin. And then maybe say, well,
- **[07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6jyAbqak0xk&t=475s)** — you know, it didn't work. Let me go on to the next diet. So I just wanted to create
- **[07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6jyAbqak0xk&t=478s)** — this video to teach you a tool that you can use using simple iodine. And since we're on
- **[08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6jyAbqak0xk&t=485s)** — topic of multodextrin, if you haven't seen this video, you definitely need to check it out. I put
- **[08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6jyAbqak0xk&t=489s)** — it up right here.

- **[00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TAl0cx5WNbg&t=0s)** — If you ever get tempted to buy a keto apple cider vinegar gummy supplement, you need to watch this video.
- **[00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TAl0cx5WNbg&t=7s)** — Because chances are at the end of this video you won't be buying that product. It's a very similar formula.
- **[00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TAl0cx5WNbg&t=13s)** — It comes under many different brands like the keto Lux or the Bioscience, BioLife, Vital Pulse, BioHealth, Horback, Justified Laboratories, and Biofast.
- **[00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TAl0cx5WNbg&t=25s)** — And there's probably a hundred more. Incredible claims. You can have instant fat burning, accelerated fat burning, and you can even transform your body.
- **[00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TAl0cx5WNbg&t=33s)** — I mean, right in the title they'll use shark tank, but not as endorsed by shark tank. They just use shark and tank in the sentence.
- **[00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TAl0cx5WNbg&t=42s)** — And then you assume that it's endorsed by shark tank when it's absolutely not endorsed.
- **[00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TAl0cx5WNbg&t=46s)** — So they'll mix weight loss with shark tank. They'll call it weight shark loss tank or shark fat tank loss.
- **[00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TAl0cx5WNbg&t=56s)** — This is called subliminal messaging. It's ridiculous.
- **[00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TAl0cx5WNbg&t=59s)** — OK, now here's another thing that they'll put in there that they kind of trick people made in the USA.
- **[01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TAl0cx5WNbg&t=67s)** — Well, all that means is that they're putting the ingredients together in a bottle in the United States.
- **[01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TAl0cx5WNbg&t=72s)** — The ingredients usually come from China. OK, because I sell supplements.
- **[01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TAl0cx5WNbg&t=77s)** — I know this little loophole that people use and they use it all the time.
- **[01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TAl0cx5WNbg&t=81s)** — Sometimes people even ask me, Dr. Burke, why do you sell supplements? You shouldn't sell supplements.
- **[01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TAl0cx5WNbg&t=86s)** — I said, well, would you rather a marketer sell them who really doesn't know about supplements, that doesn't care about the ingredients,
- **[01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TAl0cx5WNbg&t=92s)** — that has a brand, but not an individual person behind that brand that you can actually listen to their philosophy.
- **[01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TAl0cx5WNbg&t=98s)** — They'll use terms like gluten free. Right. Well, here you take out the gluten, which is the protein out of wheat.
- **[01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TAl0cx5WNbg&t=104s)** — OK, so you might not be allergic to it. You might not be sensitive.
- **[01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TAl0cx5WNbg&t=108s)** — But now you took up that protein. It's going to be more carbohydrates, less protein.
- **[01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TAl0cx5WNbg&t=114s)** — And they'll even use terms like all natural. Like that really means anything legally. It doesn't.
- **[01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TAl0cx5WNbg&t=118s)** — But the biggest problem with these gummies, OK, is that per serving size, which usually is two,
- **[02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TAl0cx5WNbg&t=126s)** — come out to about three to five grams of sugar. Now, realize one teaspoon of sugar is four grams.
- **[02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TAl0cx5WNbg&t=134s)** — So if it's five grams of sugar per serving size, it's a little bit more than a teaspoon of sugar.
- **[02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TAl0cx5WNbg&t=139s)** — I mean, think about the whole bottle, right? If we add up a 60 count, which is the usual number of these gummies in one bottle,
- **[02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TAl0cx5WNbg&t=147s)** — you're talking about in that tiny little bottle, there are 30 teaspoons of sugar.
- **[02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TAl0cx5WNbg&t=153s)** — This is not a keto product. This is a candy. It should be in the candy section.
- **[02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TAl0cx5WNbg&t=160s)** — But I think people think because they look so cute and they taste so sweet and they're
- **[02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TAl0cx5WNbg&t=166s)** — really the texture is very chewy. I mean, they wouldn't sell them or they wouldn't claim
- **[02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TAl0cx5WNbg&t=171s)** — to be keto unless they really were keto. No, they're not keto. Just look at the ingredients.
- **[02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TAl0cx5WNbg&t=177s)** — And then some of these products, they don't even have the ingredients in the listing
- **[03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TAl0cx5WNbg&t=181s)** — on Amazon. You have to dig and try to find it. But anytime when they list the ingredients,
- **[03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TAl0cx5WNbg&t=185s)** — the first ingredient is probably the majority of the product. And usually the first ingredient
- **[03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TAl0cx5WNbg&t=191s)** — is either corn syrup or sugar cane or some other type of sugar. And it's not just
- **[03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TAl0cx5WNbg&t=199s)** — one sugar. There's like several sugars within the ingredients. If we just take glucose syrup
- **[03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TAl0cx5WNbg&t=205s)** — by itself, that has a glycemic index of 100. Corn syrup has a glycemic index of 115.
- **[03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TAl0cx5WNbg&t=212s)** — Okay, that is like way, way too high. This is not keto. It's a scam. It'll bump you out of
- **[03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TAl0cx5WNbg&t=219s)** — ketosis and you'll probably feel bloated and you're definitely not going to lose weight.
- **[03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TAl0cx5WNbg&t=223s)** — You might feel a little bit tired after you take them because that spike in sugar.
- **[03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TAl0cx5WNbg&t=227s)** — The B vitamins that they add are just really, really cheap. And then on top of that,
- **[03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TAl0cx5WNbg&t=231s)** — the apple cider vinegar. One serving size, which is two gummies, comes out to 500 milligrams
- **[03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TAl0cx5WNbg&t=238s)** — of apple cider vinegar. Well, do you know what an average serving size of apple cider vinegar
- **[04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TAl0cx5WNbg&t=244s)** — out of the bottle is? 15 grams of apple cider vinegar. In other words, if we compare one
- **[04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TAl0cx5WNbg&t=252s)** — actual serving size of apple cider vinegar in a tablespoon, that would be equivalent to the
- **[04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TAl0cx5WNbg&t=257s)** — bottle of gummies. Okay. So when you're getting a serving size of gummies, you're just getting
- **[04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TAl0cx5WNbg&t=262s)** — several drops of apple cider vinegar. It's not going to do anything. You'd be much better off
- **[04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TAl0cx5WNbg&t=267s)** — just buying apple cider vinegar, putting it in some water. And by the way, I would always
- **[04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TAl0cx5WNbg&t=272s)** — recommend the brand Fair Child's not brag because brag used to be good, but they started
- **[04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TAl0cx5WNbg&t=278s)** — diluting their apple cider vinegar with water, just watering it down, but they didn't
- **[04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TAl0cx5WNbg&t=282s)** — bring the price down. Right? So if you just add water and dilute it, you make a lot more profit.
- **[04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TAl0cx5WNbg&t=288s)** — But Fair Child's has some really good integrity and they do not dilute their apple cider
- **[04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TAl0cx5WNbg&t=294s)** — vinegar. In fact, it's raw, it's organic, and it's awesome. But anyway, I wanted to do
- **[05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TAl0cx5WNbg&t=300s)** — this video because a lot of people ask me, are those gummies any good? Should I get some?
- **[05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TAl0cx5WNbg&t=304s)** — Are they going to help me? And the answer is a big fat no, I wouldn't waste your money.
- **[05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TAl0cx5WNbg&t=310s)** — I would instead buy some actual real apple cider vinegar. Now, because of the censoring
- **[05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TAl0cx5WNbg&t=316s)** — and the suppressing of the algorithms on YouTube, it's becoming more difficult to

- **[00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uvh3m2pp1zc&t=0s)** — Autism is not caused by vaccines. The science is settled. If you look it up on Wikipedia, it'll say,
- **[00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uvh3m2pp1zc&t=5s)** — there is no known cause of autism. It's most likely genetic, possibly environmental. There's no known
- **[00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uvh3m2pp1zc&t=11s)** — cure. But there's one thing that Wikipedia does emphasize over and over again. It's a myth that
- **[00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uvh3m2pp1zc&t=16s)** — vaccines are a cause of autism. I have to give a disclaimer here because YouTube has policies.
- **[00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uvh3m2pp1zc&t=22s)** — If something conflicts with medical consensus, it's considered misinformation. However, YouTube
- **[00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uvh3m2pp1zc&t=28s)** — does give you an exception to that. If you want to cover opposing viewpoints or your own opinions
- **[00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uvh3m2pp1zc&t=34s)** — and you back it up with research, potentially they won't take the video down. I am not going
- **[00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uvh3m2pp1zc&t=39s)** — to conclude for you. I'm just going to give you a series of pieces of information and you
- **[00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uvh3m2pp1zc&t=45s)** — can make up your own mind. With all these controversial topics, there's always opposing
- **[00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uvh3m2pp1zc&t=49s)** — viewpoints, right? Because you have like Dr. Paul Offit. He's an advocate for vaccines
- **[00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uvh3m2pp1zc&t=55s)** — for children and he's a critic of the anti-vaccine movement. Then of course,
- **[00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uvh3m2pp1zc&t=59s)** — you have Anthony Fauci who also says that there's no evidence between autism and vaccines.
- **[01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uvh3m2pp1zc&t=64s)** — And then between 2010 and 2021, Fauci received 58 royalty payments directly from vaccine
- **[01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uvh3m2pp1zc&t=72s)** — research. So there's two main things I'm going to talk about. Number one is the myth that
- **[01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uvh3m2pp1zc&t=77s)** — autism comes from vaccines because it's been disproven and there's no research. I'm going
- **[01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uvh3m2pp1zc&t=85s)** — autism. There's advocates that are telling us that a cure is even dangerous and autism is
- **[01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uvh3m2pp1zc&t=92s)** — normal. Let's first talk about what we really know about autism. We know that there's a
- **[01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uvh3m2pp1zc&t=96s)** — much higher level of inflammation in the brain with autism. And I'm going to put some links
- **[01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uvh3m2pp1zc&t=101s)** — down below from the research done by Dr. Coenbrey, who's a neurologist. So the data
- **[01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uvh3m2pp1zc&t=106s)** — that he found in autism is that there's chronic inflammation that's not related to
- **[01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uvh3m2pp1zc&t=112s)** — a microbe or a pathogen. One study showed that 70% of autistic children had higher levels of
- **[01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uvh3m2pp1zc&t=119s)** — autoimmune diseases, which is really interesting. But what's even more interesting about that,
- **[02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uvh3m2pp1zc&t=124s)** — a vaccine given to a person does not create an adequate immune response unless you also add
- **[02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uvh3m2pp1zc&t=131s)** — something to that vaccine. And that thing that's added to the vaccine is called an adjuvant.
- **[02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uvh3m2pp1zc&t=136s)** — Aluminum compounds are the most commonly used vaccine adjuvants. Research shows that aluminum
- **[02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uvh3m2pp1zc&t=143s)** — is toxic on multiple levels. It is a neurotoxin. The neurotoxicity of aluminum typically manifests
- **[02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uvh3m2pp1zc&t=150s)** — in learning, memory, concentration, and speech deficits. The question arises what makes
- **[02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uvh3m2pp1zc&t=156s)** — the brain particularly susceptible to aluminum toxic impact. When you get an injection with
- **[02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uvh3m2pp1zc&t=161s)** — adjuvant aluminum, it goes up into and it crosses the blood-brain barrier with the help of an
- **[02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uvh3m2pp1zc&t=167s)** — immune cell triggered by repeated exposure of unexpectedly long persistence of aluminum
- **[02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uvh3m2pp1zc&t=173s)** — adjuvants in the human body. Now that's all very interesting, but now I have to show you
- **[02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uvh3m2pp1zc&t=178s)** — something on this page right here. What we're looking at on this page is from 1980 to 2023.
- **[03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uvh3m2pp1zc&t=186s)** — Okay, and we're looking at the autism rate in the United States. There's one in 10,000
- **[03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uvh3m2pp1zc&t=191s)** — people in the U.S. The number of vaccine doses went up to 12, with aluminum exposure 4x more
- **[03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uvh3m2pp1zc&t=197s)** — than 250, so we got a thousand micrograms. Ten years later, now we have one in 150 people
- **[03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uvh3m2pp1zc&t=204s)** — getting autism. And at that time, we went up doubling from 12 to 24 number of vaccine doses
- **[03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uvh3m2pp1zc&t=212s)** — by age six, with more than doubling the aluminum exposure to 2,500 micrograms of
- **[03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uvh3m2pp1zc&t=220s)** — 23 years later in 2023. One in 36 kids are diagnosed with the most aggressive vaccine
- **[03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uvh3m2pp1zc&t=227s)** — schedule in history with 49 vaccine doses by age six, with an aluminum toxicity exposure
- **[03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uvh3m2pp1zc&t=234s)** — of 5,000 micrograms. Now, I'm not telling you what to conclude from this. I'm just giving you
- **[04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uvh3m2pp1zc&t=241s)** — the data. The FDA Department of Health and Human Services requires limits on aluminum in
- **[04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uvh3m2pp1zc&t=247s)** — parental feeding solutions that require warning labels about potential aluminum hazards,
- **[04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uvh3m2pp1zc&t=253s)** — yet sets no safety limits or required warnings for aluminum in vaccines. I would love to ask
- **[04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uvh3m2pp1zc&t=259s)** — some of these medical experts that are pro-vaccine to help me understand how 5,000
- **[04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uvh3m2pp1zc&t=268s)** — micrograms are safe for a child under the age of six. The consequence of this view is
- **[04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uvh3m2pp1zc&t=274s)** — reflected in the fact that a large number of vaccine trials use an aluminum adjuvant containing
- **[04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uvh3m2pp1zc&t=282s)** — placebo or other aluminum containing vaccines as the control group. When you do an experiment,
- **[04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uvh3m2pp1zc&t=289s)** — a control group is a group that doesn't get the treatment. So that way you have something
- **[04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uvh3m2pp1zc&t=293s)** — to compare it to, right? So guess what? In the studies using this adjuvant aluminum in
- **[04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uvh3m2pp1zc&t=297s)** — vaccines, the control group that's not supposed to be getting the aluminum is getting the
- **[05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uvh3m2pp1zc&t=302s)** — aluminum. So right there, that completely cancels out those studies that did that.
- **[05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uvh3m2pp1zc&t=306s)** — And also the data, when you look at countries that don't have such an aggressive vaccine
- **[05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uvh3m2pp1zc&t=312s)** — schedule, do not have significant trending autistic diagnoses. Even in the Amish community,
- **[05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uvh3m2pp1zc&t=318s)** — which is unvaccinated, they have extremely low diagnoses of autism. There are certain
- **[05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uvh3m2pp1zc&t=324s)** — genes that could put a child more at risk for developing autism, no doubt. And so the
- **[05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uvh3m2pp1zc&t=331s)** — combination of the aggressive vaccine schedule with the amount of aluminum in an individual
- **[05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uvh3m2pp1zc&t=336s)** — that's vulnerable because their genetics are predisposed to having autism, that could be the
- **[05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uvh3m2pp1zc&t=342s)** — perfect storm. I personally think that before anyone is given a vaccine, if they could look
- **[05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uvh3m2pp1zc&t=346s)** — at their genetics to see if they're vulnerable, then they can have a better choice on who's
- **[05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uvh3m2pp1zc&t=351s)** — more at risk than others. So I'm going to give you Dr. Kornberry's protocol. And then
- **[05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uvh3m2pp1zc&t=355s)** — right after I give you Dr. Kornberry's protocol, I'm going to show you a clip of
- **[06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uvh3m2pp1zc&t=360s)** — him speaking about this topic. So the number one thing that he'll give someone is vitamin D3
- **[06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uvh3m2pp1zc&t=364s)** — in higher amounts, 10,000 IUs. High levels of vitamin D3 help to create a calming effect
- **[06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uvh3m2pp1zc&t=371s)** — of an overactive immune system. We have a hypersensitive immune reaction in the brain,
- **[06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uvh3m2pp1zc&t=378s)** — interrupting the normal function of the brain. So vitamin D, number two, propolis. This is
- **[06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uvh3m2pp1zc&t=383s)** — something that related to what bees make. Propolis greatly helps regulate a dysfunctional
- **[06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uvh3m2pp1zc&t=389s)** — system. And it's a very potent anti-inflammatory for the brain. But the third thing is probably
- **[06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uvh3m2pp1zc&t=396s)** — the most important thing. And it's an oral silica supplement. And the one that Dr.
- **[06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uvh3m2pp1zc&t=401s)** — Kornberry recommends is called monomethyl-silentrol. And he'll give between 100 to 200 milligrams
- **[06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uvh3m2pp1zc&t=408s)** — of the silica three times a day. And if the child also has hyperactivity, he will add to
- **[06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uvh3m2pp1zc&t=415s)** — his protocol four grams of glycinate, which calms down the nervous system. Now he'll also
- **[07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uvh3m2pp1zc&t=421s)** — make some adjustments on that. If the child is too sleepy during the day, he'll cut that
- **[07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uvh3m2pp1zc&t=426s)** — down a little bit because it does make you very calm. And I'm going to recommend that you
- **[07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uvh3m2pp1zc&t=430s)** — put your child on a low carb diet so then the brain can start increasing ketones. And
- **[07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uvh3m2pp1zc&t=437s)** — I also think that will support the brain. But I'm not making any claims. This is all theory.
- **[07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uvh3m2pp1zc&t=441s)** — Go ahead and make up your own mind. But now check out this clip from Dr. Kornberry.
- **[07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uvh3m2pp1zc&t=446s)** — When you inject aluminum in vaccines, aluminum is not eliminated by the kidneys. It remains in
- **[07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uvh3m2pp1zc&t=455s)** — our organism. It is within the immune cells and it enters the brain, carried by the immune
- **[07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uvh3m2pp1zc&t=461s)** — cells. There is a lot of research by Christopher Huxley. And he has shown that
- **[07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uvh3m2pp1zc&t=470s)** — in the brains of people who died, they had autism and they found high levels of
- **[07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uvh3m2pp1zc&t=479s)** — aluminum in the brain tissue. They went to the University of Oxford in England and they
- **[08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uvh3m2pp1zc&t=486s)** — got samples from the brains of patients that had autism when they died. And they
- **[08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uvh3m2pp1zc&t=494s)** — could see in the microscope that there were lots of nanoparticles of aluminum.
- **[08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uvh3m2pp1zc&t=500s)** — It's amazing to see the number of vaccines and how people just accept it as something
- **[08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uvh3m2pp1zc&t=508s)** — being normal. I've been treating autism since 2014. I was in high doses of vitamin D.
- **[08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uvh3m2pp1zc&t=517s)** — In a way, autism is not an immune disorder. And in another way, it is also a manifestation
- **[08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uvh3m2pp1zc&t=524s)** — of toxicity caused by this aluminum. It causes a lot of abnormal metabolic changes.
- **[08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uvh3m2pp1zc&t=534s)** — Every now and then, I received patients, their children or adolescents, and I was
- **[09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uvh3m2pp1zc&t=542s)** — amazed to see the number of children and adolescents that are depressed nowadays,
- **[09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uvh3m2pp1zc&t=549s)** — committing suicide. And this is increasing in the same rate that autism is increasing.
- **[09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uvh3m2pp1zc&t=557s)** — So at some point, I received here a MS patient and her daughter was 17 years old. The
- **[09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uvh3m2pp1zc&t=567s)** — told me that when she was only four years old, she was so depressed that child had to take
- **[09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uvh3m2pp1zc&t=576s)** — antidepressant drugs. And because that girl was born in 2006, when she was receiving lots of
- **[09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uvh3m2pp1zc&t=584s)** — vaccines containing aluminum, I decided to give her silica. That substance binds to aluminum
- **[09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uvh3m2pp1zc&t=591s)** — and both silica and aluminum are eliminated by the kidneys. And she came back

- **[10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uvh3m2pp1zc&t=609s)** — better. And her psychiatrist was decreasing the drugs that she was taking. The psychiatrist
- **[10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uvh3m2pp1zc&t=617s)** — thought that maybe she was no longer needing all those medications. You see, this is a

- **[00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJEAqOdnF2E&t=0s)** — I'd like to talk about three really common mistakes that a lot of people make when they start the ketogenic diet.
- **[00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJEAqOdnF2E&t=6s)** — So when interviewing people who are either plateaued or they're running into problems,
- **[00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJEAqOdnF2E&t=12s)** — these three things keep coming up over and over and over again.
- **[00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJEAqOdnF2E&t=14s)** — So I'm going to make it really simple and this is going to be a fairly quick video,
- **[00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJEAqOdnF2E&t=19s)** — but these are very important points.
- **[00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJEAqOdnF2E&t=22s)** — So that way, if you're starting keto, you can be very successful.
- **[00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJEAqOdnF2E&t=26s)** — And the first mistake relates to fat, okay?
- **[00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJEAqOdnF2E&t=29s)** — People sometimes think that a ketogenic diet is just a high-fat diet,
- **[00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJEAqOdnF2E&t=33s)** — and that's what makes you burn fat and turn it into ketones.
- **[00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJEAqOdnF2E&t=39s)** — That's not true. It's not eating more fat.
- **[00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJEAqOdnF2E&t=41s)** — Eating more fat is not going to make you more into ketosis.
- **[00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJEAqOdnF2E&t=44s)** — It's the lowering of carbohydrates.
- **[00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJEAqOdnF2E&t=46s)** — Now, what is an average person trying to fix when they go on keto?
- **[00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJEAqOdnF2E&t=50s)** — They're trying to fix problems with their insulin, okay?
- **[00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJEAqOdnF2E&t=56s)** — Primarily this thing called insulin resistance.
- **[00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJEAqOdnF2E&t=58s)** — Insulin resistance is basically the pre-stage before diabetes.
- **[01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJEAqOdnF2E&t=64s)** — It starts off mild, it gets worse, worse, and worse
- **[01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJEAqOdnF2E&t=67s)** — until the point where it becomes advanced insulin resistance,
- **[01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJEAqOdnF2E&t=70s)** — and then you become a pre-diabetic and a diabetic.
- **[01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJEAqOdnF2E&t=73s)** — So diabetes is advanced insulin resistance.
- **[01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJEAqOdnF2E&t=77s)** — Now let's just take a look at a really,
- **[01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJEAqOdnF2E&t=80s)** — like probably the most important function of insulin.
- **[01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJEAqOdnF2E&t=84s)** — Insulin prevents the loss of fat.
- **[01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJEAqOdnF2E&t=89s)** — It's a survival mechanism.
- **[01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJEAqOdnF2E&t=91s)** — Yes, it does help you store fat,
- **[01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJEAqOdnF2E&t=93s)** — but it prevents the burning of fat.
- **[01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJEAqOdnF2E&t=95s)** — It also prevents the loss of proteins in the body.
- **[01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJEAqOdnF2E&t=98s)** — Like, if you think about a diabetic type one,
- **[01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJEAqOdnF2E&t=102s)** — where they have no more insulin,
- **[01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJEAqOdnF2E&t=103s)** — and what happens with them?
- **[01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJEAqOdnF2E&t=105s)** — They're really skinny.
- **[01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJEAqOdnF2E&t=106s)** — But what's confusing to some people is that,
- **[01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJEAqOdnF2E&t=108s)** — wow, they're a diabetic, they should be fat.
- **[01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJEAqOdnF2E&t=110s)** — Now, a lot of times when you have type one,
- **[01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJEAqOdnF2E&t=111s)** — you're very, very skinny.
- **[01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJEAqOdnF2E&t=112s)** — Why?
- **[01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJEAqOdnF2E&t=113s)** — Because you have no more insulin to store anything.
- **[01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJEAqOdnF2E&t=116s)** — So everything just tends to just end up in the blood.
- **[01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJEAqOdnF2E&t=119s)** — So you have high levels of fat in the blood
- **[02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJEAqOdnF2E&t=121s)** — that then don't get stored.
- **[02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJEAqOdnF2E&t=123s)** — You end up with high levels of sugar,
- **[02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJEAqOdnF2E&t=124s)** — and you lose a lot of protein too.
- **[02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJEAqOdnF2E&t=127s)** — So it's a really nasty problem, diabetes type one.
- **[02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJEAqOdnF2E&t=129s)** — So how does this relate to fat?
- **[02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJEAqOdnF2E&t=132s)** — In order for you to even develop diabetes
- **[02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJEAqOdnF2E&t=135s)** — in the first place, advanced insulin resistance,
- **[02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJEAqOdnF2E&t=137s)** — or even insulin resistance,
- **[02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJEAqOdnF2E&t=139s)** — there has to first be a problem in your fat cells,
- **[02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJEAqOdnF2E&t=143s)** — where your fat cells have insulin resistance.
- **[02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJEAqOdnF2E&t=146s)** — In other words, there's this dysfunctional fat cell
- **[02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJEAqOdnF2E&t=150s)** — that can no longer store fat.
- **[02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJEAqOdnF2E&t=153s)** — So as a protective mechanism,
- **[02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJEAqOdnF2E&t=155s)** — the fat cell has to stop that fat from going in.
- **[02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJEAqOdnF2E&t=157s)** — So it develops this resistance against insulin.
- **[02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJEAqOdnF2E&t=160s)** — So we no longer have this storage mechanism
- **[02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJEAqOdnF2E&t=162s)** — in the fat cell.
- **[02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJEAqOdnF2E&t=163s)** — But now where does that fat go?
- **[02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJEAqOdnF2E&t=164s)** — The fat is now gonna be accumulated outside
- **[02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJEAqOdnF2E&t=168s)** — the fat cell.
- **[02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJEAqOdnF2E&t=169s)** — Okay, that's called ectopic fat.
- **[02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJEAqOdnF2E&t=172s)** — It's not in the adipocyte anymore.
- **[02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJEAqOdnF2E&t=175s)** — You're gonna get fatty muscle.
- **[02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJEAqOdnF2E&t=177s)** — It's gonna be in your liver.
- **[02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJEAqOdnF2E&t=178s)** — It's gonna be around the organs.
- **[03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJEAqOdnF2E&t=180s)** — It's gonna be inside the pancreas.
- **[03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJEAqOdnF2E&t=182s)** — It's gonna be all over the place.
- **[03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJEAqOdnF2E&t=183s)** — That is when you start developing insulin resistance
- **[03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJEAqOdnF2E&t=187s)** — to a point where then it switches to diabetes.
- **[03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJEAqOdnF2E&t=191s)** — So let's just take a look at that one point
- **[03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJEAqOdnF2E&t=193s)** — for a second.
- **[03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJEAqOdnF2E&t=194s)** — If you're gonna go on keto to fix insulin resistance
- **[03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJEAqOdnF2E&t=199s)** — and you're a pre-diabetic or you're diabetic,
- **[03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJEAqOdnF2E&t=202s)** — would it make sense to really stuff yourself
- **[03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJEAqOdnF2E&t=204s)** — with more fat?
- **[03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJEAqOdnF2E&t=206s)** — That's gonna contribute to the problem.
- **[03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJEAqOdnF2E&t=208s)** — So one of the biggest mistakes on keto
- **[03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJEAqOdnF2E&t=209s)** — is people just do unlimited fat.
- **[03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJEAqOdnF2E&t=212s)** — They do bulletproof coffee.
- **[03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJEAqOdnF2E&t=213s)** — They're downing tons of butter.
- **[03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJEAqOdnF2E&t=215s)** — They're doing keto fat bombs.
- **[03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJEAqOdnF2E&t=217s)** — I actually have a recipe channel
- **[03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJEAqOdnF2E&t=219s)** — that teaches you how to make these recipes,
- **[03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJEAqOdnF2E&t=222s)** — but I do think they serve one purpose
- **[03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJEAqOdnF2E&t=223s)** — is when you first start keto
- **[03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJEAqOdnF2E&t=225s)** — and you're making this transition
- **[03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJEAqOdnF2E&t=226s)** — and you wanna make it easy
- **[03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJEAqOdnF2E&t=227s)** — and you eat more fat to be able to fast longer,
- **[03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJEAqOdnF2E&t=230s)** — okay, that's a good reason.
- **[03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJEAqOdnF2E&t=231s)** — But after you've adapted and you're doing good,
- **[03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJEAqOdnF2E&t=235s)** — I don't recommend continuing to just dump
- **[03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJEAqOdnF2E&t=239s)** — unlimited amount of fat in your system.
- **[04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJEAqOdnF2E&t=241s)** — What you should do is consume the fat
- **[04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJEAqOdnF2E&t=243s)** — that normally comes with the protein.
- **[04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJEAqOdnF2E&t=245s)** — Don't go low fat.
- **[04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJEAqOdnF2E&t=247s)** — Don't avoid fat,
- **[04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJEAqOdnF2E&t=248s)** — but just don't consume a lot of extra fat,
- **[04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJEAqOdnF2E&t=251s)** — especially if you're trying to fix insulin resistance
- **[04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJEAqOdnF2E&t=255s)** — and diabetes.
- **[04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJEAqOdnF2E&t=257s)** — So when someone's like plateaued with their weight
- **[04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJEAqOdnF2E&t=259s)** — and I asked them what they're eating
- **[04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJEAqOdnF2E&t=263s)** — and then I find out they're eating
- **[04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJEAqOdnF2E&t=264s)** — like all this extra fat,
- **[04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJEAqOdnF2E&t=266s)** — like I'll have them make that change
- **[04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJEAqOdnF2E&t=268s)** — and they'll do much better.
- **[04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJEAqOdnF2E&t=269s)** — On the flip side of that,
- **[04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJEAqOdnF2E&t=270s)** — there are certain programs like ideal protein
- **[04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJEAqOdnF2E&t=274s)** — that is protein, low carb and low fat.
- **[04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJEAqOdnF2E&t=280s)** — But the problem is the quality of ingredients
- **[04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJEAqOdnF2E&t=282s)** — are really crappy.
- **[04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJEAqOdnF2E&t=283s)** — They're getting their protein from soy protein isolates
- **[04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJEAqOdnF2E&t=286s)** — and all that stuff.
- **[04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJEAqOdnF2E&t=286s)** — So that's not necessarily one of the mistakes.
- **[04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJEAqOdnF2E&t=288s)** — I just want to bring that up.
- **[04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJEAqOdnF2E&t=290s)** — You want to use healthy ingredients as well,
- **[04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJEAqOdnF2E&t=293s)** — like real food,
- **[04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJEAqOdnF2E&t=294s)** — which relates to the mistake number two.
- **[04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJEAqOdnF2E&t=296s)** — I mean, this concept of keto snacks
- **[05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJEAqOdnF2E&t=300s)** — goes completely against what we're trying to do
- **[05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJEAqOdnF2E&t=303s)** — because insulin is not just increased by carbs,
- **[05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJEAqOdnF2E&t=307s)** — it's also increased by eating
- **[05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJEAqOdnF2E&t=310s)** — and these snacks are going to really just raise
- **[05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJEAqOdnF2E&t=312s)** — your insulin.
- **[05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJEAqOdnF2E&t=313s)** — Especially if you're buying all these snacks,
- **[05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJEAqOdnF2E&t=315s)** — you're going to be eating them through the day.
- **[05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJEAqOdnF2E&t=316s)** — I mean, just go on Amazon and type keto snacks.
- **[05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJEAqOdnF2E&t=320s)** — There's just everything from keto ice cream,
- **[05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJEAqOdnF2E&t=324s)** — the so-called protein shakes,
- **[05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJEAqOdnF2E&t=326s)** — there's chips, there's cookies.
- **[05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJEAqOdnF2E&t=328s)** — It just goes on and on and on.
- **[05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJEAqOdnF2E&t=330s)** — And if you read the label on this,
- **[05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJEAqOdnF2E&t=331s)** — they're filled with things like polydextrose
- **[05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJEAqOdnF2E&t=334s)** — and dextrose and all these new fibers
- **[05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJEAqOdnF2E&t=335s)** — that haven't been tested, tapioca, corn, fiber.
- **[05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJEAqOdnF2E&t=339s)** — And just because something says keto
- **[05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJEAqOdnF2E&t=341s)** — does not even make it keto.
- **[05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJEAqOdnF2E&t=342s)** — But the point is that you don't want to do these snacks.
- **[05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJEAqOdnF2E&t=346s)** — I can see using some of these as dessert occasionally,
- **[05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJEAqOdnF2E&t=349s)** — but I don't do a lot of these keto snacks.
- **[05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJEAqOdnF2E&t=351s)** — And that is a big reason why people are failing on keto
- **[05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJEAqOdnF2E&t=354s)** — because they're doing all this keto snacks
- **[05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJEAqOdnF2E&t=357s)** — and the ingredients are not even keto.
- **[06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJEAqOdnF2E&t=360s)** — Especially when you get into the Atkins type,
- **[06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJEAqOdnF2E&t=363s)** — so-called keto friendly foods,
- **[06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJEAqOdnF2E&t=364s)** — and then you have slim fast.
- **[06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJEAqOdnF2E&t=366s)** — But if you see ingredients like maltitol,
- **[06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJEAqOdnF2E&t=369s)** — I mean, that's just like almost the same as sugar.
- **[06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJEAqOdnF2E&t=371s)** — And I have found just by cutting out the keto snacks
- **[06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJEAqOdnF2E&t=373s)** — that people do very well, just eat real food.
- **[06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJEAqOdnF2E&t=376s)** — Don't make your meal a bar, like a keto bar,
- **[06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJEAqOdnF2E&t=381s)** — even if they're the correct macros,
- **[06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJEAqOdnF2E&t=382s)** — because it's just not real food.
- **[06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJEAqOdnF2E&t=384s)** — All right, number three, hidden carbohydrates.
- **[06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJEAqOdnF2E&t=388s)** — And a big one is this maltodextrin.
- **[06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJEAqOdnF2E&t=391s)** — It's even in your supplements.
- **[06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJEAqOdnF2E&t=392s)** — It's in the electrolyte powders.
- **[06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJEAqOdnF2E&t=394s)** — I've done a video on that.
- **[06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJEAqOdnF2E&t=395s)** — And I think another big thing is too many berries and fruit.
- **[06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJEAqOdnF2E&t=401s)** — I've had people say, well, fruit has fructose.
- **[06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJEAqOdnF2E&t=403s)** — Fruit has half fructose and half glucose.
- **[06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJEAqOdnF2E&t=407s)** — So yes, fructose is low in the glycemic index,
- **[06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJEAqOdnF2E&t=411s)** — but your liver is the only organ that can handle fructose
- **[06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJEAqOdnF2E&t=415s)** — and it is gonna create a major problem
- **[06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJEAqOdnF2E&t=416s)** — with insulin resistance.
- **[06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJEAqOdnF2E&t=418s)** — So even though it's low in the glycemic index,
- **[07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJEAqOdnF2E&t=421s)** — it's still a big problem.
- **[07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJEAqOdnF2E&t=423s)** — And out of all the things that are very high in fructose,
- **[07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJEAqOdnF2E&t=426s)** — a GAVA Nectar is right at the top.
- **[07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJEAqOdnF2E&t=428s)** — And if you look at GAVA Nectar in some products,
- **[07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJEAqOdnF2E&t=431s)** — it says, oh yeah, it's keto friendly
- **[07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJEAqOdnF2E&t=432s)** — because it's low in the glycemic index.
- **[07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJEAqOdnF2E&t=434s)** — Well, that's just like saying like,
- **[07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJEAqOdnF2E&t=436s)** — pizza is good because it has tomatoes.
- **[07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJEAqOdnF2E&t=438s)** — Well, it has other things as well.
- **[07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJEAqOdnF2E&t=440s)** — Now there's a really good Kindle book
- **[07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJEAqOdnF2E&t=443s)** — that I recently got.
- **[07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJEAqOdnF2E&t=444s)** — I didn't finish it.
- **[07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJEAqOdnF2E&t=445s)** — So I can't say that I agree with every single point yet,
- **[07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJEAqOdnF2E&t=449s)** — but it's called, Don't Eat For The Winter.
- **[07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJEAqOdnF2E&t=453s)** — And what I like about it, it's written by an engineer.
- **[07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJEAqOdnF2E&t=456s)** — Okay. And so engineers are good problem solvers.
- **[07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJEAqOdnF2E&t=458s)** — They think logically.
- **[07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJEAqOdnF2E&t=460s)** — And this book is so far really interesting
- **[07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJEAqOdnF2E&t=462s)** — because the author mentioned like an acorn,
- **[07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJEAqOdnF2E&t=465s)** — a squirrel would start to accumulate all these acorns,
- **[07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJEAqOdnF2E&t=468s)** — right? And they're gonna eat those through the winter.
- **[07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJEAqOdnF2E&t=471s)** — Now an acorn is like 53% fat,
- **[07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJEAqOdnF2E&t=474s)** — it's 41% carb and it's like 6% protein.
- **[07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJEAqOdnF2E&t=479s)** — A very similar profile to junk food.
- **[08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJEAqOdnF2E&t=483s)** — And when you combine that much carb with that much fat,
- **[08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJEAqOdnF2E&t=486s)** — well, you're gonna create a lot of storage of fat.
- **[08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJEAqOdnF2E&t=488s)** — And he also mentions another interesting point about,
- **[08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJEAqOdnF2E&t=491s)** — you know, when do we harvest fruits?
- **[08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJEAqOdnF2E&t=495s)** — Okay. Like apples, pears, peaches,
- **[08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJEAqOdnF2E&t=498s)** — all this fruit is mainly harvested in September,
- **[08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJEAqOdnF2E&t=502s)** — October, maybe early November.
- **[08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJEAqOdnF2E&t=506s)** — It's very unnatural to harvest fruit all year round.
- **[08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJEAqOdnF2E&t=510s)** — That fruit, which is higher in fructose,
- **[08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJEAqOdnF2E&t=512s)** — tends to act as a survival mechanism
- **[08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJEAqOdnF2E&t=513s)** — so you can survive through the winter.
- **[08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJEAqOdnF2E&t=515s)** — But of course we have fruit available
- **[08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJEAqOdnF2E&t=517s)** — every single day of the year.
- **[08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJEAqOdnF2E&t=519s)** — So you can very easily overdo the fruit,
- **[08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJEAqOdnF2E&t=521s)** — especially if you add it with fat.
- **[08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJEAqOdnF2E&t=523s)** — Our body and our genes have not evolved
- **[08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJEAqOdnF2E&t=525s)** — to handle that much fructose.
- **[08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJEAqOdnF2E&t=528s)** — So to summarize, number one,
- **[08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJEAqOdnF2E&t=530s)** — don't overdo it with the fat.
- **[08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJEAqOdnF2E&t=532s)** — Consume the fat that normally comes with protein.
- **[08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJEAqOdnF2E&t=534s)** — And also realize when you're drinking all this fat,
- **[08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJEAqOdnF2E&t=536s)** — it's not all being oxidized as fat burning.
- **[08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJEAqOdnF2E&t=539s)** — A lot of it can be stored as well.
- **[09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJEAqOdnF2E&t=540s)** — And as I'm thinking about this,
- **[09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJEAqOdnF2E&t=542s)** — there's actually a fourth one that I wanna bring up.
- **[09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJEAqOdnF2E&t=544s)** — I mentioned this in another video.
- **[09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJEAqOdnF2E&t=547s)** — Now, typically the ketogenic diet
- **[09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJEAqOdnF2E&t=549s)** — should be a moderate amount of protein,
- **[09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJEAqOdnF2E&t=551s)** — and it definitely should be bioavailable,
- **[09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJEAqOdnF2E&t=554s)** — complete protein.
- **[09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJEAqOdnF2E&t=555s)** — So if you're doing the ketogenic diet
- **[09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJEAqOdnF2E&t=558s)** — with plant-based protein
- **[09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJEAqOdnF2E&t=559s)** — or just not enough bioavailable protein,
- **[09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJEAqOdnF2E&t=563s)** — that's gonna tell the brain to keep eating.
- **[09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJEAqOdnF2E&t=566s)** — So out of all the macronutrients,
- **[09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJEAqOdnF2E&t=568s)** — carbs, protein, fat,
- **[09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJEAqOdnF2E&t=571s)** — protein is the most valuable to the body
- **[09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJEAqOdnF2E&t=573s)** — because we don't store it.
- **[09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJEAqOdnF2E&t=574s)** — And there's so many different functions
- **[09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJEAqOdnF2E&t=576s)** — that are dependent on this protein.
- **[09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJEAqOdnF2E&t=578s)** — So this really relates to when you start doing
- **[09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJEAqOdnF2E&t=581s)** — more intermittent fasting and prolonged fasting.
- **[09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJEAqOdnF2E&t=583s)** — If you're deficient in amino acids,
- **[09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJEAqOdnF2E&t=585s)** — going into a prolonged fast,
- **[09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJEAqOdnF2E&t=588s)** — you're just not gonna feel good.
- **[09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJEAqOdnF2E&t=589s)** — And so for some people that don't feel good,
- **[09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJEAqOdnF2E&t=592s)** — it wouldn't hurt to take a blend
- **[09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJEAqOdnF2E&t=594s)** — of complete amino acids just to fortify the body.
- **[09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJEAqOdnF2E&t=598s)** — Now, to get more information
- **[09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJEAqOdnF2E&t=599s)** — on the healthy version of the ketogenic diet,
- **[10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJEAqOdnF2E&t=603s)** — I put that video up right here.
- **[10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJEAqOdnF2E&t=605s)** — Check it out.

- **[00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lo77w0bP4Qs&t=0s)** — Today, we are going to show you how to go from a toxic, fatty, inflamed liver to a liver that is clean,
- **[00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lo77w0bP4Qs&t=8s)** — without fat, and without scar tissue. And I am actually going to give you 8 different recipes.
- **[00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lo77w0bP4Qs&t=13s)** — And these are very delicious, very easy to make. The liver reversing properties in these foods
- **[00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lo77w0bP4Qs&t=18s)** — heal your liver and create a vacuum to also get rid of the fat in your midsection as well.
- **[00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lo77w0bP4Qs&t=23s)** — And then the last thing I am going to show you is going to blow you away. It is a recipe to
- **[00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lo77w0bP4Qs&t=27s)** — make a very healthy soda that will take your liver to the next level. The liver is the hub of so many different organs.
- **[00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lo77w0bP4Qs&t=36s)** — Having a fatty liver doubles your risk of heart attacks. A dirty liver cannot detoxify anymore,
- **[00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lo77w0bP4Qs&t=42s)** — develops cirrhosis. And not having a liver work right can really mess up your hormones.
- **[00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lo77w0bP4Qs&t=46s)** — With all these smoothies I am going to show you, you are going to add one cup of water with one cup of ice.
- **[00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lo77w0bP4Qs&t=51s)** — Let's dive right in. The first recipe is simply going to combine two different ingredients.
- **[00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lo77w0bP4Qs&t=58s)** — One cup of spinach or just a small handful of spinach. The cool thing about spinach,
- **[01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lo77w0bP4Qs&t=62s)** — it will decrease your cravings because it really helps blood sugar. And it can also help you
- **[01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lo77w0bP4Qs&t=66s)** — remove fat in your abdomen. And then if we add that with kiwi, we are going to get a lot of vitamin C.
- **[01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lo77w0bP4Qs&t=72s)** — And depending on the size of the kiwi, you might want to add two or three kiwis.
- **[01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lo77w0bP4Qs&t=76s)** — Kiwi is one of those foods that has almost the most vitamin C of any food out there.
- **[01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lo77w0bP4Qs&t=80s)** — It also has certain properties to protect the liver against damage. Combining these both can enhance the repair of your liver.
- **[01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lo77w0bP4Qs&t=87s)** — You may also want to add a little squeeze of lemon or lime juice to this mixture.
- **[01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lo77w0bP4Qs&t=91s)** — Combine these ingredients, blend it and then drink up. In the next smoothie we are going to add spinach and grapefruit.
- **[01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lo77w0bP4Qs&t=97s)** — It has a unique property of increasing the sensitivity to the hormone insulin to help with blood sugar.
- **[01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lo77w0bP4Qs&t=104s)** — And remember this is a smoothie, we are not juicing anything. We are going to take all the fiber, blend that with spinach.
- **[01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lo77w0bP4Qs&t=109s)** — Add a little handful, which is like one cup, and then you are going to do one grapefruit.
- **[01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lo77w0bP4Qs&t=114s)** — The other cool thing about grapefruit is it increases bile flow from the liver.
- **[01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lo77w0bP4Qs&t=119s)** — And bile helps you break down fats, but a lot of the toxins from the liver go through the bile ducts as they come out into the small intestine.
- **[02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lo77w0bP4Qs&t=129s)** — And I also like to add either half of a lemon or some lime juice to this mixture as well. Go ahead and blend and drink away.
- **[02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lo77w0bP4Qs&t=135s)** — The next combination is kale with pomegranate. Kale is one of the cruciferous vegetables, so it has some additional properties to help with the detoxification of the liver.
- **[02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lo77w0bP4Qs&t=146s)** — It's a great anti-inflammatory for the liver. And then pomegranate has the potential to really drop that inflammation in the liver.
- **[02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lo77w0bP4Qs&t=154s)** — Remember, too much inflammation can develop scarring of the liver. We don't want that.
- **[02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lo77w0bP4Qs&t=157s)** — Pomegranate also prevents fat from accumulating in the liver itself.
- **[02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lo77w0bP4Qs&t=161s)** — If we combine both kale and pomegranate together, we stimulate one of the most powerful antioxidants in the body.
- **[02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lo77w0bP4Qs&t=169s)** — If you want, you can also add a tablespoon of flaxseed to this mixture as well.
- **[02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lo77w0bP4Qs&t=174s)** — The thing about flaxseed is it has a precursor to omega-3 fatty acid.
- **[02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lo77w0bP4Qs&t=179s)** — Anything that can increase more omega-3 fatty acids can help inflammation.
- **[03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lo77w0bP4Qs&t=184s)** — The next drink is really just a cup of sliced or chopped papaya in water. That's it.
- **[03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lo77w0bP4Qs&t=189s)** — And maybe some ice cubes. Papaya is interesting because it's loaded with enzymes.
- **[03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lo77w0bP4Qs&t=195s)** — It can really help digestion. And it's really good for fighting inflammation in the liver.
- **[03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lo77w0bP4Qs&t=201s)** — One thing you might want to add a pinch of Himalayan sea salt. That way we can add some electrolytes in there.
- **[03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lo77w0bP4Qs&t=206s)** — The next combination is combining one cup of chopped celery with one cup of blueberries.
- **[03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lo77w0bP4Qs&t=214s)** — Celery is one of my favorite vegetables. It's good to increase bile production.
- **[03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lo77w0bP4Qs&t=219s)** — It's great for reducing liver inflammation. And it's generally good to counter the toxicity from junk food.
- **[03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lo77w0bP4Qs&t=226s)** — Not that you ever eat junk food, but if you ever do, eat more celery.
- **[03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lo77w0bP4Qs&t=230s)** — With the blueberries, basically reduce fat on your liver.
- **[03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lo77w0bP4Qs&t=234s)** — And if you also have excessive iron overload, like a lot of people do as they age,
- **[03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lo77w0bP4Qs&t=239s)** — blueberries have the polyphenol chemicals to help bind with iron and remove it from the body.
- **[04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lo77w0bP4Qs&t=244s)** — If you were brave enough to add maybe a teaspoon of apple cider vinegar to this mixture,
- **[04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lo77w0bP4Qs&t=248s)** — you would greatly enhance the effectiveness as well as increase more bile flow through this area.
- **[04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lo77w0bP4Qs&t=253s)** — When the bile backs up into the liver, you get right shoulder pain through here.
- **[04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lo77w0bP4Qs&t=259s)** — And it could radiate up to this side right through here or in the back part right here.
- **[04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lo77w0bP4Qs&t=263s)** — This is a great smoothie to help the liver and help keep things flowing.
- **[04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lo77w0bP4Qs&t=267s)** — The next one we're going to talk about is cucumber and lemon.
- **[04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lo77w0bP4Qs&t=270s)** — A cup of each. Chop these things up and then blend them and then drink away.
- **[04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lo77w0bP4Qs&t=274s)** — The thing about cucumber is it's super hydrating. It has great electrolytes.
- **[04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lo77w0bP4Qs&t=278s)** — It's great to increase the liver's ability to detoxify.
- **[04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lo77w0bP4Qs&t=283s)** — And there's also a study I read that shows that it can help prevent the non-alcoholic fatty liver disease.
- **[04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lo77w0bP4Qs&t=289s)** — Adding the lemon can also increase the detoxification of the liver.
- **[04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lo77w0bP4Qs&t=294s)** — Melons in general are really good to pull edema from your legs or your feet because they're a natural diuretic.
- **[05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lo77w0bP4Qs&t=301s)** — And then you can add a slice of ginger to that and make it a really tasty little shake.
- **[05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lo77w0bP4Qs&t=305s)** — Then we get to the next one. Avocado with strawberries.
- **[05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lo77w0bP4Qs&t=309s)** — I recommend doing a cup of each with a glass of water and some ice cubes. Blend it down.
- **[05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lo77w0bP4Qs&t=314s)** — Alright, what's in the avocado? One of the most powerful antioxidants and they have reparative properties for the liver.
- **[05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lo77w0bP4Qs&t=320s)** — Strawberries are great to increase overall liver function. They can help increase the metabolism.
- **[05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lo77w0bP4Qs&t=325s)** — They can help remove some of the fat from the liver.
- **[05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lo77w0bP4Qs&t=327s)** — There's a common theme here because we're talking about fruits and vegetables.
- **[05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lo77w0bP4Qs&t=330s)** — All are very powerful antioxidants that support the liver.
- **[05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lo77w0bP4Qs&t=334s)** — And the problem a lot of times with the liver is we're eating foods without those antioxidants like refined foods.
- **[05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lo77w0bP4Qs&t=341s)** — And even if someone is a diabetic or they have a chronic condition and they have a lot of inflammation,
- **[05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lo77w0bP4Qs&t=346s)** — if they also at the same time consume foods high in antioxidants, at least they would have a lot less side effects.
- **[05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lo77w0bP4Qs&t=353s)** — This is just another important reason why I think people need to conclude these in their diet.
- **[05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lo77w0bP4Qs&t=357s)** — The last smoothie is going to combine coconut with papaya. This is a really delicious smoothie.
- **[06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lo77w0bP4Qs&t=364s)** — Now coconut has loric acid and that's really good as an antiviral. It's good for the immune system.
- **[06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lo77w0bP4Qs&t=370s)** — Coconut is loaded with what's called MCT fat. These fats turn into ketones.
- **[06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lo77w0bP4Qs&t=376s)** — And ketones are great for the liver because they're a low stress fat for the liver.
- **[06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lo77w0bP4Qs&t=380s)** — If we combine that with papaya, which has a lot of enzymes and antioxidants,
- **[06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lo77w0bP4Qs&t=385s)** — we're going to really drop the inflammation and the scarring that's happening in the liver.
- **[06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lo77w0bP4Qs&t=389s)** — What you might want to do is add a little sprinkle of cinnamon to the mix to take things even further,
- **[06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lo77w0bP4Qs&t=394s)** — especially for the blood sugar. I've given you a lot of different options for smoothies,
- **[06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lo77w0bP4Qs&t=398s)** — but now I want to show you something very, very cool.
- **[06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lo77w0bP4Qs&t=401s)** — This recipe that I'm going to share with you came from Dr. William Davis.
- **[06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lo77w0bP4Qs&t=405s)** — He's the author of Supergut and also Wheat Belly. And he shared this with me in one of his emails.
- **[06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lo77w0bP4Qs&t=411s)** — And I want to share it with you. You're going to love this. It's like a probiotic.
- **[06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lo77w0bP4Qs&t=415s)** — And you're going to combine that with fruit juice. Any fruit juice.
- **[06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lo77w0bP4Qs&t=419s)** — Orange, apple, grapefruit, pomegranate, cranberry.
- **[07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lo77w0bP4Qs&t=426s)** — And what's going to happen is this microbe, it's actually a friendly fungus,
- **[07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lo77w0bP4Qs&t=432s)** — is going to ferment and eat up the sugar in this juice over a period of 72 hours.
- **[07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lo77w0bP4Qs&t=441s)** — And you're going to leave it out of the fridge right on the counter with maybe some cheesecloth over it.
- **[07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lo77w0bP4Qs&t=446s)** — And if you don't have a cheesecloth, you can basically get a paper towel and put a rubber band around it.
- **[07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lo77w0bP4Qs&t=452s)** — Because within 24 hours, you're going to get a lot of CO2 production.
- **[07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lo77w0bP4Qs&t=457s)** — And if you close a lid on this thing, it's going to explode with all the pressure in there. So don't do that.
- **[07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lo77w0bP4Qs&t=463s)** — You just take any amount of juice you want. You can just take a 16 ounce, you can take a 12 ounce,
- **[07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lo77w0bP4Qs&t=468s)** — and you'll take one of these capsules.
- **[07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lo77w0bP4Qs&t=470s)** — Now, the type of fungus or probiotic that you're going to need, you can get from Walmart or even the drugstore.
- **[07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lo77w0bP4Qs&t=478s)** — It's this probiotic right here. It's called Florestor. And there's a very specific strain in here.
- **[08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lo77w0bP4Qs&t=487s)** — CNCM1-745. And it loves sugar. In fact, after 72 hours, it's not even going to taste that sweet.
- **[08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lo77w0bP4Qs&t=493s)** — It's going to be this delicious, carbonated, slightly flavored drink like a soda. And then you put it in the fridge.
- **[08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lo77w0bP4Qs&t=502s)** — You're going to love it. It's delicious. And it's really good for you as well. It helps the gut.
- **[08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lo77w0bP4Qs&t=506s)** — It can also help counter diarrhea and even suppress small intestinal bacterial overgrowth.
- **[08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lo77w0bP4Qs&t=513s)** — You're just going to take one capsule from this, open it up, the contents of one capsule, and then just mix it up.
- **[08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lo77w0bP4Qs&t=519s)** — Cover it up with that paper towel or a cheesecloth with a little rubber band and put it on your kitchen counter.
- **[08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lo77w0bP4Qs&t=526s)** — And put your timer to 72 hours. Come back and drink it and you're going to be shocked.
- **[08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lo77w0bP4Qs&t=531s)** — We talked about the foods for the liver, but we didn't talk about the entire diet that you should be on.
- **[08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lo77w0bP4Qs&t=537s)** — If you want that information, you should watch this video right here. Check it out.

- **[00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEeYVUaL170&t=0s)** — Let's talk about various strategies that you can do to stop overeating, or should we say stop eating like a pig, like this.
- **[00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEeYVUaL170&t=19s)** — So there's just a few problems with overeating. Of course, you have overeating of the wrong foods and overeating of just healthy foods, right?
- **[00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEeYVUaL170&t=28s)** — Which then can create a big strain on your digestive system. Being satisfied is a very subjective thing. And it's difficult because sometimes the food that they're eating is not satisfying them for certain reasons.
- **[00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEeYVUaL170&t=42s)** — And we're going to talk about that. So what is the right amount to eat so you don't overdo it? That's the big question. Now in Okinawa, they have a very good principle that they follow.
- **[00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEeYVUaL170&t=54s)** — Of course, we're talking about the traditional people, probably not the current people that are kind of more modern. But traditionally, they eat until they're about 80% full. I think that gives us some nice leeway there.
- **[01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEeYVUaL170&t=67s)** — And I like that principle if you can do it. So ultimately, the best thing you can do for this problem is to not have an appetite and not have any cravings, right? If you can do that, then everything's going to be easier.
- **[01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEeYVUaL170&t=82s)** — And of course, the way to do that is to get on the healthy version of keto, okay, where you're doing high quality, nutrient dense foods that's satisfying you on one end. And then also you're doing low carbs, which will greatly reduce the hunger in between eating.
- **[01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEeYVUaL170&t=97s)** — And also when you're doing intermittent fasting, your stomach does change because you're not eating so frequently. And the amount of food that you eat is going to be less because you can't just fit all that food in there like you did before, especially if you're doing things like eating one meal a day.
- **[01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEeYVUaL170&t=112s)** — You're just not going to be able to cram that much food. It's going to be uncomfortable. It's going to be painful. And so you're not going to keep doing it. Typically, when you're craving certain foods, that could just be a low blood sugar situation where you're trying to
- **[02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEeYVUaL170&t=127s)** — maintain this level of glucose or the storage of glucose in your liver called glycogen. And so you have to constantly eat something more on the carbohydrate side. But you also have people that crave bread could mean that they might need more B vitamins.
- **[02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEeYVUaL170&t=139s)** — People that crave just sugar, it could potentially mean that they need more potassium, possibly, probably not. But it could be or if you crave chocolate, that could mean that you need more magnesium. And of course, if you're craving dirt, that classically means that you need more iron.
- **[02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEeYVUaL170&t=156s)** — Or even if you crave dairy, it could mean that you need more calcium. I intuitively can just know what to eat. If I go to a grocery store, okay, or on a given day before I eat, I can pretty much know what my body needs more of. And because I'm in keto, and for some reason, I can just gravitate to certain foods more than other foods, like I'll need a lot more celery. Other times I'll need more protein.
- **[03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEeYVUaL170&t=185s)** — So you do want to get to a point where you're really in tune with your own body. But the worst question you can ever ask is, hmm, what is my body in the mood for today? Popcorn, pizza, chips, cookies? Don't ever ask that question. Okay. A better question would be what can I eat? That's truly going to make my body healthier. But of course, you really have to be keto adapted, or fat adapted to ask the question. Or you just kind of eat it.
- **[03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEeYVUaL170&t=215s)** — I'm constantly running into this low energy, low sugar, blood sugar situation. There is actually, and I've learned this just recently, there are certain genes that you can have an issue with that can cause you to have more of a sweet tooth. And that can cause you to not be able to stop eating certain things when you start eating certain things. And that is one of my problems. If I start eating sugar, I can't stop. I will just eat massive amounts.
- **[04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEeYVUaL170&t=245s)** — The same thing with carbohydrates. So I just don't start. But I think the worst factor to this topic is restaurants, especially the all you can eat buffets, right? Where you really want to get your money's worth and you keep going back and back. And it's like, why do we have to stuff our body with that much food? It's just insane. There are certain foods, especially in America, that give you much larger portions than you really need. Okay. Huge steaks, like 12
- **[04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEeYVUaL170&t=275s)** — ounce steaks. Do you really need to eat that much protein? And then of course the pasta. And then of course the dessert, right? I have found in Europe, their serving sizes are much less. There are certain restaurants that will have these small portions, but it will be many of those. So in one restaurant, and I'm not kidding, they gave us 11 of these, these plates. Okay, it was small. But after the seventh meal, I was just holding
- **[05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEeYVUaL170&t=305s)** — it, hoping it was going to be done because it was not pleasurable. It was just sampling after sampling after sampling. So I think one really good tip is just to really determine how much food you're going to eat. And then the next day you end up with a blood trigger problems because you raise your insulin up. Okay. And now you're craving the wrong thing. And then you also have the factor that you must eat everything on your plate because people are starving in other places of the world. And we just have to just finish our plate.
- **[05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEeYVUaL170&t=333s)** — And so if that's the case, just keep your portions on the smaller side. So there are hormones that increase your appetite, make you hungry, and there's hormones that make you full. Okay. We're satisfied. And the hormones that make you hungry. We'll talk about that first, include ghrelin, insulin, and cortisol, the stress hormone. So ghrelin, that hunger hormone is triggered by various things. One would be the lack of sleep, right?
- **[06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEeYVUaL170&t=363s)** — I know with myself, if I don't get enough sleep, I definitely have more of an appetite. Stress is another factor. When you're under stress, you're going to crave more food. And also when you eat refined carbohydrates, that's going to tend to lack those factors that are supposed to satisfy you. And eating refined carbohydrates can also stimulate that hormone. But when someone's actually stressed, they're really not in the present. And especially if they're in a social environment,
- **[06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEeYVUaL170&t=393s)** — where they'll just do things that they don't normally do because you're not really in the present, they get into this certain mode and they just start eating and they really don't differentiate what they're eating. And then next thing you know, you just are completely off your plan. Now with insulin, of course, that is another hormone that stimulates hunger. Doesn't matter what you're eating. Well, spike insulin, which will make you more hungry about an hour and a half later, especially if you're doing those snacks. Okay. Of course, carbohydrates and also larger amounts of
- **[07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEeYVUaL170&t=422s)** — protein and MSG can also increase insulin and trigger hunger. And of course there's cortisol. And if you're more stressed, you're going to eat more of certain things and the wrong things. And also it's interesting. People that are on a diet, they tend to get off sugar, but sometimes we'll have artificial sweeteners. Well, artificial sweeteners can also stimulate hunger, which is interesting because it can potentially stimulate insulin. Now other things that can stimulate appetite, a lack of bile.
- **[07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEeYVUaL170&t=452s)** — And your gallbladder. Let's say, for example, you have gallstones, which means you're lacking bile, that thing that helps you dissolve fat and extract fat soluble vitamins from your meal. Let's say you had the gallbladder removed. Okay.
- **[07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEeYVUaL170&t=465s)** — Chances are you're going to be lacking bile or any type of problem with the liver or tightness underneath the right rib cage and pain that goes on the right side.
- **[07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEeYVUaL170&t=474s)** — All those are subtle indicators that you are deficient in bile. And so if you're not absorbing certain fats, that can keep you from being satisfied. You will feel full, but you won't be satisfied.
- **[08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEeYVUaL170&t=490s)** — So that will trigger to eat more. And by the way, the way to handle that is just to take bile salts after the meal. Take one and that will help.
- **[08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEeYVUaL170&t=499s)** — Being on a low fat diet can definitely keep your hunger up. Fat is very satisfying. I do recommend being on the ketogenic diet to eat more fat, especially after the meal.
- **[08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEeYVUaL170&t=511s)** — Okay. And then that way you can fast longer and that can help you. Now junk food. Okay. Especially these refined carbohydrates at any grocery store. You'll have all these flavored chips, which are loaded with chemicals, incredible flavors and spices, but no real nutrients behind it.
- **[08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEeYVUaL170&t=533s)** — And you'll just keep tasting these and you'll just keep, oh boy, these are delicious, but there's no satisfaction. So you can eat the whole thing. Of course, manufacturing companies do this on purpose. So you know that. But if I buy a bag of Doritos, I cannot just have one.
- **[09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEeYVUaL170&t=550s)** — Right. I'll eat the whole darn thing. And then I'll want another one and another one. So you just have to avoid those areas on the grocery store or at some other place that they would sell them.
- **[09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEeYVUaL170&t=559s)** — Another reason why people will overeat is to get energy because they're tired. They will satisfy this tired feeling. They tend to reach for more food to replace this fatigue to hopefully get more energy. Okay.
- **[09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEeYVUaL170&t=574s)** — So that's another reason why people will eat certain foods. Of course, that food that they just ate or overate, they're going to be tired shortly after that.
- **[09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEeYVUaL170&t=581s)** — You also have people eating out of boredom. Boy, that's a, it's a big one. You know, you're sitting around the house and you just are bored. So you eat. You really don't have any reason. You're not hungry. You just like to chew on chips.
- **[09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEeYVUaL170&t=596s)** — Not necessarily celery, but something crunchy like nuts, like pistachio or something like that. Now if someone's pregnant and they're craving certain things, hopefully they're on the ketogenic diet. That could definitely mean that the baby needs certain things.
- **[10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEeYVUaL170&t=612s)** — So just make sure you have something nutrient dense. And also then some people will eat because they're in pain as some way to actually get them out of pain. Right. So there's a lot of reasons why people will eat.
- **[10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEeYVUaL170&t=623s)** — Now let's talk about the other hormone called leptin that is supposed to satisfy you. So if leptin is too low, okay, you can also be hungry. And people that are overweight, people that have insulin resistance, people that have metabolic syndrome, people that have diabetes have low levels of leptin.
- **[10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEeYVUaL170&t=645s)** — Okay, so they're going to be hungrier versus all of those people that I just mentioned are going to have higher amounts of insulin. So hormonally, things are against them. And it's going to be more difficult. If you don't have enough of that leptin, you're not going to be satisfied too well.
- **[11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEeYVUaL170&t=662s)** — So let's talk about those things that can increase leptin other than losing weight, fixing your insulin resistance, and getting rid of your diabetes.
- **[11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEeYVUaL170&t=670s)** — A good night's rest can help you raise your leptin. Lowering stress can help you. Routine regular exercise or physical activity can help increase leptin. Adding more fiber can help you increase leptin. And I'm not talking about these functional food fibers, these new ones. I'm talking about the actual vegetables.
- **[11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEeYVUaL170&t=693s)** — Another thing that can increase leptin is fasting, right? Now at first when you do fasting, you're going to be hungry, but then your body is going to convert over, you're going to burn fat. And so now you're doing intermittent fasting and now your appetite goes away, and your leptin can start to reverse and start to be increased.
- **[11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEeYVUaL170&t=709s)** — Okay. And this is the best indicator to know that you're burning fat, okay, that you're in ketosis is that you lose the appetite. And of course, if you lose the appetite, your leptin is going to be higher.
- **[12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEeYVUaL170&t=722s)** — Omega 3 fatty acids can help increase leptin. Green tea can help increase leptin. Probiotics and fermented foods, but the microbial density can help increase leptin and make you more satisfied. Just nutrient dense foods in general can make you more satisfied.
- **[12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEeYVUaL170&t=744s)** — Now, the research on this is sketchy, but I know for a fact, I live in a farm, when I consume the eggs for my chickens, boy, I am satisfied compared to other eggs when I consume the meat from my own farm. Super satisfying. So what's causing that? Is it the fat? Is it the protein? Is it the carbs?
- **[12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEeYVUaL170&t=767s)** — No, it's the nutrients. It's nutrient dense. So most people, Americans especially, are just eating empty calories. And that is going to keep them eating over and over and just make them always hungry, which is terrible if you're trying to do any type of diet or trying to achieve any type of health goal.
- **[13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEeYVUaL170&t=786s)** — So to get out of this pattern of overeating, you want to get on the healthy version of keto and definitely do intermittent fasting. I also recommend that you eat your vegetables first. Okay. And that way, at least you can get a lot of really low calorie fiber and nutrients first. And that's going to help definitely just with feeling full as you eat the next meal versus the protein, which tends not to turn off that hunger as much.
- **[13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEeYVUaL170&t=813s)** — So eat your vegetables first. Also before you eat, determine what you're going to eat and how much you're going to eat. And then that way you can control what you eat. And we're talking about moderate amounts of protein between three, four, five, six, maybe seven ounces of protein. If you're going to do salad, that's seven to 10 cups. But of course, if you're doing two meals, right, you would cut that in half. It's doable. And then of course, the fat that comes with that protein. Now, I also add extra fat, like whether it's going to be pecans or macadamia nuts, or maybe even
- **[14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEeYVUaL170&t=843s)** — avocado, olive oil, maybe a keto dessert, I'll add more butter to the meal. The other thing to do to kind of keep you conscious and in the moment, okay, is to chew your food longer, right? So many people I've watched them eat and they just like inhale the food. And it's like there's a race to chew your food thoroughly before you eat. Okay, that'll help your digestion. And then I think the restaurants are a bit dangerous. If you don't go to the right restaurant,
- **[14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEeYVUaL170&t=873s)** — don't go to all you can eat buffets. Make sure that you kind of stay in control of your meal at a restaurant. You know, they bring you all these, these breads and hors d'oeuvres. So just be really conscious of what you're putting in your mouth and the size of those foods at the restaurants, especially if you're doing them frequently. So this topic was all about not overeating. But I think it's very important to know what to eat, okay? What meal would be the healthiest meal? And I put

- **[00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evxMkIHpRcI&t=0s)** — If you want any chance of burning off belly fat, you need to watch this entire video.
- **[00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evxMkIHpRcI&t=4s)** — I'm going to explain six foods that will directly prevent you from ever losing your belly fat.
- **[00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evxMkIHpRcI&t=8s)** — I'm talking about a type of fat called visceral fat. That is a fat around the organs, keeps your
- **[00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evxMkIHpRcI&t=14s)** — body in a state of inflammation. And when your own fat is inflamed because you have visceral fat,
- **[00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evxMkIHpRcI&t=18s)** — that alone keeps you from burning it. Let's start with the first food. And it's this right here.
- **[00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evxMkIHpRcI&t=24s)** — Low-fat yogurt, 27 grams of carbohydrate. There's only 19 grams of sugar, but there's an additional
- **[00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evxMkIHpRcI&t=31s)** — 8 grams of hidden sugar as starch. But they don't really tell you. You have to read and
- **[00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evxMkIHpRcI&t=37s)** — understand the label because the first ingredient is low-fat milk. The second is sugar, water,
- **[00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evxMkIHpRcI&t=42s)** — and then the next one is modified food starch. That is hidden sugar. This is what it is right
- **[00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evxMkIHpRcI&t=48s)** — here. It's a powder. And let me tell you about industrial starch. It's not just modified
- **[00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evxMkIHpRcI&t=52s)** — food starch. It's modified cornstarch, maltodextrin, and many other types of starch.
- **[00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evxMkIHpRcI&t=58s)** — The reason why it's worse than sugar is that it's not really sweet. So people are consuming a
- **[01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evxMkIHpRcI&t=63s)** — lot more of it than actual sugar. If you look at the glycemic index, it turns into glucose
- **[01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evxMkIHpRcI&t=68s)** — a lot faster than table sugar turns into glucose. So even though it's not classified
- **[01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evxMkIHpRcI&t=73s)** — as a sugar, it acts like a sugar, but worse than sugars. This is creating this constant
- **[01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evxMkIHpRcI&t=77s)** — elevation of blood sugar, which is going to burn out your pancreas a lot faster. This is
- **[01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evxMkIHpRcI&t=82s)** — leading to more diabetes. What's really wild is the purpose of the starch in food is just to act
- **[01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evxMkIHpRcI&t=88s)** — as a filler. It's something to add bulk in a product. Industrial starch goes through high
- **[01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evxMkIHpRcI&t=94s)** — heats, chemical processing, deodorizers. They take out the color with different chemicals. So
- **[01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evxMkIHpRcI&t=99s)** — you're ending up with this like completely dead product that then has to be flavored,
- **[01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evxMkIHpRcI&t=104s)** — colored. And if we look at the bottom of the label, it'll say made with bioengineered food
- **[01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evxMkIHpRcI&t=110s)** — ingredients. That is another word for GMO, genetically modified ingredients, creating this
- **[01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evxMkIHpRcI&t=116s)** — appearance of very healthy, but it's not very healthy. Next food item we're going to talk about
- **[02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evxMkIHpRcI&t=121s)** — is processed meat. Processed meat is very different than grass-fed beef. We're going to
- **[02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evxMkIHpRcI&t=126s)** — take a look at this chicken hot dogs with pork added. The first ingredient is called
- **[02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evxMkIHpRcI&t=132s)** — mechanically separated chicken. What the hell is mechanically separated chicken? That is a
- **[02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evxMkIHpRcI&t=140s)** — one. Okay, what I am objecting to, the corn syrup is actually made from the corn starch. This is an
- **[02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evxMkIHpRcI&t=147s)** — industrial sugar that will really spike your blood sugar. It's not healthy. When you add
- **[02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evxMkIHpRcI&t=152s)** — sugar to meat, what you're going to get is something called advanced glycated proteins.
- **[02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evxMkIHpRcI&t=157s)** — They're not very healthy. They have to use high heats. They use ammonia, sometimes chlorine
- **[02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evxMkIHpRcI&t=162s)** — to kill the bacteria. This is the stuff that they put in the chicken nuggets and a lot of
- **[02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evxMkIHpRcI&t=167s)** — other breaded chicken meats. Of course, they also added the modified cornstarch in here as well.
- **[02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evxMkIHpRcI&t=173s)** — You don't want to buy a hot dog that has that much starch and sugar. A much better hot dog
- **[02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evxMkIHpRcI&t=179s)** — would be something like this. Let's take a look at these ingredients. Organic grass-fed beef.
- **[03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evxMkIHpRcI&t=185s)** — Then we get sea salt, organic vinegar, baking soda, organic garlic, organic spices. Take a
- **[03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evxMkIHpRcI&t=200s)** — look at the ingredients. The next one we're going to get to is my favorite, the Atkins products.
- **[03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evxMkIHpRcI&t=204s)** — This gives you a perception that, wow, it's keto friendly. It's low carb. One gram of sugar.
- **[03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evxMkIHpRcI&t=210s)** — You're automatically thinking, man, this is great. Until you read the ingredients,
- **[03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evxMkIHpRcI&t=214s)** — milk protein concentrate, and then the soy protein isolate, these are very low quality
- **[03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evxMkIHpRcI&t=219s)** — proteins. The cheapest proteins you can possibly imagine. The very bottom contains bio-engineered
- **[03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evxMkIHpRcI&t=226s)** — food ingredients. It's not truly nutrient dense. It doesn't come from any real food. It's a
- **[03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evxMkIHpRcI&t=233s)** — highly processed... If Dr. Atkins ever knew that this company would end up like this, he'd probably
- **[03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evxMkIHpRcI&t=238s)** — be very upset. I know I would be upset if someone started to market this under my name.
- **[04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evxMkIHpRcI&t=244s)** — But typically, when you consume these so-called keto friendly foods, they add a lot of fiber
- **[04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evxMkIHpRcI&t=249s)** — in there. It's usually industrial fiber, synthetic fibers. You're going to get a lot of
- **[04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evxMkIHpRcI&t=254s)** — diarrhea. Over time, we're going to find out that that's going to really affect our weight.
- **[04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evxMkIHpRcI&t=258s)** — Just like artificial sweeteners have been found to create more problems with our gut,
- **[04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evxMkIHpRcI&t=263s)** — converting into things that then lead to insulin resistance and more weight gain problems. The
- **[04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evxMkIHpRcI&t=267s)** — next food we're going to talk about is juice. First thing you see is 100% vitamin C. You're
- **[04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evxMkIHpRcI&t=271s)** — like, wow, healthy. But when you read the ingredients, this only contains 5% actual juice.
- **[04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evxMkIHpRcI&t=278s)** — Let's see what the ingredients are. Oh, wow. Water in high fructose corn syrup. This is
- **[04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evxMkIHpRcI&t=284s)** — liquid candy. I think this is false advertising. They shouldn't be able to put that on there.
- **[04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evxMkIHpRcI&t=288s)** — Now, the other thing that's interesting about this is they'll have a concentrated orange juice.
- **[04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evxMkIHpRcI&t=293s)** — That means that that juice could be sitting up to a year and a vat, losing all of the
- **[04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evxMkIHpRcI&t=298s)** — nutrition. Then we take it out and then we add water to turn it into something not very
- **[05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evxMkIHpRcI&t=304s)** — nutrient dense. If we're talking about actual juice, like orange juice, that usually has
- **[05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evxMkIHpRcI&t=308s)** — more sugar than soda. That's a lot of fructose. Fructose cannot be broken down by all of your
- **[05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evxMkIHpRcI&t=314s)** — cells. Only your liver can process that fructose. What happens because of that is
- **[05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evxMkIHpRcI&t=318s)** — your liver starts generating a lot more fat. It creates more of a fatty liver than actual
- **[05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evxMkIHpRcI&t=324s)** — glucose. Because with glucose, at least all your cells can metabolize it. But with
- **[05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evxMkIHpRcI&t=328s)** — fructose, only the liver can break it down. The next product I want to talk about is agave
- **[05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evxMkIHpRcI&t=333s)** — It's something like between 15 and 30 on the glycemic index. Now, how can that be? It's a
- **[05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evxMkIHpRcI&t=340s)** — sweetener. It tastes just like sugar syrup. Well, that's because 80 to 90 percent of it is
- **[05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evxMkIHpRcI&t=346s)** — fructose. Only a very tiny bit of it is glucose. You don't want to consume things that
- **[05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evxMkIHpRcI&t=351s)** — are very high in fructose. That's going to really mess with your liver. Coconut sweetener
- **[05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evxMkIHpRcI&t=355s)** — would be better. And also honey is better if it's raw. But if you're trying to lose weight,
- **[05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evxMkIHpRcI&t=359s)** — probably not a good idea because anytime you consume sugar and starch, you're going to spike
- **[06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evxMkIHpRcI&t=365s)** — the glycemic index and that's going to bump you out of ketosis. One little side point about
- **[06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evxMkIHpRcI&t=370s)** — insulin. I think it'd be super valuable for all these doctors to do periodic screenings of
- **[06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evxMkIHpRcI&t=377s)** — testing your insulin because your insulin will go high about 15 years before your blood sugars
- **[06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evxMkIHpRcI&t=384s)** — start elevating. But we don't do that. Doctors don't test insulin. It's going to be left hidden
- **[06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evxMkIHpRcI&t=389s)** — to the point where eventually your blood sugars will rise and then you have diabetes and it's
- **[06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evxMkIHpRcI&t=393s)** — been brewing in the oven for 15 years. And well, now we've got to put you on medication.
- **[06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evxMkIHpRcI&t=397s)** — Lastly, I'm going to get into mayonnaise, which basically is mostly soy oil processed
- **[06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evxMkIHpRcI&t=403s)** — through industrial heats, hexane chemicals. You're getting a lot of extra things that
- **[06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evxMkIHpRcI&t=408s)** — you don't really want. This type of fat goes into your fat cells and it doesn't get
- **[06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evxMkIHpRcI&t=413s)** — like saturated fat. It stays in your fat cells longer. And so when you consume this and you're
- **[06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evxMkIHpRcI&t=419s)** — just storing this in the fat cell, I think this is behind a lot of chronic disease and
- **[07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evxMkIHpRcI&t=425s)** — time is going to prove that especially since they call these oils heart healthy. And that's
- **[07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evxMkIHpRcI&t=431s)** — going to be a class action suit waiting to happen. Now, you know, at least six foods and
- **[07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evxMkIHpRcI&t=435s)** — the ingredients in those foods to stay away from. If you really want to lose your belly fat,
- **[07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evxMkIHpRcI&t=440s)** — we're good.

- **[00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=neabI31ofMc&t=0s)** — Today I'm going to show you all the things that can help suppress your appetite.
- **[00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=neabI31ofMc&t=4s)** — And this is backed up by science. You ever wonder how some people can just go through the entire day
- **[00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=neabI31ofMc&t=8s)** — and be in front of food and totally resist it. Yet other people think about certain things they shouldn't be eating.
- **[00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=neabI31ofMc&t=15s)** — Sometimes they might think that this is a lack of willpower or they're just a professional procrastinator.
- **[00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=neabI31ofMc&t=20s)** — That is absolutely not true. What they're really lacking is the knowledge I'm going to share with you today.
- **[00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=neabI31ofMc&t=25s)** — At the end of this presentation you're going to be a lot more in control of what to eat or what to do to suppress your appetite,
- **[00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=neabI31ofMc&t=33s)** — which directly increases your control over food. So you can lose weight, look good, feel good about yourself, and have a good willpower.
- **[00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=neabI31ofMc&t=42s)** — Hunger and appetite don't start with your stomach. Sometimes it starts with your microbes, your gut bacteria that manipulate your brain.
- **[00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=neabI31ofMc&t=51s)** — There's some wild and bizarre information how gut microbes can actually cause you to eat the wrong thing.
- **[00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=neabI31ofMc&t=56s)** — Today I'm going to help you defeat these temptations. Sugar, refined carbs, foods with MSG, monosodium glutamate, alcohol, ultra-processed foods, aka junk foods.
- **[01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=neabI31ofMc&t=65s)** — Let's go through these foods starting with coffee. Coffee stimulates something that actually helps you feel like you're full.
- **[01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=neabI31ofMc&t=73s)** — Decaf coffee can do the exact same thing. Just make sure you do an organic decaf coffee if you're going to do that.
- **[01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=neabI31ofMc&t=79s)** — Avocado is a really good thing to satisfy you. Not just because it's fatty, but there are certain natural chemicals in avocado that help satisfy you, reduce hunger.
- **[01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=neabI31ofMc&t=88s)** — I know with me, when I consume guacamole, it really fills me up really fast. Plus it has certain fiber that can feed your bacteria.
- **[01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=neabI31ofMc&t=96s)** — And fiber in anything slows down the spike of blood sugar. It will prevent you from having a low blood sugar situation, which will increase appetite.
- **[01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=neabI31ofMc&t=105s)** — Dark chocolate. There's a certain chemical that's very bitter that suppresses appetite.
- **[01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=neabI31ofMc&t=109s)** — Realize when they go up with the percentage, it's actually going to be less and less sugar. So if you can find something like 95% or even 90%, you're going to be good to go because the amount of sugar in there is very, very tiny.
- **[02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=neabI31ofMc&t=121s)** — There's a lot of magnesium in chocolate as well. Cayenne pepper is another thing you should be adding to your food.
- **[02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=neabI31ofMc&t=128s)** — In certain studies, just the smell of it alone will decrease hunger, which is pretty wild.
- **[02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=neabI31ofMc&t=132s)** — Apple cider vinegar is the next one on the list. If you add that tablespoon in a glass of water, it's going to help stabilize your blood sugar.
- **[02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=neabI31ofMc&t=140s)** — Even if you actually raise your blood sugar, apple cider vinegar will help stabilize them so your blood sugar will not come down too low.
- **[02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=neabI31ofMc&t=148s)** — One of the reasons why this works is your body can actually use the acid in apple cider vinegar as fuel.
- **[02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=neabI31ofMc&t=154s)** — There's a certain chemical in green tea. E, G, C, G. Super effective of suppressing appetite.
- **[02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=neabI31ofMc&t=163s)** — Bone broth is the next thing on the list. Drinking bone broth actually creates a very similar effect to being satisfied after eating something more savory like meat.
- **[02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=neabI31ofMc&t=173s)** — It has a lot of nutrients. You should try that sometime and you'll see.
- **[02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=neabI31ofMc&t=176s)** — Next one is just a protein rich meal like eggs or even red meat. Because out of all the things you can eat like carbs, fats, especially if you have a high quality protein like eggs or red meat.
- **[03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=neabI31ofMc&t=189s)** — Because not only are there high quality amino acids, but you have a lot of other nutrition in the meat that can satisfy your brain and give your body what it really needs when it's hungry.
- **[03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=neabI31ofMc&t=199s)** — The next one on the list is adding ginger to your foods. It has the ability to stimulate digestive juices which allow you to extract more nutrients from the food that you eat.
- **[03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=neabI31ofMc&t=207s)** — Next one is dark leafy green vegetables or lettuce. And then the olive oil is a fat. That's very satisfying but it will also help extract some of the fat soluble nutrients from those greens which are certain nutrients that go beyond just vitamins and minerals.
- **[03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=neabI31ofMc&t=222s)** — Next on the list is MCT oil. You can get these from coconuts. But MCT oil is a certain type of fat that does not involve all the different chemical reactions like other types of fats.
- **[03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=neabI31ofMc&t=234s)** — Easily to digest and a lot of it turns into ketones which will give you more energy than carbs or even protein. Because the body likes to consume ketones as its fuel.
- **[04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=neabI31ofMc&t=244s)** — Adding turmeric to your foods create a lot of positive things. One being just feeling more satisfied. Next thing on the list is zinc. If someone is deficient in zinc they are going to be excessively hungry.
- **[04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=neabI31ofMc&t=257s)** — Next one is something called kombucha tea which is not really a tea. It's like a carbonated drink. It's very acidic. I like it. You just need to drink a half a glass and sip it.
- **[04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=neabI31ofMc&t=267s)** — I like to dilute it with water. But it's very very satisfying because it's filled with something called lactic acid that helps feed your gut. Which will then send signals up to your brain that you're full.
- **[04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=neabI31ofMc&t=277s)** — Grapefruit also has a certain chemical that can be very satisfying. Also there's another chemical that's bitter in arugula that supports the liver that seems to be more satisfying than having regular salad like romaine, lettuce or something like that.
- **[04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=neabI31ofMc&t=293s)** — You also realize when you consume vegetables with fiber or berries with fiber, that fiber can buffer the blood sugar. Anytime you have a meal with fiber you're going to be more satisfied.
- **[05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=neabI31ofMc&t=303s)** — The next thing on the list is full fat protein. You don't want to do lean protein. The leaner the protein, as in like whey protein powder, the more insulin that's going to be raised. So there's something called the insulin index.
- **[05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=neabI31ofMc&t=317s)** — And at the top of the list you have the highest thing that stimulates insulin as far as not being a carbohydrate. And that is whey protein. As you come down and have more fat with the protein, like a whole egg or more fattier meat or fattier fish, you have a lower insulin spike.
- **[05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=neabI31ofMc&t=334s)** — You're not going to have the dip in blood sugar because insulin pushes your blood sugar down. We want to keep your blood sugar level. Eating more fat with the protein can help buffer that response.
- **[05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=neabI31ofMc&t=346s)** — Eating more fiber also helps buffer the glycemic index as well. Another thing that can really help your appetite is exercise. Now here's the thing. If you are exercising too much, like high intensity exercise, that could actually drop your blood sugar too low and you could be hungry.
- **[06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=neabI31ofMc&t=364s)** — What I'm talking about is long walks. Something that's not too intense. That can greatly help your blood sugar. The next thing in the list, and this is really important, is getting an extra 30 minutes of sleep. Whether you take a nap for 30 minutes or you sleep in 30 minutes later.
- **[06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=neabI31ofMc&t=379s)** — That extra sleep greatly reduces cortisol and levels off your blood sugar. This leads me to the next thing, which is just keeping your stress level as low as possible. And to do that, you want to do exercise, physical work around the house, sleep more, eat healthy, do stretching, and take ashwagandha and definitely magnesium glycinate before you go to bed. That can greatly help.
- **[06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=neabI31ofMc&t=402s)** — If you combine some of these foods with better sleep, less stress, you can control your appetite, lose weight, look good, and feel better about yourself.

- **[00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PicLOEhw3nA&t=0s)** — I'd like to discuss a very, very important hormone called growth hormone in relationship to how to increase it,
- **[00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PicLOEhw3nA&t=7s)** — especially as you age. Unfortunately, as we age, growth hormone just really tanks.
- **[00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PicLOEhw3nA&t=13s)** — If you're over 65 years old, your growth hormone is likely to be 65% lower than what it should be.
- **[00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PicLOEhw3nA&t=21s)** — And growth hormone in an adult versus a child works completely differently.
- **[00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PicLOEhw3nA&t=26s)** — So if you don't have enough growth hormone as a kid, you're going to be shorter.
- **[00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PicLOEhw3nA&t=29s)** — But in an adult, it has everything to do with protein synthesis. I'm talking about muscle building,
- **[00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PicLOEhw3nA&t=38s)** — building of your tendons, your ligaments, your collagen, your joints, and your bones.
- **[00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PicLOEhw3nA&t=45s)** — Now, what's pretty wild about this is that the levels of growth hormone in someone over the
- **[00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PicLOEhw3nA&t=51s)** — age of 60 are equivalent to someone younger with a growth hormone deficiency pathology
- **[00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PicLOEhw3nA&t=57s)** — or some dysfunction with the pituitary gland. Because the pituitary gland makes growth hormone.
- **[01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PicLOEhw3nA&t=63s)** — So a lot of people are deficient in growth hormone and they don't connect the dots on
- **[01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PicLOEhw3nA&t=68s)** — what that's doing to their body. They're going to have a difficult time building muscle.
- **[01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PicLOEhw3nA&t=72s)** — A growth hormone also has everything to do with fat burning. They're breaking down the lipids or
- **[01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PicLOEhw3nA&t=77s)** — fats, primarily in your midsection. So someone with lower growth hormone is going to have a
- **[01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PicLOEhw3nA&t=87s)** — usually have a lower mood relating to either depression or anxiety. They may have higher
- **[01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PicLOEhw3nA&t=93s)** — levels of LDL, hair loss, and insomnia. But growth hormone, in typical in adult,
- **[01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PicLOEhw3nA&t=99s)** — helps you with protein. Very similar to testosterone. So not only does growth hormone
- **[01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PicLOEhw3nA&t=106s)** — go down as you age, testosterone also goes down as well. So growth hormone is produced
- **[01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PicLOEhw3nA&t=112s)** — by the pituitary gland that's in your brain. And that hormone signal comes down and works
- **[01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PicLOEhw3nA&t=118s)** — through your liver initially. And it works with this other thing. It's like a hormone. It's
- **[02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PicLOEhw3nA&t=123s)** — called insulin-like growth factor number one. Now it sounds kind of a strange name, but
- **[02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PicLOEhw3nA&t=128s)** — basically you can think of that very similar to growth hormone because it has very similar
- **[02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PicLOEhw3nA&t=133s)** — functions except for growth hormone has a more potent effect on fat burning. Whereas IGF1 or
- **[02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PicLOEhw3nA&t=140s)** — IGF1 has a weaker effect on fat burning. Now there's a very important reason why I brought
- **[02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PicLOEhw3nA&t=145s)** — that up because I'm going to be talking about the liver in just a minute. But I just wanted to
- **[02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PicLOEhw3nA&t=148s)** — give you the general function of what growth hormone does. Professional athletes that take
- **[02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PicLOEhw3nA&t=153s)** — human growth hormone when probably they're not supposed to because it's illegal in many
- **[02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PicLOEhw3nA&t=158s)** — different sports. And it does have a lot of side effects. But that doesn't seem to discourage
- **[02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PicLOEhw3nA&t=163s)** — certain athletes from taking it. And there's a lot of people taking other types of things to
- **[02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PicLOEhw3nA&t=169s)** — stimulate growth hormone. I'm going to focus more on the natural ways that will keep you
- **[02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PicLOEhw3nA&t=174s)** — out of trouble that don't have side effects. What blocks growth hormone? The biggest thing is
- **[03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PicLOEhw3nA&t=180s)** — insomnia, especially if you have sleep apnea. Sleep apnea is a situation where you're you
- **[03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PicLOEhw3nA&t=185s)** — have this obstruction in your back of your your sinus cavity or maybe the back of the
- **[03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PicLOEhw3nA&t=191s)** — throat for some reason and you're not able to get enough oxygen. There's some interesting
- **[03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PicLOEhw3nA&t=195s)** — connection between getting enough oxygen when you're sleeping, right, in order to sleep. So
- **[03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PicLOEhw3nA&t=200s)** — if we have this imbalance and we're not getting enough air, we're not going to be able to get
- **[03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PicLOEhw3nA&t=203s)** — enough sleep. Growth hormone is mostly elevated during the first part of deep delta wave
- **[03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PicLOEhw3nA&t=210s)** — sleep. So if you don't get that, you're not going to be able to have the benefit of growth
- **[03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PicLOEhw3nA&t=216s)** — hormone. In fact, they tested people with sleep apnea and their growth hormone is much,
- **[03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PicLOEhw3nA&t=221s)** — lower. And even when they wear a CPAP machine and they get more oxygen, okay, that's that mask over
- **[03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PicLOEhw3nA&t=228s)** — their their nose where they're in their mouth where they're getting oxygen, their growth
- **[03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PicLOEhw3nA&t=232s)** — hormone comes back to where it should be, which is interesting. So if you can fix sleep
- **[03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PicLOEhw3nA&t=237s)** — apnea, you can greatly increase growth hormone. When you're in a room, when the windows are not
- **[04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PicLOEhw3nA&t=243s)** — open and you're not getting enough oxygen, because maybe you don't also have enough plants
- **[04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PicLOEhw3nA&t=248s)** — in your room which give you oxygen, you may have a tendency to have more CO2 in that room.
- **[04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PicLOEhw3nA&t=254s)** — And just that alone can affect your sleep in a negative way. And this is why when you open
- **[04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PicLOEhw3nA&t=261s)** — the window, if you can, or you get a plant next to where you're sleeping, you can definitely
- **[04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PicLOEhw3nA&t=267s)** — sleep better. Just for the fact that you're increasing the oxygen and you're lowering the
- **[04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PicLOEhw3nA&t=270s)** — CO2. So many people are spending all day in a room with a higher level of CO2 and not
- **[04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PicLOEhw3nA&t=277s)** — oxygen. So this greatly higher CO2 situation can affect cognitive function, especially if you're
- **[04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PicLOEhw3nA&t=285s)** — like a student and you're taking a test and you're trying to have the best intelligent
- **[04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PicLOEhw3nA&t=289s)** — focus that you can. Well, having this imbalance of CO2 and oxygen can greatly affect that,
- **[04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PicLOEhw3nA&t=294s)** — but it also majorly affects your sleep. The next thing that really messes up growth hormone
- **[04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PicLOEhw3nA&t=298s)** — is something called hyperglycemia. That's too much sugar in the blood from a high
- **[05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PicLOEhw3nA&t=303s)** — carbohydrate diet. Or let's say you're a diabetic. That can inhibit growth hormone. And there's a lot
- **[05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PicLOEhw3nA&t=309s)** — of things that you can do to fix that, like going on a low carb diet. But what you need to
- **[05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PicLOEhw3nA&t=313s)** — know is that one common way that growth hormone is suppressed is through either high sugar
- **[05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PicLOEhw3nA&t=320s)** — or high insulin. Now this insulin topic is very interesting because high level of insulin
- **[05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PicLOEhw3nA&t=328s)** — will suppress growth hormone the same as a severe deficiency of insulin. So we really need to have
- **[05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PicLOEhw3nA&t=338s)** — normal insulin. And this is maybe a confusion that a lot of people have with keto. They
- **[05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PicLOEhw3nA&t=343s)** — think that they need to bring insulin down to zero because insulin is really, really bad.
- **[05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PicLOEhw3nA&t=348s)** — No, insulin is really necessary. It's a normal hormone. We want it normal. We don't want
- **[05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PicLOEhw3nA&t=353s)** — it too high or too low. And unless you're a type 1 diabetic and have loss of the cells that produce
- **[06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PicLOEhw3nA&t=360s)** — insulin, usually when you are a diabetic or a pre-diabetic, not type 1 but type 2, you can
- **[06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PicLOEhw3nA&t=367s)** — have a situation where you have high level of insulin and low level of insulin at this
- **[06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PicLOEhw3nA&t=373s)** — exact same time. Now how can that be? Well, because the body develops this resistance. So in
- **[06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PicLOEhw3nA&t=378s)** — receptor, you have this blockage. So the insulin comes out triggered by carbs, goes into the
- **[06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PicLOEhw3nA&t=384s)** — receptor. The receptor is blocking it. So we have low insulin inside the cell. The feedback loop
- **[06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PicLOEhw3nA&t=389s)** — actually tells the pancreas to produce more. So now we have the situation where we have more
- **[06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PicLOEhw3nA&t=393s)** — and more and more insulin. And over time, the insulin becomes so weak that you can't regulate
- **[06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PicLOEhw3nA&t=400s)** — the blood sugars anymore because the pancreas is exhausted. So one really simple way to know
- **[06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PicLOEhw3nA&t=406s)** — if you have a severe insulin deficiency is this. You want to do a test, a fasting blood glucose
- **[06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PicLOEhw3nA&t=415s)** — test. You don't even have to go to the doctor. You can just get a kit at the local drug store
- **[07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PicLOEhw3nA&t=420s)** — or buy it online. But it's a blood test kit and you test while you're fasting. Maybe like
- **[07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PicLOEhw3nA&t=426s)** — when you wake up in the morning. Normally it should be around 75-80. If that blood sugar is
- **[07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PicLOEhw3nA&t=432s)** — let's say it goes up to 100, 115, 120, things like that, then you know you have a deficiency
- **[07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PicLOEhw3nA&t=442s)** — of insulin. Think about it. What's happening when your blood sugars are going up? You don't
- **[07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PicLOEhw3nA&t=446s)** — have enough insulin to suppress the blood sugars because that's what insulin does.
- **[07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PicLOEhw3nA&t=451s)** — Anytime your blood sugar goes up, you don't have enough insulin. And that could be created
- **[07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PicLOEhw3nA&t=455s)** — from this insulin resistant situation. And one really interesting thing about a diabetic
- **[07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PicLOEhw3nA&t=461s)** — on a good portion of their high blood sugar. It may not be 100% from the diet. In fact, it's not.
- **[07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PicLOEhw3nA&t=469s)** — A good portion of their high sugar is because the liver is making too much glucose. It's
- **[07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PicLOEhw3nA&t=476s)** — making out of protein and even fat and even ketones. So that brings up the next point that
- **[08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PicLOEhw3nA&t=482s)** — I want to talk about. The pituitary gland as one of its functions is the production of
- **[08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PicLOEhw3nA&t=488s)** — hormone. And if you think about these hormones, they're made by glands. Hormones are
- **[08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PicLOEhw3nA&t=493s)** — communications that travel between different points, right? From the pituitary to the liver.
- **[08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PicLOEhw3nA&t=498s)** — And then also there's a feedback loop that comes back to turn it off. So you have this
- **[08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PicLOEhw3nA&t=502s)** — entire communication going on. And my thought is not to replace the message or the hormone
- **[08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PicLOEhw3nA&t=510s)** — with some synthetic version. Instead, why don't we actually support the gland that actually
- **[08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PicLOEhw3nA&t=515s)** — makes growth hormone? It's a new concept for a lot of people, but it's much, much wiser because
- **[08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PicLOEhw3nA&t=521s)** — that way you don't mess with this hormone that can then shut down the gland. So anytime you
- **[08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PicLOEhw3nA&t=527s)** — take any type of hormone replacement, whether it's estrogen or even testosterone or even
- **[08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PicLOEhw3nA&t=532s)** — growth hormone, you end up causing the gland that makes it to go to sleep. It atrophies,
- **[08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PicLOEhw3nA&t=538s)** — it shrinks, it doesn't work anymore. So one really important thing I think would be good to
- **[09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PicLOEhw3nA&t=545s)** — increase your growth hormone, especially if you notice a loss of muscle and these other issues
- **[09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PicLOEhw3nA&t=551s)** — I mentioned, is to take a pituitary glandular support. One that I like and I'm not affiliated
- **[09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PicLOEhw3nA&t=557s)** — with this company. I don't get any kickbacks or anything, but it's standard process.
- **[09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PicLOEhw3nA&t=561s)** — They're a pituitrophin product. PMG. This is something I used in practice. It seems to
- **[09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PicLOEhw3nA&t=567s)** — work good not by giving you growth hormone because they take the hormones out, but by
- **[09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PicLOEhw3nA&t=572s)** — giving you the raw materials to support the gland that makes your own growth hormone.
- **[09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PicLOEhw3nA&t=580s)** — And a lot of people have reported back that they sleep better and their nails and hair starts
- **[09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PicLOEhw3nA&t=586s)** — growing back much better. So you might want to make a mental note of that. Also stress. A
- **[09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PicLOEhw3nA&t=591s)** — little bit of stress is good for the growth hormone, but chronic stress, right? It can
- **[09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PicLOEhw3nA&t=596s)** — really inhibit your growth hormone. But intermittent stress is good as an exercise,
- **[10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PicLOEhw3nA&t=602s)** — intense exercise has the ability to stimulate growth hormone up to 2000%.
- **[10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PicLOEhw3nA&t=608s)** — And I'm talking about sprinting as the most intense can help someone increase growth hormone.
- **[10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PicLOEhw3nA&t=614s)** — If you have a liver problem, as in a fatty liver or an inflamed liver or even a liver
- **[10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PicLOEhw3nA&t=620s)** — that has cirrhosis, that can really mess with your growth hormone. So anything that
- **[10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PicLOEhw3nA&t=626s)** — can improve liver function will help growth hormone. And I'm talking about milk thistle.
- **[10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PicLOEhw3nA&t=631s)** — That's probably one of the best things you can take to improve many different aspects of your
- **[10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PicLOEhw3nA&t=636s)** — liver. I mean, it's kind of like something that actually counters poisoning in your liver,
- **[10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PicLOEhw3nA&t=641s)** — whether it's from Tylenol poisoning or a snake bite or poisoning from mushroom.
- **[10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PicLOEhw3nA&t=647s)** — Milk thistle counters that, but it has a lot of other cool things it can do as well.
- **[10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PicLOEhw3nA&t=652s)** — And from a diet standpoint, moderate protein can help increase growth hormone.
- **[10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PicLOEhw3nA&t=657s)** — That sounds familiar. Sounds like the ketogenic diet, right? Now what type of protein is best?
- **[11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PicLOEhw3nA&t=663s)** — The most bioavailable complete protein. The protein that has basically the best
- **[11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PicLOEhw3nA&t=667s)** — concentrated amino acids. Red meat, eggs, fish, all of that is really, really good.
- **[11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PicLOEhw3nA&t=673s)** — And also red meat and other types of meat are loaded with zinc. And if you're zinc
- **[11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PicLOEhw3nA&t=678s)** — deficient, you're also going to be low in growth hormone as well as testosterone.
- **[11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PicLOEhw3nA&t=683s)** — So you want to make sure you do the healthy version of the ketogenic diet, which includes
- **[11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PicLOEhw3nA&t=689s)** — all of these nutrients, like all the trace minerals to help. Now when you exercise,
- **[11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PicLOEhw3nA&t=693s)** — okay, I've talked a lot about doing the cold immersion or even a cold shower to help increase
- **[11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PicLOEhw3nA&t=699s)** — anti-aging factors and things like that. But cold therapy also increases something called
- **[11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PicLOEhw3nA&t=705s)** — heat shock proteins, which increase growth hormone. Heat, as in a hot shower or a sauna or a whirlpool
- **[11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PicLOEhw3nA&t=715s)** — or a jacuzzi will also increase growth hormone significantly, even more than cold therapy.
- **[12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PicLOEhw3nA&t=724s)** — Okay. So heat therapy will increase growth hormone by a factor of 1500%, which is even
- **[12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PicLOEhw3nA&t=733s)** — exercise. So this is why I'm bringing this up because maybe you can combine it. And also this
- **[12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PicLOEhw3nA&t=738s)** — heat will help you sleep at night, which will automatically increase your growth hormone. But
- **[12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PicLOEhw3nA&t=744s)** — I'm not talking about when you're in the bed staying warm. I'm talking about sometime during
- **[12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PicLOEhw3nA&t=747s)** — the day getting a sauna because at night you want to keep the room a bit cooler. You're going
- **[12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PicLOEhw3nA&t=752s)** — to sleep better. And maybe you just sleep with a sheet or something like that. And the
- **[12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PicLOEhw3nA&t=756s)** — other aspect of growth hormone is to do intermittent fasting. It's actually very, very
- **[12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PicLOEhw3nA&t=761s)** — potent. I'm not talking about necessarily lowering your calories, especially if you're trying to
- **[12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PicLOEhw3nA&t=767s)** — build muscle. I'm recommending to keep the same amount of calories, but just eat them less
- **[12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PicLOEhw3nA&t=772s)** — frequently. So if you did two meals and you did enough calories and you didn't snack,
- **[12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PicLOEhw3nA&t=778s)** — you have the ability to increase growth hormone by 2000%, which is pretty fascinating. I want
- **[13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PicLOEhw3nA&t=786s)** — to just bring up the topic of your muscles. Okay. Sometimes people, when they get on the
- **[13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PicLOEhw3nA&t=790s)** — ketogenic diet, they feel that the muscles are just flat. They kind of lost their size. They
- **[13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PicLOEhw3nA&t=795s)** — look dehydrated because when you do keto, at least initially you lose your glycogen stores.
- **[13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PicLOEhw3nA&t=803s)** — Glycogen is basically the storage of glucose, a lot of water and potassium. And when you
- **[13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PicLOEhw3nA&t=811s)** — initially cut down your carbs, okay, you're going to also use up some of your glycogen
- **[13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PicLOEhw3nA&t=817s)** — reserve and you're going to lose water weight. Okay. And then your body's going to burn more
- **[13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PicLOEhw3nA&t=822s)** — fat. You're going to get leaner. But how do we handle this flat muscle situation? Well,
- **[13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PicLOEhw3nA&t=827s)** — here's how you would handle it. There's a real interesting study with athletes that do
- **[13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PicLOEhw3nA&t=832s)** — keto. And apparently there's no glycogen difference in their muscles versus someone
- **[13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PicLOEhw3nA&t=836s)** — who's not doing keto. They have the same amount of glycogen. Now think about what
- **[14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PicLOEhw3nA&t=840s)** — happens with an athlete. They have to use this glycogen initially to run a certain way.
- **[14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PicLOEhw3nA&t=845s)** — And then if they're fat adapted, they can convert over to burning fat and they burn three times
- **[14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PicLOEhw3nA&t=849s)** — as much fat as anyone else. They're like a fat burning machine. But what if you're not an
- **[14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PicLOEhw3nA&t=854s)** — athlete, okay, and you're not using up this glycogen that then caused your body to replenish
- **[14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PicLOEhw3nA&t=860s)** — it, you might have lower amounts of glycogen. Well, number one, make sure you consume enough
- **[14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PicLOEhw3nA&t=866s)** — fluid with the electrolyte potassium and sodium. Very, very, very important to keep the
- **[14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PicLOEhw3nA&t=874s)** — dehydration of the muscle because we want to avoid this carb loading. Bodybuilders do where
- **[14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PicLOEhw3nA&t=880s)** — they basically just eat a lot of refined carbs and they just fill up the muscle with glycogen,
- **[14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PicLOEhw3nA&t=885s)** — which is a lot of its water. So it makes the muscle look fuller. We don't want to do
- **[14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PicLOEhw3nA&t=890s)** — that because that comes with the package. It creates problems with insulin resistance, but at
- **[14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PicLOEhw3nA&t=893s)** — the same time, we don't want to look dehydrated. So we want to make sure that
- **[14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PicLOEhw3nA&t=896s)** — the electrolytes, including sodium and potassium, are consumed with enough fluid. And
- **[15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PicLOEhw3nA&t=904s)** — if you have a problem with this, you need to bring your carbs up to 50 grams. So that would
- **[15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PicLOEhw3nA&t=909s)** — be roughly about three cups of berries per day. But we don't want to just do any straight sugar
- **[15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PicLOEhw3nA&t=915s)** — because that's going to inhibit our growth hormone. So I've given you a lot of different
- **[15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PicLOEhw3nA&t=918s)** — things you can do related to growth hormone. And there's a lot more to learn about this,
- **[15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PicLOEhw3nA&t=922s)** — but if you have not seen this video on how to help someone with sleep apnea,
- **[15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PicLOEhw3nA&t=928s)** — that would be a really good one to watch. I put it up right here.

## Video 26: Breakfast is a Lie

**Watch on YouTube:** [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tqlMxfAECGg](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tqlMxfAECGg)

## Full Transcript with Timestamps

*Click any timestamp to jump to that moment in the video*

- **[00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tqlMxfAECGg&t=0s)** — I want to share some important insights on breakfast foods. Eggs, oatmeal, toast, pancakes, meat. All sorts of foods that people eat for breakfast.
- **[00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tqlMxfAECGg&t=8s)** — What you eat as your first meal is going to totally affect how you feel through the rest of the day. It will also affect your ability to focus, your creative ability to solve problems, also how you sleep at night.
- **[00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tqlMxfAECGg&t=19s)** — I also want to get into fasting and just share some insights with breakfast because there are levels of good and bad.
- **[00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tqlMxfAECGg&t=25s)** — My typical breakfast that I had for years was this right here. It's always before life. Cereal. Sometimes, believe it or not, I would do pop tarts. I did that for many, many years.
- **[00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tqlMxfAECGg&t=36s)** — What I did not know is I didn't have any concept of insulin resistance. Insulin is not working like it should in the cells. Insulin helps you absorb fuel, but it also helps you absorb sugar in the cells.
- **[00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tqlMxfAECGg&t=51s)** — If you have resistance to insulin, you can't really absorb fuel. And of course, the first place to notice it is in your brain. The actual cells in my brain just weren't absorbing sugar that well. I needed more and more sugar to fuel the brain.
- **[01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tqlMxfAECGg&t=64s)** — I also didn't know how to make ketones. The way that you make ketones is you have to lower your carbs and sugar. And also you can do it with fasting.
- **[01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tqlMxfAECGg&t=72s)** — The body has no choice but then convert over to making ketones. Ketones are a wonderful thing for the brain. Ketones bring your mood up and you're burning your own fat.
- **[01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tqlMxfAECGg&t=82s)** — When I was eating the carbohydrate breakfast, I was hungry in about an hour and a half. Once I got my body into ketosis, I could go for a long period of time without meals.
- **[01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tqlMxfAECGg&t=91s)** — I'm excited about our new product we just released called multi-collagen peptides. There are a lot of collagen brands out there, but many are from animals that are not grass-fed. They're not pasture-raised.
- **[01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tqlMxfAECGg&t=102s)** — Guess what? This is. And we use the word multi because it comes from various sources. Chicken collagen, chicken egg membranes, and fish and beef collagen.
- **[01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tqlMxfAECGg&t=111s)** — To have a synergistic effect on your skin, your ligaments, your tendons, your bones. If you want a high-quality collagen product, you might want to try this one.
- **[01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tqlMxfAECGg&t=119s)** — There are healthier versions of this. If we were just to improve the version of this and this to something like this, the magic spoon, right? Which has no sugars.
- **[02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tqlMxfAECGg&t=129s)** — This is a little bit better. Or something like this, keto granola. That might be a good option too. If you look at the ingredients, there's no added sugar or anything.
- **[02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tqlMxfAECGg&t=137s)** — It's just like pecans, dried coconuts, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, or something like this. They're not adding all this extra sugar in there.
- **[02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tqlMxfAECGg&t=146s)** — What about oatmeal? This stuff is just pure, ultra processed food calories. They add so much sugar, starch. You don't want to have that.
- **[02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tqlMxfAECGg&t=154s)** — If we upgrade from that, then you would do just regular oatmeal without anything added.
- **[02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tqlMxfAECGg&t=162s)** — And of course, the ultimate type of oatmeal is steel cut oats. Yes, it's not as convenient. It takes a while to cook, like 30 to 40 minutes. But that's a lot better.
- **[02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tqlMxfAECGg&t=170s)** — I'm not going to discourage people from eating it if it seems to be working for them. But I do want to give one more upgrade.
- **[02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tqlMxfAECGg&t=177s)** — Oatmeal is something that is heavily sprayed with glyphosate. That's an herbicide. That's the stuff in all the GMO foods. But oatmeal is not GMO.
- **[03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tqlMxfAECGg&t=187s)** — Why are they spraying this herbicide, this weed killer, on oats? To dry it out very, very fast. They also spray it on wheat.
- **[03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tqlMxfAECGg&t=197s)** — If you're getting a lot of glyphosate, which is not good for your body, it's been shown to cause cancer and it's going to mess with your gut.
- **[03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tqlMxfAECGg&t=203s)** — If you're going to do organic oatmeal without all the other crap in it. I mean, there are people that lived on oatmeal the entire life and they're fine.
- **[03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tqlMxfAECGg&t=212s)** — They probably don't eat a lot of other processed foods. They just might add the oatmeal and they have a lot of other things.
- **[03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tqlMxfAECGg&t=217s)** — You see, you have like two extreme diets, right? You have the low carb ketogenic diet over here. And then you also have the vegan diet over here.
- **[03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tqlMxfAECGg&t=224s)** — Both of them can get great results with things like diabetes. And then you also have really dirty keto processed ingredients in the ketogenic like snack foods.
- **[03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tqlMxfAECGg&t=234s)** — I think if we look at the keto versus vegan and you pull out these ultra processed type refined foods, you're going to be able to reduce a lot of problems.
- **[04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tqlMxfAECGg&t=244s)** — Personally, I could not do a vegan diet. I was just literally starving. I need animal protein.
- **[04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tqlMxfAECGg&t=249s)** — Let's talk about protein for a second, especially as your first meal. If you were to make just one simple change that would produce probably the biggest effect of your life,
- **[04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tqlMxfAECGg&t=262s)** — it would be to replace your breakfast food from whatever you're eating to more protein, meat, even bacon. Let's talk about eggs. OK.
- **[04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tqlMxfAECGg&t=272s)** — Of course, there's different levels of eggs. And I'm talking about quality of eggs. You know what?
- **[04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tqlMxfAECGg&t=276s)** — And if you're a college student struggling financially like I was, any egg will be better than nothing.
- **[04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tqlMxfAECGg&t=282s)** — It's going to definitely be a step up from any of this right here. What about bacon? Now there's levels of bacon.
- **[04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tqlMxfAECGg&t=288s)** — I probably wouldn't eat bacon unless it was organic and no sugar. Eggs and bacon. Perfect breakfast. Maybe you want to throw an avocado in there.
- **[04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tqlMxfAECGg&t=297s)** — Maybe you want to add some cheese. You can get some really good European cheeses in America that are raw cheese that are super healthy.
- **[05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tqlMxfAECGg&t=306s)** — I would not consume American cheese. I wouldn't do any type of Alvita. Cheese has a lot of nutrition.
- **[05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tqlMxfAECGg&t=312s)** — Plus, it's a fermented product, so it has good bacteria. It's a good source of protein. I also do yogurt. You can do Greek yogurt.
- **[05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tqlMxfAECGg&t=319s)** — This is organic White Mountain Bulgarian yogurt. It's like a probiotic. I do like this one.
- **[05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tqlMxfAECGg&t=325s)** — Or actually even a make my own probiotic. If you haven't seen that video, I'll put a link down below. Of course, I am addicted to coffee.
- **[05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tqlMxfAECGg&t=331s)** — I think coffee honestly is out of all the things. It's fine. I would try to do organic coffee. This is the type of coffee that I consume.
- **[05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tqlMxfAECGg&t=340s)** — Kick ass coffee. And this is organic. And I'll do like a small cup with half and half cream. And that's it.
- **[05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tqlMxfAECGg&t=346s)** — If you have kids, sometimes they have a super fast metabolism and you don't want to necessarily just give them Wonder Bread.
- **[05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tqlMxfAECGg&t=352s)** — You should try the sprouted bread. Ezekiel bread actually is one of the better breads. There's less gluten. There's less bad things.
- **[06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tqlMxfAECGg&t=361s)** — There's some other protein that I think can make you feel even better than egg protein. When I consume red meat, I also do pork sausage.
- **[06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tqlMxfAECGg&t=371s)** — There is some good nutrient density in there. In fact, out of all the things that have the most vitamin B1 is pork.
- **[06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tqlMxfAECGg&t=377s)** — Sometimes you might have kids and they don't want to eat eggs. They're finicky. They're not going to eat meat. They're not going to do the yogurt.
- **[06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tqlMxfAECGg&t=383s)** — They're going to have to do something like Ezekiel bread. Right? Maybe you want to add some peanut butter to it.
- **[06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tqlMxfAECGg&t=389s)** — Of course, the best peanut butter would be the Valencia peanut butter. It's organic. Get it from Trader Joe's.
- **[06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tqlMxfAECGg&t=394s)** — If you start to lower your carbohydrate, it's going to really help your brain and really get you into ketosis.
- **[06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tqlMxfAECGg&t=399s)** — And if you have been eating carbs for many, many years, you may find that around eight o'clock in the morning, you're getting hungry.
- **[06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tqlMxfAECGg&t=408s)** — What's happening at eight o'clock in the morning, you're getting a spike of something called cortisol because it's a natural circadian wave.
- **[06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tqlMxfAECGg&t=414s)** — If you just ignore that and wait, that goes away. I've been doing this pattern for many years.
- **[07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tqlMxfAECGg&t=420s)** — I would eat at noon, roughly, maybe a little later, and then at dinner. Right? Two meals for a long time.
- **[07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tqlMxfAECGg&t=427s)** — And of course, I'm always experimenting back and forth. And I found something that is working a little better for me right now that you might want to try as well.
- **[07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tqlMxfAECGg&t=436s)** — What I've done is I ate a breakfast 10, 1030. That's my first meal of the day.
- **[07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tqlMxfAECGg&t=442s)** — And then I'll have the second meal maybe early afternoon, three or four, maybe 430. Why am I doing that?
- **[07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tqlMxfAECGg&t=451s)** — Because I want most of the energy in the beginning part of the day. I don't want a lot of energy at night versus fasting for the first part of the day and getting my fuel from fat.
- **[07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tqlMxfAECGg&t=460s)** — But that actually worked initially for a long period of time, and it probably still would work. But I like to do a lot of physical work in the morning.
- **[07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tqlMxfAECGg&t=468s)** — Another little variable that's so important is your sleep. If you just get one hour or less of sleep, let's say you get six hours versus seven,
- **[07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tqlMxfAECGg&t=478s)** — it makes a huge change in your blood sugar and your mental cognitive state. I was living on six hours of sleep for years, and now I'm getting probably eight hours of sleep, which is actually increasing in two hours.
- **[08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tqlMxfAECGg&t=491s)** — Wow, what a difference with my ability to go for a long period of time without needing food. My blood sugars are so much better. My cognitive function is so much better.
- **[08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tqlMxfAECGg&t=503s)** — Just wanted to do this upgraded video on breakfast foods because the type of foods that you eat for that first meal will determine so many different effects. It's crazy. Thanks for watching.

*Click any timestamp to jump to that moment in the video*

- **[00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iV6osRQSbXE&t=0s)** — Yesterday, I got in a heated argument with Chachapiti.
- **[00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iV6osRQSbXE&t=3s)** — My wife actually came in and she said,
- **[00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iV6osRQSbXE&t=4s)** — Who are you talking to?
- **[00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iV6osRQSbXE&t=5s)** — I was really frustrated because I wanted to see
- **[00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iV6osRQSbXE&t=7s)** — if Chachapiti had at least basic truthful information
- **[00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iV6osRQSbXE&t=11s)** — in the area of health.
- **[00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iV6osRQSbXE&t=12s)** — How do they know this information is more truthful
- **[00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iV6osRQSbXE&t=16s)** — than something else?
- **[00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iV6osRQSbXE&t=17s)** — It's basically waded through medical consensus.
- **[00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iV6osRQSbXE&t=20s)** — There's so much medical dogma that ends up being
- **[00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iV6osRQSbXE&t=23s)** — completely false over periods of years.
- **[00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iV6osRQSbXE&t=25s)** — Today, we're gonna take a deep dive
- **[00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iV6osRQSbXE&t=27s)** — and ask Chachapiti various questions
- **[00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iV6osRQSbXE&t=29s)** — and see what it says.
- **[00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iV6osRQSbXE&t=31s)** — Before I do that, I want you to comment down below
- **[00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iV6osRQSbXE&t=34s)** — and tell me, how do you find your health information?
- **[00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iV6osRQSbXE&t=38s)** — Where do you go to get answers on health?
- **[00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iV6osRQSbXE&t=41s)** — The first question that I asked Chachapiti is,
- **[00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iV6osRQSbXE&t=43s)** — How do I lose weight?
- **[00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iV6osRQSbXE&t=44s)** — And of course, it said this.
- **[00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iV6osRQSbXE&t=46s)** — Losing weight comes down to creating
- **[00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iV6osRQSbXE&t=47s)** — a sustainable calorie deficit.
- **[00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iV6osRQSbXE&t=51s)** — Burning more calories than you consume.
- **[00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iV6osRQSbXE&t=53s)** — Of course, this dogma has persisted
- **[00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iV6osRQSbXE&t=55s)** — and it's going on right now.
- **[00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iV6osRQSbXE&t=56s)** — This is what the medical profession tells you to do
- **[00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iV6osRQSbXE&t=59s)** — to lose weight.
- **[01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iV6osRQSbXE&t=60s)** — To give you a tip, a good starting point
- **[01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iV6osRQSbXE&t=62s)** — is to reduce your intake by 300 to 500 calories per day.
- **[01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iV6osRQSbXE&t=65s)** — Let's just say you did reduce 500 calories.
- **[01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iV6osRQSbXE&t=68s)** — You're just gonna be so hungry
- **[01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iV6osRQSbXE&t=69s)** — because you're not gonna actually tap into your fat supply.
- **[01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iV6osRQSbXE&t=72s)** — You're gonna be dependent on the calories
- **[01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iV6osRQSbXE&t=74s)** — from the food coming in
- **[01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iV6osRQSbXE&t=75s)** — because you're running on carbs.
- **[01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iV6osRQSbXE&t=77s)** — Then I asked Chachapiti,
- **[01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iV6osRQSbXE&t=78s)** — what is the best diet for health?
- **[01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iV6osRQSbXE&t=81s)** — Number one, the Mediterranean diet.
- **[01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iV6osRQSbXE&t=83s)** — Of course, it's lots of vegetables,
- **[01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iV6osRQSbXE&t=84s)** — fruits, legumes, and whole grains.
- **[01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iV6osRQSbXE&t=87s)** — Moderate fish, poultry.
- **[01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iV6osRQSbXE&t=89s)** — Of course, you have to limit the red meat,
- **[01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iV6osRQSbXE&t=91s)** — sugar and processed foods.
- **[01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iV6osRQSbXE&t=92s)** — I like how they put that together.
- **[01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iV6osRQSbXE&t=94s)** — Limit red meat, sugar and processed foods.
- **[01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iV6osRQSbXE&t=97s)** — Like they lump those three together
- **[01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iV6osRQSbXE&t=99s)** — because they're all of equal importance to avoid.
- **[01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iV6osRQSbXE&t=102s)** — Look at this, optional, moderate red wine.
- **[01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iV6osRQSbXE&t=105s)** — For women, that's one glass per day.
- **[01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iV6osRQSbXE&t=109s)** — For men, it's two glasses of alcohol per day.
- **[01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iV6osRQSbXE&t=111s)** — First of all, if you're recommending a diet
- **[01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iV6osRQSbXE&t=113s)** — that's good for health,
- **[01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iV6osRQSbXE&t=114s)** — and you're actually recommending alcohol,
- **[01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iV6osRQSbXE&t=116s)** — explain to me how that's gonna make anyone healthy.
- **[01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iV6osRQSbXE&t=119s)** — The second diet is, of course, plant-based.
- **[02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iV6osRQSbXE&t=121s)** — Here we got the same old, same old recommendations.
- **[02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iV6osRQSbXE&t=124s)** — Flexitarian diet.
- **[02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iV6osRQSbXE&t=125s)** — This is mostly plants with a moderate amount of protein.
- **[02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iV6osRQSbXE&t=128s)** — Same thing, lean proteins.
- **[02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iV6osRQSbXE&t=130s)** — And then we have the DASH diet.
- **[02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iV6osRQSbXE&t=132s)** — For blood pressure, more grains, lots of vegetables.
- **[02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iV6osRQSbXE&t=136s)** — Fish and lean meat, same old, same old.
- **[02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iV6osRQSbXE&t=138s)** — But now we're gonna lower your sodium as well.
- **[02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iV6osRQSbXE&t=140s)** — Sodium has been found not to cause high blood pressure
- **[02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iV6osRQSbXE&t=144s)** — unless someone's super sensitive and low in potassium.
- **[02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iV6osRQSbXE&t=148s)** — There's just as many, if not more,
- **[02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iV6osRQSbXE&t=150s)** — problems with low sodium,
- **[02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iV6osRQSbXE&t=152s)** — especially if you're going low carb,
- **[02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iV6osRQSbXE&t=153s)** — because when you lower your sodium,
- **[02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iV6osRQSbXE&t=155s)** — you're gonna have weakness in the muscle
- **[02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iV6osRQSbXE&t=157s)** — and the nervous system.
- **[02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iV6osRQSbXE&t=158s)** — People actually need at least one teaspoon
- **[02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iV6osRQSbXE&t=160s)** — and a half per day of sea salt,
- **[02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iV6osRQSbXE&t=163s)** — just to get enough sodium.
- **[02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iV6osRQSbXE&t=165s)** — Diets to avoid long-term.
- **[02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iV6osRQSbXE&t=166s)** — Here we go. Keto and carnivore.
- **[02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iV6osRQSbXE&t=169s)** — Can show fast results, but hard to sustain.
- **[02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iV6osRQSbXE&t=171s)** — Often lacks fiber and can affect long-term heart health.
- **[02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iV6osRQSbXE&t=175s)** — There is absolutely zero evidence of that data.
- **[03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iV6osRQSbXE&t=180s)** — Again, where Chachapi-T gets her data
- **[03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iV6osRQSbXE&t=182s)** — is from organizations like the American Heart Association,
- **[03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iV6osRQSbXE&t=185s)** — the American Diabetes Association.
- **[03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iV6osRQSbXE&t=187s)** — All of these organizations are heavily funded
- **[03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iV6osRQSbXE&t=190s)** — by certain individuals, certain industries
- **[03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iV6osRQSbXE&t=193s)** — that are gonna make them very biased.
- **[03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iV6osRQSbXE&t=195s)** — I mean, think about keto and carnivore.
- **[03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iV6osRQSbXE&t=198s)** — What kind of threat that is to all sorts of money,
- **[03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iV6osRQSbXE&t=202s)** — medications, junk foods.
- **[03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iV6osRQSbXE&t=204s)** — Basically, they call the keto and carnivore fad diet.
- **[03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iV6osRQSbXE&t=208s)** — Quick results, but often result in rebound weight gain
- **[03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iV6osRQSbXE&t=210s)** — and nutrient deficiencies.
- **[03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iV6osRQSbXE&t=213s)** — Wait a second.
- **[03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iV6osRQSbXE&t=214s)** — The healthy version of the ketogenic diet
- **[03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iV6osRQSbXE&t=216s)** — and carnivore are so nutrient dense.
- **[03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iV6osRQSbXE&t=219s)** — Let's just compare that with the dietary food guidelines,
- **[03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iV6osRQSbXE&t=222s)** — which by the way, do not even measure up
- **[03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iV6osRQSbXE&t=224s)** — to give us our basic nutrients,
- **[03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iV6osRQSbXE&t=226s)** — unless you include the three cups of refined grains
- **[03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iV6osRQSbXE&t=229s)** — from the fortification of the synthetic vitamins
- **[03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iV6osRQSbXE&t=232s)** — put in there just to make it have some nutrients.
- **[03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iV6osRQSbXE&t=235s)** — So again, Chachapi-T is just lying through its teeth.
- **[03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iV6osRQSbXE&t=237s)** — General principles for a healthy diet.
- **[03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iV6osRQSbXE&t=239s)** — Well, you have the mostly plants, whole grains,
- **[04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iV6osRQSbXE&t=242s)** — adequate water, enough protein can be plant or animal.
- **[04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iV6osRQSbXE&t=246s)** — You see what they just did.
- **[04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iV6osRQSbXE&t=246s)** — They just kind of made those two equal each other,
- **[04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iV6osRQSbXE&t=249s)** — which is absolutely not true.
- **[04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iV6osRQSbXE&t=251s)** — If you're trying to get protein from plant,
- **[04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iV6osRQSbXE&t=253s)** — good luck, you're gonna be deficient.
- **[04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iV6osRQSbXE&t=255s)** — Next question, is keto healthy to do?
- **[04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iV6osRQSbXE&t=257s)** — Ketogenic diet can be healthy for some people short term,
- **[04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iV6osRQSbXE&t=261s)** — but it's not ideal for everyone
- **[04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iV6osRQSbXE&t=262s)** — or for long-term health in most cases.
- **[04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iV6osRQSbXE&t=265s)** — But then here we go to the risks and the drawbacks,
- **[04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iV6osRQSbXE&t=268s)** — nutrient deficiencies, fiber.
- **[04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iV6osRQSbXE&t=270s)** — I do a version of the ketogenic diet
- **[04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iV6osRQSbXE&t=273s)** — where I actually eat salad, I'm getting fiber.
- **[04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iV6osRQSbXE&t=276s)** — And with greens, you can get vitamin C,
- **[04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iV6osRQSbXE&t=278s)** — you can get a lot of magnesium, potassium,
- **[04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iV6osRQSbXE&t=281s)** — difficult to sustain, many regain weight after stopping,
- **[04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iV6osRQSbXE&t=285s)** — really?
- **[04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iV6osRQSbXE&t=286s)** — Actually, I know a lot of people
- **[04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iV6osRQSbXE&t=287s)** — who have maintained their weight
- **[04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iV6osRQSbXE&t=288s)** — for a very long period of time,
- **[04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iV6osRQSbXE&t=290s)** — and it's very sustainable.
- **[04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iV6osRQSbXE&t=293s)** — May negatively affect athletic performance?
- **[04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iV6osRQSbXE&t=296s)** — No, it actually will help increase athletic performance.
- **[05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iV6osRQSbXE&t=300s)** — Possible impact on gut health?
- **[05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iV6osRQSbXE&t=302s)** — Yeah, positive impact on gut health.
- **[05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iV6osRQSbXE&t=304s)** — Might be beneficial for type two diabetes
- **[05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iV6osRQSbXE&t=307s)** — or pre-diabetes.
- **[05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iV6osRQSbXE&t=308s)** — That's a lot of people, right?
- **[05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iV6osRQSbXE&t=310s)** — And so many people have blood sugar problems.
- **[05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iV6osRQSbXE&t=311s)** — Why wouldn't this be a powerful tool?
- **[05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iV6osRQSbXE&t=315s)** — What is the best way to lower my cholesterol?
- **[05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iV6osRQSbXE&t=317s)** — More fiber, their version of healthy fats,
- **[05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iV6osRQSbXE&t=320s)** — but replace saturated fats with unsaturated fats.
- **[05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iV6osRQSbXE&t=323s)** — In other words, we're going to recommend
- **[05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iV6osRQSbXE&t=326s)** — to eat heart healthy seed oils
- **[05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iV6osRQSbXE&t=329s)** — instead of the saturated fats.
- **[05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iV6osRQSbXE&t=331s)** — Again, this is just completely outdated dogma.
- **[05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iV6osRQSbXE&t=334s)** — That is, yes, it's general consensus,
- **[05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iV6osRQSbXE&t=337s)** — but that's completely outdated and false.
- **[05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iV6osRQSbXE&t=339s)** — Limit red meat and full fat dairy.
- **[05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iV6osRQSbXE&t=343s)** — That would be a mistake.
- **[05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iV6osRQSbXE&t=345s)** — Replace some animal proteins with plant-based proteins.
- **[05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iV6osRQSbXE&t=347s)** — Plants don't have complete proteins.
- **[05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iV6osRQSbXE&t=351s)** — The protein you get from plants is far inferior
- **[05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iV6osRQSbXE&t=354s)** — than the protein you get from animal products.
- **[05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iV6osRQSbXE&t=357s)** — Reduce dietary cholesterol.
- **[05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iV6osRQSbXE&t=359s)** — Limit foods such as egg yolks, shellfish, organ meats.
- **[06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iV6osRQSbXE&t=362s)** — Just ignore that because cholesterol is needed
- **[06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iV6osRQSbXE&t=364s)** — to make bile.
- **[06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iV6osRQSbXE&t=366s)** — It's needed to make vitamin D.
- **[06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iV6osRQSbXE&t=368s)** — It's needed to make all your cell membranes.
- **[06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iV6osRQSbXE&t=370s)** — It's needed for your brain.
- **[06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iV6osRQSbXE&t=371s)** — It's needed for your hormones.
- **[06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iV6osRQSbXE&t=373s)** — Medications if necessary.
- **[06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iV6osRQSbXE&t=375s)** — Hmm, okay.
- **[06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iV6osRQSbXE&t=376s)** — This is what the experts say, statins.
- **[06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iV6osRQSbXE&t=378s)** — All right.
- **[06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iV6osRQSbXE&t=379s)** — Next question.
- **[06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iV6osRQSbXE&t=380s)** — Are seed oils really that bad
- **[06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iV6osRQSbXE&t=382s)** — when seed oils aren't that bad?
- **[06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iV6osRQSbXE&t=384s)** — When used in moderation?
- **[06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iV6osRQSbXE&t=386s)** — When seed oils might be bad, highly refined.
- **[06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iV6osRQSbXE&t=389s)** — Well, that's the majority of seed oils out there.
- **[06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iV6osRQSbXE&t=391s)** — Oh, I like this, the verdict.
- **[06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iV6osRQSbXE&t=392s)** — Should I avoid seed oils?
- **[06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iV6osRQSbXE&t=394s)** — No need to demonize them completely.
- **[06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iV6osRQSbXE&t=396s)** — The key is balance and moderation.
- **[06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iV6osRQSbXE&t=399s)** — This is a play in their playbook.
- **[06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iV6osRQSbXE&t=402s)** — Everything in moderation.
- **[06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iV6osRQSbXE&t=404s)** — So that way you can keep eating the junk food.
- **[06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iV6osRQSbXE&t=406s)** — There is no bad food.
- **[06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iV6osRQSbXE&t=407s)** — It's just about balance and moderation.
- **[06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iV6osRQSbXE&t=409s)** — Well, when you have a chronic disease,
- **[06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iV6osRQSbXE&t=411s)** — you cannot just solve it by balancing your diet.
- **[06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iV6osRQSbXE&t=416s)** — You have to do something out of balance.
- **[06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iV6osRQSbXE&t=417s)** — And I think this is how they normalize carbohydrates.
- **[06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iV6osRQSbXE&t=419s)** — They started to use arguments that we need carbs
- **[07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iV6osRQSbXE&t=422s)** — for our brain to the point where it's like 65%
- **[07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iV6osRQSbXE&t=426s)** — of our calories are grains.
- **[07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iV6osRQSbXE&t=427s)** — What is the best recommendation, diet and nutrition
- **[07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iV6osRQSbXE&t=430s)** — for someone with type 2 diabetes?
- **[07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iV6osRQSbXE&t=432s)** — Why do they add whole grains and legumes?
- **[07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iV6osRQSbXE&t=435s)** — Think about what causes insulin to spike.
- **[07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iV6osRQSbXE&t=438s)** — It's carbs. So what is diabetes?
- **[07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iV6osRQSbXE&t=440s)** — It's a disease where there's too much blood sugar.
- **[07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iV6osRQSbXE&t=443s)** — Why would you want to add more carbs
- **[07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iV6osRQSbXE&t=445s)** — to increase that sugar if type 2 diabetes
- **[07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iV6osRQSbXE&t=448s)** — is too much sugar already?
- **[07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iV6osRQSbXE&t=450s)** — Wow, look at this.
- **[07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iV6osRQSbXE&t=451s)** — One fourth of your plate should be whole grains
- **[07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iV6osRQSbXE&t=453s)** — and starchy vegetables.
- **[07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iV6osRQSbXE&t=454s)** — Really? Sweet potatoes?
- **[07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iV6osRQSbXE&t=455s)** — Why do you even recommend that for diabetes?
- **[07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iV6osRQSbXE&t=457s)** — This is ridiculous.
- **[07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iV6osRQSbXE&t=459s)** — Avoid large portions of carbs. Be mindful.
- **[07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iV6osRQSbXE&t=461s)** — No, no, don't consume any carbs
- **[07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iV6osRQSbXE&t=463s)** — or keep your carbs really, really low.
- **[07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iV6osRQSbXE&t=466s)** — Also, they say focus on complex carbs.
- **[07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iV6osRQSbXE&t=469s)** — Did you know that maltodextrin, modified food starch,
- **[07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iV6osRQSbXE&t=471s)** — and modified cornstarch is classified chemically
- **[07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iV6osRQSbXE&t=474s)** — as a complex carbohydrate?
- **[07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iV6osRQSbXE&t=477s)** — Yeah, I know. It's bizarre.
- **[07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iV6osRQSbXE&t=479s)** — Limit sugary foods and drinks.
- **[08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iV6osRQSbXE&t=482s)** — Wow. If you do consume fruit juice,
- **[08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iV6osRQSbXE&t=485s)** — make sure it's 100% fruit juice.
- **[08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iV6osRQSbXE&t=487s)** — Oh my gosh, this is so, so outdated.
- **[08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iV6osRQSbXE&t=491s)** — Oh, this is good.
- **[08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iV6osRQSbXE&t=492s)** — Meal timing.
- **[08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iV6osRQSbXE&t=494s)** — Spacing meals evenly through the day
- **[08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iV6osRQSbXE&t=495s)** — can prevent blood sugar spikes.
- **[08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iV6osRQSbXE&t=497s)** — Consider smaller, more frequent meals.
- **[08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iV6osRQSbXE&t=499s)** — No, no, we don't want a lot of spikes.
- **[08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iV6osRQSbXE&t=502s)** — The more you eat anything, the more you spike insulin.
- **[08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iV6osRQSbXE&t=504s)** — So this is going to contribute to diabetes,
- **[08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iV6osRQSbXE&t=507s)** — not inhibit it.
- **[08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iV6osRQSbXE&t=508s)** — With type 2 diabetes, you do not need to balance
- **[08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iV6osRQSbXE&t=511s)** — your carbohydrates. That's bad advice.
- **[08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iV6osRQSbXE&t=513s)** — You need to bring your carbs way, way down
- **[08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iV6osRQSbXE&t=515s)** — to as close to zero as possible.
- **[08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iV6osRQSbXE&t=518s)** — Of course, I asked the question,
- **[08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iV6osRQSbXE&t=519s)** — what about red meat?
- **[08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iV6osRQSbXE&t=519s)** — Is it healthy or unhealthy?
- **[08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iV6osRQSbXE&t=522s)** — So it brings up the risks of red meat,
- **[08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iV6osRQSbXE&t=524s)** — especially processed meat.
- **[08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iV6osRQSbXE&t=525s)** — It's interesting how they always combine
- **[08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iV6osRQSbXE&t=527s)** — red meat with processed meat.
- **[08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iV6osRQSbXE&t=529s)** — You know how many people that go on carnivore
- **[08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iV6osRQSbXE&t=532s)** — that improve their blood pressure, their heart function,
- **[08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iV6osRQSbXE&t=535s)** — how many people come off medications
- **[08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iV6osRQSbXE&t=537s)** — that are related to the heart
- **[08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iV6osRQSbXE&t=539s)** — when they do all animal products.
- **[09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iV6osRQSbXE&t=542s)** — It's a lot. Some studies have shown that higher consumption
- **[09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iV6osRQSbXE&t=546s)** — of red meat and processed meat might be associated
- **[09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iV6osRQSbXE&t=548s)** — with higher risk of developing type 2 diabetes.
- **[09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iV6osRQSbXE&t=550s)** — Well, I would love to see those studies.
- **[09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iV6osRQSbXE&t=552s)** — Well, I actually already looked at them
- **[09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iV6osRQSbXE&t=554s)** — and they're observational studies,
- **[09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iV6osRQSbXE&t=556s)** — which by the way, are only meant to develop theories.
- **[09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iV6osRQSbXE&t=559s)** — They're not meant to prove something
- **[09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iV6osRQSbXE&t=562s)** — as it being causative.
- **[09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iV6osRQSbXE&t=566s)** — So what does the research say?
- **[09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iV6osRQSbXE&t=567s)** — Moderation is the key.
- **[09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iV6osRQSbXE&t=569s)** — We have that word again coming up.
- **[09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iV6osRQSbXE&t=570s)** — For example, serving red meat a few times a week,
- **[09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iV6osRQSbXE&t=574s)** — around three to four ounces per serving.
- **[09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iV6osRQSbXE&t=576s)** — Really?
- **[09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iV6osRQSbXE&t=577s)** — No, I consume red meat almost every single day.
- **[09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iV6osRQSbXE&t=580s)** — How much red meat is healthy?
- **[09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iV6osRQSbXE&t=581s)** — Well, the American Heart Association,
- **[09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iV6osRQSbXE&t=583s)** — which by the way, is a private corporation
- **[09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iV6osRQSbXE&t=586s)** — funded by big food.
- **[09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iV6osRQSbXE&t=589s)** — I'm talking about the junk food industry
- **[09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iV6osRQSbXE&t=591s)** — as well as big pharma.
- **[09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iV6osRQSbXE&t=592s)** — You really think that the American Heart Association
- **[09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iV6osRQSbXE&t=594s)** — can be independent and stay independent?
- **[09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iV6osRQSbXE&t=597s)** — No, they can't.
- **[09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iV6osRQSbXE&t=598s)** — American Heart Association recommends
- **[09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iV6osRQSbXE&t=599s)** — limiting red meat in no more than one to two servings per week,
- **[10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iV6osRQSbXE&t=603s)** — with each serving being around three to four ounces.
- **[10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iV6osRQSbXE&t=605s)** — This is actually valuable information
- **[10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iV6osRQSbXE&t=607s)** — to find out what they're recommending you don't do
- **[10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iV6osRQSbXE&t=610s)** — so you can start doing it.
- **[10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iV6osRQSbXE&t=611s)** — I think that would be the only use.
- **[10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iV6osRQSbXE&t=614s)** — The link between red meat and cancer
- **[10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iV6osRQSbXE&t=615s)** — has been a subject of extensive research.
- **[10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iV6osRQSbXE&t=618s)** — And while red meat does not directly cause cancer,
- **[10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iV6osRQSbXE&t=621s)** — there's evidence that excessive consumption
- **[10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iV6osRQSbXE&t=624s)** — of certain types of red meat, processed meat,
- **[10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iV6osRQSbXE&t=627s)** — may increase the risk of cancer.
- **[10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iV6osRQSbXE&t=629s)** — It's just interesting to me
- **[10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iV6osRQSbXE&t=630s)** — how they have to throw those both into the same category
- **[10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iV6osRQSbXE&t=634s)** — when the truth is there is no credible research on red meat.
- **[10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iV6osRQSbXE&t=639s)** — Then I asked Chet Chappie-Tea
- **[10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iV6osRQSbXE&t=641s)** — from a diet and nutrition consideration,
- **[10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iV6osRQSbXE&t=643s)** — what would you recommend for the following conditions?
- **[10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iV6osRQSbXE&t=647s)** — So I'm talking about like autoimmune diseases,
- **[10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iV6osRQSbXE&t=650s)** — fibroids, cancer, glaucoma, ulcers, heartburn,
- **[10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iV6osRQSbXE&t=653s)** — brain fog, peripheral neuropathy,
- **[10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iV6osRQSbXE&t=655s)** — which is a lack of sensation or pain
- **[10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iV6osRQSbXE&t=658s)** — in the bottom of your feet,
- **[11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iV6osRQSbXE&t=660s)** — heart disease and clogged arteries,
- **[11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iV6osRQSbXE&t=662s)** — just to see what they would recommend.
- **[11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iV6osRQSbXE&t=665s)** — Cause that would tell me a lot about
- **[11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iV6osRQSbXE&t=667s)** — where the recommendations came from.
- **[11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iV6osRQSbXE&t=668s)** — Let's start with autoimmune diseases.
- **[11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iV6osRQSbXE&t=671s)** — And they're recommending, you know,
- **[11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iV6osRQSbXE&t=673s)** — omega-3 fatty acids, fruits, vegetables,
- **[11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iV6osRQSbXE&t=676s)** — curcumin, avoid processed food,
- **[11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iV6osRQSbXE&t=678s)** — gluten, nightshade vegetables.
- **[11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iV6osRQSbXE&t=680s)** — That's fine, but none of that is going to
- **[11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iV6osRQSbXE&t=684s)** — put your autoimmune disease in remission.
- **[11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iV6osRQSbXE&t=686s)** — To put any autoimmune condition into remission,
- **[11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iV6osRQSbXE&t=690s)** — you have to do two things.
- **[11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iV6osRQSbXE&t=691s)** — You have to really raise your vitamin D levels
- **[11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iV6osRQSbXE&t=695s)** — to a therapeutic dose.
- **[11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iV6osRQSbXE&t=697s)** — Because vitamin D helps prevent the immune system
- **[11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iV6osRQSbXE&t=700s)** — from making a mistake and attacking its own tissues
- **[11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iV6osRQSbXE&t=703s)** — instead of a microbe or a pathogen.
- **[11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iV6osRQSbXE&t=706s)** — You need a lot of vitamin D
- **[11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iV6osRQSbXE&t=707s)** — and it's called the Coimbra protocol.
- **[11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iV6osRQSbXE&t=709s)** — Instead they have other things that are okay,
- **[11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iV6osRQSbXE&t=712s)** — but they're not significant in putting your
- **[11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iV6osRQSbXE&t=715s)** — autoimmune disease back in remission.
- **[11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iV6osRQSbXE&t=717s)** — Cancer, they're going to recommend plant-based
- **[11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iV6osRQSbXE&t=719s)** — vegetables, cruciferous, healthy fats, et cetera, et cetera.
- **[12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iV6osRQSbXE&t=723s)** — Depending on how severe your cancer is,
- **[12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iV6osRQSbXE&t=725s)** — yes, you need to clean up the junk food
- **[12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iV6osRQSbXE&t=727s)** — and eat healthier, but fasting,
- **[12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iV6osRQSbXE&t=730s)** — that's not even in here, right?
- **[12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iV6osRQSbXE&t=731s)** — Prolonged fasting is the most powerful thing
- **[12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iV6osRQSbXE&t=734s)** — you can do for cancer, especially stage four.
- **[12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iV6osRQSbXE&t=738s)** — Let's get to ulcers, non-acidic foods,
- **[12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iV6osRQSbXE&t=740s)** — bananas, apples, cooked vegetables, oatmeal, probiotics,
- **[12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iV6osRQSbXE&t=744s)** — slippery elm bark, avoid spicy foods.
- **[12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iV6osRQSbXE&t=746s)** — Again, it's not going to work.
- **[12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iV6osRQSbXE&t=748s)** — You need zinc carnosine.
- **[12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iV6osRQSbXE&t=750s)** — The advantage that I've been fortunate to get
- **[12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iV6osRQSbXE&t=752s)** — is experience working one-on-one
- **[12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iV6osRQSbXE&t=755s)** — with a lot of people over many, many years
- **[12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iV6osRQSbXE&t=758s)** — that have been validated by many, many people.
- **[12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iV6osRQSbXE&t=761s)** — How much ultra-processed foods,
- **[12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iV6osRQSbXE&t=762s)** — aka junk foods, can we eat
- **[12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iV6osRQSbXE&t=764s)** — to still live a healthy life?
- **[12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iV6osRQSbXE&t=767s)** — While eating ultra-processed foods occasionally,
- **[12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iV6osRQSbXE&t=769s)** — won't necessarily derail your health.
- **[12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iV6osRQSbXE&t=773s)** — The key is, can you guess what they're going to say?
- **[12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iV6osRQSbXE&t=776s)** — Moderation.
- **[12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iV6osRQSbXE&t=778s)** — Limit the ultra-processed food calories
- **[13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iV6osRQSbXE&t=780s)** — to less than 20 to 25% of your total calories.
- **[13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iV6osRQSbXE&t=784s)** — If you're doing 2,000 calories per day,
- **[13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iV6osRQSbXE&t=788s)** — they're telling us to consume 500 calories
- **[13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iV6osRQSbXE&t=791s)** — of all ultra-processed foods every single day.
- **[13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iV6osRQSbXE&t=794s)** — Well, we have Pop-Tarts.
- **[13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iV6osRQSbXE&t=796s)** — Let's see, that's 370 calories.
- **[13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iV6osRQSbXE&t=800s)** — So I can actually take two of these
- **[13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iV6osRQSbXE&t=802s)** — and probably another one of these.
- **[13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iV6osRQSbXE&t=805s)** — So three Pop-Tarts every single day
- **[13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iV6osRQSbXE&t=807s)** — and still maintain my healthy lifestyle.
- **[13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iV6osRQSbXE&t=812s)** — Now that you have that information,
- **[13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iV6osRQSbXE&t=813s)** — I think it's really important to have the truth
- **[13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iV6osRQSbXE&t=816s)** — about what to eat to create a healthy body.
- **[13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iV6osRQSbXE&t=820s)** — And for that information,
- **[13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iV6osRQSbXE&t=821s)** — you should watch this video right here.
- **[13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iV6osRQSbXE&t=824s)** — Yeah, click this one right now.

- **[00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D2VwqySGwA&t=0s)** — Let's talk about the kidney and how amazing it is and how to protect it and exactly what you should
- **[00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D2VwqySGwA&t=6s)** — be taking to minimize any type of toxicity or damage to the kidney, especially long term.
- **[00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D2VwqySGwA&t=12s)** — The kidney is actually very rugged. It's similar to the liver in that it can take a beating,
- **[00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D2VwqySGwA&t=18s)** — but it can regenerate. Each kidney is composed of roughly about a million tiny little filters.
- **[00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D2VwqySGwA&t=25s)** — And these kidneys have to filter all day and all night long, 24-7, constantly. And they filter blood.
- **[00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D2VwqySGwA&t=32s)** — And so where does the blood come from? Well, it comes from what you eat, right? So all the food
- **[00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D2VwqySGwA&t=36s)** — that you eat, all the junk food, all the alcohol that you drink, all the medications and the
- **[00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D2VwqySGwA&t=42s)** — drugs that you're exposed to, all the pollution, all the plastics end up in the blood and then
- **[00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D2VwqySGwA&t=47s)** — they end up in the kidney. And your kidney just has to be able to differentiate what it
- **[00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D2VwqySGwA&t=52s)** — recycle and what it needs to get rid of. So there's a high degree of complexity going on
- **[00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D2VwqySGwA&t=57s)** — in this little filter called the nephron. And as you age, you start losing these little
- **[01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D2VwqySGwA&t=62s)** — filters to the point where you can actually lose up to 20% of your kidney. Okay. They
- **[01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D2VwqySGwA&t=66s)** — can shrink as you age. And so it becomes even more important that as you age, you really start
- **[01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D2VwqySGwA&t=73s)** — eating better and are exposed to less toxins, drugs, and medications. Of course, that's just
- **[01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D2VwqySGwA&t=79s)** — opposite. As we age, we take more medications and unfortunately, older people, especially
- **[01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D2VwqySGwA&t=85s)** — if they end up in some type of home, are not eating the right foods. The kidneys also make
- **[01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D2VwqySGwA&t=92s)** — certain hormones, one being to make red blood cells. The other one is for blood pressure.
- **[01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D2VwqySGwA&t=97s)** — But let's dive into some things that really destroy the kidney. And there's even so-called
- **[01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D2VwqySGwA&t=103s)** — healthy foods that are destroying the kidney. We'll talk about those as well.
- **[01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D2VwqySGwA&t=107s)** — Let's first talk about what makes up a kidney stone, right? Because having a kidney stone can
- **[01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D2VwqySGwA&t=113s)** — create a lot of damage to your kidney, especially because it has these little crystals
- **[01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D2VwqySGwA&t=117s)** — that can damage and create scar tissue of the kidney itself, as well as a little tube
- **[02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D2VwqySGwA&t=122s)** — that connects the kidney to the bladder. So kidney stones most commonly come from what's
- **[02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D2VwqySGwA&t=127s)** — called oxalate stones, like calcium oxalate stones. But you can also get them in a form
- **[02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D2VwqySGwA&t=132s)** — of uric acid stones as well. One of the most important things to do, especially if you're
- **[02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D2VwqySGwA&t=139s)** — prone to kidney stones, is to limit the amount of oxalates that you're exposed to.
- **[02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D2VwqySGwA&t=144s)** — And if you're on the ketogenic plan, chances are you're probably eating something right now
- **[02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D2VwqySGwA&t=148s)** — that is very high in oxalates. So almonds, spinach, beet tops, peanuts, grains,
- **[02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D2VwqySGwA&t=157s)** — beans, sweet potatoes, cassava, tapioca, which comes from cassava, kiwi, chocolate,
- **[02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D2VwqySGwA&t=166s)** — swiss chard, turmeric has a good amount of oxalates. However, turmeric has a lot of
- **[02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D2VwqySGwA&t=172s)** — other properties to help decrease inflammation, as well as prevent the binding of calcium
- **[02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D2VwqySGwA&t=177s)** — in oxalates. But also cinnamon is a bit high in oxalates, as well as clove. Now,
- **[03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D2VwqySGwA&t=184s)** — other point I want to mention about these oxalates, because they can really create
- **[03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D2VwqySGwA&t=189s)** — some issues that go beyond just problems in the kidney. They can create arthritis,
- **[03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D2VwqySGwA&t=196s)** — as well as something called pseudo gout. Gout is normally created by this uric acid crystal
- **[03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D2VwqySGwA&t=203s)** — that's developing. But with pseudo gout, it's not uric acid. There's some other types of
- **[03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D2VwqySGwA&t=209s)** — are developing from calcium, and also can be worsened if you have high levels of oxalates,
- **[03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D2VwqySGwA&t=218s)** — right? Either in the diet or your body is just making them. One point about pseudo gout is
- **[03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D2VwqySGwA&t=223s)** — that anything that increases the excretion of too much calcium could worsen it. Okay. And
- **[03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D2VwqySGwA&t=232s)** — enough too much salt can cause a release of this calcium from the kidneys. So if you currently
- **[04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D2VwqySGwA&t=241s)** — are consuming a lot of salt, and probably not enough potassium, you might want to just make
- **[04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D2VwqySGwA&t=246s)** — a change and see if that doesn't help you. For the most population, you can handle a lot of
- **[04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D2VwqySGwA&t=250s)** — salt. But for a select small group of people, especially if they have gout or even pseudo
- **[04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D2VwqySGwA&t=255s)** — gout, they might do better without excessive salt. I think really the big problem is the
- **[04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D2VwqySGwA&t=261s)** — ratio of potassium to sodium. And if you had enough potassium, your salt level would be fine.
- **[04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D2VwqySGwA&t=268s)** — But I would just recommend playing around with the dosage and start lowering the salt and
- **[04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D2VwqySGwA&t=272s)** — raising the potassium and see if you don't feel better. So by decreasing the salt,
- **[04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D2VwqySGwA&t=276s)** — you're going to be excreting calcium a lot less, and it won't develop into crystals.
- **[04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D2VwqySGwA&t=281s)** — The other interesting point about oxlets has to do with malabsorption in your gut. If you
- **[04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D2VwqySGwA&t=290s)** — have malabsorption, and I'm talking about damage in the gut, let's say you have inflammation,
- **[04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D2VwqySGwA&t=294s)** — you have celiac or Crohn's or irritable bowel syndrome, gastric bypass, for example. So
- **[05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D2VwqySGwA&t=300s)** — there's a certain level of damage in your digestive tract that doesn't allow you to
- **[05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D2VwqySGwA&t=305s)** — absorb certain things, especially fats. And if you're doing the ketogenic diet,
- **[05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D2VwqySGwA&t=313s)** — or even carnivore, and you have all this fat that's coming into the gut, but you can't really
- **[05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D2VwqySGwA&t=318s)** — absorb the fat, some of that fat is going to bind with the calcium. And that's going to
- **[05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D2VwqySGwA&t=324s)** — leave the oxlets free to be reabsorbed, go into your blood, and end up in a kidney.
- **[05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D2VwqySGwA&t=330s)** — So there is this interesting connection between fat binding to calcium and then freeing up this
- **[05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D2VwqySGwA&t=336s)** — oxlet. If you're eating foods low in oxlets, you'd have nothing to worry about. Also, another
- **[05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D2VwqySGwA&t=341s)** — point about that, if you're eating foods high in oxlets and you take more calcium with it,
- **[05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D2VwqySGwA&t=347s)** — maybe through the dairy, then you're also protected. So if you're going to do some
- **[05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D2VwqySGwA&t=352s)** — spinach dish and you had cheese with it, that might be helpful. So that's just another way
- **[05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D2VwqySGwA&t=359s)** — to counter the damage of these oxlets on the kidney. Since the kidney can be very sensitive
- **[06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D2VwqySGwA&t=364s)** — to too much uric acid and oxlets, when they usually do a urine test for people with gout
- **[06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D2VwqySGwA&t=371s)** — or kidney stones, they usually always find that there's excessive amounts of calcium in
- **[06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D2VwqySGwA&t=377s)** — the urine, excessive amounts of uric acid, oxlets, and there's also lower amounts of this
- **[06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D2VwqySGwA&t=388s)** — Also, you can get it from consuming citrus, like lemons or limes. And citrus is really
- **[06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D2VwqySGwA&t=397s)** — interesting because it actually binds with the oxlets in a way that prevents the calcium from
- **[06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D2VwqySGwA&t=403s)** — binding and it can lower your risk of getting kidney stones. And the thing about consuming
- **[06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D2VwqySGwA&t=409s)** — lemons is that they're alkaline. That's one way to counter gout if you have too much
- **[06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D2VwqySGwA&t=415s)** — So this is why lemons are really good for the kidney. They protect the kidney.
- **[07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D2VwqySGwA&t=422s)** — They have potassium in there. They provide some alkalinity, but they also protect against these
- **[07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D2VwqySGwA&t=428s)** — oxlets. Another interesting natural remedy would be apple cider vinegar. Take like a tablespoon
- **[07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D2VwqySGwA&t=435s)** — in your water in the morning as a way to prevent stones. Let me just kind of circle back
- **[07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D2VwqySGwA&t=440s)** — potassium again and talk a little bit more about that. Potassium is probably one of the
- **[07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D2VwqySGwA&t=446s)** — best minerals to protect the kidney and people are so concerned about taking potassium
- **[07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D2VwqySGwA&t=453s)** — because they've heard something that potassium is bad for the kidney. It's only bad if you
- **[07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D2VwqySGwA&t=458s)** — have a stage five kidney disease, like end stage kidney disease, where you wouldn't want
- **[07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D2VwqySGwA&t=463s)** — to take potassium. But apparently, even if there is some damage to the kidney,
- **[07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D2VwqySGwA&t=468s)** — potassium can be protective. So since the general population doesn't consume a lot of
- **[07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D2VwqySGwA&t=472s)** — potassium foods, potassium in a like electrolyte powder or just high potassium foods are very,
- **[07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D2VwqySGwA&t=478s)** — very beneficial for the kidney and they can help balance it. The sodium, leafy greens,
- **[08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D2VwqySGwA&t=484s)** — large salads, avocados, very, very high in potassium. Well, but so are beet leaves,
- **[08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D2VwqySGwA&t=490s)** — but beet leaves are very high in oxlets. So you want to consume vegetables that are high in
- **[08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D2VwqySGwA&t=497s)** — potassium, but low in oxlets. And so even though spinach is very high in potassium,
- **[08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D2VwqySGwA&t=503s)** — you wouldn't want to do it because it's high in oxlets as well. But there's other things you
- **[08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D2VwqySGwA&t=506s)** — can do to counter that damage. You can actually, again, have a little cheese with that.
- **[08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D2VwqySGwA&t=510s)** — And that way it'll give you the calcium to prevent some of those oxlets from
- **[08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D2VwqySGwA&t=514s)** — binding. But I probably didn't talk about the most damaging thing to your kidney,
- **[08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D2VwqySGwA&t=519s)** — which is sugar. Okay. Because the number one cause of end stage kidney disease is
- **[08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D2VwqySGwA&t=527s)** — diabetes. Right. And that comes from a high carb diet. You know, it's so interesting. If
- **[08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D2VwqySGwA&t=531s)** — you look at the flips out of that, the ketogenic diet, low carb, you might hear reports
- **[08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D2VwqySGwA&t=537s)** — that, Oh, the ketogenic diet is really bad for your kidneys. So you need to avoid it
- **[09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D2VwqySGwA&t=543s)** — because you might develop a ketoacidosis. And well, first of all, we're always recommending
- **[09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D2VwqySGwA&t=549s)** — the healthy version of the ketogenic diet. So you're not going to develop
- **[09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D2VwqySGwA&t=553s)** — ketoacidosis. Ketoacidosis occurs when you're a diabetic and you forget to take your insulin
- **[09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D2VwqySGwA&t=557s)** — and you have super high levels of acidity and ketones, which you're never going to see
- **[09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D2VwqySGwA&t=564s)** — if you're not a diabetic. Actually ketones are very healthy for the kidney. And a high carb
- **[09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D2VwqySGwA&t=569s)** — diet is not very healthy to the kidney because you're exposing the kidney, the little filters
- **[09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D2VwqySGwA&t=574s)** — with so much oxidation. And that's basically kind of rusting out the kidney. And then what
- **[09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D2VwqySGwA&t=580s)** — happens is once you destroy that filter, then you start seeing glucose in the urine
- **[09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D2VwqySGwA&t=586s)** — because we're not recycling it anymore. And one test to evaluate what's going on the kidneys
- **[09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D2VwqySGwA&t=591s)** — is actually to check your blood, like your waste product of protein is called urea. So it's
- **[09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D2VwqySGwA&t=597s)** — called blood urea nitrogen. So with kidney disease, you'll see excessive amount of protein
- **[10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D2VwqySGwA&t=603s)** — in the urine, which is not good, but you also see urea or a waste product of protein
- **[10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D2VwqySGwA&t=608s)** — in the blood. But you also see another compound called creatinine in the urine as well in
- **[10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D2VwqySGwA&t=616s)** — excessive amounts. And that just indicates there's another protein problem with your
- **[10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D2VwqySGwA&t=620s)** — muscles not being handled by the kidney. But creatinine can also occur from other
- **[10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D2VwqySGwA&t=625s)** — reasons as well, because when you eat a lot of cooked meat, when you cook it,
- **[10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D2VwqySGwA&t=631s)** — you actually convert creatine to creatinine and that can show up in the urine, as well as
- **[10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D2VwqySGwA&t=636s)** — consuming just large amounts of protein. But typically you're only going to see a problem with
- **[10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D2VwqySGwA&t=640s)** — that if your kidneys are not healthy. If your kidneys are healthy and you're eating a lot of
- **[10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D2VwqySGwA&t=644s)** — protein, I think you're not going to see any problem. In fact, I really have not found any
- **[10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D2VwqySGwA&t=650s)** — really good evidence to show that eating too much protein will do any damage to the kidney.
- **[10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D2VwqySGwA&t=656s)** — It's usually when someone's eating a lot of protein and a lot of sugar at the same time.
- **[10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D2VwqySGwA&t=659s)** — But creatinine can also show up if there's liver damage or even as a side effect from taking ACE
- **[11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D2VwqySGwA&t=664s)** — inhibitors, which are medications for blood pressure, or if you're doing heavy duty exercise,
- **[11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D2VwqySGwA&t=671s)** — it can show up. So you have to be able to differentiate is a kidney problem or
- **[11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D2VwqySGwA&t=675s)** — is it something else. So let's just summarize some of the things you can do to really keep
- **[11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D2VwqySGwA&t=679s)** — these kidneys in check. I would do lemon water every morning. If you can squeeze a lemon,
- **[11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D2VwqySGwA&t=685s)** — would be best. Put it in the water, add your outside of vinegar, drink your liquids. It's
- **[11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D2VwqySGwA&t=692s)** — probably a good idea, especially if you're prone to kidney stones to consume two and a
- **[11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D2VwqySGwA&t=696s)** — half liters of water because kidney stone occurs because there's a super saturated amount
- **[11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D2VwqySGwA&t=702s)** — of urine and you're getting all these crystals developing. So if you're drinking enough
- **[11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D2VwqySGwA&t=707s)** — liquids, you're going to be fine with that. Second point is to avoid high oxalate type
- **[11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D2VwqySGwA&t=712s)** — Of course, there's a lot more to talk about that, but I gave you the ones that are like
- **[11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D2VwqySGwA&t=715s)** — the most important. And if you do eat foods, high in oxalates, well add some dairy to it or
- **[12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D2VwqySGwA&t=720s)** — add some calcium to counter that. And of course, a really important point is to go on
- **[12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D2VwqySGwA&t=725s)** — the low carb ketogenic plan within a minute fasting. And also out of all the sugars,
- **[12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D2VwqySGwA&t=731s)** — fructose, by the way, and I want to just add this to the mix, can really spike your
- **[12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D2VwqySGwA&t=736s)** — acid more than a lot of other things. So fructose is really, really bad as in high
- **[12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D2VwqySGwA&t=742s)** — fructose corn syrup. Also, when you're consuming a lot of vitamin C, and I know there is some
- **[12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D2VwqySGwA&t=747s)** — benefits of doing high levels of vitamin C for certain things. But if you're trying to
- **[12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D2VwqySGwA&t=752s)** — get rid of your gout or your pseudo gout and you're consuming massive amounts of vitamin C
- **[12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D2VwqySGwA&t=758s)** — in the form of the scorpic acid, well, just make some changes, cut that out for a couple
- **[12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D2VwqySGwA&t=762s)** — days and see if your pain doesn't just go away. I just wanted to, in this video, include a lot
- **[12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D2VwqySGwA&t=767s)** — of different links to things that could be aggravating your condition. Now, let's say you
- **[12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D2VwqySGwA&t=773s)** — are a diabetic or you have kidney damage already. There are things you can do to help
- **[12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D2VwqySGwA&t=778s)** — protect the kidney even more. In addition to potassium, and that would be consuming a lot
- **[13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D2VwqySGwA&t=783s)** — of the phytonutrients or the antioxidants in certain plant foods, especially in microgreens,
- **[13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D2VwqySGwA&t=790s)** — which are these little baby plants. They grow a little bit more than sprouts. I recommend the
- **[13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D2VwqySGwA&t=797s)** — ones grown in soil if you can get them. And the reason I'm saying that is if you're consuming
- **[13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D2VwqySGwA&t=801s)** — microgreens compared to adult vegetables, you're going to get some of these phytonutrients
- **[13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D2VwqySGwA&t=807s)** — in levels that are 20, 50 to a hundred times more than the adult vegetables. So
- **[13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D2VwqySGwA&t=814s)** — all it takes is a small amount of these things to create a big effect. And if you're
- **[13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D2VwqySGwA&t=819s)** — trying to protect the kidney, this is very doable. It's very easy. Just add it to your salad
- **[13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D2VwqySGwA&t=825s)** — and it can help protect you. And I'm talking about the phytonutrients like
- **[13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D2VwqySGwA&t=830s)** — sulforaphane, flavonoids, carotenoids, even chlorophyll. All of those are really good
- **[13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D2VwqySGwA&t=835s)** — to protect the kidney. But just one last point about that. Turmeric does have high
- **[13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D2VwqySGwA&t=839s)** — levels of oxalates. So there's mixed reviews on that powerful phytonutrient. Now that you
- **[14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D2VwqySGwA&t=849s)** — know, the seven warning signs of a toxic kidney, I put that up right here. Check it out.

- **[00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h81qq8Ne3go&t=0s)** — so there was a doctor, Gil Carvalho, who did a fact checking video on me, so today we're going to do a fact checking video on the fact checker.
- **[00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h81qq8Ne3go&t=9s)** — so we got a ton of requests from a lot of you guys to comment on this video.
- **[00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h81qq8Ne3go&t=14s)** — okay, so the first thing he says is there's a ton of you that requested to do a video on one of my videos.
- **[00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h81qq8Ne3go&t=22s)** — hmm, what does my channel have to do with your channel? i'm just curious, like,
- **[00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h81qq8Ne3go&t=28s)** — can you just maybe show us how many people actually requested this video? we're going to focus only on
- **[00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h81qq8Ne3go&t=35s)** — the substance. no ad ominums. i didn't google him, i don't know anything about him, i didn't go watch
- **[00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h81qq8Ne3go&t=40s)** — a bunch of his other videos for context, nothing. because it doesn't matter. the only thing that
- **[00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h81qq8Ne3go&t=46s)** — matters is whether the claims match the evidence. so don't you hate that when you know that
- **[00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h81qq8Ne3go&t=50s)** — there's some bad news coming, there are some negative things about you coming, but they kind of
- **[00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h81qq8Ne3go&t=58s)** — won't... we'll be really nice to them. as someone maybe pushes you underneath the bus. okay, let's continue.
- **[01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h81qq8Ne3go&t=64s)** — let's go. this was in 2018. the new guidelines by the american heart association. okay, this is
- **[01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h81qq8Ne3go&t=70s)** — brand new. they said total cholesterol is not significantly associated with heart disease.
- **[01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h81qq8Ne3go&t=79s)** — okay, that's a new finding. they just found out. looking at your total cholesterol doesn't
- **[01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h81qq8Ne3go&t=84s)** — really give you a lot of information in relationship to predicting heart disease.
- **[01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h81qq8Ne3go&t=92s)** — i don't know what he's talking about. total cholesterol is not the best marker,
- **[01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h81qq8Ne3go&t=95s)** — it's a dirty marker, but it definitely associates with cardiovascular disease with heart disease.
- **[01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h81qq8Ne3go&t=101s)** — i don't remember any american heart association guidelines saying that it just doesn't associate,
- **[01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h81qq8Ne3go&t=106s)** — period. here's the 2018 american heart association guidelines. like he said,
- **[01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h81qq8Ne3go&t=111s)** — population studies suggest optimal total cholesterol levels are about 150. populations
- **[01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h81qq8Ne3go&t=117s)** — with cholesterol in this range manifest low rates of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease.
- **[02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h81qq8Ne3go&t=123s)** — nobody's saying it's the best marker but this is the opposite of what he's saying. i've read
- **[02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h81qq8Ne3go&t=126s)** — these guidelines, there's nothing in there about total cholesterol not associating, period.
- **[02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h81qq8Ne3go&t=132s)** — maybe he saw something else and misunderstood it. is there anything in the description that he
- **[02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h81qq8Ne3go&t=138s)** — has a reference to? okay, two links to journals. that's good. american heart association journal,
- **[02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h81qq8Ne3go&t=145s)** — that's probably it. let's click here. all right, sweet. um wait, this is scientific
- **[02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h81qq8Ne3go&t=153s)** — advisory for dietary cholesterol? no way, no way! don't tell me this guy's confusing... wow!
- **[02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h81qq8Ne3go&t=165s)** — yep, here's the passage he's referring to. oh my god. generally no significant association with
- **[02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h81qq8Ne3go&t=174s)** — cardiovascular disease risk. but this document is the scientific... this is the science advisory
- **[03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h81qq8Ne3go&t=180s)** — on dietary cholesterol. i think most people understand the difference but just in case.
- **[03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h81qq8Ne3go&t=185s)** — all right, so that sounds a little bit staged but nevertheless he's absolutely correct. i did
- **[03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h81qq8Ne3go&t=190s)** — make a mistake. the american heart association did not say that but they did say that the
- **[03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h81qq8Ne3go&t=196s)** — dietary cholesterol is not associated with cardiovascular risk. however, if you take a look
- **[03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h81qq8Ne3go&t=202s)** — at this paper in 2018 entitled LDL cholesterol does not cause cardiovascular disease. a
- **[03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h81qq8Ne3go&t=210s)** — comprehensive review of the current literature under section 2. does high cholesterol cause
- **[03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h81qq8Ne3go&t=217s)** — atherosclerosis? and in summary no association between total cholesterol and degree of
- **[03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h81qq8Ne3go&t=225s)** — atherosclerosis. that's stuff that clogs up your arteries. so gill's point is correct.
- **[03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h81qq8Ne3go&t=230s)** — american heart association did not say that but another paper did say that. so both dietary
- **[03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h81qq8Ne3go&t=236s)** — cholesterol and blood level cholesterol is not associated with cardiovascular risk. more
- **[04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h81qq8Ne3go&t=244s)** — on. particle size no longer predicts risk. it's just like the ashtray analogy. and they add two
- **[04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h81qq8Ne3go&t=251s)** — more lines of evidence. okay wait a second. let's go back to this for a second. saturated fats
- **[04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h81qq8Ne3go&t=256s)** — in cardiovascular health, current evidence and controversies. this is an editorial
- **[04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h81qq8Ne3go&t=262s)** — piece. it's not an actual study. it's someone talking about the data. and they add two more
- **[04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h81qq8Ne3go&t=268s)** — lines of evidence. statins which have a well-established effect of lowering risk
- **[04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h81qq8Ne3go&t=273s)** — preferentially reduce large ldl. and number two, patients with familial hypercholesterolemia
- **[04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h81qq8Ne3go&t=280s)** — which is a disease where people have very high cholesterol and very high risk of heart disease,
- **[04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h81qq8Ne3go&t=284s)** — they have mainly large ldls and they are at high risk indicating that large ldls are not
- **[04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h81qq8Ne3go&t=291s)** — benign. okay the next point he brings up which is rather a long explanation. i'm going
- **[04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h81qq8Ne3go&t=298s)** — summarize it because it gets into a lot of additional things which are a bit complex.
- **[05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h81qq8Ne3go&t=303s)** — but basically the point i was making was that you have two different size particles
- **[05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h81qq8Ne3go&t=309s)** — with ldl. you have small dents and you have large buoyant. okay and i was making a point
- **[05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h81qq8Ne3go&t=317s)** — that the small dents were more pathological. they create more problems than the large buoyant
- **[05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h81qq8Ne3go&t=325s)** — and so then he shows several references that it's not true. they're both damaging especially if
- **[05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h81qq8Ne3go&t=331s)** — you look at the total concentration of ldls. if that's high, that's going to be a bigger
- **[05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h81qq8Ne3go&t=336s)** — problem. but there was two additional studies that i want to show you right now that
- **[05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h81qq8Ne3go&t=343s)** — came a little bit later than the one he posted. this one was originally published in 15
- **[05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h81qq8Ne3go&t=347s)** — february 2021. small dense low density lipoprotein. that would be the small dense
- **[05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h81qq8Ne3go&t=354s)** — ldl. cholesterol is the most atherogenic lipoprotein parameter in the prospective
- **[06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h81qq8Ne3go&t=362s)** — bramingham offspring study. in the conclusion it says our data indicate that small dense
- **[06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h81qq8Ne3go&t=368s)** — ldl is the most atherogenic lipoprotein parameter. and then there's one more study i
- **[06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h81qq8Ne3go&t=376s)** — showed in 2017. small dense low density lipoprotein. that's ldl. as biomarker for
- **[06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h81qq8Ne3go&t=384s)** — atherosclerotic diseases. so this is the conclusion. the results of the recent study
- **[06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h81qq8Ne3go&t=389s)** — demonstrate that ldl fractions. talking about the low dense versus the large buoyant. the two
- **[06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h81qq8Ne3go&t=397s)** — different particle sizes have different atherogenicity. that means ability to affect
- **[06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h81qq8Ne3go&t=403s)** — with the small dense ldl being more atherogenic than the large ldl sub fractions. small dense
- **[06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h81qq8Ne3go&t=412s)** — ldl is characterized by the enhanced ability to penetrate the arterial wall that makes
- **[06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h81qq8Ne3go&t=418s)** — it a potent source of cholesterol for the development of atherosclerotic plaque. importantly
- **[07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h81qq8Ne3go&t=426s)** — longer circulation times of small dense ldl result in multiple atherogenic modifications
- **[07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h81qq8Ne3go&t=433s)** — of small dense ldl particles in plasma. that's your blood. further increasing its
- **[07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h81qq8Ne3go&t=439s)** — atherogenicity. now they just mentioned why the small dense ldl is more pathogenic.
- **[07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h81qq8Ne3go&t=445s)** — because it has the ability to penetrate the deeper walls. as well as having a longer
- **[07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h81qq8Ne3go&t=452s)** — circulation time. the longer that a small dense ldl is exposed to the arteries, it's going to
- **[07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h81qq8Ne3go&t=460s)** — create more problems. and there was some additional data that there's more oxidation
- **[07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h81qq8Ne3go&t=464s)** — going on with the small dense ldl than the large buoyant. okay, let's move to a different
- **[07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h81qq8Ne3go&t=469s)** — topic. one little thing that dr gill kept bringing up was this word we. he keeps saying,
- **[07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h81qq8Ne3go&t=478s)** — this or we're doing that. my first thought was, i thought you were an independent guy who just
- **[08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h81qq8Ne3go&t=485s)** — basically is putting out the message and doing videos on various topics. it's not on his
- **[08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h81qq8Ne3go&t=490s)** — youtube channel. i had to do a little searching. and i suspect it's a group that he's a member
- **[08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h81qq8Ne3go&t=494s)** — of. and of course i'm just guessing but that's the only group that i could find. so dr gill
- **[08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h81qq8Ne3go&t=499s)** — is a member or council member of an organization called true health initiative. so let's take a
- **[08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h81qq8Ne3go&t=505s)** — look at what this organization is. plant-based diets for reversing disease and saving the
- **[08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h81qq8Ne3go&t=511s)** — planet. okay, so this is a plant-based organization. all right, let's go down to the bottom and
- **[08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h81qq8Ne3go&t=518s)** — take a look at the purpose of this organization and what they do. okay, changing policy,
- **[08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h81qq8Ne3go&t=524s)** — changing minds, improving lives. we are a global coalition of world-renowned experts
- **[08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h81qq8Ne3go&t=529s)** — fighting fake facts and combating false doubts about creating a world free of preventable diseases
- **[08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h81qq8Ne3go&t=538s)** — using the time-honored evidence-based fundamentals of lifestyle as medicine. okay, so the whole
- **[09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h81qq8Ne3go&t=545s)** — mission is to fight fake facts and combat false doubts. okay, all right. so that must
- **[09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h81qq8Ne3go&t=552s)** — be the organization that he's talking about when we're talking about we. if we scroll down
- **[09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h81qq8Ne3go&t=556s)** — we see no beef week challenge. okay, so this is definitely a vegan or vegetarian type
- **[09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h81qq8Ne3go&t=563s)** — group supporting the benefits of plant-based. let's take a look at their partners, the true
- **[09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h81qq8Ne3go&t=569s)** — health initiative partners. okay, we have no beef. so i can see very clearly they're against
- **[09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h81qq8Ne3go&t=574s)** — beef. now if you look at how many videos that i have on meat and beef, there's a lot. i
- **[09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h81qq8Ne3go&t=585s)** — actually am pro beef. right? i tell people to consume beef. now i see why this fact checking
- **[09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h81qq8Ne3go&t=589s)** — video was created. dr gill also did one on dr ekberg who also has the same philosophy
- **[09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h81qq8Ne3go&t=595s)** — because we're into the healthy version of the ketogenic diet. okay, so now it's all making a
- **[10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h81qq8Ne3go&t=600s)** — lot more sense. so dr gill, if you're watching, i just want to let you know i
- **[10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h81qq8Ne3go&t=605s)** — did participate in a study involving grass-fed beef and from farmers all over united states.
- **[10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h81qq8Ne3go&t=612s)** — and they submitted their beef into this study. and it was a metabolomic study looking at all
- **[10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h81qq8Ne3go&t=619s)** — these metabolites and comparing grass-fed to grain-fed beef. okay, and about six months
- **[10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h81qq8Ne3go&t=628s)** — after the study, the researcher called me up and said, what are you doing? i said, what do
- **[10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h81qq8Ne3go&t=634s)** — you mean? he says, take a look at this report. look at this first graph. total phytochemicals.
- **[10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h81qq8Ne3go&t=639s)** — phyto stands for plants. interesting. so you can clearly see the difference between the beef
- **[10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h81qq8Ne3go&t=644s)** — that i submitted for this research project as far as the amount of phytochemicals, plant-based
- **[10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h81qq8Ne3go&t=651s)** — chemicals in the beef. and this was compared to other farmers who had grass-fed and compared
- **[10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h81qq8Ne3go&t=656s)** — to grain-fed. so this was the total phytochemicals. okay, if we scroll down,
- **[11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h81qq8Ne3go&t=662s)** — we'll take a look at a very specific phytochemical called hypirate, which is the major
- **[11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h81qq8Ne3go&t=668s)** — polyphenol. these typically are antioxidant anti-inflammatory. and higher levels are
- **[11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h81qq8Ne3go&t=673s)** — associated with improved gut microbial diversity and a lowered risk for metabolic syndrome in
- **[11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h81qq8Ne3go&t=678s)** — humans. here's another one that was significantly higher, which is an anti-inflammatory
- **[11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h81qq8Ne3go&t=683s)** — metabolite. here's another one, antioxidant anti-inflammatory. and take a look at the fatty
- **[11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h81qq8Ne3go&t=688s)** — acid profile. we're looking at the omega-6 to omega-3 ratios. so a lower omega-6 to 3 ratio
- **[11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h81qq8Ne3go&t=695s)** — is typically considered beneficial. lower levels means a higher abundance of omega-3 fatty acids.
- **[11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h81qq8Ne3go&t=701s)** — here's another interesting finding, vitamin b3. quite a bit more than the other groups.
- **[11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h81qq8Ne3go&t=705s)** — here's one that's a bit lower than the others, advanced glycation end products,
- **[11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h81qq8Ne3go&t=710s)** — which is a major negative marker for health. here's another one, homocysteine.
- **[11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h81qq8Ne3go&t=715s)** — much lower than the other groups, which is a beneficial thing. and the reason i wanted to
- **[12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h81qq8Ne3go&t=720s)** — because so many times people lump in processed meat with grass-fed grass-finished beef. like
- **[12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h81qq8Ne3go&t=728s)** — they're the same thing. they're not. and of course, there's not a tremendous amount of
- **[12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h81qq8Ne3go&t=731s)** — research in the area of grass-fed grass-finished, but that's coming using what's called
- **[12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h81qq8Ne3go&t=735s)** — metabolomic testing. so you could really see what's going on with these health markers.
- **[12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h81qq8Ne3go&t=740s)** — because there is a difference in differentiating going to mcdonald's versus getting a really
- **[12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h81qq8Ne3go&t=746s)** — source of beef, which is filled with phytonutrients and a lot of other great things,
- **[12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h81qq8Ne3go&t=753s)** — including a lot of great bioavailable protein. so dr. gill, if you're watching,
- **[12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h81qq8Ne3go&t=757s)** — i just want to let you know there's a lot of positive things in beef that
- **[12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h81qq8Ne3go&t=760s)** — personally i feel very healthy when i consume it. but i can see that i am a target for this
- **[12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h81qq8Ne3go&t=766s)** — organization for sure. all right, let's scroll down a little bit further on the true health
- **[12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h81qq8Ne3go&t=770s)** — initiative. we have beyond meat. all right, the truth about plant-based meats. okay, i see. so
- **[12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h81qq8Ne3go&t=778s)** — this is definitely supporting plant-based meats and alternative meats. okay. and if we do a
- **[13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h81qq8Ne3go&t=784s)** — search on dr. gill's site, you have quite a few videos about imitation meats or beyond
- **[13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h81qq8Ne3go&t=791s)** — impossible burger, lab-grown meat. i have no idea what your thoughts are. i didn't watch
- **[13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h81qq8Ne3go&t=796s)** — but you definitely talk about these products. now the president of this organization,
- **[13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h81qq8Ne3go&t=802s)** — dr. david katz, is definitely not a fan of keto or any other diet that restricts entire food
- **[13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h81qq8Ne3go&t=809s)** — groups, calling them unhealthy or unsustainable. he said that keto is just a false label for

- **[13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h81qq8Ne3go&t=819s)** — any good diet does. katz's low opinion on keto is echoed by many nutritional specialists
- **[13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h81qq8Ne3go&t=827s)** — across the country. katz joined 24 other top names in the field to rank 35 popular weight loss

- **[14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h81qq8Ne3go&t=868s)** — rather predictably, starvation has profound effects on all aspects of metabolism. the body
- **[14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h81qq8Ne3go&t=874s)** — effectively turns to autodigestion to sustain itself during the protracted fast. now,
- **[14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h81qq8Ne3go&t=882s)** — first of all, i can tell that what you're talking about is starvation. it's not even

- **[14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h81qq8Ne3go&t=893s)** — you're actually starving, until you burn up your fat. i mean, this is the way our bodies
- **[14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h81qq8Ne3go&t=898s)** — designed to store fat, to live during times of famine. and we didn't have food, so we would
- **[15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h81qq8Ne3go&t=904s)** — burn fat. so there's a way to do ketosis without even doing fasting, just cutting down
- **[15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h81qq8Ne3go&t=909s)** — your carbs. he goes on to say that the one known benefit of ketogenic diets is for the
- **[15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h81qq8Ne3go&t=915s)** — short-term control of otherwise intractable seizures mostly in certain children. so why
- **[15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h81qq8Ne3go&t=921s)** — would that be a short-term thing if it helped them? and that's the only benefit that
- **[15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h81qq8Ne3go&t=926s)** — you should go to my website. i have over 7,000 success stories, which you probably won't consider
- **[15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h81qq8Ne3go&t=932s)** — valid, but there's 7,000 people that are real testimonials of going on the ketogenic diet
- **[15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h81qq8Ne3go&t=938s)** — and looking at many other benefits. here's another quote. there are, as noted, short-term
- **[15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h81qq8Ne3go&t=944s)** — studies of ketogenic diets showing the usual metabolic benefits attached to almost any diet.
- **[15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h81qq8Ne3go&t=951s)** — so basically just lump everything together. all right, whatever. but this next sentence is quite
- **[15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h81qq8Ne3go&t=957s)** — entertaining. but lest you think short-term improvements in these markers a good idea
- **[16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h81qq8Ne3go&t=961s)** — makes, consider these other interventions that do the same. a bout of cholera, a crack cocaine
- **[16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h81qq8Ne3go&t=968s)** — binge, the spread of cancer through one's body, or the advance of tuberculosis. my goodness.
- **[16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h81qq8Ne3go&t=975s)** — many life-threatening diseases evoke autodigestion and cause weight, cholesterol, glucose, insulin,
- **[16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h81qq8Ne3go&t=982s)** — and blood pressure to fall. they are all emphatically ill-advised just the same. so
- **[16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h81qq8Ne3go&t=988s)** — he's comparing the ketogenic diet creating damage like you would if you smell crack or
- **[16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h81qq8Ne3go&t=994s)** — had cancer or had TB. and the last thing i want to bring up, just one last quote,
- **[16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h81qq8Ne3go&t=999s)** — as i write this, the proposed guiding principles for healthy eating in canada
- **[16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h81qq8Ne3go&t=1004s)** — have just been released. they are eminently sensible, current, and evidence-based. so
- **[16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h81qq8Ne3go&t=1010s)** — naturally they are under immediate attack, as was the comparably sensible 2015 report of the
- **[16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h81qq8Ne3go&t=1018s)** — dietary guideline advisory committee here in the u.s. before its ink was dry. all right,
- **[17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h81qq8Ne3go&t=1024s)** — so definitely he's talking about how, you know, there is some attack on this dietary
- **[17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h81qq8Ne3go&t=1029s)** — guideline advisory committee. well, if you take a look at this website called the u.s. right to
- **[17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h81qq8Ne3go&t=1034s)** — know.org, nearly half of the dietary guidelines advisory committee have conflicts of interest.
- **[17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h81qq8Ne3go&t=1041s)** — this is why it's attacked. so i'm not sure about dr. gill, but i definitely know dr. catz
- **[17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h81qq8Ne3go&t=1046s)** — doesn't like keto and probably doesn't like my 980 keto videos, which very unfortunately,
- **[17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h81qq8Ne3go&t=1054s)** — well, he'll probably like this. you can't even find them anymore. when you do a search on
- **[17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h81qq8Ne3go&t=1058s)** — keto, all you see is the negative keto videos that come up. but of course, if you search
- **[17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h81qq8Ne3go&t=1063s)** — the plant-based ones, they're all really nice and positive. so my question for gill and others
- **[17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h81qq8Ne3go&t=1068s)** — who do like an anti-dr. burg videos is what diet do you recommend? you know, what should we be
- **[17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h81qq8Ne3go&t=1075s)** — eating? and let's compare that versus just the ketogenic diet, because there's a lot of
- **[17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h81qq8Ne3go&t=1079s)** — different ketogenic diet versions. the one i recommend is the healthy version. in fact,
- **[18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h81qq8Ne3go&t=1085s)** — i don't know if gill knows this, but i recommend seven to ten cups of vegetables every
- **[18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h81qq8Ne3go&t=1091s)** — day, which is a considerable amount of vegetables. i don't know if he knew that or not. but as i dug
- **[18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h81qq8Ne3go&t=1096s)** — more into this true health initiative site, i found a link to this other site called eatforum.org.
- **[18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h81qq8Ne3go&t=1106s)** — it's called the eat lancet commission, the planetary health diet. so as far as i know,
- **[18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h81qq8Ne3go&t=1113s)** — this might be the diet that this group recommends. i don't know this for a fact,
- **[18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h81qq8Ne3go&t=1118s)** — but it's definitely mostly plant-based. and they want to put this out to the entire planet. so
- **[18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h81qq8Ne3go&t=1123s)** — this is what it looks like. okay, here's the interesting thing about this diet. they're
- **[18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h81qq8Ne3go&t=1128s)** — recommending 811 calories be whole grains. okay, what about gluten? what about the phytates,
- **[18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h81qq8Ne3go&t=1137s)** — which block zinc? and what about the fact that very, very few people have just whole grains.
- **[19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h81qq8Ne3go&t=1142s)** — they have a combination of whole grains and refined grains. i mean, just take a look at
- **[19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h81qq8Ne3go&t=1146s)** — the grocery store. they do recommend potatoes and cassava, fruits, 126 calories. but this is
- **[19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h81qq8Ne3go&t=1152s)** — interesting. beef. we can have 30 calories per day. that comes out to a half of an ounce
- **[19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h81qq8Ne3go&t=1158s)** — per day. that's like a little tiny bite. but we can have 284 calories from legumes,
- **[19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h81qq8Ne3go&t=1166s)** — okay? and 291 calories of nuts and 354 calories of unsaturated oils. would that be like
- **[19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h81qq8Ne3go&t=1175s)** — canola oil, soy oil, cottonseed oil, corn oil? i couldn't find the specific unsaturated fats.
- **[19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h81qq8Ne3go&t=1181s)** — and you're allowed added sugars. 120 calories. that's 7.5 teaspoons per day. now why
- **[19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h81qq8Ne3go&t=1188s)** — is that on the list of a planetary health diet? why do you even have to add sugars?
- **[19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h81qq8Ne3go&t=1193s)** — what is healthy about those added sugars? i would love to know. now another thing about
- **[19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h81qq8Ne3go&t=1199s)** — planetary health diet is the strategic partners. strategic partners. let's take a look who that
- **[20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h81qq8Ne3go&t=1206s)** — would be. well, we have nestle. that's interesting. nestle produces a lot of
- **[20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h81qq8Ne3go&t=1212s)** — refined foods at the grocery store, don't they? why are they involved in this planetary health
- **[20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h81qq8Ne3go&t=1217s)** — diet? that's strange. well, i did a little deeper dive on vegannews.com and apparently nestle
- **[20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h81qq8Ne3go&t=1224s)** — is the first major food company to get behind lab-grown meat. incredible. dr gill, if you're
- **[20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h81qq8Ne3go&t=1231s)** — watching, please tell us what we should be eating and please educate us on what is damaging
- **[20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h81qq8Ne3go&t=1236s)** — about what i'm recommending and also what is so beneficial health-wise of what you're
- **[20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h81qq8Ne3go&t=1241s)** — recommending. now because of the censoring and the suppressing of the algorithms on youtube,
- **[20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h81qq8Ne3go&t=1247s)** — it's becoming more difficult to find my content. and there's a lot of content that i cannot

## Video 30: Dr. Berg Gets Censored (Silenced)

**Watch on YouTube:** [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETonDtzkETw](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETonDtzkETw)

## Full Transcript with Timestamps

*Click any timestamp to jump to that moment in the video*

- **[00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETonDtzkETw&t=1s)** — Well, it's official. YouTube has just now banned anything related to health that doesn't align with the general medical consensus.
- **[00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETonDtzkETw&t=13s)** — So if any information related to health doesn't agree with the World Health Organization, they won't necessarily always take down the video, but they're going to change the algorithms.
- **[00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETonDtzkETw&t=24s)** — So they're going to replace those videos that were popular, that had lots of likes and lots of engagement with medical information.
- **[00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETonDtzkETw&t=32s)** — This new partnership with YouTube is supposed to protect you against misinformation and promote high quality health information.
- **[00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETonDtzkETw&t=43s)** — And their definition of misinformation is anything that opposes their viewpoint.
- **[00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETonDtzkETw&t=49s)** — I mean, if you go to DrBurg.com, you will see that I have 7,607 success stories. I'm helping people.
- **[00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETonDtzkETw&t=59s)** — I'm giving people lots of non-toxic solutions. And if you just read the comments, you'll see that a lot of people are being helped.
- **[01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETonDtzkETw&t=67s)** — So my information is not dangerous. It's not misinformation. It's actually quite helpful.
- **[01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETonDtzkETw&t=72s)** — And this new change is going to hurt a lot of people because they're not going to be able to find alternative viewpoints, alternative opinions.
- **[01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETonDtzkETw&t=79s)** — Sometimes medicine doesn't work. You know, looking for inexpensive natural remedies to handle certain body issues.
- **[01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETonDtzkETw&t=87s)** — But guess what? Now they're going to have a very difficult time finding those solutions because all these medical sites are going to replace alternative health.
- **[01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETonDtzkETw&t=96s)** — I mean, I used to rank for so many conditions. Now you can't even find me unless you type DrBurg slash whatever.
- **[01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETonDtzkETw&t=104s)** — And even on the keto diet, I have 928 keto videos. That's right. 928 videos.
- **[01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETonDtzkETw&t=113s)** — Guess what? When you type keto diet, you can't find me. Instead, the number one ranked video is from Mayo Clinic.
- **[02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETonDtzkETw&t=123s)** — And the comments are turned off. And you can see the likes are actually not very high compared to the number of views.
- **[02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETonDtzkETw&t=129s)** — I think they have like 260,000 views, but very few likes. And it's an anti-keto video.
- **[02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETonDtzkETw&t=136s)** — And I'm going to share some interesting things in that video. But I first want to communicate a couple things.
- **[02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETonDtzkETw&t=141s)** — You know, a long time ago when Google started, they had this motto. And that was do the right thing.
- **[02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETonDtzkETw&t=147s)** — And then they changed it to don't be evil. And now I don't even know if they have a motto.
- **[02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETonDtzkETw&t=154s)** — But you think just giving people this one medical viewpoint, this monopoly over your body, your health care, you think that's going to increase the quality of health?
- **[02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETonDtzkETw&t=165s)** — I mean, basically this move is going to wipe out the competition. And competition, competing viewpoints and opinions are very, very good in the health care field
- **[02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETonDtzkETw&t=175s)** — because it forces everyone to raise the bar and do better at getting results.
- **[03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETonDtzkETw&t=181s)** — And how do we trust this medical group with all the strategic alliances and the strategic partners?
- **[03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETonDtzkETw&t=188s)** — The strategic alliances with Big Pharma and how they partner with medical universities and medical journals.
- **[03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETonDtzkETw&t=195s)** — How do we trust that? Like I said before, their definition of misinformation is basically any information that opposes the medical viewpoint,
- **[03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETonDtzkETw&t=204s)** — the medical consensus. How do we make sure they're transparent with all the conflict of interest, the strategic alliances and the strategic partners
- **[03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETonDtzkETw&t=214s)** — and what they call the stakeholders, which some of them are part of industry, and of course the revolving doors with all the directors?
- **[03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETonDtzkETw&t=222s)** — It's terrible. It's terrible. And I think it's going to hurt a lot of people because freedom of health information is really freedom of speech.
- **[03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETonDtzkETw&t=230s)** — It's a very slippery slope. The more you start filtering out other opinions, other viewpoints, so many people go on the internet
- **[03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETonDtzkETw&t=238s)** — because they have not gotten results with certain types of medications and they're trying to find alternatives.
- **[04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETonDtzkETw&t=246s)** — So if someone wants something that's non-toxic, okay, or something that's natural, or a do-it-yourself remedy, that is all considered dangerous misinformation.
- **[04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETonDtzkETw&t=257s)** — Yeah, it's just terrible. But it's not just me. It's all the other alternative health care practitioners, anyone who comments on nutrition,
- **[04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETonDtzkETw&t=266s)** — even the lay person who wants to share their viewpoint on health, they're not going to rank. And this doesn't just hurt me or them.
- **[04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETonDtzkETw&t=273s)** — It hurts the person trying to find the right knowledge. We're going to be pretty much stuck with just one way of treating the body.
- **[04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETonDtzkETw&t=283s)** — And they call this science. They call this high quality health information, really.
- **[04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETonDtzkETw&t=289s)** — And there's also a really interesting side comment that I read about this, and they call it the silent epidemic. It's called health illiteracy.
- **[04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETonDtzkETw&t=297s)** — And some of these people that are writing about this give health illiteracy as the reason why people aren't going to the doctors as much
- **[05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETonDtzkETw&t=306s)** — and they're going online searching for alternative viewpoints on health. And this is what they defined health illiteracy.
- **[05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETonDtzkETw&t=314s)** — You ready for this? It's an inability to comprehend and use medical information. And they say this, it's worse with the elderly, poor people, and minorities.
- **[05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETonDtzkETw&t=326s)** — Sounds a little bit like discrimination to me. So basically they're saying that it's an epidemic out there.
- **[05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETonDtzkETw&t=330s)** — There's so many people who just can't understand medicine, right? And that's probably why they're going to alternative sites, you know, like things like that.
- **[05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETonDtzkETw&t=339s)** — And not sticking with incredible high quality health care information. I mean, this is just ridiculous.
- **[05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETonDtzkETw&t=345s)** — I mean, maybe they don't understand it because the doctor is talking over their head or the information doesn't make sense.
- **[05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETonDtzkETw&t=350s)** — Or maybe they do really understand. They just don't agree with this idea of suppressing a symptom with a drug and being on the drug the rest of your life.
- **[05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETonDtzkETw&t=359s)** — To me, that's not science. I mean, even if you start looking up like pretty much almost every disease, psoriasis, MS, if you look at the cause of this, it'll say unknown cause, unknown cause.
- **[06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETonDtzkETw&t=370s)** — We don't know what causes it. Well, if you don't know what causes it, what makes you the expert over that condition, you know?
- **[06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETonDtzkETw&t=375s)** — But what really frustrates me is having them take over the keywords for the ketogenic diet. Now, why is that a bad thing?
- **[06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETonDtzkETw&t=384s)** — Because they don't have any experience in that area. Many times when doctors go to school, they don't get a lot of training in nutrition or anything alternative.
- **[06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETonDtzkETw&t=393s)** — And so now they get to be the controllers of that information as well. This next video that I'm going to show you is the video ranked number one for the ketogenic diet. Check this out.
- **[06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETonDtzkETw&t=406s)** — According to Dr. Google, the most searched question of 2018 was, what is the keto diet?
- **[06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETonDtzkETw&t=412s)** — Now, the reason I'm bringing this up, and this was even four years ago, keto is very popular. People are searching for it.
- **[06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETonDtzkETw&t=419s)** — The bottom line is the more people that get on this diet, the less medication they're going to need because it handles so many issues.
- **[07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETonDtzkETw&t=427s)** — Instead of carbs for energy, the body burns fat entering a state called ketosis.
- **[07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETonDtzkETw&t=432s)** — Ketosis. What could go wrong? Sounds like a great plan. Sounds a little dangerous to me. That's why I've not tried it.
- **[07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETonDtzkETw&t=438s)** — Dangerous, really? Here's the problem. The lack of differentiating between therapeutic ketosis, OK, or they call it nutritional ketosis and ketoacidosis.
- **[07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETonDtzkETw&t=453s)** — But mild ketosis or therapeutic ketosis is extremely therapeutic. And I'm going to put some links on a whole bunch of science behind that that supports that.
- **[07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETonDtzkETw&t=463s)** — When I think about ketosis, sometimes I get a little nervous. I think, well, gosh, we don't really actually want you in ketosis. But can you tell us about that?
- **[07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETonDtzkETw&t=472s)** — Right. And I think and I think this is something that is the unknown with when people are saying, well, I'm going to put myself on a ketogenic diet and be in ketosis.
- **[08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETonDtzkETw&t=482s)** — Because really, when you think about what ketosis is, it's a it's a alternative pathway that our body has to use in times of emergency.
- **[08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETonDtzkETw&t=492s)** — So right there, you can see that huge bias. They don't want people to do keto. They think ketosis only occurs in an emergency situation when you are starving or something like that.
- **[08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETonDtzkETw&t=505s)** — That is so false. Talk about misinformation on steroids. That is absolutely not true.
- **[08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETonDtzkETw&t=511s)** — Did you realize that when your body goes into this mild ketosis, your fight or fight mechanism goes down? It reduces cortisol.
- **[08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETonDtzkETw&t=521s)** — You help balance the autonomic nervous system. It's anything but emergency. It's super healthy.
- **[08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETonDtzkETw&t=530s)** — So you're right. It's it's it's something that historically has alarmed us in terms of we don't necessarily want people to be in ketosis.
- **[08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETonDtzkETw&t=538s)** — Because it can be very dangerous. Ketone bodies are considered toxic. Your body has two ways of getting rid of them.
- **[09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETonDtzkETw&t=546s)** — You either exhale them through your breath or you urinate them out.
- **[09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETonDtzkETw&t=551s)** — And so it is a stressful kind of process on your body, too, because your body is trying to rid itself of these ketone bodies.
- **[09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETonDtzkETw&t=559s)** — Here's another clip that shows that they just don't have any information about this.
- **[09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETonDtzkETw&t=563s)** — They have zero information about the healthy version of ketosis. It's not toxic. It's not dangerous. Ketones are actually a super fuel.
- **[09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETonDtzkETw&t=575s)** — Ketones are an antioxidant and they talk about it being toxic because your body is trying to get rid of it through urine or breath.
- **[09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETonDtzkETw&t=581s)** — That's just in the transition step. When you're transitioning over to burning fat, the motor is inefficient.
- **[09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETonDtzkETw&t=590s)** — So you're wasting some of these ketones and then very quickly your body becomes very efficient where you're utilizing all this ketone energy.
- **[09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETonDtzkETw&t=598s)** — In fact, a ketone is much more efficient than glucose. It produces more energy and it runs off fat.
- **[10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETonDtzkETw&t=605s)** — I mean, just think about way back when we had this hunter gatherer type environment.
- **[10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETonDtzkETw&t=611s)** — We developed this ability to run on ketones for a survival mechanism because we didn't have food available. We didn't have all these carbohydrates.
- **[10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETonDtzkETw&t=620s)** — So to say that ketones are dangerous, it's just the opposite. Glucose is dangerous and toxic.
- **[10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETonDtzkETw&t=628s)** — In fact, the numbers of people who have diabetes have a condition called hyperglycemia. That's high blood glucose.
- **[10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETonDtzkETw&t=635s)** — Another term for that is glucotoxicity. That's very, very damaging.
- **[10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETonDtzkETw&t=641s)** — And what's really interesting about that concept is this. When you eat a lot of sugar and carbs, which they don't seem to have a problem with, over time you develop diabetes.
- **[10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETonDtzkETw&t=653s)** — And in an advanced type 2 diabetes as well as type 1 diabetes, that's when you can develop this ketoacidosis problem.
- **[11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETonDtzkETw&t=661s)** — So the number one reason why people have ketoacidosis is because they have high blood glucose.
- **[11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETonDtzkETw&t=667s)** — It has nothing to do with being on a ketogenic diet. I've never met one person that's went on a ketogenic diet and has developed ketoacidosis.
- **[11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETonDtzkETw&t=677s)** — Dr. Kozing, you and I both said we know people who have lost hundreds of pounds.
- **[11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETonDtzkETw&t=682s)** — People I know socially or patients of mine. Big weight loss and they feel great.
- **[11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETonDtzkETw&t=688s)** — Well, and so for them, they consider that to be, finger quotes, successful.
- **[11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETonDtzkETw&t=693s)** — But possibly we're talking two different languages here. Ketosis and those ketones and things that is not someplace that you want to be health wise.
- **[11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETonDtzkETw&t=704s)** — Yes, weight loss is one of those successful indicators.
- **[11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETonDtzkETw&t=707s)** — But what about all the other great indicators like the improved blood sugars, like the having less of a fatty liver, better cholesterol levels,
- **[11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETonDtzkETw&t=717s)** — better energy, better cognitive function, less inflammation, better mood.
- **[12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETonDtzkETw&t=722s)** — These are all the benefits of the ketogenic diet.
- **[12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETonDtzkETw&t=725s)** — Anyway, I have a personal favor I want to ask you. I would love to get your opinion on this situation.
- **[12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETonDtzkETw&t=735s)** — So if you would please click the link down below and go through the survey questions and tell me what your opinion is on this.
- **[12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETonDtzkETw&t=746s)** — What I think is very radical recent change of suppressing other viewpoints on health.
- **[12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETonDtzkETw&t=755s)** — So I want to thank you for watching this video and thank you in advance for filling out this survey because I really want to know what you think about this.

- **[00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=32s)** — Welcome back everyone. We are here with another show Q&A. We are going to talk about Mockito.
- **[00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=36s)** — We will talk about nutrition. Anything they say is not meant to replace your medical care or diagnose you because that is illegal in the state of Virginia.
- **[00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=46s)** — So I just like to dive right in Stephen. Let's roll with these questions.
- **[00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=50s)** — Alright, straight to social media. This time from Lisa from YouTube. I'm a 57 year old female who does 18 hours of fasting a day. There you go.
- **[01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=60s)** — Please share your thoughts about using Cot liver oil as opposed to sardine or anchovy oil. Very specific.
- **[01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=69s)** — Now, those oils are similar and I don't have a comparison in my mind. You'd have to do your research.
- **[01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=78s)** — But I do know that if you just compare... I know Cot liver oil has the most omega 3 to omega EPA and DHA.
- **[01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=91s)** — Those right there as well as the vitamin A and vitamin D. So I'm not sure if these other oils have the vitamin A and vitamin D.
- **[01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=100s)** — And what's unique about that is that in order for you to make vitamin D work, you also need vitamin A.
- **[01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=109s)** — And you never want to take vitamin A as a supplement because it's very hard to get a natural version that actually works. So you want to get it from food.
- **[01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=117s)** — And one of the best sources is Cot liver oil. You can do liver if you like liver. Egg yolks have vitamin A, retinol.
- **[02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=125s)** — But Cot liver oil gives you a really nice balance of that vitamin A, which a lot of times is missing in a lot of different formulas.
- **[02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=133s)** — All right. Thank you for that. She says, Mary Moore from Rumble, will using cruciferous vegetables affect thyroid function?
- **[02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=144s)** — This this has come up many times because you have certain compounds and cruciferous that inhibit iodine.
- **[02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=153s)** — And so they're called goitergenic effects. And you would have to consume.
- **[02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=158s)** — I looked at this a while ago. You'd have to consume a tremendous amount of this and not take any iodine to create that effect.
- **[02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=164s)** — So I wouldn't worry about it unless you're consuming a lot of it and you notice your thyroid's enlarging or you have thyroid symptoms.
- **[02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=174s)** — But typically, I think a moderate or a little bit amount in your diet is going to be good because of what that cruciferous can do for your whole body.
- **[03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=184s)** — So we have to look at the whole picture. It helps stimulate the phase one, phase two detoxification in your liver.
- **[03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=189s)** — It lowers the risk of cancer. The sulfurophane in cruciferous can actually decrease or literally put H. pylori, which is a microbe in ulcers, back into remission. Does a lot.
- **[03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=206s)** — All right. Taekwondong from YouTube. What is the primary cause of thyroid nodules, in your opinion?
- **[03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=215s)** — I think that could be a vitamin, I'm sorry, an iodine deficiency. So if you take a little C-calp and it goes away, then we know that's for real.
- **[03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=228s)** — So see, what iodine does is it helps to regulate excess estrogen and too much estrogen can also cause problems with fibrocystic breast, cyst in the thyroid.
- **[04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=241s)** — So one culprit to the thyroid function is estrogen. Estrogen inhibits the thyroid function and it can create problems with it.
- **[04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=252s)** — So a little bit of iodine goes a long way, especially with dealing with nodules.
- **[04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=256s)** — Okay, we have a lovely participant all the way from the Philippines and it's midnight there. So I'm going to be merciful and get Tina on with us.
- **[04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=264s)** — And Tina, if you go ahead with your quick 30 second question, please.
- **[04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=270s)** — Hello. Hi, Dr. Berg. Good morning there. Yeah, I just have some questions about the intermittent fasting that I'm doing.
- **[04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=279s)** — I'm actually doing 48 hours twice a month. And then on my regular days, I'm doing 20 hours.
- **[04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=286s)** — There's a variation, because I saw online that you need variation, like 20 hours, 17, 18.
- **[04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=291s)** — I just want to make sure I'm doing it right, because it's been more than a month and I already lost 10 kilograms.
- **[05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=303s)** — I think that's too fast. Is it normal? Or am I doing it right?
- **[05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=310s)** — Well, it's a tool to help you lose weight and also get healthy.
- **[05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=314s)** — If you're losing too much weight, then you just cut it back and don't do the severity of intermittent fasting.
- **[05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=321s)** — So it really depends on what's happening in your body. I can't see you. You're in your body.
- **[05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=326s)** — You know, maybe if you're losing way too fast, don't do as the severity of what you're doing.
- **[05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=332s)** — Maybe cut it down a little bit and adjust it. But I think the way that you know it's working is...
- **[05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=340s)** — Or in other words, the way that you know you're doing the right intermittent fasting is number one, do you feel better?
- **[05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=347s)** — If you feel like crap, then that means that maybe you're not ready for the intense intermittent fasting.
- **[05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=353s)** — Number two, if you can't go from one meal to the next without considerable hunger, then you need to back it up a bit.
- **[06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=361s)** — But if you're feeling great, you're improving, you're losing weight. And then with your case, you're losing too much weight,
- **[06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=367s)** — which is I know that's a big problem for a lot of people, being sarcastic. But I think you just cut it down and go at your own pace, whatever you want to do.
- **[06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=377s)** — But there's so many benefits to intermittent fasting. We're actually stressing the body out a little bit to cause it to survive better.
- **[06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=386s)** — And it does that with decreased risk for diabetes and Alzheimer's and cancer and all sorts of things.
- **[06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=395s)** — So I think I see what you're doing. You're trying to get the benefits of it. But yeah, weight loss is another benefit that you can go too fast.
- **[06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=403s)** — I mean, if I did what you're doing now, I probably would lose too much weight. I don't want to keep losing weight.
- **[06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=410s)** — So, yeah, that's my question. Thank you. Thank you so much. Sure. Thank you, Robert. You're welcome. Now you can get to bed at 12. Good night.
- **[07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=421s)** — That's right. Thank you. Great call. Sounds like you're on the right track. All right. Let's see. With all due respect, I'm going to cut your audio off there, Tina.
- **[07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=429s)** — And have a great evening. I just go back to social media. Christina from YouTube. If you have high cortisol levels, can you still burn ketones?
- **[07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=437s)** — Also, with getting cortisone shots, keep your cortisol levels from returning to normal.
- **[07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=445s)** — Yeah, cortisol can inhibit ketosis because when you have high cortisol, it's releasing sugar from your own body and it's increasing the breakdown of your own protein and turning that into sugar.
- **[07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=461s)** — This is why people gain weight during stress. People that take synthetic cortisol as a prednisone sometimes get diabetes because of all that release of sugar increases that and then insulin.
- **[07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=476s)** — So this is a problem. Now, when you're taking prednisone, I think you said you're taking cortisol, which I did as well, it could really mess up your body because now your body becomes dependent on it.
- **[08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=488s)** — And then your cortisol levels might even be too low and can't adapt or they might be too high. Or you might create what's called cortisol resistance, which you might have high levels, but it's not working in your body.
- **[08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=501s)** — So this is why people that have high cortisol sometimes have all the symptoms of low cortisol, like inflammation and all these other things.
- **[08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=510s)** — So there is an antidote to kind of recovering from a lot of prednisone and that is taking a lot of vitamin D because vitamin D, what it does, it will bring your immune system down if it's too high and it will also bring the immune system up if it's too low.
- **[08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=535s)** — So it's an immune modulator. So it's way better than cortisol, which actually just brings your immune system down, like it suppresses white blood cells. So it's a great antidote, but you have to take it in higher amounts.
- **[09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=548s)** — All right, very good. And here is our first very interesting question, Dr. Burdick.
- **[09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=552s)** — Why is it after a global iron fortification of our foods, you know, they put the iron in the flour and the food supply and our grains and do we still have over 2 billion people who are anemic?
- **[09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=568s)** — Why is that?
- **[09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=569s)** — All right, let's see if they can figure that one out.
- **[09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=572s)** — Because because because iron is the they say iron is the most common nutrient deficiency in the world.
- **[09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=581s)** — Okay. But then they fortified the entire our food supply and now but hasn't really changed anemia. So what's up with that?
- **[09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=591s)** — All right, Gary from Rumble is asking a question I think we'd all like to know. I could not find the video on what filter used to eliminate forever chemicals and microplastics from our water.
- **[10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=600s)** — Could you please briefly review your choices for the audience?
- **[10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=605s)** — I put that link down below, but I released it.
- **[10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=610s)** — But it wasn't I didn't title it as anything related to water.
- **[10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=615s)** — It might have been a title if I'm correct. If I'm wrong, they're poisoning us.
- **[10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=620s)** — But I will what I'll do is I'll make mental note. I will put that video down below when I'm done with the show.
- **[10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=627s)** — But then I don't remember the exact name of the all three filters, but I'll put those as well.
- **[10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=635s)** — And so you can have that data. Okay. Thank you, Gary. That's terrific question.
- **[10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=641s)** — Thomas from Facebook is long term type two diabetes reversal possible?
- **[10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=649s)** — Yes, it is possible. And, you know, I talk to people who are diabetic all the time and.
- **[10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=655s)** — They don't even really even know that I have a YouTube channel, but they tell me, oh, yeah, I have diabetes and it's being managed for years.
- **[11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=664s)** — I'm like, and I see what they're eating. I'm like, they don't realize.
- **[11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=667s)** — And sometimes I'll say, you know, you can get rid of that and they don't believe you.
- **[11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=672s)** — So, yes, you can. You can totally get rid of it.
- **[11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=677s)** — And I'm trying to not answer a question that I think is coming on the next quiz.
- **[11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=682s)** — So I think I'll just stop right there, Steve. All right. Very good.
- **[11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=686s)** — Well, I'm going to throw a stick in the spokes. Glenda from Facebook.
- **[11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=688s)** — And we can hold this question. What's the best way to maintain healthy iron levels?
- **[11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=692s)** — Should we hold that? Yeah, we should hold that, too, because I have another question on that.
- **[11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=701s)** — All right, Glenda, you stand by. We'll go to JJ from Facebook.
- **[11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=705s)** — Kombucha seems to be very popular for its health benefits.
- **[11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=709s)** — Do you recommend consuming it? You can do kombucha.
- **[11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=713s)** — I would try to find something with the lowest sugars. There is a little sugar in there.
- **[11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=718s)** — So just, you know, realize that.
- **[12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=721s)** — But the acid in kombucha, lactic acid, is very, very beneficial because even though it doesn't have any microbes that are going to reseed your gut,
- **[12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=732s)** — it will wake up some of the dormant good bacteria that's sitting in your gut.
- **[12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=737s)** — So it actually will improve the gut diversity.
- **[12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=741s)** — So does that just make sure that you don't shake it before you open it.
- **[12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=745s)** — It's very acidic. It's very explosive.
- **[12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=749s)** — It's a lot of carbonation in it.
- **[12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=751s)** — And then also probably consume no more than a half of a bottle per seeding with a straw, because it's very acidic to your teeth.
- **[12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=761s)** — Because one time I drank a whole bottle right before bed and I really dropped my pH down to acid.
- **[12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=768s)** — And it affected my sleep. So it's very, very acidic.
- **[12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=773s)** — So you have to maybe just have small amounts.
- **[12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=776s)** — All right. Let's go to Okame from YouTube. Any suggestions on how to clear a blocked fallopian tubes?
- **[13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=787s)** — You can get those little pipe cleaner type things.
- **[13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=791s)** — I think I don't know exactly what's happening, but the formation of those tubes and the normalization of the structures around the ovary and the fallopian tubes in the uterus are highly correlated with nutrition.
- **[13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=807s)** — One would be folate. The other one would be vitamin D.
- **[13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=812s)** — And I think there's some data that shows that if you take higher amounts of vitamin D, it can help to remold or model certain tissues.
- **[13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=823s)** — So a lot of people have weird structures that are abnormal in the eye or in the heart.
- **[13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=832s)** — And vitamin D helps to sometimes bring that down to like into a normal range. I would try that.
- **[13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=838s)** — But I think, too, when there's certain things in the environment when people are born or when they're babies that are exposed to that can affect things like that down the road.
- **[14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=851s)** — But I think you could I think there's a lot of things you can do about it if you just work on it and change your diet and be real clean.
- **[14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=859s)** — All right. Very good. God's galaxy, as they call themselves from YouTube.
- **[14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=863s)** — I've been on the carnivore diet for several months and have only lost two pounds. What's going on with God's galaxy?
- **[14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=874s)** — Couple things. Sometimes some people respond very well to the carnivore diet with weight loss.
- **[14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=881s)** — Sometimes they don't. There is something that happens, too.
- **[14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=885s)** — When you start consuming more protein, especially if you're female and getting close to menopause, your body starts to heal.
- **[14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=893s)** — And I'm talking about gaining a better composition with more muscle.
- **[14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=898s)** — If that's happening and you're getting more muscle and less fat, you're not going to see any change with your weight.
- **[15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=905s)** — So it's part of the healing process. It's like you're yes, you weigh the same, but you have less fat and you're more muscle.
- **[15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=912s)** — You have less atrophy that could be going on.
- **[15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=916s)** — And I don't I don't know also if you're doing the healthy version of carnivore, you know, versus going going to McDonald's and then getting all the patties and just eating on eating that that pride wouldn't be the best thing.
- **[15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=928s)** — So I think if you're carnivore, you should also do a good amount of seafood and shell fish.
- **[15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=936s)** — That would be good. Very good.
- **[15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=939s)** — All right. In addition to Tina, who we heard from from the Philippines, let's see who else is tuning in.
- **[15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=945s)** — So we'd like to say a good day to all of our viewers joining us today from the UK, Canada, Mexico, Serbia, Jordan, Albania, Bolivia, Armenia, Italy, South Africa, Iran, the Philippines.
- **[15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=956s)** — There you go, Tina Trinidad and Tobago, the Czech Republic, Eritrea, El Salvador, Bulgaria, Iraq, the Netherlands, Switzerland, Puerto Rico, Malta, Moldova, Botswana, Pakistan, Syria, Lithuania, Scotland, Ghana, Greece, New Zealand, Nigeria, Portugal, Romania, India, Russia, France, Jamaica, Nigeria, Ireland, Thailand, Indonesia, Japanese, interior.
- **[16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=983s)** — I don't think I had any type or any mispronunciations mispronunciations there and all across the United States of America.
- **[16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=990s)** — Thanks. Thank you, world, for joining in.
- **[16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=993s)** — And the world also appears to have answered quiz question number one, a very fascinating one, which asks, why is it after a global iron fortification of our food?
- **[16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=1002s)** — Do we still have over two billion people who are anemic?
- **[16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=1005s)** — And 90 percent of respondents say because iron added to foods is not bioavailable and thus not absorbed properly.
- **[16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=1013s)** — And 10 percent say it lacks the proper cofactors.
- **[16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=1016s)** — Those are very lofty answers.
- **[17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=1021s)** — You're right. You're right. Absolutely.
- **[17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=1023s)** — On those two points, there's a couple additional points I want to mention, too.
- **[17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=1028s)** — There is absolutely no studies to show the follow up benefits of adding iron to the food supply.
- **[17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=1035s)** — OK, there's no studies. That's interesting.
- **[17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=1038s)** — Secondly, you're right.
- **[17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=1041s)** — The type of iron you're adding, non-heme iron, is very, very different than HEMA iron, which comes from meat.
- **[17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=1055s)** — One thing about iron is that when people accumulate iron, and that's a lot of people have the body is a hard time getting rid of iron.
- **[17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=1067s)** — So it has really no mechanism to get rid of it.
- **[17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=1070s)** — So you got to be very cautious about adding iron.
- **[17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=1074s)** — And then when you add iron, many times you create another situation called dysfunctional iron, which now we have too much iron that's locked up.
- **[18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=1087s)** — Yet we also are anemic because iron cannot be used effectively.
- **[18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=1091s)** — So here you are having an iron deficiency, yet you have excess.
- **[18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=1094s)** — Professor Bruce Ames, who's a great scientist, he did a study and he found something mind blowing, which I don't know.
- **[18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=1103s)** — Someone's talking about this.
- **[18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=1105s)** — As we age, as a natural function of age, we accumulate more iron.
- **[18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=1112s)** — So he compared aging tissue versus young tissue and the aging tissue had 10 times more iron than younger tissue.
- **[18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=1121s)** — Now, if you understand what iron does, it's like rust and it can really create a lot of rusting out of your organs, especially the liver.
- **[18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=1129s)** — It drops testosterone down to zero.
- **[18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=1132s)** — It locks up your ability to make hemoglobin.
- **[18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=1136s)** — So you're anemic. So creates inflammation.
- **[18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=1139s)** — There's all these chemical reactions that occur with free iron, too much iron in the body that create a lot of disease, especially of your brain and your heart.
- **[19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=1149s)** — So you have to be careful.
- **[19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=1153s)** — Every one a day that I've seen out there, especially the top brands of one or days, and I won't mention any names, they're filled with iron and they're also filled with calcium carbonate, which is a limestone.
- **[19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=1165s)** — It's like and then that locks up magnesium.
- **[19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=1170s)** — So I would highly suggest not taking iron supplements.
- **[19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=1174s)** — I would not cook with iron skillets.
- **[19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=1177s)** — I would not take Geritol.
- **[19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=1181s)** — And instead, there's a there's another trace mineral.
- **[19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=1185s)** — And someone mentioned this to a cofactor to help the transportation of iron into safe places.
- **[19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=1193s)** — The storage of iron.
- **[19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=1195s)** — So it's not affecting our body too much.
- **[19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=1198s)** — And that is copper.
- **[20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=1201s)** — But sometimes just by eliminating the taking of iron or the, you know, or let's say, for example, you're older and you give blood and you feel so much better than we know you have a problem with iron.
- **[20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=1213s)** — But maybe you want to take copper as a supplement, but or even just consume the foods, iron, copper, which is shellfish and get your copper a little higher.
- **[20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=1222s)** — And now you have the cofactors to transport iron effectively.
- **[20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=1230s)** — And because the problem is with copper is that because our food supply is very low in trace minerals and also farming methods to plead copper, it creates a lot of problems with iron in our body.
- **[20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=1243s)** — All right. Very good. Enough about all that. Let's talk about iron in our second question.
- **[20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=1252s)** — If you have too much iron in your body, what is the best way to eliminate?
- **[20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=1255s)** — I just told you. I just told you one answer, which is copper.
- **[21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=1261s)** — And I might as well just give you the rest of the answer because there's a little bit more to that.
- **[21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=1264s)** — So, yeah, copper. But let's say you are over the age of 50.
- **[21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=1269s)** — OK, and you're getting older and now you're aware you have too much iron inside the cell.
- **[21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=1275s)** — OK, we don't we don't want that. It's like way too much.
- **[21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=1278s)** — So how can we get rid of it over time or at least minimize it?
- **[21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=1283s)** — Right. You already stop exposing yourself of iron.
- **[21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=1286s)** — But how can we kind of it's called chelating it out, pulling it out.
- **[21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=1289s)** — You when you consume certain things, you can help lock it up and then pull it out.
- **[21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=1296s)** — Polyphenols, which are in like herbs and things, curcumin.
- **[21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=1303s)** — Quercetin is a chemical in onions. It's a great chelator for iron.
- **[21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=1308s)** — Pulls iron out. So this is one of the reasons I have onions almost every single day.
- **[21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=1313s)** — I'll have like at least a half an onion or even a whole onion.
- **[21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=1317s)** — Another thing you can do is the black tea or green tea.
- **[22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=1320s)** — Great chelator for iron as a supplement.
- **[22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=1329s)** — Lactoferrin is a very potent remedy to pull iron out.
- **[22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=1334s)** — Same thing with IP6, which is another remedy that can help pull iron out.
- **[22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=1342s)** — So there's quite a few things that you can chelate iron out of your body.
- **[22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=1348s)** — And people are always taking these what's called polyphenols or these phytonutrients in plants and berries and thinking that they're anti-inflammatory.
- **[22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=1358s)** — Probably the reason why they're anti-inflammatory is they help you get rid of iron, which is highly inflammatory.
- **[22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=1365s)** — So that's just another reason to do certain things to pull out this iron.
- **[22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=1371s)** — Alright, very good. Let's go to James from Facebook.
- **[22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=1373s)** — Can you share your thoughts on consuming the skins of tomatoes? It's not supposed to be good for us.
- **[22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=1379s)** — Should we peel the tomatoes before eating them? It sounds like an old wives tale.
- **[23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=1383s)** — No, no, you want to eat those peels. That's where you get a lot of the nutrition.
- **[23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=1387s)** — You have lycopene, great for prostate, good for anti-cancer, good for a lot of things.
- **[23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=1396s)** — I remember my wife had a lot of tomatoes and she was going to start canning.
- **[23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=1402s)** — And she said, I have to take the peels. I said, no, keep those in there. I want them.
- **[23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=1406s)** — I want them in there because there's some great nutrition in the peels of a lot of plants and fruits and vegetables.
- **[23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=1416s)** — Alright, hopeful news. Rebecca from Facebook. Should I breastfeed while on keto or fasting?
- **[23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=1425s)** — Well, I think what I would recommend is not to do anything extreme.
- **[23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=1430s)** — The key is making sure you're getting the right nutrients.
- **[23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=1432s)** — So I wouldn't do any type of... I wouldn't do one meal a day. Maybe you do two meals, no snacks, or maybe three meals, no snacks.
- **[24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=1440s)** — The key is to... because this is the most important time to get the most nutrition.
- **[24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=1448s)** — So we don't want to necessarily do anything extreme,
- **[24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=1452s)** — but we do want to do something that supplies enough of the really important nutrients of vitamin D, number one, magnesium, zinc,
- **[24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=1464s)** — enough protein, because let's say there's not enough vitamin K2, because you're not eating certain things or not enough vitamin D,
- **[24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=1475s)** — then the child potentially could develop subclinical problems with their bones.
- **[24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=1480s)** — They can end up with bowed legs, knocked knees, scoliosis, lordosis, kyphosis, all these spinal malformations and dental malformations
- **[24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=1491s)** — and they're probably going to need braces down the road.
- **[24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=1494s)** — So the combination of the trace minerals, which are all the cofactors for proteins and also the fat soluble vitamins are crucial for that baby.
- **[25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=1504s)** — Now, even when you breastfeed, apparently, a lot of times there's just not enough vitamin D that comes through the breast milk.
- **[25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=1513s)** — So this is why they recommend even for babies giving some liquid vitamin D.
- **[25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=1518s)** — But I would highly recommend, and this is like a super important thing, you should be taking between 8,000 and 10,000 of vitamin D3 every single day
- **[25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=1532s)** — if you're breastfeeding to make sure that child has enough vitamin D or else they're going to be deficient and have problems.
- **[25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=1541s)** — So there you have it.
- **[25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=1543s)** — There you have it.
- **[25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=1544s)** — All right, let's go to Laura from YouTube. If you have symptoms of a vitamin D deficiency, she doesn't mention which ones, what's the recommended daily dose of it?
- **[25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=1552s)** — And can it be taken with food?
- **[25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=1557s)** — It should be taken with food unless there's some oil or fat in it because it's a fat soluble nutrient.
- **[26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=1562s)** — But I think at a maintenance dose, it has to be, I mean, I recommend 10,000.
- **[26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=1572s)** — There's a thousand different reasons for that, but there's 10,000 different reasons.
- **[26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=1576s)** — But 10,000 IUs should be a maintenance. Now, that is not a toxic dose.
- **[26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=1583s)** — If you want a therapeutic dose, if you're trying to fix something, then you need to even increase it even more.
- **[26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=1589s)** — But think about what 10,000 IUs of vitamin D3 really is.
- **[26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=1594s)** — That's 20 minutes in the summer sun. Is that toxic? No.
- **[26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=1601s)** — Well, much relief. Monowas is the name from YouTube.
- **[26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=1610s)** — Excuse me, folks. Please share your thoughts on using sunscreen to stop absorption of UV rays.
- **[26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=1617s)** — Don't recommend it. Don't like it unless you're extremely fair-complected and you can't get a suntan.
- **[27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=1625s)** — Some people like that. And then you're going to have to substitute with vitamin D.
- **[27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=1629s)** — But if you're not in that case, I highly recommend you don't use sun blockers.
- **[27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=1636s)** — Because we become sunphobic. And because, oh, the sun's dangerous. All of a sudden in the 80s.
- **[27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=1643s)** — Well, you would think skin cancer, especially melanoma, would drop. It hasn't. It keeps going up.
- **[27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=1650s)** — So my opinion is that melanomas, which is a certain type of skin cancer, is actually a vitamin D deficiency.
- **[27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=1657s)** — But do your own research on that. But no, the sun... go out in the sun until you get slightly a little pink and then get out of the sun.
- **[27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=1667s)** — Don't burn your skin. Just be out there. Build it up over time so you have a tan.
- **[27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=1673s)** — But there's so many therapeutic benefits of sun for you to use sun blockers.
- **[28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=1680s)** — I mean, only maybe that there's no sun protection. You can't get under. Okay, good.
- **[28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=1686s)** — But don't don't overdo it because it blocks the conversion of some.
- **[28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=1691s)** — Oh, some of these sun blockers don't even block the type of UV that causes damage.
- **[28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=1700s)** — They only block the type of UV that turns into vitamin D because there's three different types of UV.
- **[28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=1708s)** — So I did a video on that. You can look it up.
- **[28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=1711s)** — Talking of counterproductive goodness. Here's quiz question number three.
- **[28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=1715s)** — Why do some people have bad reactions from taking vitamin D even in non toxic doses?
- **[28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=1726s)** — Audience, it's all yours. Back to social media.
- **[28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=1730s)** — Let's see. Swapna from Facebook. Boy, these names.
- **[28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=1734s)** — Do you have any advice for someone with fibromyalgia?
- **[28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=1739s)** — I do. If it's on the right side of your body, the upper quadrant, it's not fibromyalgia.
- **[29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=1748s)** — Your bile ducts are plugged and you have sludge in there and you need to take something called Tudka,
- **[29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=1756s)** — which will open up the bile ducts and now all that pain in the right side will go away.
- **[29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=1761s)** — All the stuff that you thought was fibromyalgia, especially up through here.
- **[29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=1765s)** — And of course, you have to change the diet eventually.
- **[29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=1769s)** — But there is also another type of fibromyalgia that is coming from some virus that came out of remission,
- **[29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=1779s)** — like an Epstein-Barr virus or cytomegalovirus, because you went through some stress and now it's in active mode.
- **[29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=1787s)** — And now you're experiencing not the full blown infection, but kind of a version of it, which is a systemic inflammation,
- **[29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=1793s)** — in which case you just need to up your vitamin D, do a whole stress program where you're getting a lot of sleep,
- **[30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=1801s)** — trying to do hikes through nature, exercise to reduce your stress, and that fibromyalgia should go away, if it's viral related.
- **[30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=1812s)** — Okay, some really interesting questions today. Ida from Facebook, speaking of copper, she says,
- **[30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=1817s)** — Does wearing copper bracelets or other items made of copper actually contribute to healing? I'll add absorption.
- **[30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=1826s)** — I think it contributes to certain healing in certain ways, but it's not going to go into counter the big iron problem that people have.
- **[30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=1838s)** — Okay, Tracy from Rumble, are there any remedies for chronic vertigo for a 72 year old on keto diet and using zero sugar?
- **[30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=1848s)** — Would you suggest an MRI or metabolic test? Didn't say if they had it before keto, but anyway.
- **[30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=1855s)** — I would, what I would do is I would watch my recent videos on vertigo and just apply it. There's a technique you can do,
- **[31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=1861s)** — but you're going to have to take more vitamin D3 to remove the calcium crystals that are not being stabilized around the little hairs that help you help the gyroscope balance your body.
- **[31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=1879s)** — So there's some freed up calcium deposits that are floating around there. So we got to get rid of those and vitamin D helps you absorb calcium.
- **[31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=1889s)** — So that's one thing and you should watch the videos on all that information.
- **[31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=1893s)** — Okay, once again, where do they go to find these videos? YouTube sometimes suppresses it. What's the deal?
- **[31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=1899s)** — Just go to my website, DrBurg.com and you could search and I have every video on there so you can check it out.
- **[31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=1905s)** — Now I do, I do say that all the videos I have on cancer are on rumble.
- **[31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=1913s)** — And I will also say that there's been some recent videos that are taken down because there's certain things I can't talk about.
- **[32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=1924s)** — And you can find those in rumble as well. But I won't even say the name because they'll shut this video down.
- **[32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=1930s)** — All right, go to rumble, folks. Learn it all. XMandel from Facebook.
- **[32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=1936s)** — Do you have any thoughts about the use of saffron as a way to remedy schizophrenia, a horrible disease?
- **[32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=1944s)** — I have some thoughts on it, but I don't want to share them.
- **[32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=1946s)** — Now, I think I think it's a valid therapy, but there's something I think a little bit better.
- **[32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=1951s)** — And that would be high doses of vitamin D3. Look up the research by Hoffer on this.
- **[32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=1959s)** — Amazing. I mean, he basically said that schizophrenia really is a vitamin D3 deficiency.
- **[32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=1967s)** — Wow, that's very hopeful. OK, let's see. The quiz question number three asked, what do some people have?
- **[32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=1975s)** — Why do some people have bad reactions from taking vitamin D, even in non toxic levels?
- **[33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=1980s)** — And there's an opinion from the audience. Seventy eight percent say it's because of magnesium deficiency.
- **[33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=1985s)** — Twelve percent say a vitamin K2 deficiency and the remaining 10 percent say it's a zinc deficiency.
- **[33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=1994s)** — You guys are super smart. Wow, that's amazing.
- **[33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=1998s)** — Because there is quite a few. Well, I'd say maybe maybe five percent or even less.
- **[33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=2004s)** — The people that react to vitamin D sometimes right away and sometimes a little longer.
- **[33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=2008s)** — They're doing great. And all of a sudden they have leg cramps.
- **[33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=2013s)** — They have maybe hallucinations, confusion, altered gait, high blood pressure.
- **[33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=2023s)** — There's a whole bunch of different anxiety, a whole bunch of different symptoms.
- **[33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=2028s)** — And they think it's a toxic vitamin D when it's not.
- **[33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=2033s)** — The need for other cofactors like magnesium and other things like zinc and vitamin K2 go up the more vitamin D you take.
- **[34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=2042s)** — So if you're going on a vitamin D protocol and you're already slightly deficient in magnesium,
- **[34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=2047s)** — now you're going to be really deficient and you're going to have symptoms of that cofactor.
- **[34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=2055s)** — This is why we recommend when you take vitamin D, take it with magnesium, zinc, K2 to prevent that.
- **[34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=2063s)** — But it's really bad. It's really terrible if you don't know that and you end up going, oh, vitamin D is toxic and I'm going to stop taking it.
- **[34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=2070s)** — Now you just stop taking the thing that you needed and then you're not going to understand that you're also deficient in these cofactors.
- **[34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=2079s)** — So the person gets stuck with the problem.
- **[34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=2082s)** — So it's so important to have the right information when you want to get help with your body.
- **[34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=2089s)** — And fortunately, it's hard to get that information because of this whole scare that vitamin D is, oh, my gosh, it's toxic.
- **[34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=2098s)** — It's very, very rare to get a toxic effect from vitamin D3. Very rare.
- **[35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=2106s)** — OK, we've had a guest in the green room whose picture has been frozen for 20 minutes.
- **[35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=2112s)** — Let me see if I can hear her. Mimi, are you there? Mimi?
- **[35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=2119s)** — I'm afraid her whole thing is frozen. Let's go back to social media.
- **[35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=2123s)** — KJ from Rumble, would vitamin D be good to address the symptoms of COPD?
- **[35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=2132s)** — Absolutely. Because when you have chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, your receptors for vitamin D are severely downgraded.
- **[35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=2141s)** — And one of the most potent, cool effects of vitamin D3 is what it can do for your respiratory tissue.
- **[35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=2149s)** — And it can really help people with asthma, chronic breathing problems.
- **[35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=2156s)** — But many times it won't work with the typical 600 IUs that they recommend.
- **[36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=2163s)** — So I would I would take a lot more. I would take at least 20 or 30,000 international units of vitamin D3 every single day.
- **[36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=2171s)** — Just realize this. There's some data that says that we don't need to take about every day.
- **[36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=2176s)** — We can take it once a week or once every two weeks.
- **[36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=2179s)** — Well, that's true if you're talking about bone or calcium vitamin D.
- **[36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=2186s)** — There's a completely different system over here that that needs it.
- **[36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=2192s)** — It only has a 24 hour half life. So you're going to need to take it every day to feed these other organs like your lung, your brain, your muscle, and especially your immune system.
- **[36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=2204s)** — All right. Take your vitamin D for goodness sakes.
- **[36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=2208s)** — Mud 4x4 country guy guess from rumble. Will castor oil dissolve cataracts? He doesn't talk how he would apply it.
- **[36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=2216s)** — I don't know. I know it's it's good for the body. I'm not sure.
- **[37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=2222s)** — Something to try and experiment. I think there's a there's some data that shows that it improves cataracts.
- **[37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=2229s)** — Also, you know, a lot of the what's happening with the the opaqueness in the lens is you're getting it's called glycation.
- **[37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=2239s)** — So you're it's like a protein that's connected to a sugar.
- **[37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=2242s)** — And that's from doing too many carbs and stuff like that with with protein.
- **[37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=2248s)** — So now that locks up the protein and so creates a little opaqueness that creates a lot of free radical damage.
- **[37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=2257s)** — And so there's two types of antioxidants, stuff in the food and also stuff that your body makes.
- **[37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=2264s)** — Your body makes antioxidants and in a more significant way than the food antioxidants.
- **[37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=2273s)** — So having the right nutrients, selenium, zinc, copper, manganese with high quality protein from grass fed meats and stuff like that
- **[38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=2286s)** — are really beneficial to build up your natural antioxidants to prevent a lot of these complications from glycation and iron and pollution.
- **[38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=2299s)** — All right. Very good. Here's another one for and I mean this are smart audience quiz question number four.
- **[38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=2306s)** — Why is fructose more damaging on the body, even if it's lower on the glycemic index than glucose?
- **[38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=2313s)** — And I forgot to add that little comment in there. But all right. Very good. I can't wait to learn from the audience back to social media.
- **[38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=2320s)** — Let's see. Josh from YouTube. What's the best for autophagy? A 16 hour fast every day or a 24 hour or longer fast once a week? Good question.
- **[38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=2332s)** — So it's it's not like an on off switch. You kind of develop autophagy the more you fast.
- **[38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=2338s)** — So there might be a little bit of autophagy starting out and then more and more and more as you go 18 hours, 20 hours, 23 hours, you get more autophagy.
- **[39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=2347s)** — If you if you can do three 48 hours or 72 hours, you get a lot more top of G.
- **[39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=2352s)** — So this is why I think it's periodic, prolonged intermittent fasting.
- **[39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=2359s)** — So maybe once a week or once every two weeks you do 48 hours.
- **[39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=2366s)** — That would go that would go a long way because it actually forces your body to get really conservative and start to recycle a lot of the tissue because it doesn't have the protein there.
- **[39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=2376s)** — So it's going to recycle it. And what does it have to go after your muscles? No, it's going to go after the damaged proteins first.
- **[39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=2383s)** — It's very smart. So it's going to go after, you know, scar tissue had or damaged tissue that's kind of locking up biological functions and start.
- **[39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=2395s)** — It's amazing. It's a garbage disposal in your cells that will just literally.
- **[40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=2400s)** — Dismantle with enzymes and then form brand new spanking new proteins to have for new tissue.
- **[40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=2409s)** — It's like the ultimate for anti aging.
- **[40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=2412s)** — Wow, if I may, I'm 21.3 on the fasting, but I do enjoy a cup of decaf about 10 o'clock at night with a big glop of heavy cream.
- **[40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=2421s)** — Have I destroyed the whole process?
- **[40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=2424s)** — Well, it's not. I think it's going to. It'll probably stop autophagy and ketosis for a little while.
- **[40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=2432s)** — So maybe not do too much cream because, yes, it's low on the glycemic index.
- **[40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=2440s)** — It's it's not going to stimulate insulin to a certain degree.
- **[40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=2445s)** — But anything anytime you eat it all, it will increase insulin to some degree.
- **[40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=2450s)** — So anytime insulin goes up, it bumps you out of ketosis in the top of the tree.
- **[40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=2454s)** — So we want to keep insulin low. So maybe just do the black coffee.
- **[40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=2459s)** — All right. Straight up. Here's question number four for you, Doc.
- **[41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=2464s)** — OK, I already asked that. So let's do we have an answer.
- **[41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=2468s)** — Let's see. Maybe that's what I meant. No, we don't yet.
- **[41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=2472s)** — Let's see. Let's go to social media as we wait.
- **[41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=2476s)** — A&J from Facebook can aloe aloe vera drinks harm the liver.
- **[41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=2481s)** — My doctor warned me to stop drinking them and stop taking supplements except vitamin C. Your thoughts, doctor?
- **[41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=2489s)** — Yeah, we should stop those natural remedies and just take the drugs because they've been tested.
- **[41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=2494s)** — They're FDA approved and they're generally recognized as safe.
- **[41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=2500s)** — No, I don't. I never heard that before. The aloe is is bad for you.
- **[41:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=2506s)** — Yeah, I think that's incorrect information, Steve.
- **[41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=2510s)** — All right. Good. Well, oh, speaking of quiz question number four, which I wanted to ask twice,
- **[41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=2516s)** — it asks, why is fructose damaging on the body even if it's lower than the glycemic index in the audience?
- **[42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=2524s)** — Eighty five percent of respondents say it's because it directly produced in the liver.
- **[42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=2528s)** — Ten percent say it's because it's very concentrated and five percent say it has similar properties to the processing of alcohol in the body.
- **[42:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=2537s)** — Again, some lofty answers. Is that correct?
- **[42:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=2541s)** — Yes. So here's the thing.
- **[42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=2546s)** — You have fructose and glucose and these are individual sugar molecules.
- **[42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=2554s)** — OK. And when you combine them together, they form what's called a disaccharide or two sugars like cable sugar and honey.
- **[42:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=2563s)** — They're disaccharides. You're both connected when you consume starches.
- **[42:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=2569s)** — You're just dealing with a string of glucose. There's no fructose and starch.
- **[42:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=2575s)** — So when you drink fructose, as in high fructose corn syrup, it's in a lot of different junk foods.
- **[43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=2584s)** — Only the liver can deal with that fructose.
- **[43:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=2587s)** — Whereas if you did glucose, all of your whole body cells can metabolize glucose.
- **[43:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=2595s)** — So think about this. To force feed one organ in your entire body to deal with this poison, I'm sorry, the sugar, like that's a lot of stress on the liver.
- **[43:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=2607s)** — It doesn't get to be equally distributed.
- **[43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=2610s)** — And so it creates more problems in the liver to the point where we have more inflammation, more toxicity, very similar to alcohol.
- **[43:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=2620s)** — But also it can cause insulin resistance even worse than glucose.
- **[43:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=2627s)** — We talk about high fructose corn syrup.
- **[43:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=2631s)** — So think about this. Now, your cells can't pull in insulin because they're resistant and they can't pull in glucose.
- **[44:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=2645s)** — So what happens now? Because we have a cell that's literally starving, yet you're consuming a lot of sugar, right? You can't pull it in there.
- **[44:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=2655s)** — So the body has a plan B by compensating. And what it will do, it will start to produce more glucose.
- **[44:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=2666s)** — It's called gluconeo. That means new. Genesis, the creation of. So now the body starts making more glucose.
- **[44:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=2675s)** — And I think I should just stop right there because I think there's something related to this in the next question, Steve.
- **[44:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=2681s)** — All right. Well, speak of the devil. Why don't we get to that? There it is, Don.
- **[44:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=2687s)** — Why do I always do this? I'm like, I'm giving you some clues. OK.
- **[44:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=2692s)** — Why do some diabetics have high blood sugar levels, even if they even even if they lower their carbohydrates?
- **[45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=2702s)** — All right. Maybe you have a hint, audience. Speaking the audience, let's go to Meg from YouTube.
- **[45:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=2709s)** — My stomach constantly gurgles and I'm in pain. My gastroenterologist wants me to take Pepsid twice a day.
- **[45:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=2717s)** — Could I be suffering from low stomach acid?
- **[45:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=2720s)** — You could. So when you get gurgling or all these different sounds, it just tells us that your diet is not quite right for you.
- **[45:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=2729s)** — So I would I would radically revaluate what you're eating instead of trying to treat the symptom with some drug.
- **[45:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=2735s)** — It's like now we now we're going to go down a rabbit hole, which doesn't have any good outcomes because you're just camouflaging the hole in the bucket.
- **[45:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=2745s)** — This is the problem I have with medicine is they don't. So, Steve, let me ask you a question.
- **[45:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=2751s)** — Tell me one thing, one medication that helps increase the health of the body.
- **[45:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=2758s)** — Can you think of one? Put me on the spot here. All the medications out there.
- **[46:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=2764s)** — Just give me one. That's all I want. A medication, not a vitamin. Right.
- **[46:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=2770s)** — OK, I don't know. Right.
- **[46:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=2773s)** — Either do I. Because what it's doing, it's not increasing the health.
- **[46:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=2776s)** — It's just it's it's switching out one problem for another.
- **[46:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=2780s)** — Like when you take high medication for diabetes, right?
- **[46:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=2783s)** — What do you think it's doing to your sugar? Is it making it evaporate?
- **[46:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=2787s)** — No, it's just it's getting it out of the bloodstream, but it's putting it somewhere else.
- **[46:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=2791s)** — So basically we get we trade one problem with a side effect.
- **[46:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=2796s)** — And so this is the problem with medicine. It's not really based on increasing health.
- **[46:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=2803s)** — People will debate that. But the thing is, I don't think you're getting healthy because now you're dependent on something.
- **[46:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=2808s)** — And that's not true health. And also just because you get rid of a symptom doesn't mean you're healthier.
- **[46:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=2813s)** — So the point is that I think that if you get this gurgling sound, reevaluate the diet, change that, you probably need to increase your microbiome to help you digest.
- **[47:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=2826s)** — We just changed our dog food. OK, we just changed dog foods.
- **[47:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=2833s)** — And of course, Charlie, our dog, jumps in the bed last night.
- **[47:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=2837s)** — He was on the bed and I'm trying to sleep and I hear this gurgling going on all night long.
- **[47:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=2843s)** — It's the change in dog food. There's something in that dog food that he can't is not digesting that well.
- **[47:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=2849s)** — So, yeah, that's just a symptom. You're on the wrong program.
- **[47:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=2854s)** — Interesting. Good luck, Charlie. OK, let's see. Till we meet from Rumble after developing a staph infection following surgery, I'm now on a round of antibiotics for 14 days.
- **[47:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=2866s)** — Can I take a prebiotic while on these antibiotics?
- **[47:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=2871s)** — I wouldn't. I would take a probiotic.
- **[47:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=2875s)** — And then I would continue to take that probiotic after you stop because they're wiping out all the good bacteria as well as the bad.
- **[48:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=2883s)** — So you want to kind of replace the good bacteria. It's not going to hurt.
- **[48:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=2888s)** — I mean, I'd like to someone to explain to me why taking a good bacteria, why you're taking an antibiotic is bad because are we trying to kill the good bacteria for any reason?
- **[48:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=2899s)** — Is there any purpose for that? I don't think so. So you take that because it's what's going to happen is after you take the antibiotic, your gut never comes back to the original diversity and the ratios and stuff.
- **[48:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=2910s)** — So it's always a problem. And if anyone says, oh, yeah, they all grow back. Not necessarily true.
- **[48:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=2916s)** — Some of them don't come back. I mean, look what's happening.
- **[48:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=2919s)** — Look, look what happens to a person after years of taking antibiotics, including myself.
- **[48:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=2923s)** — You have all sorts of problems with your microbiome and digestion.
- **[48:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=2927s)** — And so I would watch my recent video I did on it's the micro behind depression and just you'll get some good information on that.
- **[48:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=2936s)** — Interesting. I'll watch it. Okay. Let's see. Dr. Berg, our astute audiences answered quiz question number five, which asked, why do some diabetics have high blood sugar levels, even if they lower their carbohydrates?
- **[49:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=2950s)** — And 92 percent of our respondents say it's because of insulin resistance and eight percent say it's because of a magnesium deficiency.
- **[49:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=2961s)** — Very good answers. Steve. So when someone's a diabetic and they start cutting down their carbs, you would expect they're not eating any sugars.
- **[49:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=2974s)** — The blood sugar should come right down. But a lot of times it doesn't. They'll stay higher. Like, why? It's because of something else.
- **[49:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=2983s)** — The liver is still so insulin resistant and like it can't it can't even absorb enough sugar.
- **[49:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=2991s)** — The sensors with that insulin resistance then causes the liver to make its own sugar.
- **[49:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=2999s)** — And that's called gluconeogenesis. So the majority. This is interesting.
- **[50:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=3006s)** — The majority of blood sugar in a diabetic is coming from that gluconeogenesis.
- **[50:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=3014s)** — Not necessarily always the diet. That's interesting. So your body is keeping the sugar high because of the insulin resistance.
- **[50:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=3024s)** — So where is it getting the sugar? It's turning it's turning things into sugars, turning fats in the sugars, turning protein in the sugar, non carbohydrate sources.
- **[50:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=3037s)** — So this is why metformin is used because metformin has one huge effect at helping the receptor for insulin, the liver work better.
- **[50:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=3053s)** — So it reduces insulin resistance and it reduces that glucose production of the liver called gluconeogenesis in diabetes.
- **[51:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=3062s)** — And so the problem is it has a black warning label because it creates a B1 and B12 deficiency.
- **[51:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=3068s)** — So I highly recommend taking those vitamins. But why not take a look at maybe something that doesn't have side effects that works in a similar way like berberine.
- **[51:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=3079s)** — Berberine does a similar thing. There's research on it. You should look it up. But here's the big problem, Steve.
- **[51:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=3087s)** — If you...anytime anything natural, natural remedy creates an effect like that on a disease, then it moves over into the classification of drugs.
- **[51:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=3101s)** — And if someone's using that to cure it, then they're practicing medicine without a license.
- **[51:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=3108s)** — So the only reason I'm even talking about this is because I'm not...I don't have a patient doctor-patient relationship with people.
- **[51:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=3116s)** — So just giving information so you can do your research. But it's really interesting how medicine pretty much has a monopoly over disease and treatments.
- **[52:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=3124s)** — And you can't necessarily cross that line. But the point is, I mean, there's research, berberine.
- **[52:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=3132s)** — There's a lot of things also going intermittent fasting, low carb. All of these things will help reduce the insulin resistance to the point where your blood sugars will finally start coming down.
- **[52:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=3143s)** — That's encouraging. Dana from Facebook, do you believe manuka honey has healthy benefits?
- **[52:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=3150s)** — Yeah, yeah, it does. It has antimicrobial. That's a natural antibiotic effect. It's good for sore throats. It's really interesting.
- **[52:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=3159s)** — There's some wild properties that...for your digestion. Yeah, it's very unique. I think I've done a video on it.
- **[52:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=3167s)** — All right, let's go to Lini from YouTube. Could you please discuss the benefits of taking DIM?
- **[52:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=3174s)** — This is a super concentrated cruciferous product. So it helps to regulate excess estrogen.
- **[53:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=3185s)** — So it's good. Like, for example, if gyno, mastia, like excessive breast tissue in men, that would be good for that.
- **[53:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=3193s)** — If a woman has estrogen dominance, she should take it. So it helps to lower this estrogen, which a lot of people have too much.
- **[53:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=3206s)** — Interesting. Dora from Facebook, what would you recommend for those pesky varicose veins?
- **[53:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=3213s)** — There's several natural remedies, and you can watch my video on that.
- **[53:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=3216s)** — But I think probably a very important thing is that as we age, we get more problem with the veins because of a sedentary lifestyle, too much sitting.
- **[53:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=3228s)** — And that's the worst. Think about your...what is a vein? You hear the heart pumps, it pushes blood through the vascular arterial system, and then it hits the capillaries.
- **[53:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=3239s)** — And then it has to come back through the venous system. The venous system can be sluggish if you're not really exercising enough, and then it just pulls.
- **[54:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=3252s)** — Especially if you do too much sitting and things like that. So now we get this dilation of this vein.
- **[54:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=3258s)** — So I think one of the best things to do is to, beyond just the healthy diet, is to do regular, consistent exercise.
- **[54:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=3268s)** — Good. Okay. That sounds like sound advice. Saranda. Sarandir, excuse me, from Facebook. What's the best way to reduce high protein levels in the blood?
- **[54:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=3283s)** — Are you sure it's not high levels of protein in the urine?
- **[54:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=3288s)** — Interesting.
- **[54:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=3289s)** — And I mean, high protein could be a liver problem. It could be a kidney problem, especially if it's in the urine. That means there's some kidney problems.
- **[55:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=3304s)** — If there's not enough protein in the blood, you start getting edema, because the liver makes these proteins that are in the blood.
- **[55:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=3312s)** — So that's why when you get cirrhosis and you don't make enough protein, then you have low protein and you start getting edema and swelling and fluid retention and something called the CITES.
- **[55:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=3322s)** — So you get this pot belly effect. But too much protein, I would need more information to try to figure that out.
- **[55:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=3332s)** — All right. How about... Hi, Kathy from Facebook. Is there a link between a polycystic ovary and high cortisol levels?
- **[55:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=3342s)** — I don't think so. But I think there's a link between high levels of estrogen.
- **[55:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=3349s)** — And because what works really good for any type of cysts in the ovaries is iodine, which actually lowers that estrogen.
- **[55:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=3359s)** — Now, I remember in practice, had this lady come in, she had this serious hip pain.
- **[56:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=3368s)** — And I just said, you know, have you ever had your ovaries checked? Because I know that in a large ovary or cyst can refer pain to the hip.
- **[56:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=3376s)** — She did it and it was like massive. It was like just a huge swollen ovary.
- **[56:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=3381s)** — So she got in Seek Help. And I think over three weeks it went down to normal. She was fine. Hip pain went away.
- **[56:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=3387s)** — So, yeah, estrogen. So you want to be careful about birth control pills, hormonal placement therapy, and some of the other estrogen compounds that could potentially come from soy products.
- **[56:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=3404s)** — All right. Well, Terry, I'm so proud of you for typing so much. Here's a long one.
- **[56:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=3408s)** — This is from Nada or Nada from YouTube. My daughter is pregnant and suffering from autoimmune disorders, rheumatoid arthritis and ankle locespondylitis.
- **[56:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=3418s)** — Oh, he did that attacks the spine. Ankle locespondylitis. Did I say that right? Terry? Yeah.
- **[57:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=3425s)** — Okay. And she has constant flare ups. And I'm concerned that they may affect her six week pregnancy.
- **[57:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=3431s)** — And she says, thank you, Dr. Bird, to close all that.
- **[57:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=3435s)** — This is what I would do. I would, if you were relative, I would say, first of all, when you go through pregnancy, in theory, autoimmune disease should kind of go in remission.
- **[57:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=3451s)** — Apparently it's not. So the need for vitamin D goes up when you're pregnant. And so you probably were sub-clinically deficient.
- **[57:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=3461s)** — I would imagine your prior levels are maybe 20 or lower. And nanograms per milliliter. And I think what happens is now it's going to flare up more inflammation.
- **[57:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=3475s)** — So what I would do if I were you is I would start taking large amounts, probably 40,000, 50,000 I use every single day to reduce inflammation.
- **[58:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=3486s)** — And that extra vitamin D could actually really help that baby too.
- **[58:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=3497s)** — There are doctors that you can work with around the world that can help you work with higher doses of vitamin D3.
- **[58:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=3505s)** — And they can check different things like the parathyroid gland, making sure you're taking all the cofactors like magnesium and zinc and K2.
- **[58:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=3514s)** — But I think vitamin D is so important in autoimmune diseases as well.
- **[58:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=3522s)** — Alright, very good. Exploited is... I'm sorry to hear that. From YouTube, what are the best supplements for someone with rheumatoid arthritis? That's a horrible condition.
- **[58:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=3532s)** — Well, that's an autoimmune and large doses of vitamin D3.
- **[58:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=3537s)** — I mean, the thing is when you check your blood, you're looking at the inactive version.
- **[59:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=3547s)** — Very little of that goes into the immune system. Most goes into the bone and the calcium.
- **[59:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=3555s)** — So autoimmune is an immune problem.
- **[59:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=3562s)** — And the T cell misalignment between the T cells sets you up for an autoimmune disease.
- **[59:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=3573s)** — And they have receptors for vitamin D.
- **[59:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=3575s)** — And so an autoimmune disease is a hyperimmune reaction.
- **[59:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=3582s)** — So we're getting more inflammation.
- **[59:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=3584s)** — And so if we just put in an immune modulator, vitamin D, and overcome some of the resistance that a lot of people have.
- **[59:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=3592s)** — And this is the reason why they get autoimmune disease.
- **[59:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=3594s)** — They have this deeper problem with the vitamin D receptor that just either is genetically or just a past infection.

- **[00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9TD4aPRd6k&t=0s)** — Hello, everyone. I have a very special short presentation. I'm going to tell you what I'm going to be talking about at an upcoming event that you need to be there.
- **[00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9TD4aPRd6k&t=10s)** — It's called Hack Your Health. And we have the CEO, the person who's putting this whole thing on, Robin, is here with us.
- **[00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9TD4aPRd6k&t=17s)** — You know, I've been doing a lot of research. I want to share with you some of the updated things that I'm involved in that you're just going to blow you away.
- **[00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9TD4aPRd6k&t=24s)** — And it's really going to be good for me to finally meet you in person because I'm sitting in front of this camera and behind a computer all day long.
- **[00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9TD4aPRd6k&t=32s)** — And I need to get out of the house. I need to go meet people.
- **[00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9TD4aPRd6k&t=36s)** — So I want to share with you four things I'm going to be talking about that you're not going to want to miss.
- **[00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9TD4aPRd6k&t=42s)** — OK, so I'm going to talk about hopefully, Robin, if you give me enough time, but I want to talk about cancer.
- **[00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9TD4aPRd6k&t=50s)** — This is something I can't talk about on YouTube, but there is something very, very new that I stumbled on that is even more powerful than fasting for cancer.
- **[01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9TD4aPRd6k&t=62s)** — I mean, there is a gentleman who I did a video on who had stage four cancer and his entire success was doing fasting, prolonged fasting.
- **[01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9TD4aPRd6k&t=74s)** — And he should have been dead six years ago. He's still alive, going well.
- **[01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9TD4aPRd6k&t=79s)** — We have before and afters of him getting rid of his cancer using fasting. Right.
- **[01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9TD4aPRd6k&t=83s)** — Well, there's something else that's even more powerful than fasting.
- **[01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9TD4aPRd6k&t=89s)** — And it is basically the poor man's cure because it involves no surgery, no drugs and no money.
- **[01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9TD4aPRd6k&t=98s)** — OK, so there's nothing to buy. There's no supplements, anything.
- **[01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9TD4aPRd6k&t=101s)** — You need to hear what I'm going to talk about on that. The research I stumbled on this was on animals.
- **[01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9TD4aPRd6k&t=107s)** — OK, so it's true. It's not on humans, but the principles are the same.
- **[01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9TD4aPRd6k&t=113s)** — So you're not going to want to miss this. This will blow you away.
- **[01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9TD4aPRd6k&t=117s)** — So I'm going to cover cancer. And the second thing I'm going to cover has to do with autoimmune diseases.
- **[02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9TD4aPRd6k&t=124s)** — And, Robin, I don't know if you if I mentioned this before, but we know that like heart disease and cancer is probably the two top most things that get people.
- **[02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9TD4aPRd6k&t=135s)** — Right. But there's a third thing that's even bigger right now that just popped up.
- **[02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9TD4aPRd6k&t=141s)** — It's an epidemic. And that is autoimmune diseases. Did I did I mention that?
- **[02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9TD4aPRd6k&t=145s)** — You have. Yes. I'm really interested in this topic.
- **[02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9TD4aPRd6k&t=149s)** — Yeah, autoimmune diseases are on the rise, like on a massive scale.
- **[02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9TD4aPRd6k&t=153s)** — But out of all the autoimmune diseases, the thyroid Hashimoto's is number one.
- **[02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9TD4aPRd6k&t=159s)** — Yeah. And the question is why? I had the answer.
- **[02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9TD4aPRd6k&t=164s)** — I'm going to share it with people exactly why out of all these autoimmune diseases that are, you know, just trending up.
- **[02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9TD4aPRd6k&t=171s)** — Why is the Hashimoto's is number one. I'm going to show you some solutions for that.
- **[02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9TD4aPRd6k&t=176s)** — And we're going to talk about that. That's going to be really interesting.
- **[03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9TD4aPRd6k&t=180s)** — Number three, I'm going to talk about something that I was involved with a long time ago that involves the heart.
- **[03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9TD4aPRd6k&t=190s)** — You know, people are really talking about cholesterol, LDL, clogged arteries, et cetera.
- **[03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9TD4aPRd6k&t=196s)** — But there's more to heart problems than just a clogged artery.
- **[03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9TD4aPRd6k&t=202s)** — Back, I don't know, maybe this is 20 years ago, I studied the works of Dr. Roy Elite when he had something called the endocardiograph,
- **[03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9TD4aPRd6k&t=211s)** — which is an older unit of what they have now of a sound recorder for your heart.
- **[03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9TD4aPRd6k&t=217s)** — And so I had this crazy idea. I wanted to digitize it.
- **[03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9TD4aPRd6k&t=221s)** — So hired a bunch of acoustic engineers and people to put this thing together and start to have a digital version of this endocardiograph,
- **[03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9TD4aPRd6k&t=231s)** — which is a very sophisticated heart sound recording system because he developed the technology of using nutrition to evaluate heart sounds.
- **[04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9TD4aPRd6k&t=242s)** — Because out of all the organ tissues, the heart is the most responsive to nutrition.
- **[04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9TD4aPRd6k&t=247s)** — I mean, like you could see changes quickly. And so back in the 40s and 50s, Roy Elite had all these doctors using this technology of using the endocardiograph,
- **[04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9TD4aPRd6k&t=260s)** — which he developed, as well as this method until I think it was like the early 1963-ish timeframe where the FDA came in and shut them down
- **[04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9TD4aPRd6k&t=271s)** — and confiscated all these units, of course, because it was a big threat.
- **[04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9TD4aPRd6k&t=275s)** — But that technology was kept alive and is still going today, not in a large scale.
- **[04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9TD4aPRd6k&t=283s)** — Anyway, what I want to do is I want to share with people what we kind of found when I actually even did that in practice, when I was in practice,
- **[04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9TD4aPRd6k&t=290s)** — as far as the relationship between how the heart responds to nutrition.
- **[04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9TD4aPRd6k&t=297s)** — Again, not just about clogged arteries, but about with valvular function.
- **[05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9TD4aPRd6k&t=301s)** — What's behind murmurs? What's behind angina and a heart attack when someone has no clogged arteries? What's up with that?
- **[05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9TD4aPRd6k&t=315s)** — What's really behind arrhythmias? What's behind when the heart starts to enlarge, when it starts to work harder and get bigger?
- **[05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9TD4aPRd6k&t=324s)** — What nutritional factors relate to all this? I'm going to share all that with you.
- **[05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9TD4aPRd6k&t=329s)** — It's going to be very, very important, especially if you have a heart, which you do.
- **[05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9TD4aPRd6k&t=333s)** — So you're going to want to know about that.
- **[05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9TD4aPRd6k&t=337s)** — And the last topic I'm going to talk about has to do with, I think, medicine of the future, which is going to be something called metabolomics.
- **[05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9TD4aPRd6k&t=346s)** — OK, metabolomics. What is metabolomics? It has to do with metabolism, which the Greek word for metabolism is change or transformation.
- **[05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9TD4aPRd6k&t=355s)** — So you have food that changes into energy, into body tissue, et cetera, and you have waste coming out.
- **[06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9TD4aPRd6k&t=362s)** — So metabolism is a very broad term.
- **[06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9TD4aPRd6k&t=365s)** — But metabolomics has to do with assessing what's called metabolites, which are these all the different chemical things that happen in these biochemical pathways in your biochemistry.
- **[06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9TD4aPRd6k&t=380s)** — And so there is actually a... it's not really new, but it's new for a lot of people because even doctors don't even know much about it.
- **[06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9TD4aPRd6k&t=390s)** — But it's a new technology that's coming out that is growing really fast in the research area.
- **[06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9TD4aPRd6k&t=395s)** — There's like 81,000 studies on it already.
- **[06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9TD4aPRd6k&t=400s)** — But metabolomics allows a practitioner to look inside your biochemistry to see a picture, to see like a kind of an imprint in time.
- **[06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9TD4aPRd6k&t=413s)** — And the question is, like, how is it different than a regular blood test?
- **[06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9TD4aPRd6k&t=416s)** — Well, a blood test will assess a series of biomarkers, maybe, I don't know, six to 13 biomarkers mainly.
- **[07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9TD4aPRd6k&t=424s)** — And it gives you more data, but it doesn't really tell you what's going on behind the scenes.
- **[07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9TD4aPRd6k&t=430s)** — It kind of tells you the symptom. It doesn't tell you why.
- **[07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9TD4aPRd6k&t=434s)** — So metabolomics is a fairly new technology that will show you what's really underneath the hood.
- **[07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9TD4aPRd6k&t=440s)** — Because where medicine, you know, they treat disease, they diagnose disease, metabolomics looks more at function.
- **[07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9TD4aPRd6k&t=449s)** — How is the body functioning right now? And what can we do to fix the function? And what can we do to create more health?
- **[07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9TD4aPRd6k&t=456s)** — So it's a completely different model that I think it's going to disrupt the medical kind of the standards treating these treating symptoms versus like really understanding what's going on.
- **[07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9TD4aPRd6k&t=469s)** — So I'm going to share with you this topic, especially as it relates to me, because what I'm doing is I'm doing a metabolic test every two weeks now.
- **[07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9TD4aPRd6k&t=479s)** — And I'm analyzing my own body. I'm learning all this amazing data with some top people that are involved with this, using me as a guinea pig.
- **[08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9TD4aPRd6k&t=488s)** — And I'm going to share with what we're sharing with you what we're finding that we're discovering.
- **[08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9TD4aPRd6k&t=493s)** — Because, yeah, you can put everyone on a certain diet, but this allows you to really tailor make and see if what you're doing and eating is working for you.
- **[08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9TD4aPRd6k&t=508s)** — Because not every person needs the exact same thing that you could do like a blood test to measure, let's say vitamin C, or you can go by the RDAs.
- **[08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9TD4aPRd6k&t=517s)** — But this test allows us to see if you're using if what the inputs of like vitamin C is being utilized efficiently for these different pathways that need it.
- **[08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9TD4aPRd6k&t=532s)** — So let's say, for example, your demand is really, really high for a certain nutrient.
- **[08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9TD4aPRd6k&t=537s)** — You know, who I mean, this will pick that up versus trying to just do a blood test and say you're normal.
- **[09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9TD4aPRd6k&t=545s)** — Blood test doesn't really tell you what's going on deeper in the cells.
- **[09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9TD4aPRd6k&t=549s)** — So we're able to look at the biochemical steps between the different steps like the chemistry, like even the Krebs cycle, we have all these different steps.
- **[09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9TD4aPRd6k&t=557s)** — It's like an assembly line. We're able to see the inputs, the changes that occur.
- **[09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9TD4aPRd6k&t=563s)** — And then from the changes, we could see bottlenecks, missing cofactors.
- **[09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9TD4aPRd6k&t=568s)** — Those are like nutrients and really do a deep dive on your true health.
- **[09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9TD4aPRd6k&t=576s)** — And primarily, my whole focus is on the mitochondria, because if you can just get your mitochondria really healthy, you're going to be healthy.
- **[09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9TD4aPRd6k&t=585s)** — You know, there's no way you could be sick and have a really healthy mitochondria.
- **[09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9TD4aPRd6k&t=589s)** — So many diseases stem from the mitochondria, including cancer.
- **[09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9TD4aPRd6k&t=592s)** — So this allows us to have a way to measure that mitochondrial efficiency and function, which I think is going to be a game changer versus just the blood test.
- **[10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9TD4aPRd6k&t=606s)** — So I'm going to be getting into that and explaining it.
- **[10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9TD4aPRd6k&t=611s)** — I mean, like even like there's certain toxins, heavy metals that can block pathways.
- **[10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9TD4aPRd6k&t=616s)** — But it's almost like, do you want to detox or do we just want to make these pathways work better?
- **[10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9TD4aPRd6k&t=623s)** — So this you might need more of a certain nutrient to really just push through pollution, chemicals, oxidative stress to just make sure it works.
- **[10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9TD4aPRd6k&t=633s)** — Right. So it's a better strategy for creating health.
- **[10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9TD4aPRd6k&t=637s)** — And it gives us the whole whole picture.
- **[10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9TD4aPRd6k&t=640s)** — And it even allows a practitioner to predict of what could happen down the road or what's going to happen.
- **[10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9TD4aPRd6k&t=646s)** — But like with diabetes, you can predict it like two decades before you even get it.
- **[10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9TD4aPRd6k&t=651s)** — So that's going to be. Yeah, it's going to be amazing.
- **[10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9TD4aPRd6k&t=654s)** — You know, you get a blood test and your blood sugars are normal.
- **[10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9TD4aPRd6k&t=657s)** — That does not tell you anything about, you know, if you're going to get diabetes tomorrow, whatever, because you want to look at the deeper underneath the hood.
- **[11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9TD4aPRd6k&t=665s)** — So I'm going to share this technology with and make it really simple, because I think the the reason why it hasn't caught on so far, because I think it's been out in the late 60s, is because we really just the word metabolomics stops you right there.
- **[11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9TD4aPRd6k&t=684s)** — It's like it puts you to sleep. It's like, what's metabolomics? What's that?
- **[11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9TD4aPRd6k&t=690s)** — You have so many. I think one of the worst things that's happening now is to get misdiagnosed, right?
- **[11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9TD4aPRd6k&t=698s)** — They don't have all the information. You got missing information. All of a sudden you get the wrong diagnosis, get the wrong treatment, and you get you go down this path.
- **[11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9TD4aPRd6k&t=705s)** — So this is going to be a great tool to get the complete picture to make sure there's nothing missing, to be able to look at all aspects to narrow down on someone's problem a lot more than what's happening right now with the typical blood test.
- **[12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9TD4aPRd6k&t=722s)** — And so you can then over time, test yourself against yourself over time.
- **[12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9TD4aPRd6k&t=727s)** — So, you know, I was initially interested in the genome and genome and the genetic testing, but that's really only the test the potential of what might happen.
- **[12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9TD4aPRd6k&t=738s)** — Right. So if we have the genome plus the epigenome, the environment that's interacting on your genes, then we get the the metabolomic testing so we can see how everything is being affecting you and looking at very specific biomarkers.
- **[12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9TD4aPRd6k&t=757s)** — To be able to see where you're at, and how you're improving, and if you're not and to get prediction. So those are the kind of the four topics that I'm going to be discussing.
- **[12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9TD4aPRd6k&t=769s)** — I'm going to try to cram that into.
- **[12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9TD4aPRd6k&t=772s)** — Oh, Robert, how much time do I have?
- **[12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9TD4aPRd6k&t=775s)** — You have 50 minutes.
- **[12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9TD4aPRd6k&t=777s)** — Okay, then I'm gonna have to talk fast.
- **[13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9TD4aPRd6k&t=781s)** — But, so this event is going to be in Austin.
- **[13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9TD4aPRd6k&t=786s)** — Right. And the date is going to be when?
- **[13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9TD4aPRd6k&t=790s)** — May 31st through June 2nd.
- **[13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9TD4aPRd6k&t=792s)** — Awesome. And then also, how much does it cost?
- **[13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9TD4aPRd6k&t=797s)** — The general attendee ticket is $299, but we created a discount code for your community, Dr. Berg. So the general admission ticket would be $249.
- **[13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9TD4aPRd6k&t=808s)** — Okay, that's really cheap. So everyone can come to that. That's great.
- **[13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9TD4aPRd6k&t=814s)** — And we're trying to bring as wide of an audience as we can. We'd like to... the whole goal of this event is to educate as many people as we possibly can.
- **[13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9TD4aPRd6k&t=825s)** — I love it.
- **[13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9TD4aPRd6k&t=827s)** — Yeah, there's going to be, I think, several thousand people that are going to attend this. You have a lot of speakers.
- **[13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9TD4aPRd6k&t=832s)** — And I think, you know, your organization was called KetoCon, but kind of switch it to more hacking your health because, you know, if we look at the whole picture of health, there's a lot... there's additional things other than diet, right?
- **[14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9TD4aPRd6k&t=848s)** — I mean, there's a whole bunch of things that you can implement.
- **[14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9TD4aPRd6k&t=851s)** — Yeah, we kind of... we found ourselves in a place where the sole conversation was about the ketogenic diet, which was really wonderful when things were just starting and there was so much research and there was a lot of evidence towards implementing a protocol like this for a lot of different reasons.
- **[14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9TD4aPRd6k&t=873s)** — And it helped a lot of people, including myself. But as we continued to have this event continue to grow, what I saw is that it became very limited. We were kind of...
- **[14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9TD4aPRd6k&t=885s)** — I felt that we were limiting the event to only people who were interested in the ketogenic diet. And there's just so much more to health than just your diet. And as you just discussed, it's very personalized.
- **[14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9TD4aPRd6k&t=896s)** — So what worked for me may not work for another person. They may need to do more or less than what I did. So this enables us to throw a much wider net.
- **[15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9TD4aPRd6k&t=905s)** — That's great. Yeah. And I always like these events because I get to meet people behind the camera. People have been watching me for a long time. I love to just meet people. So if you're out there, if you're watching my channel, I hope to meet you in person.
- **[15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9TD4aPRd6k&t=921s)** — We'll have plenty of time to hang out with people and talk to them. But definitely come to the event coming up here very soon. It's going to be what? Is this...
- **[15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9TD4aPRd6k&t=930s)** — Three months. Three months. Okay, good. So I really hope to see you there and to meet you in person. And this talk is going to literally blow you away. I think you're going to be excited.
- **[15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9TD4aPRd6k&t=944s)** — And a lot of value in this talk because there's a lot of things I'm working on. I have to work on several things to keep myself interested. And so I want to share some of these research things that I'm involved with.
- **[15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9TD4aPRd6k&t=957s)** — And I built a whole network of super smart people, way smarter than me, that are consulting and picking their brains and getting some of their research and some of their data from books that are not even published yet.
- **[16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9TD4aPRd6k&t=970s)** — And so I want to... they gave me permission to share that information with people. So I will reveal this information at the event coming up soon. Very excited to have you there. Awesome. Okay. Thank you, Robin. And we'll talk to you real soon. Thank you.

- **[00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=36s)** — Welcome back everyone. We are here with another Q&A. We are going to talk about everything
- **[00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=40s)** — keto and you guys might have some additional questions. Anything that I say is definitely
- **[00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=44s)** — not meant to replace your medical care check with your doctor before implementing any of
- **[00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=49s)** — the things we are going to talk about. We have some great people in the green room
- **[00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=53s)** — as well as people on social media. So bring your questions and let's get started.
- **[00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=57s)** — Okay, very good. We do have a great one. And also this is a milestone for us. We have in
- **[01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=63s)** — Dr. Berg show history the longest single question in terms of word count of any other
- **[01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=69s)** — one. So that's very exciting news for all of you. We will get to that shortly. But
- **[01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=73s)** — why don't we jump all... we love everyone, green room participants, of course Dr. Berg
- **[01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=77s)** — and also social media. So why don't we kick it off with some social media questions
- **[01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=82s)** — to begin with. And let's start with Robbie from YouTube. Please discuss the best ways
- **[01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=87s)** — to naturally cleanse the liver. I've heard a regimen of olive oil, Epsom salts, and
- **[01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=92s)** — citrus juice is very effective. Any comments on that, Doc?
- **[01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=97s)** — Yeah, just one thing you need to know about the liver. It's not a storage of
- **[01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=102s)** — toxins. It doesn't store toxins. The fat maybe in the liver might store toxins,
- **[01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=108s)** — but not the liver itself. It's a detoxifying machine. So it goes through this whole
- **[01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=116s)** — biochemical enzyme pathway, two different phases, or actually three different phases,
- **[02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=121s)** — to be able to turn poisons into harmless particles. So how can you increase that?
- **[02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=128s)** — Well, you want to strengthen the liver. Cruciferous vegetables also can help
- **[02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=135s)** — stimulate your own genes to actually detoxify. And there's also things in
- **[02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=141s)** — those cruciferous that can help dismantle poisons as well. So you have the cruciferous
- **[02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=146s)** — vegetables. Now as far as lemons, yes, lemon is definitely a great thing to help
- **[02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=152s)** — that process. You also have olive oil can help that process as well. It supports
- **[02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=159s)** — the liver. But you have many of the different herbs, like milk thistle, stinging
- **[02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=164s)** — nettle root, anything bitter, dandelion greens, arugula. Any of these bitter
- **[02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=172s)** — vegetables are really good to help increase the ability for that liver to
- **[02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=178s)** — detoxify and get rid of poisons.
- **[03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=181s)** — Very good. Okay, good luck with that, sir. Steve from YouTube, I've lost
- **[03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=185s)** — 65, excuse me, 62 pounds on healthy keto and intermittent fasting.
- **[03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=189s)** — I have to ring that. And let's see he says but he's got crepe skin C R E P E Terry
- **[03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=198s)** — Is that right? Does that make sense? crepe skin? And wants to know on his arms
- **[03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=203s)** — and so on and wants to know how to get rid of it.
- **[03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=206s)** — A couple things related to that. You may want to make sure that you have
- **[03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=213s)** — electrolytes to hold the fluid in your tissue so your tissues are not
- **[03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=218s)** — too dehydrated. Also, you want to make sure you have enough of the right fats,
- **[03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=223s)** — not just the saturated fats to come with the keto, but also the omega-3
- **[03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=227s)** — fatty acids. That might be helpful as well. And then you may want to just
- **[03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=232s)** — raise your carb level up to but not more than 50 grams because the
- **[03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=237s)** — carbs tend to increase water retention. Okay, a little bit more.
- **[04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=243s)** — This is why I like bodybuilders might go into competition and carb load,
- **[04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=248s)** — which I don't recommend you do. But just we're talking just raise the
- **[04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=251s)** — carbs up a little bit. You just the carb load tends to it doesn't increase
- **[04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=256s)** — muscle. It basically increases a fullness around your body. So you so
- **[04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=262s)** — you hold more fluid. And that might just handle it right there.
- **[04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=266s)** — Interesting. Now I can visualize the crepe skin sort of rippled or something
- **[04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=271s)** — like that. Well, good luck with that, Steve. But congratulations again on a
- **[04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=275s)** — tremendous weight loss. That's healthy. The other is just an annoyance,
- **[04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=280s)** — I'm sure. Jane from Zambia on YouTube, I am on peripheral neuropathy
- **[04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=288s)** — supplements. Boy, couldn't get that out. That have 18 milligrams of
- **[04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=292s)** — calcium citrate. Can I increase my intake to support bone growth?
- **[04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=298s)** — Well, peripheral neuropathy is if you're done supplements for that,
- **[05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=303s)** — then you want to take more calcium for bones two different problems.
- **[05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=308s)** — To build bone, you really want it's not just about calcium. I would
- **[05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=313s)** — recommend having the full array of trace minerals to build bone, make
- **[05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=319s)** — sure you have enough of the amino acids high quality amino acids from
- **[05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=323s)** — animal meats, specifically red meat. And then also, you definitely
- **[05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=329s)** — need calcium for sure. But also the vitamins that help the calcium
- **[05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=334s)** — go into the bones like vitamin K two. And so where do you get that?
- **[05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=340s)** — That's from sauerkraut, cheese, which then you can also get the
- **[05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=344s)** — calcium as well. fatty liver, things like that, that'll give you
- **[05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=350s)** — And of course, don't forget vitamin D. So you can get that from the sun,
- **[05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=355s)** — a caliber oil, or a supplement. Those are the things that I would
- **[05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=357s)** — focus on if you want to strengthen the bone. Of course, the
- **[06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=360s)** — peripheral neuropathy, that would be a combination of benfotamine
- **[06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=364s)** — and alpha lipoic acid.
- **[06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=367s)** — All right. Now, I just don't know of many other shows that have
- **[06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=370s)** — the worldwide support and viewership that the Dr. Berks show has.
- **[06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=374s)** — And once again, here's today's evidence of that. A good morning
- **[06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=378s)** — to all of our viewers joining us today from the UK, Canada. By the

- **[07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=432s)** — Moldova, Tanzania, Russia, Portugal, Scotland, Thailand,
- **[07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=436s)** — and of course all across these United States of America. And I'm always
- **[07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=439s)** — really nervous to read that because our producer Terry is a broadcast,
- **[07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=445s)** — degree, an English major, and he's a real grammarian. And he always catches me on
- **[07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=451s)** — mispronouncing something. So I'm just in an absolute sweat and panic each week as I
- **[07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=455s)** — read that for fear that I have somehow butchered the English language or foreign
- **[07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=461s)** — pronunciations of countries. So Terry, I'm doing the best I can. Trish from Facebook,
- **[07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=466s)** — is mushroom coffee a good alternative for a regular coffee? I think it is. I think it is. I
- **[07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=473s)** — kind of wish I never started drinking coffee, but now I'm addicted. So
- **[07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=477s)** — but yeah, mushrooms, there's some fascinating benefits with these different mushroom
- **[08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=482s)** — beverages and supplements from anti-aging to anti-cancer to incredible cognitive function as
- **[08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=489s)** — well. So I would definitely go that route if you're not addicted like myself.
- **[08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=495s)** — Okay, very good. And speaking of our grammarian, Terry sent me a message that
- **[08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=500s)** — crepe is pronounced crepe. So it's crepe skin. Thank you for that, Terry, that public humiliation.
- **[08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=506s)** — Alberto from YouTube, if the absorbic acid form of vitamin C is not good for us, how do
- **[08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=514s)** — we get the best forms of vitamin C without using fresh fruits and fresh fruit juices?
- **[08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=521s)** — You can get them from fresh vegetables like the bell pepper. Bell peppers are loaded. And also
- **[08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=529s)** — you're going to get vitamin C in all the vegetables and onions, salad, as well as
- **[08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=535s)** — lemons, juice the whole lemon. And then you can also get it from sauerkraut.
- **[09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=542s)** — That would be a good source. And berries are some berries are acceptable on the ketogenic diet.
- **[09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=548s)** — Okay, very good. Here is the first quiz question of the day, Dr. Berg.
- **[09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=553s)** — Okay. All right, question. Which part of the lemon contains most of the nutrition?
- **[09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=561s)** — I'm scared of what you're going to say. But there it is, doc, which is
- **[09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=565s)** — our audience, excuse me, which is the most nutritious part, the delicious
- **[09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=568s)** — inner part or something else, maybe who knows? Okay, let's go back once again to social media.
- **[09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=576s)** — Matt from YouTube, what is the best way to remove toxic metals from our skin cells so that
- **[09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=581s)** — our immune system can properly do its job? So he's filled with shrapnel.
- **[09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=587s)** — The first thing to do is to find out the source where it's coming from and avoid that.
- **[09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=591s)** — And the second thing is cilantro happens to be a good
- **[09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=596s)** — remedy for toxic metals, as well as
- **[10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=603s)** — drinking distilled water. That will help as well. But then you can put the minerals that
- **[10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=610s)** — you want back into the body. But I did a complete video on it. Heavy metals is a problem,
- **[10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=616s)** — for sure. And so there's many different hidden sources and it can really mess you up.
- **[10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=623s)** — Unfortunately, because of the food supply, it grows in things that have runoffs from different
- **[10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=633s)** — chemical companies. We're exposed to these toxic pollutants and not just heavy metals,
- **[10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=641s)** — but all sorts of plastics and things like that. So there's other things you can use too.
- **[10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=651s)** — I can't recall, but there's many different remedies. But I think those two would be a good start.
- **[10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=658s)** — All right, very good. Felipe from Facebook, besides physical therapy,
- **[11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=663s)** — what would you recommend to alleviate the horrible, I put that in, symptoms of sciatica?
- **[11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=670s)** — Well, you can try chiropractic. But I have a lot of videos on sciatica. I think
- **[11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=678s)** — the sciatic nerve is composed of more than one nerve and it branches from your lower lumbar to
- **[11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=685s)** — the lower sacrum. And it comes out through a little... it bundles into one nerve,
- **[11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=691s)** — which is the largest nerve of the body. And it comes right up through your butt and up
- **[11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=693s)** — through a little notch that goes down the back of the leg. So usually what happens is
- **[11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=698s)** — some type of pinching in the lumbar area could be part of a protruded disc or some scar tissue
- **[11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=708s)** — in that area. So what you can do is you can keep that curve arched inward. So you want to
- **[11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=717s)** — take a lumbar support or some type of cushion or foam roller, lay in your lower back to keep
- **[12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=722s)** — that curve in there. Because when you lose the curve, you start putting undue pressure on
- **[12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=727s)** — lower back. There's also certain vitamin deficiency things that can be related to that as well. I do
- **[12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=734s)** — videos on that. But I think the most important thing is to keep that curve in there. And
- **[12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=739s)** — you don't want to necessarily stretch your hamstring on the same side you have that
- **[12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=744s)** — pain. You want to stretch in the opposite way. So if you just stretch your thigh muscle,
- **[12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=749s)** — that would give you probably more relief. But I will say that long term sitting or driving
- **[12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=755s)** — just can really aggravate that sciatic nerve. All right, well, good luck with that. We hope
- **[12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=762s)** — that you can get over that Felipe. It's an awful thing. I've suffered from that. But we
- **[12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=767s)** — have not suffered from an unresponsive audience because they already have the answer to quiz
- **[12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=772s)** — question number one, which asks which part of the lemon contains the most nutritious part.
- **[12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=779s)** — And 98% of the respondents say it's the skin of the rind of the lemon yuck and 2% say it's
- **[13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=785s)** — seeds. No one voted for the gushy part. They are correct. So if you're going to eat a lemon,
- **[13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=793s)** — just eat the rind and the seeds and throw the rest away. Well, there's some vitamin C in the
- **[13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=798s)** — pith or not. Yeah, the pith, I think it's called the meat of that lemon. So yeah,
- **[13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=804s)** — there's vitamin C in there. But and it's kind of a trick question, because I didn't tell
- **[13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=808s)** — what nutrients. So mainly the flavonoids. Flavonoids are a general term of over,
- **[13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=816s)** — I think, six to 8,000 to even more different molecules. So there's quite a few. And that's
- **[13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=823s)** — what lemons are known for, especially the little white part underneath the rind.
- **[13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=828s)** — So this is this is why the best way to consume a lemon is to blend it
- **[13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=835s)** — in the water. But you can still do that you're going to get some nutrition, but you're going
- **[14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=840s)** — to get probably 10 times more if you blend the whole lemon and I put a little face minerals or I
- **[14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=845s)** — might put a couple drops of stevia or a little couple blueberries drink that drink down. It's
- **[14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=850s)** — really good. If you if you ever drink lemonade, sweet lemonade, you have to try,
- **[14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=859s)** — try this blending a lemon and putting a couple drops maybe a little bit of lemon juice in
- **[14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=863s)** — it. And then you can add a little bit of lemon juice. And then you can add maybe 10 drops of
- **[14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=864s)** — stevia in there. I swear you this is like the totally acceptable version of lemonade that you
- **[14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=870s)** — can have. And I think you'd really enjoy it. And if you don't want to blend it, just take
- **[14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=874s)** — the juice from it and add that stevia. And it's a great alternative to the sweetened
- **[14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=880s)** — lemonade that so many people consume. All right, I'm going to blast one up in the blender this
- **[14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=885s)** — afternoon and try it out. Now, would you also add water to that once you blast all of this?
- **[14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=889s)** — Yes, yes. Yeah, add add a couple or two of water for sure. All right. I'll report back
- **[14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=895s)** — with my findings. Carrie from YouTube. What's the best form of potassium supplements,
- **[15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=900s)** — potassium chloride or potassium citrate? I like the citrate because the citrate
- **[15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=907s)** — is something that is involved in our mitochondrial
- **[15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=911s)** — Krebs cycle pathway. And it kind of gives the raw material for everything else to work.
- **[15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=917s)** — And citrates also bind with oxalates, which actually prevent kidney stones. So you have a
- **[15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=923s)** — couple other nice things about that citrate that can help you. But I will say this,
- **[15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=929s)** — when you buy a potassium citrate, a lot of people just get it in electrolyte powder.
- **[15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=934s)** — Be wary of the manufacturing of that product, because a lot of companies get the cheaper
- **[15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=941s)** — version and it's loaded with Maltodextrin. Now, how would you know if that powder, that
- **[15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=949s)** — potassium powder that you have that's loaded with this starch, all you have to do is put
- **[15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=955s)** — some water in it, put in a little glass and then put a couple drops of iodine in it.
- **[16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=961s)** — And if there's starch in there, it'll turn dark purple. If there's not, it'll just stay
- **[16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=969s)** — yellow or almost transparent. So I did a video on that and you'd be shocked to find out how many
- **[16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=976s)** — companies have this hidden Maltodextrin. Maltodextrin, think about this, on the glycemic
- **[16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=982s)** — index, sugar is like 70, what, 73 or 74. Glucose is 100. Maltodextrin is like 110 to 130.
- **[16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=993s)** — So it's way, way, way worse than actual sugar, but it's not even classified as a sugar.
- **[16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=999s)** — They made it as a starch for probably marketing purposes, so you wouldn't see this hidden sugar.
- **[16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=1007s)** — Interesting. Okay, well now, drum roll, it's time to go to our wonderful green room
- **[16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=1012s)** — with the all-female cast today. We're going to start off with Stacey in Alberta, Canada. And
- **[16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=1018s)** — Stacey, I'm going to unmute you if you'll do the same thing. And she's going to ask you one
- **[17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=1023s)** — question in 30 seconds and get a great answer. Go ahead. Okay, go ahead, hit it.
- **[17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=1029s)** — Hi, I've been watching you. April 23rd of this year, I started keto, intermittent fasting,
- **[17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=1036s)** — quit drinking, blah, blah, blah. I've lost 60 pounds. In that strict, I went through all my
- **[17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=1045s)** — cupboards. Anyways, that's not my question, but I'm on it. So a year and a half ago,
- **[17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=1050s)** — I had a hip replacement on my left hip. And I was supposed to get another hip replacement on my
- **[17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=1059s)** — right hip. But three days after I started doing the keto intermittent fasting, I haven't
- **[17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=1065s)** — taken one pill or nothing for it. Yeah, like I'm everybody knows about you in my world. I'm
- **[17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=1074s)** — just wondering, is there any way I can prevent from having another hip replacement?
- **[18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=1080s)** — Well, you're not hurting, right? I mean, no, not at all. Now. Here's the thing, I would ride the
- **[18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=1086s)** — wave because that's a major surgery. And you know how the recovery is for that. So I mean,
- **[18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=1092s)** — the fact that you went on keto, you dropped your inflammation, things can start healing in
- **[18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=1097s)** — that area. Let's say worst case scenario, you can also even possibly do some stem cell,
- **[18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=1103s)** — there's some miraculous stuff done with that if you need it. But I think I would ride the
- **[18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=1109s)** — wave. I've had patients come in to see me when I was in practice, bone on bone. And yet,
- **[18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=1115s)** — they're doing fine. So yeah, you know, if you don't have pain, I think I would,
- **[18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=1121s)** — I think a lot of people who were in your boat would be shocked to find out if they
- **[18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=1126s)** — just change their diet, how much inflammation will go away. Oh, exactly. Exactly. It is,
- **[18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=1132s)** — it is phenomenal. And my brain function, I think way better than I've ever thought.
- **[18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=1138s)** — That's so great. Yeah. And the you can of course support, there's a lot of joint formulas out
- **[19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=1145s)** — there with the chondrodontin sulfate and glucosamine, you can take those as well. But
- **[19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=1153s)** — it's all... Oh, I'm so glad you said about the sauerkraut. I eat that every day. I love
- **[19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=1159s)** — sauerkraut. And I grow microgreens. And I sell them because of you. Awesome. Yeah. And
- **[19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=1166s)** — on top of that, you're from Alberta, which is even more awesome because I've been through
- **[19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=1170s)** — there. It's beautiful. Yeah. I went up to see Lake Banff. I think it's called... Oh, Banff.
- **[19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=1175s)** — Yeah. Lake Louise. Yeah. Actually Waterton is nicer. Oh, nice. Yes. Okay. And not too
- **[19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=1184s)** — Okay. Now listen, I just want to show off her microgreens. So I shifted the camera. There
- **[19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=1189s)** — they are baking away in the background. And that's not all of them. Wow. Great job.
- **[19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=1196s)** — You betcha. People love them. I'm spreading the word. You're my hero. Yeah. Thank you.
- **[20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=1204s)** — I appreciate you. Thank you. All right. Thanks so much, Stacey. You did very well with the
- **[20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=1209s)** — questioning protocol. And we're very proud of you for that. So let's see. Let's move on to...
- **[20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=1215s)** — What time is it? It's time for quiz question number two. And this drum roll is what I said
- **[20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=1221s)** — the longest in history by word count question, but it's a fun one. And here you go.
- **[20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=1228s)** — Okay. So definition of medical misinformation, A, false misleading or inaccurate medical
- **[20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=1236s)** — information, or B, anything that conflicts with the World Health Organization Foundation,
- **[20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=1242s)** — or now it's World Health Organization, not foundation, or general medical consensus.
- **[20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=1250s)** — What's the answer? What's the true answer of that? All right, audience. I know you're on it.
- **[20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=1255s)** — And let's go back to social media. Let's see. Katrina from Facebook. Which foods and protocols
- **[21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=1265s)** — would you suggest for someone with Dupitrins, he phonetically did that for Dupitrins,
- **[21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=1273s)** — contracture, a condition in which one or more fingers becomes permanently bent in a flexed
- **[21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=1279s)** — position. Ouch. So there's a couple different theories of it. They don't really know exactly
- **[21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=1286s)** — why it is. But I will say that I would take, because we have a contracture, I would take
- **[21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=1295s)** — magnesium first. Okay. Well, you can take different versions. Glycosinate is a good
- **[21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=1302s)** — type of magnesium. And I wouldn't also avoid calcium. I would probably take the calcium.
- **[21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=1309s)** — Usually you can get magnesium with calcium in there. And that way you have the minerals to
- **[21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=1313s)** — allow the contraction and relaxation of muscles. Now, the other point about this
- **[21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=1318s)** — is that if your pH is too on the alkaline side, that can create these minerals from
- **[22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=1327s)** — working correctly. So you may find that if you acidify the body with either ongoing
- **[22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=1332s)** — apple cider vinegar and or butane hydrochloride, you can take it when you eat with your
- **[22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=1338s)** — digestive system. You may find that that allows us minerals to work a lot better as well. So
- **[22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=1343s)** — it's either a pH problem, I'm guessing, or a mineral problem between magnesium and calcium.
- **[22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=1351s)** — Very good. So Sean from Facebook writes, bless you, dude. Canada loves you. I've lost 80
- **[22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=1358s)** — pounds thanks to your intermittent fasting videos. Exclamation mark. And there you go,
- **[22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=1363s)** — Sean. You get a couple of those. That's terrific. What a great story. And there's
- **[22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=1367s)** — thousands of those. I didn't lose 80 pounds, but I'm down about 45 and never felt better. So
- **[22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=1372s)** — that's terrific. Now the audience's promise has
- **[22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=1378s)** — bared through the entire huge question number two, which asks definition of medical
- **[23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=1383s)** — misinformation. A. False misleading or inaccurate medical information or B.
- **[23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=1390s)** — Anything that conflicts with the World Health Organization or general medical consensus. And
- **[23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=1397s)** — 50% there's a split of our respondents say it's A and 50% say it's B.
- **[23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=1403s)** — Well, according to YouTube, it's B. So in other words, anything that doesn't align with World
- **[23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=1409s)** — Health Organization or medical consensus is misinformation and that would be false information.
- **[23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=1414s)** — So unfortunately, they're starting to censor anyone who doesn't comply with that. So this
- **[23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=1420s)** — is why you may have a hard time finding my videos. So you want to just type Dr. Berg and
- **[23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=1425s)** — the topic, because they kind of deranked a lot of us, especially even in the ketogenic
- **[23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=1431s)** — world, unfortunately. So I'm going to release a video on that soon. But to me, I think
- **[23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=1438s)** — misinformation is incorrect, invalid, false information. I mean, that just would be
- **[24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=1445s)** — doesn't mean regardless of how many times is general medical consensus have been wrong.
- **[24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=1452s)** — Right. I mean, just recently, they changed their they flipped their idea. And if you
- **[24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=1458s)** — take omega three before surgery, because it could thin the blood. So it's constantly changing
- **[24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=1463s)** — all that time. So unfortunately, if you have the opposing viewpoint, you're not going to be
- **[24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=1470s)** — heard on YouTube. So a lot of people are, are switching to other platforms.
- **[24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=1477s)** — Yeah, the idea that the sort of infallible, infallible, you know, medical community
- **[24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=1482s)** — sticks with it. Dr. Berg and I both have a great friend, MD in Bethesda, and he graduated from Yale
- **[24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=1488s)** — as a doctor. And he said on his graduation day, the Dean said, Congratulations, you've gotten the
- **[24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=1494s)** — finest medical education of any place in the world. However, half of what we've taught you
- **[25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=1500s)** — is incorrect. And he said, Your job over the next 30 years or so is to figure out which half.
- **[25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=1505s)** — So isn't that isn't that, you know, makes you feel comfortable with all that. And it's very
- **[25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=1513s)** — true, things change. So, but the medical community will admit themselves that they,
- **[25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=1518s)** — they don't know everything and things change constantly. So I'm sorry to hear that other
- **[25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=1523s)** — people are speaking on behalf of the medical community. Alright, let's see, let's go back to
- **[25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=1530s)** — social media. Raquel from YouTube, could you share any remedies for constant throat clearings?
- **[25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=1541s)** — Now, I think it's, I would take the best remedy for that. And this can also cause
- **[25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=1547s)** — laryngeal spasm, which will cause coughing as well and a clearing of the throat is to take
- **[25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=1552s)** — calcium. Take calcium, I would get the calcium lactate is a good one. But you can take other
- **[25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=1558s)** — calcium as well. But that just usually means you need more calcium and that will usually
- **[26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=1562s)** — handle that clearing. Now, you could also have acid reflux coming up, that could be a situation,
- **[26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=1570s)** — in which case you would use the tain hydrochloride as a remedy. So sometimes you
- **[26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=1574s)** — want to differentiate or you might have like some immune infection that is, that's, that
- **[26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=1581s)** — you're having this post nasal drip, in which case you would want to take vitamin D, zinc, and
- **[26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=1589s)** — also vitamin C. So there you have it. Okay, very good. Stand by, I just pushed the wrong
- **[26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=1598s)** — button. Alright, back to social media. Spam Mouse from YouTube, great fellow, which is a
- **[26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=1611s)** — I like bell peppers, because you have less sugar, less fructose. But you know,
- **[26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=1619s)** — if you have a garden, boy, you should just grow those bell peppers. Oh, I just recently had one
- **[27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=1624s)** — of my bell peppers. What a difference between a garden bell pepper and the store bought.
- **[27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=1630s)** — I mean, just night and day, when I buy these bell peppers in the store, I'm just like,
- **[27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=1634s)** — just nothing to them. Same as like eating a tomato at the store. So I encourage you to
- **[27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=1640s)** — either buy them at the farmers market or grow your own. I am going to be starting a channel
- **[27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=1646s)** — on growing very soon. I know I've been saying that for some time, but we finally are working
- **[27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=1652s)** — on our greenhouse in West Virginia. So we're going to actually film a lot of things
- **[27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=1659s)** — related to that. I think it's going to be pretty, pretty exciting, because we're going
- **[27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=1662s)** — to do a lot of research and then share what we found in that area, which will
- **[27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=1668s)** — help a lot of people who are trying to just decide what the best how to create the best soil and
- **[27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=1674s)** — all the other factors that contribute to healthy food. That is excited. We're all waiting for
- **[27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=1679s)** — that, Dr. Berg. So great news to hear that it's underway. Okay, let's put up the third
- **[28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=1686s)** — quiz question for the day. Then we're going to go over to our green room. And here's the
- **[28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=1690s)** — true falser for today. All right, true or false? The average amount of added sugar,
- **[28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=1695s)** — a person in the US consumes daily is 26 teaspoons. Sounds like a lot. Is that true
- **[28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=1703s)** — or false, audience? Okay, let's we're going to go over to Victoria, who's from Toronto, another
- **[28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=1710s)** — area that you're familiar with, Doc. And here she is with her one question, 30 seconds.
- **[28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=1716s)** — Hi, Dr. Berg, how are you? Great, thanks. Good, good. I love all of the videos that you
- **[28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=1727s)** — post. So thank you. Thank you for all the information that you post. So I wanted to ask
- **[28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=1733s)** — a really quick two questions, if I may, I promise I'll get it within 30 seconds. So
- **[28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=1738s)** — I have been suffering from endometriosis now for about 20 years. It's a horrible problem in
- **[29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=1744s)** — my life. I have two questions about endometriosis and a healthy keto diet with IF. First,
- **[29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=1749s)** — on which days of my 25 day cycle should I follow the healthy keto diet, for example,
- **[29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=1754s)** — any specific foods that I should avoid during my cycle? And then second is regarding your
- **[29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=1759s)** — videos regarding endometriosis and pain relief. Is there a recommended amount of stinging metal
- **[29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=1765s)** — root tincture, maybe, if possible, that I should take? And I want to make sure that I
- **[29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=1770s)** — don't take too much. Thank you. Yeah, so the cool thing about stinging metal root
- **[29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=1774s)** — is it helps to regulate estrogen as well. There's an enzyme called
- **[29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=1780s)** — aromatase, which it inhibits. So that can actually help a lot. And I would take,
- **[29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=1786s)** — I would take some, right, and then I would keep increasing it until
- **[29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=1791s)** — you feel better. And it might be five times the normal amount that you would normally take
- **[29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=1796s)** — during when you need it. As far as the foods to avoid with you, unfortunately, dairy is a
- **[30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=1809s)** — estrogen more than any other thing. A key trace mineral that you should be focusing on right now
- **[30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=1815s)** — is iodine. And c-kelp is a good source. But iodine is one of those wonderful things that can
- **[30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=1820s)** — actually help balance this estrogen problem and reduce the formation even of endometriosis.
- **[30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=1830s)** — There is some additional data that I recently stumbled on that you could probably do further
- **[30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=1839s)** — research on something called natokinase. It's an enzyme to help dissolve fibrous tissue.
- **[30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=1847s)** — And that's what endometriosis is. So you might want to see if there's any connection between
- **[30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=1855s)** — natokinase and endometriosis. You might find something there.
- **[31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=1860s)** — Thank you. Thank you. The c-kelp, because I ordered all of your supplements, by the way.
- **[31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=1864s)** — So your c-kelp, does it have iodine? Because I don't remember.
- **[31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=1868s)** — Yeah, yeah, it has iodine in the right amount. So yeah, you're good on that for sure.
- **[31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=1872s)** — Perfect. Thank you.
- **[31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=1874s)** — You're welcome.
- **[31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=1875s)** — Great question. Thank you so much, Victoria. And can't wait to hear,
- **[31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=1880s)** — you know, fair weather times for you in the future with your continued pursuit of getting
- **[31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=1886s)** — some relief from that irritating and troubling disease, if that's what it's called. Okay,
- **[31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=1893s)** — let's go and ask a question from Lou from YouTube. I've been suffering from migraines.
- **[31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=1899s)** — I suspect it's from high histamine levels because of my eczema and insomnia. What's the
- **[31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=1909s)** — part of his problem? Corsetin is one remedy. And a lot more vitamin C
- **[31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=1917s)** — can help reduce histamine levels too. And there's also, you might want to do a search on
- **[32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=1923s)** — high histamine foods and start avoiding those as well. And there's quite a list on that.
- **[32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=1929s)** — But the biggest thing is the corsetin is a good remedy for that and in higher amounts.
- **[32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=1936s)** — So try that. Onions actually are loaded with corsetin. So start eating a lot of onions as well.
- **[32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=1944s)** — Very good. Good luck with that. Okay, quiz question number three was a true-false, sir.
- **[32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=1949s)** — And it asks true-false. The average amount of added sugar a person in the U.S. consumes
- **[32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=1954s)** — daily is 26 teaspoons. That's a pile, I believe. And 72% of our respondents say it's true,
- **[32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=1962s)** — 28% say that's just impossible. No way. It's true. It's true. Now that doesn't even
- **[32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=1969s)** — count for the amount of sugar that's in the other carbohydrates, like all the breads,
- **[32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=1975s)** — pasta, cereal, crackers, that type of thing. So you have to realize that an average American,
- **[32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=1979s)** — I mean, who's average? There's quite a few people that are eating way more than that.
- **[33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=1984s)** — And there's a lot of people eating a lot less than that, including myself. So
- **[33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=1992s)** — unfortunately, that's going to create something called hyperglycemia. Now,
- **[33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=1999s)** — this is interesting. If you look at a trusted source of medical to learn about hyperglycemia
- **[33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=2006s)** — from, of course, Wikipedia, we know they're the most trusted source. If you look down to
- **[33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=2011s)** — the cause of that, it doesn't even mention dietary sugar at all. I wonder how that got
- **[33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=2017s)** — omitted. I mean, that just blew my mind. So, you know, it could come from glandular endocrine
- **[33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=2023s)** — problems or diabetes or, or infection or excess eating, but no one didn't mention this excess
- **[33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=2031s)** — sugar in the diet. It's kind of like the elephant in the room. And
- **[33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=2038s)** — apparently that's an omission. Yeah. Okay. And here's evidence of someone that probably
- **[34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=2043s)** — doesn't do that anymore. Jack from Facebook, I've lost 50 pounds on healthy keto and intermittent
- **[34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=2048s)** — fasting. Thank you, Dr. Berg with several exclamation marks. So good for you, Jack.
- **[34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=2054s)** — That's a tremendous achievement. And I know you feel terrific. So, and there's lots of
- **[34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=2059s)** — those again, audience, we could spend most part of the show, recanting people's pleasure
- **[34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=2066s)** — from feeling better and being healthier. But we want to stick with your questions as the
- **[34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=2071s)** — paramount thing so we can get you feeling healthier and better. Let's see.
- **[34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=2079s)** — How about Rebecca from Facebook, what would you take to alleviate shaky hands?
- **[34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=2086s)** — And what do you recommend to address varicose veins?
- **[34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=2093s)** — Well, I mean, there are people that have a dopamine deficiency and Parkinson's,
- **[35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=2100s)** — Parkinson's that shake their hands a lot. And I don't, that's more rare. So I wouldn't
- **[35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=2106s)** — go in that direction. I will say that there's some interesting data about a vitamin B1
- **[35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=2112s)** — deficiency and that affecting part of the brain that controls this involuntary movement.
- **[35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=2120s)** — So I might, I would recommend taking a natural source of B1, but take larger amounts. That
- **[35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=2129s)** — would go right to that whole lemon that's loaded with the bioflavonoids that can help
- **[35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=2135s)** — support this, the vein collagen outer part of that vein and artery. And that would help
- **[35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=2143s)** — your circulation as well. Also realize that if you have estrogen dominance,
- **[35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=2150s)** — that can also cause increase in varicose veins and spider veins. So you might want to deal
- **[35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=2157s)** — with that as well with iodine or the cruciferous vegetables, which help balance out that excess
- **[36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=2163s)** — estrogen. Okay, I think this is an interesting question. Boika from Facebook,
- **[36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=2168s)** — is it okay to consume colostrum during intermittent fasting?
- **[36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=2174s)** — Good question. I think it's okay. It's not not too much of a dose. And there is some
- **[36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=2181s)** — small amount of calories in there. If you can find colostrum from a sheep or a goat
- **[36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=2186s)** — versus a cow, you might it might work a little bit better. But I'm not saying the cows
- **[36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=2192s)** — won't work. But I know some people there have sensitivities to casein,
- **[36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=2198s)** — and even lactose, which could be in that colostrum. But colostrum has like,
- **[36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=2203s)** — all these amazing immune factors. And if we just talk about colostrum, we talk to talk
- **[36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=2209s)** — breast milk, which is the most amazing liquid gold nutrition that a human or baby could consume.
- **[36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=2219s)** — And unfortunately, the baby infant formulas, the companies are really discouraging,
- **[37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=2227s)** — in indirect ways, women breastfeeding. And I think if you take a look at some of these
- **[37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=2233s)** — formulas, they're like at the epitome of ultra processed junk food. I mean, look at the
- **[37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=2239s)** — ingredients in this stuff. I would not want to give that to an infant. If you can't breastfeed,
- **[37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=2246s)** — there's something called a Loleche League, you could get some donations from breast milk. But
- **[37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=2250s)** — the colostrum is really important for the immune system. And even if you have like,
- **[37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=2255s)** — if you had to take a lot of steroids, or, and you damage your immune system, colostrum
- **[37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=2260s)** — is one way to kind of help recover it. So I talked about that in a video. So
- **[37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=2264s)** — can you describe for the audience what colostrum is? Is it different from breast milk in itself?
- **[37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=2270s)** — It's the thing that's produced in the first time, first few times that you
- **[37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=2278s)** — give milk when you're breastfeeding, there's a colostrum that's released. And that has a
- **[38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=2285s)** — tremendous amount of immune building properties. And it's called the part of the innate immune
- **[38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=2293s)** — system. Not something, not the other system that you acquire from being infected, but
- **[38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=2299s)** — something that the mother gives you. And the other thing in breast milk, and I don't know
- **[38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=2304s)** — about colostrum, is you have a lot of probiotics as well from the mother to the infant.
- **[38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=2310s)** — So you get a lot of great things from colostrum, but mainly immune factors that are in the first
- **[38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=2317s)** — part of that cycle of breastfeeding. Okay, very good. Let's see. Kelly from YouTube,
- **[38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=2325s)** — I need your help to quit smoking. That's a rotten thing. Please share your suggestions.
- **[38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=2332s)** — I think smoking tends to help people reduce stress. They drink, they smoke to
- **[38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=2339s)** — relax, reduce stress. So if you were to take some type of natural combination of things,
- **[39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=2347s)** — like let's say ashwagandha, natural vitamin B1, and lemon balm tea, and you just
- **[39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=2353s)** — started adding that as a replacement, that might help you. And if it's really bad,
- **[39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=2358s)** — maybe you need to add like a whole desiccated adrenal supplement with that. But there's going
- **[39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=2363s)** — to be a couple weeks of withdrawals and difficulty coming off cigarettes or nicotine.
- **[39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=2371s)** — But that's what I would recommend, because it's definitely all the chemicals and the actual smoke
- **[39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=2380s)** — and the carbon monoxide, the arsenic, all that stuff ends up right through your lung
- **[39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=2386s)** — into your bloodstream, into the arteries. And it messes with your arteries and it creates
- **[39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=2392s)** — problems that you don't want. So
- **[39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=2397s)** — it also kind of increases your risk for cancer and other issues too. So it's best that you take
- **[40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=2403s)** — this and substitute that stress relief with other things that can reduce stress. Keep
- **[40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=2412s)** — yourself really busy as well. Yeah, Kelly, I tell you, and all those people in the audience,
- **[40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=2416s)** — and there's millions still that are smoking, that was one of the most difficult but rewarding
- **[40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=2420s)** — things that I ever did. I quit about 35 years ago. And when I asked a few people nervously while
- **[40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=2426s)** — I was 15 minutes into quitting smoking, you know, how do you do it? And many people would
- **[40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=2431s)** — say, well, you know, you have the physical part for three days, and then the emotional part
- **[40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=2436s)** — for five days, and then you're fine. And I thought, that doesn't sound right. And I finally
- **[40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=2440s)** — talked to one guy and he said, Look, just forget about the calendar. He goes, it's going
- **[40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=2444s)** — to suck for a while, but it's well worth it. So just don't look day by day, just just
- **[40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=2450s)** — stating it's okay to want a cigarette and it's okay not to smoke one and just keep with that.
- **[40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=2455s)** — And I'm so glad I did. But that is an insane addiction. I mean, it's hard to describe people
- **[41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=2462s)** — that haven't been, but it is just bugs you every second. And so I'm so grateful. I'm
- **[41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=2468s)** — free of that. And Kelly, you can be too. So why don't you check back in with us?
- **[41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=2472s)** — And one last thing, I bought a bicycle for the first time in my life, right when I quit
- **[41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=2477s)** — smoking, because I said, I don't think I can smoke a cigarette while I'm riding.
- **[41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=2480s)** — And then every time I thought, Well, why don't you start smoking? Okay, good. I'll just bend
- **[41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=2484s)** — up the bicycle. I won't be needing that anymore. And that that little routine kept me off long
- **[41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=2489s)** — enough. And I still enjoy riding bikes. So good for you, Kelly, keep it up.
- **[41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=2495s)** — All right, let's see. Lynn from Facebook, what would you recommend for someone diagnosed
- **[41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=2501s)** — with S. Jogren syndrome, a long term autoimmune disease that affects the body's moisture
- **[41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=2509s)** — producing glands? That's interesting. You heard of that? Oh, okay. Vitamin D in high
- **[41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=2517s)** — quantities, anything with autoimmune, you want to take vitamin D, and I'm talking like maybe
- **[42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=2522s)** — 40 to 50,000 I use per day. That would be a good thing to take. There is some other types
- **[42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=2530s)** — of remedies to help lubricate the eyes in the meantime, and you can get those online,
- **[42:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=2537s)** — they're natural remedies. But yeah, this, the tear glands and start drying up and you have
- **[42:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=2544s)** — all sorts of issues with even your connective tissue and your skin. So high levels of vitamin
- **[42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=2550s)** — D tend to act as like a natural steroid without the side effect. You know, we think about
- **[42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=2558s)** — vitamin D as a vitamin, but really, it's a hormone. And it has very similar functions
- **[42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=2564s)** — to cortisol. But it does, it's like an anti inflammatory, and it helps your immune system.
- **[42:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=2571s)** — But cortisol suppresses the immune system. Vitamin D regulates or moderates
- **[42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=2579s)** — the immune system. So it won't, it'll turn off like a cytokine storm, but it will,
- **[43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=2584s)** — it will not shut it down like cortisol will. Interesting. Okay, I'm going to use the same
- **[43:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=2589s)** — routine we did a few minutes ago. And that is to ask a question. And then we're going to go
- **[43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=2593s)** — to our final green room participant, Joyce. So Joyce, stand by for a minute. And here's
- **[43:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=2599s)** — quiz question number four. All right, most of your vitamin E is stored in which body organ?
- **[43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=2610s)** — All right, well, Joyce, boom, we replace the question and bring you up. One question,
- **[43:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=2615s)** — please, in 30 seconds. Good morning, Dr. Berg, thank you for all the information that you share
- **[43:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=2621s)** — with everybody. I love your program. The question I have today is about my husband.
- **[43:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=2628s)** — About a year ago, he was diagnosed with slow AFib. So only when he's relaxed as he go into
- **[43:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=2635s)** — a atrial AFib. He also he takes meds for high blood pressure. He has psoriatic arthritis,
- **[44:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=2645s)** — which he no longer takes biologics for because keto and IF has helped that tremendously.
- **[44:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=2652s)** — And my question is, what can we do? Well, actually, he had a cardioversion too. I forgot
- **[44:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=2658s)** — in March he had a cardioversion which lasted three days. What else can we do to help this
- **[44:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=2667s)** — situation? The doctors are saying, you know, blood thinners for the rest of your life. We
- **[44:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=2672s)** — live a very active lifestyle and you know, he exercises and it's just a little unsettling.
- **[44:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=2681s)** — So yeah, just so you know, like, I'm just going to give you areas of research because,
- **[44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=2684s)** — of course, I can't. I'm not going to cure anything. But here's some things to look at.
- **[44:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=2689s)** — Number one, you said he was he he is or he was an athlete at one time, right?
- **[44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=2694s)** — Yeah. Did he did he do biking? No, not so much. He played lacrosse, running, surfing.
- **[45:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=2704s)** — Yeah, we used to be big runners, but not so much anymore. Because because one of the things
- **[45:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=2709s)** — that can happen if someone was an athlete is their heart becomes stronger and bigger.
- **[45:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=2715s)** — And when the heart becomes bigger, it does alter the pacemakers. You have four of them.
- **[45:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=2721s)** — And that that can that can create a rhythmia just from the heart being bigger. So that's
- **[45:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=2728s)** — just one as a side note, because I did a lot of biking. And I started having arrhythmias.
- **[45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=2734s)** — What's going on? So there's a couple of things. And of course, the elephant in the room is
- **[45:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=2742s)** — electrolytes. Definitely the magnesium and potassium. And larger amounts over a longer
- **[45:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=2747s)** — period of time will be necessary to really build up the body. I think a really good test
- **[45:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=2753s)** — if you could find do a search on the internet. It's called interest. It's called
- **[45:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=2759s)** — interest cellular magnesium test. So you want to check not in your blood, but inside the cells.
- **[46:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=2767s)** — And you send you a kit and you take a little scrape of the inside of your
- **[46:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=2772s)** — your mouth. You send it in and it'll tell you where your interest cellular potassium is.
- **[46:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=2776s)** — I'm sorry, magnesium. I think they might check potassium too. But that would be a
- **[46:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=2781s)** — really good test to see what's going on with that mineral. Because I know the
- **[46:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=2787s)** — electrolytes are involved in arrhythmias problems. You also have electromagnetic fields from cell
- **[46:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=2797s)** — phones. And like I found, if you get a tester, I don't think I have mine here, but a trifield
- **[46:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=2806s)** — EMF tester, go around your house. And I found not only my computer, but right in the head of
- **[46:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=2815s)** — wall where I sleep was radiating magnetic fields eight feet off the wall. So every time I went to
- **[47:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=2822s)** — sleep, I was bathing in this electromagnetic field. I had an electrician open the wall,
- **[47:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=2829s)** — looking in there, they found all these cross wires and all these problems electrically that
- **[47:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=2833s)** — they fixed all that. And my arrhythmias went away. That was my the cause of mine.
- **[47:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=2839s)** — Okay, so you have that. And then the other things with arrhythmias, if you take a look at
- **[47:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=2847s)** — if the body is too astra to alkaline, you can have arrhythmias on both spectrum. So it's just
- **[47:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=2853s)** — something else to look at in relationship to arrhythmias. Worst case scenario, if he has
- **[47:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=2859s)** — to take a blood thinner, I would I would try to find one that is doesn't restrict his ability
- **[47:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=2866s)** — to consume dark leafy green, vitamin K rich vegetables. I know they have them out there.
- **[47:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=2874s)** — Because the Coumatin doesn't allow you to do that. So that restricts certain things. So
- **[48:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=2882s)** — I'm not sure if the one that he's on he I don't know if I can say the name of it. But
- **[48:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=2886s)** — so relto if that restricts I don't remember the doctor saying that you he couldn't have
- **[48:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=2892s)** — leafy greens. I'm not sure. But okay, something to look at. But those are the things that I
- **[48:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=2899s)** — would recommend. And hopefully one of those will help him. Thank you so much. You're
- **[48:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=2907s)** — welcome. That's great, Joyce. You know, keep us posted on your husband's progress, we hope. So
- **[48:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=2915s)** — get back to the bicycle or whatever. I guess he didn't do that. Get back to his active life.
- **[48:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=2920s)** — Would be terrific. Okay, so let's see. We did get answers in the interim while Joyce was
- **[48:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=2927s)** — giving us her husband's condition. And the question asked most of your vitamin E is stored
- **[48:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=2932s)** — in which body organ and 55% of the respondents say it's the skin 35% say it's the liver and
- **[49:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=2942s)** — stuck in the brain. Okay, the answer is adipose tissue. It's your fat. Your fat is an organ that
- **[49:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=2953s)** — produces hormones, but your fat stores the majority of your vitamin E, but not just vitamin
- **[49:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=2960s)** — A, vitamin A, vitamin D, and vitamin K. And so when you lose weight, when you do a fast,
- **[49:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=2970s)** — for example, you have to realize you're releasing some of these fat soluble vitamins
- **[49:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=2975s)** — into circulation. And this allows you to not be deficient. So think about an overweight person
- **[49:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=2983s)** — that can't tap into fat. They can't tap into some of these fat soluble vitamins as well.
- **[49:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=2990s)** — But what's interesting about this is that when you consume water soluble vitamins,
- **[49:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=2995s)** — like the B vitamins and vitamin C, the question is, how long are these water soluble
- **[50:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=3003s)** — vitamins stored in the body? And for that question, I should probably ask that next weekend,
- **[50:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=3009s)** — or next week, because it's a really good question with a very interesting answer.
- **[50:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=3013s)** — Interesting. Well, we can't wait for that. And speaking of questions, here's the final one
- **[50:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=3017s)** — for this show. Okay, what is the advantage of consuming fermented foods over just fiber
- **[50:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=3024s)** — rich foods? Climb on it audience. Okay, Anila from Facebook, the root cause of most diseases
- **[50:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=3031s)** — inflammation. What steps should we follow every day to change that condition?
- **[50:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=3037s)** — I think inflammation is not the root cause. It's the tip of the iceberg. There's something
- **[50:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=3043s)** — deeper. What's causing the inflammation, you got to pull the string deeper. And that's usually
- **[50:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=3048s)** — related to this thing called diet. So there's something that a person's eating that's
- **[50:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=3054s)** — creating inflammation. The most likely reason is the sugar and refined carbs, refined sugars and
- **[51:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=3062s)** — refined carbs. Then we get the omega-6 fatty acid type oils, the seed oils. So we're

- **[00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyBOSZVKpNM&t=0s)** — Now, if you want to sleep like a baby, you definitely want to watch this video. Of course,
- **[00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyBOSZVKpNM&t=4s)** — babies are up all night crying and I'm being very sarcastic. This video is kind of a remake of a
- **[00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyBOSZVKpNM&t=9s)** — video I did a year ago on consuming kefir in the evening to improve your sleep. Kefir is way,
- **[00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyBOSZVKpNM&t=17s)** — way better than yogurt and I'm going to talk about why. When you consume kefir, you're
- **[00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyBOSZVKpNM&t=20s)** — giving these microbes a place to live and in exchange, it gives you a lot of other benefits.
- **[00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyBOSZVKpNM&t=26s)** — The big one is going to be sleep. So how can kefir help you sleep? Well, first of all, what is
- **[00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyBOSZVKpNM&t=32s)** — kefir? Kefir is a fermented drink. So you have like five times the microbes in kefir than in
- **[00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyBOSZVKpNM&t=39s)** — yogurt. Plus, kefir has a combination of both bacteria and yeast, okay? It even has friendly
- **[00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyBOSZVKpNM&t=47s)** — candida. It's not until that candida turns into more of a pathogenic version that it becomes
- **[00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyBOSZVKpNM&t=54s)** — a problem. So it's a combination of these microbes that help you make serotonin. Now,
- **[01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyBOSZVKpNM&t=60s)** — serotonin is a neurotransmitter and 90% of all your serotonin is made in your own gut. But
- **[01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyBOSZVKpNM&t=69s)** — here's the thing, it doesn't cross the blood-brain barrier into the body. Instead, it can act as a
- **[01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyBOSZVKpNM&t=74s)** — precursor to help you make melatonin, which is the sleep neurotransmitter. So these
- **[01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyBOSZVKpNM&t=82s)** — microbes from kefir actually go into the body and they inoculate or seed your microbes to help you
- **[01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyBOSZVKpNM&t=89s)** — grow more microbes and actually the right balance. And the microbes from kefir actually
- **[01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyBOSZVKpNM&t=94s)** — can survive the stomach acid, whereas yogurt, it doesn't survive. Now, there's definitely
- **[01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyBOSZVKpNM&t=99s)** — benefits to yogurt because it can act like a food for certain things in your gut. But kefir
- **[01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyBOSZVKpNM&t=105s)** — actually is a probiotic, okay, that can help your gut by providing the precursor to melatonin.
- **[01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyBOSZVKpNM&t=111s)** — But also it can help lower cortisol, which is the main stress hormone. And if you have that
- **[01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyBOSZVKpNM&t=118s)** — cortisol pumping through your blood, you're not going to sleep. The beneficial bacteria and yeast
- **[02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyBOSZVKpNM&t=123s)** — in kefir can help break down the protein in milk, like casein and other proteins, into
- **[02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyBOSZVKpNM&t=132s)** — a digestible protein. So even though a person has an allergy to milk, it's much less
- **[02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyBOSZVKpNM&t=138s)** — kefir because of this microbial decomposition of the protein. Also kefir tends to eat up
- **[02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyBOSZVKpNM&t=146s)** — a good portion of the lactose, the milk sugar, which many people have a problem with. They have
- **[02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyBOSZVKpNM&t=152s)** — lactose intolerance. Now, a certain strain of microbe called lactobacillus can produce a compound
- **[02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyBOSZVKpNM&t=159s)** — that is an ACE inhibitor. It's something to help relax your blood vessels to increase
- **[02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyBOSZVKpNM&t=165s)** — oxygen and blood flow through the body, which helps you sleep better. This kefir also makes B1,
- **[02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyBOSZVKpNM&t=173s)** — which is essential for reducing stress, anxiety, and building up your parasympathetic
- **[03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyBOSZVKpNM&t=182s)** — nervous system. B1 is kind of like a precursor for something called acetylcholine,
- **[03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyBOSZVKpNM&t=187s)** — which is the neurotransmitter for the parasympathetic nervous system, which is all
- **[03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyBOSZVKpNM&t=191s)** — about rest and digest. Kefir will help you absorb minerals like calcium, which is basically
- **[03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyBOSZVKpNM&t=200s)** — in this fermented milk product, as well as magnesium. So having a little calcium and even
- **[03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyBOSZVKpNM&t=205s)** — magnesium in the evening is really good for sleep. But in addition to sleep, these microbes
- **[03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyBOSZVKpNM&t=211s)** — in kefir help with a lot of other things too. It can help reduce allergies, asthma,
- **[03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyBOSZVKpNM&t=217s)** — help balance your cholesterol, help with any digestive bloating or constipation,
- **[03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyBOSZVKpNM&t=223s)** — and help your immune system. Now there's some updates from my previous video. Number one,
- **[03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyBOSZVKpNM&t=229s)** — for those people who are on keto that are doing intermittent fasting, it might be best
- **[03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyBOSZVKpNM&t=236s)** — to consume the kefir at your last meal instead of right before bed. Even though a lot
- **[04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyBOSZVKpNM&t=241s)** — of people do it right before bed and it actually helps them. But if you're doing the
- **[04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyBOSZVKpNM&t=245s)** — fasting program, just take this at the end of your last meal. If you have the option to have
- **[04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyBOSZVKpNM&t=252s)** — either sheep or goat milk kefir, go for those. Now if you have the option to be in a certain
- **[04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyBOSZVKpNM&t=259s)** — state like California, which sells raw milk kefir, go for that. Recently I was in California
- **[04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyBOSZVKpNM&t=267s)** — and I found some raw milk kefir. It was amazing. It was without the sweeteners. It was
- **[04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyBOSZVKpNM&t=272s)** — no fruit. I think they had a little turmeric in there and cinnamon. And this was cow's milk,
- **[04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyBOSZVKpNM&t=278s)** — but it was raw. It was amazing. And if you can't find raw milk kefir, you might want to consider
- **[04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyBOSZVKpNM&t=284s)** — making your own from raw milk. I do it occasionally and what you would do is you
- **[04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyBOSZVKpNM&t=290s)** — have a couple options. You're going to buy the starter. It's kind of like a kefir grain
- **[04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyBOSZVKpNM&t=294s)** — and you're going to add that in a certain amount to the milk, either cow's milk,
- **[04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyBOSZVKpNM&t=298s)** — sheep milk or goat milk. And then you have an option of keeping the lid either open or closed.
- **[05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyBOSZVKpNM&t=303s)** — Now if you keep it open, you'll put some like cloth over it or some type of netting or you
- **[05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyBOSZVKpNM&t=309s)** — just make it closed. Now each of those methods create a slightly different effect on this kefir.
- **[05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyBOSZVKpNM&t=315s)** — When you keep the lid open, okay, you provide more air. You support the aerobic microbial
- **[05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyBOSZVKpNM&t=322s)** — growth versus the lid closed, which you're supporting the anaerobic microbial growth.
- **[05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyBOSZVKpNM&t=329s)** — And anytime you provide more air to fermentation, you get more of a yeast growth, a hint of
- **[05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyBOSZVKpNM&t=336s)** — sourdough bread, but less sour. Whereas the anaerobic, where the lid is closed,
- **[05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyBOSZVKpNM&t=342s)** — it's going to be more sour because of the lactic acid. So when you go out and get kefir,
- **[05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyBOSZVKpNM&t=346s)** — don't get the low fat, get the whole milk, get the plain version. And you might just find
- **[05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyBOSZVKpNM&t=352s)** — sleeping so much better. Now because of the censoring and the suppressing of the algorithms
- **[05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyBOSZVKpNM&t=357s)** — on YouTube, it's becoming more difficult to find my content. And there's a lot of content
- **[06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyBOSZVKpNM&t=362s)** — that I cannot put on YouTube, unfortunately. So to make sure you have full access of all my

## Video 35: Drink This EVERY Day to Lose More Belly Fat

**Watch on YouTube:** [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bg_xenOrKPg](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bg_xenOrKPg)

## Full Transcript with Timestamps

- **[00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bg_xenOrKPg&t=0s)** — In this video, I'm going to show you the number one best tip for intermittent fasting to help lose your
- **[00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bg_xenOrKPg&t=6s)** — belly fat. Let me first explain the relationship between insulin and fat storage using different
- **[00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bg_xenOrKPg&t=12s)** — size batteries. This big battery represents your fat. This small tiny battery represents
- **[00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bg_xenOrKPg&t=19s)** — how much sugar you have in your liver that's stored. And an average skinny person is holding
- **[00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bg_xenOrKPg&t=25s)** — about 100,000 calories of fat with only 1700 calories of sugar storage. So an average thin
- **[00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bg_xenOrKPg&t=35s)** — person has 58 times more stored fat than sugar. So how do we transition from the sugar to the fat?
- **[00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bg_xenOrKPg&t=44s)** — Well, we have to lower insulin. So the intermittent fasting tips I'm going to show you
- **[00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bg_xenOrKPg&t=48s)** — have one goal to drop insulin so you make this transition from sugar burning to fat burning.
- **[00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bg_xenOrKPg&t=53s)** — All right, let's start with the seventh tip. Okay, two tablespoons of apple cider vinegar
- **[00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bg_xenOrKPg&t=59s)** — in a glass of water. Why? Because apple cider vinegar lowers your blood sugars and it lowers
- **[01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bg_xenOrKPg&t=68s)** — insulin. And insulin is the fat making hormone and the barrier to losing weight.
- **[01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bg_xenOrKPg&t=72s)** — And this is so simple, everyone can do it. Just do one, two, or even three of these
- **[01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bg_xenOrKPg&t=77s)** — in a given day. All right, number six, you want to combine the low carb ketogenic diet with
- **[01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bg_xenOrKPg&t=84s)** — intermittent fasting. This is a one, two punch. Just by doing intermittent fasting, you're going
- **[01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bg_xenOrKPg&t=88s)** — to lower insulin. But if you add the low carb with it, you are going to be very, very
- **[01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bg_xenOrKPg&t=93s)** — successful. Plus going low carb is going to allow you to transition into fat burning a lot
- **[01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bg_xenOrKPg&t=98s)** — quicker versus just doing intermittent fasting by itself. And the way that you know you're in
- **[01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bg_xenOrKPg&t=102s)** — fat burning is you have no more appetite. Okay, so then it'll be easy to continue.
- **[01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bg_xenOrKPg&t=108s)** — All right, tip number five. When we start out, we want to start out with a high fat diet.
- **[01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bg_xenOrKPg&t=113s)** — But then as you transition and your appetite is a lot less, you know, several weeks into this,
- **[01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bg_xenOrKPg&t=119s)** — then we'll start reducing the fat. This way we can tap into more of the ketones
- **[02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bg_xenOrKPg&t=123s)** — from our own body fat versus the fat that comes from our diet. All right, tip number
- **[02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bg_xenOrKPg&t=130s)** — four. We want to enhance your sleep, but to do that, we have to lower your stress.
- **[02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bg_xenOrKPg&t=136s)** — And what's even better than exercise for stress and sleep is physical work around the
- **[02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bg_xenOrKPg&t=142s)** — house or physical work around your yard outside. Anything you do like that is a lot more
- **[02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bg_xenOrKPg&t=148s)** — productive. So you get something done. You're not just running on a treadmill and physical
- **[02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bg_xenOrKPg&t=153s)** — work does something else for your mind. It gets your attention off the stresses of life.
- **[02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bg_xenOrKPg&t=158s)** — Tip number three is exercising in a fasting state versus exercising right after a meal.
- **[02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bg_xenOrKPg&t=165s)** — There are actually 26 different studies that show that when you exercise in a fasting state,
- **[02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bg_xenOrKPg&t=170s)** — you'll burn more fat. So this is just compounding your results by adding another
- **[02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bg_xenOrKPg&t=175s)** — strategy that can speed things up for you. And as far as the type of exercise, I recommend
- **[03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bg_xenOrKPg&t=180s)** — doing a combination of higher intensity, but not more than twice a week because we don't want
- **[03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bg_xenOrKPg&t=185s)** — to overtrain. On the off days, you want to do long walks. All right, tip number two, you need to
- **[03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bg_xenOrKPg&t=191s)** — add more sea salt. And when you lose water weight, you're going to lose electrolytes,
- **[03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bg_xenOrKPg&t=194s)** — especially salt. And if you're low on salt and you're doing fasting, you're going to
- **[03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bg_xenOrKPg&t=199s)** — feel weaker. You're going to feel tired. A lot of people do not realize how much salt
- **[03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bg_xenOrKPg&t=203s)** — they actually need, especially when they're doing fasting. If you're low on salt, you're
- **[03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bg_xenOrKPg&t=207s)** — not going to sleep that good, especially in the first part of the sleep. So be more mindful
- **[03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bg_xenOrKPg&t=212s)** — of adding a little more salt to your food. All right, for the number one tip, this is the most
- **[03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bg_xenOrKPg&t=217s)** — important tip. Make note of this. You want to let your body determine the intermittent fasting
- **[03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bg_xenOrKPg&t=224s)** — pattern by hunger. So here's the rule. Don't eat unless you're hungry. This way will allow
- **[03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bg_xenOrKPg&t=232s)** — your body to transition to this at the right pace. Some people can fast longer than others.
- **[03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bg_xenOrKPg&t=237s)** — Once your body gets in this amazing adaptive state and you're burning fat, you should be
- **[04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bg_xenOrKPg&t=242s)** — feeling great mentally and physically. If you don't, it means that you're not ready yet and
- **[04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bg_xenOrKPg&t=248s)** — you have to keep doing it and just take your time. All right, so now that you have all these
- **[04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bg_xenOrKPg&t=253s)** — tips, the next thing to learn is what to eat when you eat. And for that, I put this video
- **[04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bg_xenOrKPg&t=259s)** — right here. Check it out.

## Video 36: Eating Eggs Increases the Risk of Dying from Heart Disease

- **[00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8H7ZGIDmuIw&t=0s)** — Sorry to tell you this, guys, but I have some bad news. According to the Physicians Committee
- **[00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8H7ZGIDmuIw&t=6s)** — for Responsible Medicine on the website, they revealed that eating eggs can be hazardous to
- **[00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8H7ZGIDmuIw&t=11s)** — your health. Okay, and they actually list several scientific studies that prove that eating eggs
- **[00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8H7ZGIDmuIw&t=17s)** — can be very hazardous. And I just want to tell you some of the conclusions on these studies.
- **[00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8H7ZGIDmuIw&t=21s)** — This is not good, guys. Eating eggs increases the risk of dying from heart attacks. Oh my
- **[00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8H7ZGIDmuIw&t=28s)** — gosh, I've been eating all these eggs this whole time and I'm in trouble. A 2021 study found that
- **[00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8H7ZGIDmuIw&t=34s)** — the addition of a half an egg a day was associated with more deaths from heart disease, cancer,
- **[00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8H7ZGIDmuIw&t=41s)** — and all causes. This is not good. This is scary. Another study they mentioned eating eggs also
- **[00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8H7ZGIDmuIw&t=49s)** — can be connected to developing certain types of cancer, colon, rectal, and prostate. Oh my gosh,
- **[00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8H7ZGIDmuIw&t=57s)** — I'm gonna have to change all my videos, change my diet. This is not egg-citing, guys. I mean,
- **[01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8H7ZGIDmuIw&t=64s)** — I thought I was the egg-spert. Apparently not. Well, I tell you what, we're gonna egg-splore
- **[01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8H7ZGIDmuIw&t=69s)** — this topic a little bit deeper. And I think you're gonna be shell-shocked. I'm sorry,
- **[01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8H7ZGIDmuIw&t=74s)** — I just had to do that. Before you evaluate a topic, okay, and you try to figure out what's
- **[01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8H7ZGIDmuIw&t=81s)** — truth or not truth, you have to first make sure that the data is good data, not bad data.
- **[01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8H7ZGIDmuIw&t=90s)** — You want to make sure that you include all of the data so there's no missing information.
- **[01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8H7ZGIDmuIw&t=95s)** — You want to make sure you don't exaggerate the data. I have all the studies right here.
- **[01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8H7ZGIDmuIw&t=100s)** — I printed them out. There's like 10 different studies about eggs. Seven of these studies are
- **[01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8H7ZGIDmuIw&t=105s)** — Two are meta-analyses of observational studies. One is a review article and one is a systemic
- **[01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8H7ZGIDmuIw&t=113s)** — review. These observational studies are based on food frequency questionnaires. None of them
- **[01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8H7ZGIDmuIw&t=119s)** — is an experimental study, randomized controlled trial, which is a study in which a treatment,
- **[02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8H7ZGIDmuIw&t=127s)** — procedure, or program is intentionally introduced and a result or outcome is observed.
- **[02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8H7ZGIDmuIw&t=132s)** — The problem is with our recall, who's going to remember what they ate in the last 12 months?
- **[02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8H7ZGIDmuIw&t=139s)** — I don't even remember what I ate last weekend. When I was in practice, I would ask people,
- **[02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8H7ZGIDmuIw&t=145s)** — you know, what did you eat the previous week, right? They couldn't remember. And then come to
- **[02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8H7ZGIDmuIw&t=150s)** — find out they kind of exaggerated talking about all the good things but not the bad things. So
- **[02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8H7ZGIDmuIw&t=154s)** — it's very, very difficult, if not impossible, to extract the exact thing this person ate
- **[02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8H7ZGIDmuIw&t=159s)** — and the amounts. It's not credible. Questionnaire studies do not prove causation. And as far as
- **[02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8H7ZGIDmuIw&t=166s)** — association, yes, there's an association, but there are so many variables. Why do you pick
- **[02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8H7ZGIDmuIw&t=173s)** — eggs out of the million variables? What about their smoking? What about their drinking? What
- **[02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8H7ZGIDmuIw&t=178s)** — about their medication side effects? What about their genetics? What about their inactivity? What
- **[03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8H7ZGIDmuIw&t=183s)** — about the donut that they just ate? Why didn't you pick that? It's literally impossible to
- **[03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8H7ZGIDmuIw&t=188s)** — this link between two things. Now, at first, I couldn't find if they were actually credible
- **[03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8H7ZGIDmuIw&t=194s)** — studies that showed some randomized trials, things like that. But then I dug a little deeper
- **[03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8H7ZGIDmuIw&t=198s)** — and I found that 100% of those meta-analysis were complete questionnaire, self-reported
- **[03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8H7ZGIDmuIw&t=205s)** — studies. So right there, I can't even evaluate whether the study shows any real
- **[03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8H7ZGIDmuIw&t=211s)** — substantiation or not because it's based on questionnaire studies. So pretty much puts that
- **[03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8H7ZGIDmuIw&t=215s)** — into a certain category, not to mention the conflict of interest. The Canadian Journal of
- **[03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8H7ZGIDmuIw&t=224s)** — Cardiology, this showed that those who ate the most eggs got a higher risk of cardiovascular
- **[03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8H7ZGIDmuIw&t=231s)** — disease. Dr. Spence and the Dr. DaVignon received fees from several pharmaceutical companies
- **[03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8H7ZGIDmuIw&t=236s)** — that sell anti-cholesterol medication. And Dr. Daviston also had support from Pfizer,
- **[04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8H7ZGIDmuIw&t=242s)** — AstraZeneca, and Merck. Alright, another study by JAMA. Dr. Wilkins reported receiving consultation
- **[04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8H7ZGIDmuIw&t=250s)** — fees from NGM Biopharmaceuticals. Dr. Mence reported receiving research support from various
- **[04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8H7ZGIDmuIw&t=256s)** — big pharma companies and is on their advisory board as well. So unfortunately, the Physicians
- **[04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8H7ZGIDmuIw&t=260s)** — Committee for Responsible Medicine is putting out doubts about the health of eating anything
- **[04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8H7ZGIDmuIw&t=267s)** — animal products. They're a plant-based physician group, but their membership really is only 5%
- **[04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8H7ZGIDmuIw&t=273s)** — physicians. And honestly, I think it's really, really bad for someone to put out information
- **[04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8H7ZGIDmuIw&t=278s)** — that's just a lie to scare people into not eating eggs. I know the news does it all the
- **[04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8H7ZGIDmuIw&t=286s)** — time. They'll put these little doubts in people's minds. And it's very difficult for
- **[04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8H7ZGIDmuIw&t=291s)** — most people, the general public, to evaluate that data themselves. So they depend on someone
- **[04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8H7ZGIDmuIw&t=296s)** — else who is responsible to do it for them. And I think this is just really a smear campaign on
- **[05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8H7ZGIDmuIw&t=301s)** — eggs. An egg has gotten a bad rap for many years, but the egg is a very interesting protein
- **[05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8H7ZGIDmuIw&t=306s)** — that I want to share right now, some additional information just to give you some factual
- **[05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8H7ZGIDmuIw&t=312s)** — information about what's in an egg. First of all, an egg yolk. An egg yolk is not a
- **[05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8H7ZGIDmuIw&t=320s)** — being chicken, okay? It's the nutrition for that chicken. The egg yolk is probably one of the most
- **[05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8H7ZGIDmuIw&t=328s)** — nutrient-dense, multi-vitamin mineral, phytonutrient substances that you can consume
- **[05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8H7ZGIDmuIw&t=334s)** — bathed in some additional protein around that egg yolk. The egg is almost complete with about
- **[05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8H7ZGIDmuIw&t=342s)** — every single nutrient except vitamin C, but it's loaded with vitamin B1, B2, B3, B5, B6,
- **[05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8H7ZGIDmuIw&t=348s)** — B9, and B12. It's one of the best sources of vitamin A, and I'm talking about the active
- **[05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8H7ZGIDmuIw&t=355s)** — form of vitamin A called retinol. You cannot get retinol from carrots, okay? In carrots you
- **[06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8H7ZGIDmuIw&t=360s)** — have the precursor, beta-carotene, that is supposed to convert into the active form of
- **[06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8H7ZGIDmuIw&t=364s)** — vitamin A. You have to get it from animal sources or egg sources, but vitamin A, which is
- **[06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8H7ZGIDmuIw&t=372s)** — so crucial for your eyes, for your immune system, for your skin, especially the inside
- **[06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8H7ZGIDmuIw&t=378s)** — of your skin, the sinuses, the throat, the lungs, even the colon, anything internal skin
- **[06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8H7ZGIDmuIw&t=384s)** — is supported by vitamin A. And of course, liver has the highest amount of vitamin A,
- **[06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8H7ZGIDmuIw&t=390s)** — but egg yolk is right up there as well. It has vitamin E that, by the way, supports
- **[06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8H7ZGIDmuIw&t=395s)** — the inside of your heart. Eating eggs is going to help your cardiovascular system.
- **[06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8H7ZGIDmuIw&t=400s)** — It's going to support the inside layer of the arteries because it has vitamin E,
- **[06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8H7ZGIDmuIw&t=406s)** — as well as vitamin K2, which is very important in removing the excess calcium
- **[06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8H7ZGIDmuIw&t=412s)** — in the arteries. It keeps the calcium out of the soft tissues of the body. It has vitamin D.
- **[06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8H7ZGIDmuIw&t=417s)** — Very few foods have vitamin D, but egg yolks have it. And of course, I'm talking about
- **[07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8H7ZGIDmuIw&t=423s)** — an egg that comes from a pasture-raised healthy chicken. Okay, I'm not talking about
- **[07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8H7ZGIDmuIw&t=428s)** — this chicken that's in this cage their whole life. But the egg is the best source of protein,
- **[07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8H7ZGIDmuIw&t=433s)** — the most quality source of protein behind breast milk. It's a super bioavailable source of
- **[07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8H7ZGIDmuIw&t=441s)** — amino acids. It also is the food that has the second highest amount of choline
- **[07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8H7ZGIDmuIw&t=445s)** — behind liver. And choline is important in reducing fat off your liver. It's important
- **[07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8H7ZGIDmuIw&t=453s)** — supporting the brain because it makes this neurotransmitter called acetylcholine to help
- **[07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8H7ZGIDmuIw&t=458s)** — your memory. It also has minerals, potassium, magnesium, selenium. It also has omega-3 fatty
- **[07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8H7ZGIDmuIw&t=464s)** — acids as well, which is good for the heart. Another thing that it can do is it can increase
- **[07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8H7ZGIDmuIw&t=471s)** — the particle size of your LDL. What does that mean? There's two types of LDL. You have the
- **[07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8H7ZGIDmuIw&t=475s)** — small dense particle size, which is the one that kind of invades the arteries. It creates
- **[08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8H7ZGIDmuIw&t=480s)** — more problems, creates more inflammation. But then you have something else that's bigger
- **[08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8H7ZGIDmuIw&t=484s)** — called the large buoyant particle size. And that's the one that is not pathogenic. Also,
- **[08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8H7ZGIDmuIw&t=490s)** — eggs can help reduce your insulin resistance. Think about the carb level on eggs. There's
- **[08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8H7ZGIDmuIw&t=495s)** — not a lot of carbs in eggs. So it's a perfect keto combination of protein and fat
- **[08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8H7ZGIDmuIw&t=501s)** — and nutrition. It also can increase HDL. It has lutein and zeaxanthin. What are those?
- **[08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8H7ZGIDmuIw&t=507s)** — Those are carotenoids. You see those in vegetables, but the bioavailability in
- **[08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8H7ZGIDmuIw&t=513s)** — vegetables doesn't even compare to the bioavailability from an egg. So these two
- **[08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8H7ZGIDmuIw&t=518s)** — carotenoids protect not just the eye, because it's good for the eye, against things like
- **[08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8H7ZGIDmuIw&t=526s)** — macular degeneration and cataracts, but also protects the endothelial tissue inside your
- **[08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8H7ZGIDmuIw&t=534s)** — So no, eggs don't cause heart problems. They help heart problems. So consuming eggs is an
- **[09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8H7ZGIDmuIw&t=541s)** — excellent idea. And the next time you hear some bad news about eggs, take a look at the study.
- **[09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8H7ZGIDmuIw&t=547s)** — Make sure it's not an observational study. Make sure that the source of the study,
- **[09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8H7ZGIDmuIw&t=551s)** — it doesn't have conflicts of interest. But the egg can be a super heart healthy food
- **[09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8H7ZGIDmuIw&t=556s)** — to consume. Now, if you haven't seen my new resource page on my website, DrBurg.com,

- **[00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqEO1Xc2P64&t=0s)** — There's a lot of confusion on electrolyte powder. So I just want to clear this up.
- **[00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqEO1Xc2P64&t=5s)** — It's actually a very interesting topic just to understand what an electrolyte really is.
- **[00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqEO1Xc2P64&t=10s)** — So what is it? Well, an electrolyte is an electrically charged element or mineral.
- **[00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqEO1Xc2P64&t=16s)** — What does that mean? It's basically a mineral that is free, allowing it to be an ion.
- **[00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqEO1Xc2P64&t=22s)** — And what is that? Well, normally, if you've ever taken chemistry, you'll see that it has
- **[00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqEO1Xc2P64&t=26s)** — either a negative or positive charge around this mineral. Without getting too tactical,
- **[00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqEO1Xc2P64&t=32s)** — all you need to know is these minerals, when they're free, are ions, which means they can
- **[00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqEO1Xc2P64&t=38s)** — conduct electricity in water. So they have certain charges. And then the body can use these
- **[00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqEO1Xc2P64&t=44s)** — different charged minerals to allow movement. You can kind of think of it like a battery.
- **[00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqEO1Xc2P64&t=50s)** — In a battery, you have minerals which are flowing electrons from one point to another,
- **[00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqEO1Xc2P64&t=55s)** — creating this current. So electrolytes contribute to this electrical phenomena that occurs in the
- **[01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqEO1Xc2P64&t=62s)** — body. So I just want to give you a quick demo to really make sure you get this concept before
- **[01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqEO1Xc2P64&t=66s)** — we move on. So check this out. We have a light source. We have a power source. It's plugged
- **[01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqEO1Xc2P64&t=72s)** — into the wall over here. You can see the cords. And we have an incomplete circuit, electrical
- **[01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqEO1Xc2P64&t=78s)** — circuit. We cut the wire and we put the wire into distilled water. Distilled water is water
- **[01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqEO1Xc2P64&t=86s)** — without minerals and without electrolytes. Electrolytes are electrically charged minerals.
- **[01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqEO1Xc2P64&t=92s)** — Okay, so we have no conductivity here. You can see there's no light. So we're going to take
- **[01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqEO1Xc2P64&t=97s)** — some electrolytes here, take a scoop of electrolytes, and we'll pour it in to this
- **[01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqEO1Xc2P64&t=106s)** — distilled water. And let's see what happens. And now we're going to mix it with the water to
- **[01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqEO1Xc2P64&t=114s)** — make sure it's dissolving. And look what's happening. We have a complete circuit now.
- **[02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqEO1Xc2P64&t=122s)** — So one of the main purposes of electrolytes in the body is to power the nervous system,
- **[02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqEO1Xc2P64&t=127s)** — which is the electrical system in the body, which powers the muscles and all the different
- **[02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqEO1Xc2P64&t=132s)** — organs. So now that you know that electrolytes provide the raw material to make things more
- **[02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqEO1Xc2P64&t=136s)** — electrical in the body, how does that really relate to the function of the body? Well,
- **[02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqEO1Xc2P64&t=142s)** — number one, it's responsible for nerve conductivity. Okay, the transmission of nerve
- **[02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqEO1Xc2P64&t=148s)** — impulses. And so if you have a problem with electrolyte, you have a problem with these
- **[02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqEO1Xc2P64&t=152s)** — impulses and it can affect the pacemaker of the heart. You can have palpitations.
- **[02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqEO1Xc2P64&t=156s)** — You can have various nerve issues. You can have stress in the nervous system.
- **[02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqEO1Xc2P64&t=162s)** — You can just feel stressed, like your nerves are stressed out. And where do those nerves go?
- **[02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqEO1Xc2P64&t=166s)** — They go to muscles, right? So you can have all sorts of muscle problems from muscle cramps
- **[02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqEO1Xc2P64&t=171s)** — during the day or at night, or even weak muscles. The movement of fluid through the body is
- **[02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqEO1Xc2P64&t=177s)** — dependent on these electrolytes as well. So whether you are dehydrated or hydrated depends
- **[03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqEO1Xc2P64&t=183s)** — on these electrically charged minerals in sufficient amounts and in the right balance.
- **[03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqEO1Xc2P64&t=188s)** — For example, if you have too much sodium and not enough potassium, you will get fluid retention.
- **[03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqEO1Xc2P64&t=194s)** — Also, pH is dependent on these electrolytes as well. So each part of your body is a
- **[03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqEO1Xc2P64&t=199s)** — different pH. And so if one part becomes too far to one extreme versus another,
- **[03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqEO1Xc2P64&t=205s)** — you can have all sorts of issues. And the different pH's of the body
- **[03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqEO1Xc2P64&t=210s)** — activate different enzymes. For example, if your stomach pH is not acidic enough,
- **[03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqEO1Xc2P64&t=217s)** — certain enzymes will not be activated and you can't digest food. And then we have this very
- **[03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqEO1Xc2P64&t=224s)** — important and phenomena of electrolytes called the production of energy. So your energy level
- **[03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqEO1Xc2P64&t=230s)** — is highly influenced by these electrolytes as well. There's something called the sodium
- **[03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqEO1Xc2P64&t=236s)** — potassium pump. And this little pump is in all of your cells and it's dependent on
- **[04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqEO1Xc2P64&t=242s)** — sufficient amounts of sodium and potassium. And this pump allows the cell to become
- **[04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqEO1Xc2P64&t=248s)** — like a battery so it can store charge and 30% of all your energy is dependent on that pump.
- **[04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqEO1Xc2P64&t=255s)** — And it's really easy to get sodium in the diet, but it's more difficult to get potassium
- **[04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqEO1Xc2P64&t=260s)** — simply because our potassium requirements are so high. We need like 4700 milligrams of
- **[04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqEO1Xc2P64&t=265s)** — potassium every single day. And the question is, where are you going to get that? You can
- **[04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqEO1Xc2P64&t=272s)** — don't because you would have to consume minimally seven to even 10 cups of salad
- **[04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqEO1Xc2P64&t=279s)** — with other foods to get this 4700 milligram requirement. So many people enhance their diet
- **[04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqEO1Xc2P64&t=287s)** — with electrolyte powders. So if you're deficient electrolytes, you can feel weak,
- **[04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqEO1Xc2P64&t=291s)** — fatigue, brain fog, dehydrated, palpitations, dizzy. Why would you be dizzy? Well,
- **[04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqEO1Xc2P64&t=299s)** — because of the hydration effect in your blood. So you have enough blood or volume of blood to
- **[05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqEO1Xc2P64&t=305s)** — maintain the blood flow up to your brain. It's kind of like if you were to give blood and take
- **[05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqEO1Xc2P64&t=310s)** — too much blood out and you wouldn't have the volume, you would feel very dizzy and faint.
- **[05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqEO1Xc2P64&t=315s)** — So it's the volume of blood and the pressure, both by the way controlled by electrolytes,
- **[05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqEO1Xc2P64&t=320s)** — that can greatly affect many different things related to feeling dizzy when you stand up
- **[05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqEO1Xc2P64&t=325s)** — or even high blood pressure. There is a big correlation between low potassium and high blood
- **[05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqEO1Xc2P64&t=331s)** — pressure. I mean, you probably heard your doctor, if you have high blood pressure,
- **[05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqEO1Xc2P64&t=333s)** — is going to tell you to avoid salt. But unfortunately, patients are not told to
- **[05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqEO1Xc2P64&t=337s)** — increase their potassium levels, which actually is more important. And if you're
- **[05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqEO1Xc2P64&t=342s)** — deficient in potassium, you can have cramps in your calves, especially when you're sleeping
- **[05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqEO1Xc2P64&t=346s)** — at night. All right, next topic I want to get into is how do you create a deficiency of
- **[05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqEO1Xc2P64&t=351s)** — Well, many different ways. By consuming refined carbohydrates or sugars, you'll retain sodium,
- **[05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqEO1Xc2P64&t=358s)** — but you'll deplete potassium, magnesium, calcium, and other things as well. Being
- **[06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqEO1Xc2P64&t=363s)** — under diuretic can cause you to become deficient in sodium as well as potassium as well.
- **[06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqEO1Xc2P64&t=368s)** — Being stressed out with high levels of cortisol can deplete these electrolytes.
- **[06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqEO1Xc2P64&t=373s)** — Having food with hidden MSG, monosodium glutamate, can deplete you of potassium.
- **[06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqEO1Xc2P64&t=380s)** — You'll wake up the next day with a lot of fluid retention and not sure where that came from.
- **[06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqEO1Xc2P64&t=385s)** — In that situation, the thing to do is to take more potassium as electrolyte to push out this
- **[06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqEO1Xc2P64&t=389s)** — excess sodium. Drinking too much water can deplete you of these electrolytes because they
- **[06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqEO1Xc2P64&t=395s)** — dilute the electrolytes, especially sodium, and you can create a condition called hyponatremia.
- **[06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqEO1Xc2P64&t=401s)** — That's low sodium. And that could be very, very serious. Your brain can swell, you can go
- **[06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqEO1Xc2P64&t=406s)** — into a coma. So drinking too much water is not always the best thing to do if you want to be
- **[06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqEO1Xc2P64&t=411s)** — hydrated. To be hydrated, you need both fluid and electrolytes. Now, vomiting, diarrhea can also
- **[06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqEO1Xc2P64&t=418s)** — create a deficiency of these electrolytes. Being a diabetic, you're going to be deficient
- **[07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqEO1Xc2P64&t=422s)** — in these electrolytes, especially potassium. And if you're sweating, as in exercise,
- **[07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqEO1Xc2P64&t=429s)** — you can very easily end up with a electrolyte deficiency. So speaking about sweating and
- **[07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqEO1Xc2P64&t=435s)** — there's two general types of electrolytes out there. You have electrolytes that are more for
- **[07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqEO1Xc2P64&t=440s)** — sport type things involving minerals that replace sweat, and those usually are higher in
- **[07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqEO1Xc2P64&t=447s)** — sodium. And then you have other types of electrolytes, like this one right here, which
- **[07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqEO1Xc2P64&t=452s)** — is my brand, which of course I'm not biased on the quality of ingredients in this product,
- **[07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqEO1Xc2P64&t=457s)** — but this one, being a regular electrolyte, has very high levels of potassium, like a thousand
- **[07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqEO1Xc2P64&t=463s)** — milligrams of potassium, 75 milligrams of calcium, and 60 milligrams of chlorides,
- **[07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqEO1Xc2P64&t=469s)** — and only 40 milligrams of sodium per serving size. That's then compared to the sport version,
- **[07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqEO1Xc2P64&t=476s)** — which is 500 milligrams of sodium. So when you're exercising, you lose a lot of sweat,
- **[08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqEO1Xc2P64&t=481s)** — you lose a lot of sodium, so you need more sodium. But when you're not exercising,
- **[08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqEO1Xc2P64&t=485s)** — you don't need that much sodium. And so if you were to take a sport electrolyte with a
- **[08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqEO1Xc2P64&t=491s)** — and not exercise, you're going to end up with fluid retention. But on the flip side,
- **[08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqEO1Xc2P64&t=497s)** — if you take a regular electrolyte with low sodium while you're exercising with all this
- **[08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqEO1Xc2P64&t=503s)** — potassium, that too can create another imbalance. So the regular electrolytes should be taken
- **[08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqEO1Xc2P64&t=510s)** — when you're not exercising. Now, will it be a problem if you take this while you exercise?
- **[08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqEO1Xc2P64&t=514s)** — No, you just have to make sure that you take extra sea salt during the day to replace what's
- **[08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqEO1Xc2P64&t=522s)** — missing when you sweat. Now, I just want to show you the relationship between these three sport
- **[08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqEO1Xc2P64&t=527s)** — electrolyte beverages or powders. Okay, so of course we... I'll put mine up there. Now,
- **[08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqEO1Xc2P64&t=532s)** — if we take a look at Gatorade, it has 75 milligrams of potassium, and Powerade has 35
- **[08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqEO1Xc2P64&t=539s)** — milligrams of potassium. And Dr. Berg's sport electrolyte has 1000 milligrams of potassium.
- **[09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqEO1Xc2P64&t=545s)** — So you can see there's a huge difference in potassium. Now, what about sodium? Gatorade
- **[09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqEO1Xc2P64&t=550s)** — has 270 milligrams of sodium. Powerade has 150 milligrams. And Dr. Berg's sport electrolyte
- **[09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqEO1Xc2P64&t=556s)** — has 500 milligrams. And Gatorade and Powerade also threw in some phosphates or phosphorus.
- **[09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqEO1Xc2P64&t=564s)** — And I don't know the amounts because it doesn't tell you on the label. But basically,
- **[09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqEO1Xc2P64&t=568s)** — they're giving you three electrolytes, okay, with that product. And my sport electrolytes
- **[09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqEO1Xc2P64&t=573s)** — is giving you five electrolytes in much higher amounts with all of the trace minerals. And
- **[09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqEO1Xc2P64&t=579s)** — the biggest benefit is there's no sugar. It's with organic stevia with natural flavoring and
- **[09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqEO1Xc2P64&t=585s)** — no hidden maltodextrin, which I'm going to come back to in a minute. Gatorade, on the
- **[09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqEO1Xc2P64&t=590s)** — other hand, has not just sugar, but dextrose, which is a synthetic type of sugar, totaling
- **[09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqEO1Xc2P64&t=596s)** — 34 grams of sugar per bottle. 34 grams. That's a lot of sugar. And the interesting thing about
- **[10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqEO1Xc2P64&t=603s)** — sugar is it tends to deplete electrolytes, especially potassium. Powerade has fructose,
- **[10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqEO1Xc2P64&t=609s)** — giving you 21 grams of sugar. So Gatorade and Powerade has a few electrolytes and a
- **[10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqEO1Xc2P64&t=615s)** — lot of sugar. Now, of course, they're going to taste good. And they might appear to work.
- **[10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqEO1Xc2P64&t=620s)** — But honestly, it's just colored sugar water. And they probably use artificial colorings and
- **[10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqEO1Xc2P64&t=626s)** — probably artificial sweeteners. I don't know. I want to touch on this potassium just a little
- **[10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqEO1Xc2P64&t=630s)** — bit more. Potassium also helps with insulin sensitivity. If you're trying to lose weight,
- **[10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqEO1Xc2P64&t=638s)** — if you're trying to regulate your blood sugars, you want to make sure you have enough
- **[10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqEO1Xc2P64&t=642s)** — potassium because potassium can help those conditions. Potassium also regulates pulse
- **[10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqEO1Xc2P64&t=649s)** — rate. If you're low in potassium, your pulse rate tends to go higher. Your blood pressure
- **[10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqEO1Xc2P64&t=653s)** — tends to go higher. And the other interesting thing about potassium is that it's part of
- **[11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqEO1Xc2P64&t=660s)** — the glycogen storage of sugar in your liver and your muscles. The way you store sugar is through
- **[11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqEO1Xc2P64&t=667s)** — all these little sugar glucose molecules strung together. And that's called glycogen.
- **[11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqEO1Xc2P64&t=673s)** — And you need potassium for every molecule of glucose to store it. So there's a lot of
- **[11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqEO1Xc2P64&t=679s)** — locked up within this glucose molecule, as well as a lot of water. In fact, there's three times
- **[11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqEO1Xc2P64&t=685s)** — as much water per gram of glucose. And then you have potassium with that. So when someone
- **[11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqEO1Xc2P64&t=691s)** — is on the ketogenic diet and they get rid of a lot of the stored glucose as glycogen,
- **[11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqEO1Xc2P64&t=696s)** — they also can get rid of the fluid that comes with it. This is why they lose water weight
- **[11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqEO1Xc2P64&t=701s)** — within the first week or so, or two weeks, as well as a loss of potassium. And this is one
- **[11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqEO1Xc2P64&t=707s)** — reason why if you're going to start the ketogenic diet, you want to take electrolytes at the same
- **[11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqEO1Xc2P64&t=713s)** — time to make sure you're not deficient in potassium and magnesium and other electrolytes.
- **[11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqEO1Xc2P64&t=718s)** — Now, one more really interesting thing about electrolyte powder that you probably have never
- **[12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqEO1Xc2P64&t=724s)** — heard before. You want to make sure that when you get electrolyte powder, it doesn't have
- **[12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqEO1Xc2P64&t=730s)** — hidden sugars or starches or carbohydrates, as in maltodextrin. Maltodextrin is considered a
- **[12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqEO1Xc2P64&t=739s)** — starch, even though on the glycemic index it's higher than glucose. It's like way above a
- **[12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqEO1Xc2P64&t=745s)** — hundred. And yet it's not classified as a sugar, even though it behaves worse than a sugar.
- **[12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqEO1Xc2P64&t=750s)** — A lot of times you use the maltodextrin in the flavorings of a lot of these different
- **[12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqEO1Xc2P64&t=754s)** — products, both natural and artificial flavorings. In fact, I had to pay more for my flavorings
- **[12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqEO1Xc2P64&t=761s)** — of my different electrolyte powders to make sure that they did not include this maltodextrin
- **[12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqEO1Xc2P64&t=767s)** — in the products. But there's a very simple, simple way to figure out if your electrolyte
- **[12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqEO1Xc2P64&t=772s)** — powder or other products have this hidden maltodextrin. And it's called a starch
- **[12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqEO1Xc2P64&t=777s)** — test. And all you do is you put some of these electrolytes in a little glass, okay,
- **[13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqEO1Xc2P64&t=783s)** — put a couple drops of iodine, and if it turns purple, okay, it has hidden starch in it.
- **[13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqEO1Xc2P64&t=790s)** — Most likely this maltodextrin. If it doesn't turn dark purple and it stays kind of yellow
- **[13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqEO1Xc2P64&t=796s)** — like iodine should look like, it does not have a starch in it. Okay, one last point.
- **[13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqEO1Xc2P64&t=801s)** — How much sport electrolyte powder should someone take per day? And they come in a
- **[13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqEO1Xc2P64&t=806s)** — stick pack. Okay, so one scoop would be one of those stick packs in some water per day.
- **[13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqEO1Xc2P64&t=813s)** — Now because of the censoring and the suppressing of the algorithms on YouTube,
- **[13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqEO1Xc2P64&t=817s)** — it's becoming more difficult to find my content. And there's a lot of content that I
- **[13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqEO1Xc2P64&t=822s)** — cannot put on YouTube, unfortunately. So to make sure you have full access of all my

- **[13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqEO1Xc2P64&t=836s)** — important mineral potassium, if you haven't seen this video, check it out. I put it up right here.

- **[00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t7VxmoMbD-4&t=0s)** — I have some very valuable information on floaters and how to get rid of floaters.
- **[00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t7VxmoMbD-4&t=5s)** — The most important thing you need to understand about floaters is what are floaters in the first
- **[00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t7VxmoMbD-4&t=11s)** — place. Okay? Like you have these little worm-like things floating in your eyes that really probably
- **[00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t7VxmoMbD-4&t=16s)** — are irritating you. Some of you have them and you got used to them so it doesn't bother you.
- **[00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t7VxmoMbD-4&t=21s)** — What is a floater for real? Is it just some broken collagen protein that just kind of
- **[00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t7VxmoMbD-4&t=27s)** — floating around? And it's basically this. You have this accumulation of this collagen fiber
- **[00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t7VxmoMbD-4&t=33s)** — in a certain form that is damaged from... and I'm going to give you a new word here. It's been
- **[00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t7VxmoMbD-4&t=40s)** — glycated. What does that mean? It means that it's stuck to a sugar molecule. So when you connect
- **[00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t7VxmoMbD-4&t=45s)** — a protein to a sugar or a sugar to a fat, it gets stuck. Now that protein becomes
- **[00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t7VxmoMbD-4&t=53s)** — unavailable and it kind of clogs up the body. Well, that's what these eye floaters are.
- **[00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t7VxmoMbD-4&t=58s)** — The official name is Advanced Glycation N Products. Just picture you're in an ocean
- **[01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t7VxmoMbD-4&t=65s)** — and you see this jellyfish, right? And it's floating along and you can kind of see right
- **[01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t7VxmoMbD-4&t=69s)** — through it because it's translucent. And this jellyfish happens to be eating all these little
- **[01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t7VxmoMbD-4&t=74s)** — sugary treats, right? And all the sugar is kind of like binding with this gel, okay,
- **[01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t7VxmoMbD-4&t=80s)** — this jellyfish, and it's making these little worm-like structures, which are basically the
- **[01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t7VxmoMbD-4&t=87s)** — connection of that collagen to that sugar. So it makes it cloudy. In the eye, you have this
- **[01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t7VxmoMbD-4&t=94s)** — called vitreous gel, which is basically a translucent, you can see through it,
- **[01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t7VxmoMbD-4&t=99s)** — a protein of collagen. And so when you lose your protective mechanism, which are antioxidants,
- **[01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t7VxmoMbD-4&t=105s)** — this glycation starts to occur, especially if you're on a high carb diet. Now, here's a question.
- **[01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t7VxmoMbD-4&t=113s)** — Is there anything that can get rid of this? Okay. And the answer is yes. There are many things
- **[01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t7VxmoMbD-4&t=119s)** — that you can do or take that are considered anti-glycation. In other words, they prevent
- **[02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t7VxmoMbD-4&t=125s)** — this binding of the sugar to the protein. One reference that I found called the PDR. Now,
- **[02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t7VxmoMbD-4&t=131s)** — not in the current versions, it's in the older versions. They have a natural remedy for eye
- **[02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t7VxmoMbD-4&t=137s)** — floaters. And all three of these remedies create an anti-glycation effect. So that would be
- **[02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t7VxmoMbD-4&t=143s)** — choline, inositol, and methionine. So you would take choline in a thousand milligrams per day.
- **[02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t7VxmoMbD-4&t=151s)** — That's one gram. You would take inositol, 500 milligrams each day. And then with methionine,
- **[02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t7VxmoMbD-4&t=157s)** — you would only need 200 milligrams. So that is the ratio that was advised years ago in the
- **[02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t7VxmoMbD-4&t=163s)** — physician's desk reference. Now, I found a lot of other research on this topic that you can
- **[02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t7VxmoMbD-4&t=169s)** — also add to this mixture. One being L-lysine, which is another amino acid that's been very,
- **[02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t7VxmoMbD-4&t=176s)** — very promising in creating significant improvement in eye floaters. And I would add one to three
- **[03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t7VxmoMbD-4&t=184s)** — grams, depending how bad your floaters are. And this mixture, I would recommend to take
- **[03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t7VxmoMbD-4&t=190s)** — an empty stomach, because that way it won't interfere with other proteins. If you then add
- **[03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t7VxmoMbD-4&t=196s)** — intermittent fasting, and maybe even some prolonged fasting to this protocol,
- **[03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t7VxmoMbD-4&t=201s)** — I think it would greatly speed it up. But I will say that this remedy does take a bit of
- **[03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t7VxmoMbD-4&t=205s)** — time. It takes some months for it to work. But with the fasting, I think you'll see some
- **[03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t7VxmoMbD-4&t=209s)** — results within weeks. The other advice I'm going to recommend is to start to cut down
- **[03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t7VxmoMbD-4&t=215s)** — your sugar. I'm talking about going on a low carb diet. And the name for that is the
- **[03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t7VxmoMbD-4&t=220s)** — ketogenic diet. So you'd want to add that as well. Because if you take a look at a diabetic,
- **[03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t7VxmoMbD-4&t=226s)** — usually has higher amounts of sugar, they have much greater incidence of having these
- **[03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t7VxmoMbD-4&t=231s)** — floaters than a non-diabetic. And when you do keto, you want to do the healthy version
- **[03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t7VxmoMbD-4&t=235s)** — of keto because of the antioxidants. We want more antioxidants. So vegetables with high vitamin C
- **[04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t7VxmoMbD-4&t=242s)** — would be very helpful. Also meats and seafood that are loaded with zinc. Zinc can also help
- **[04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t7VxmoMbD-4&t=247s)** — give you an anti-glycation effect. Now because of the censoring and the suppressing of the
- **[04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t7VxmoMbD-4&t=252s)** — algorithms on YouTube, it's becoming more difficult to find my content. And there's a

- **[00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TIPd0tNnHU&t=0s)** — Today let's talk about how to predict a silent stroke. A silent stroke is a stroke that has
- **[00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TIPd0tNnHU&t=7s)** — no symptoms. So how could you actually predict it? Is it possible? Well, we're going to use this book
- **[00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TIPd0tNnHU&t=13s)** — right here. One of my favorite books. It's called The Technology of War. You probably
- **[00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TIPd0tNnHU&t=16s)** — heard of The Art of War by Sun Tzu. But The Technology of War was written by this guy who
- **[00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TIPd0tNnHU&t=24s)** — found that there's so many confusions in The Art of War, he decided to learn Mandarin Chinese and
- **[00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TIPd0tNnHU&t=30s)** — transcribe the entire original text. And he was curious about if the original text was the same
- **[00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TIPd0tNnHU&t=38s)** — as some of these books that are put out there, The Art of War, or slightly different. And in a
- **[00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TIPd0tNnHU&t=42s)** — thumbnail he found out that that original text was severely altered to the point of
- **[00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TIPd0tNnHU&t=48s)** — a lot of false information, a lot of confusing information, and so it's really difficult to
- **[00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TIPd0tNnHU&t=54s)** — make sense out of The Art of War. And even if you look at the original text on the name of
- **[00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TIPd0tNnHU&t=58s)** — the book, it wasn't even called The Art of War because art implies more maybe creativity,
- **[01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TIPd0tNnHU&t=63s)** — but technology is a very specific thing. And so The Technology of War is Sun Tzu's original
- **[01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TIPd0tNnHU&t=69s)** — transcript on how he won so many wars. So we're going to apply that to the body. And
- **[01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TIPd0tNnHU&t=75s)** — the reason I'm going to do this is because of this word prediction. This book is really into
- **[01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TIPd0tNnHU&t=79s)** — predicting things like, number one, if you should go into battle or not. You can predict
- **[01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TIPd0tNnHU&t=85s)** — that based on your advantages and things like that. If you only have a 10% chance of winning
- **[01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TIPd0tNnHU&t=89s)** — a battle, you better not go to war. You better run in the other direction as fast as you can
- **[01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TIPd0tNnHU&t=95s)** — because there's no advantage there. You're going to lose. So he talks a lot about certain
- **[01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TIPd0tNnHU&t=99s)** — things or like clues or indicators to know if you're going to be successful or not. So we
- **[01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TIPd0tNnHU&t=105s)** — can apply this to the body too, and especially with the area of strokes. So even though you don't
- **[01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TIPd0tNnHU&t=110s)** — have this obvious symptom to tell you're going to get a stroke, there are some things that can
- **[01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TIPd0tNnHU&t=116s)** — very easily give you information to know if you are going to have a stroke or not. And
- **[02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TIPd0tNnHU&t=122s)** — another really good reference or paragraph, which I'm going to paraphrase, has to do with
- **[02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TIPd0tNnHU&t=128s)** — being victorious, knowing yourself and knowing your enemy. So if we were to apply this to
- **[02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TIPd0tNnHU&t=134s)** — it's very important to understand the nature of a stroke as well as how our body reacts to it
- **[02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TIPd0tNnHU&t=139s)** — and how potentially we can avoid it. So what do we know about silent strokes? There are strokes
- **[02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TIPd0tNnHU&t=146s)** — that occur without any symptoms at all. You have it, you don't even know you had it. Apparently
- **[02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TIPd0tNnHU&t=152s)** — the damage that it creates in the brain doesn't affect vital areas. So you might not even feel
- **[02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TIPd0tNnHU&t=160s)** — anything other than maybe a little bit of a lapse in memory, maybe some fatigue, maybe some
- **[02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TIPd0tNnHU&t=167s)** — dizziness, maybe even a mood change. And what's interesting about these silent strokes is that
- **[02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TIPd0tNnHU&t=173s)** — in one reference I read they occur five times more than the strokes that create all the classic
- **[03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TIPd0tNnHU&t=181s)** — symptoms, like half of your body being numb or weak, or having cognitive dysfunction,
- **[03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TIPd0tNnHU&t=185s)** — or having slurred speech. But typically if someone has a stroke, whether it's a silent stroke or
- **[03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TIPd0tNnHU&t=191s)** — another stroke, they're very likely to get another one. And strokes are basically the fifth
- **[03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TIPd0tNnHU&t=197s)** — leading cause of death in the U.S. and the second leading cause of death in the entire world.
- **[03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TIPd0tNnHU&t=203s)** — So what else do we know about strokes? Well, there's a lot of different aspects to strokes,
- **[03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TIPd0tNnHU&t=207s)** — but I'm basically going to talk about the most common situation with strokes. You have these two
- **[03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TIPd0tNnHU&t=214s)** — coronary arteries that come up through the neck through here. They supply the brain with blood.
- **[03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TIPd0tNnHU&t=220s)** — There's some other arteries, but these are the primary ones. And then they kind of merge
- **[03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TIPd0tNnHU&t=223s)** — with some other arteries called the medial cerebral arteries. And most of the strokes,
- **[03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TIPd0tNnHU&t=228s)** — like over 50% of the strokes, occur in one of those main arteries. The most common type
- **[03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TIPd0tNnHU&t=234s)** — of strokes that occur in one of these arteries, like 85% of these strokes, is a situation
- **[03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TIPd0tNnHU&t=239s)** — where the blood clot originates in one of those arteries in the brain. So if we were to know the
- **[04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TIPd0tNnHU&t=246s)** — enemy or know the blood clot, if we take a look at a blood clot, what is a blood clot?
- **[04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TIPd0tNnHU&t=252s)** — And is it really an enemy? It's actually just a mechanism of healing some type of bleeding
- **[04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TIPd0tNnHU&t=260s)** — situation, maybe some damage in an artery. So it's not really the enemy. Yet a lot of
- **[04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TIPd0tNnHU&t=265s)** — doctors treat it like the enemy by giving you a drug to thin it, but they don't really
- **[04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TIPd0tNnHU&t=270s)** — look at the true enemy behind the scenes. And that would be what we're going to talk about.
- **[04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TIPd0tNnHU&t=275s)** — So a blood clot is a kind of an aggregation of platelets, which are things that help stop
- **[04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TIPd0tNnHU&t=281s)** — bleeding with a fibrinogen, which is kind of like the glue that binds everything together.
- **[04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TIPd0tNnHU&t=286s)** — And blood clots occur in response to some injury or damage, usually in an artery. And
- **[04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TIPd0tNnHU&t=293s)** — what is the true enemy or the cause, the root cause of a stroke? Well, if you look at that,
- **[04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TIPd0tNnHU&t=299s)** — you're going to find some interesting things. Number one, high levels of sugar in the blood
- **[05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TIPd0tNnHU&t=304s)** — creates a lot of oxidation and creates a lot of damage in the artery. So there's a much
- **[05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TIPd0tNnHU&t=309s)** — higher association between diabetics or pre-diabetics or people with insulin resistance
- **[05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TIPd0tNnHU&t=315s)** — and getting blood clots. And so sugar directly, too much dietary sugar and too many carbs
- **[05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TIPd0tNnHU&t=322s)** — can create this problem. Not to mention it really increases your inflammation as well as something
- **[05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TIPd0tNnHU&t=329s)** — called the sympathetic nervous system. That's right, the stress response. And that leads us
- **[05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TIPd0tNnHU&t=335s)** — to number two. That would be adrenaline or you can call it epinephrine, the same thing.
- **[05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TIPd0tNnHU&t=342s)** — So adrenaline comes from stress and adrenaline can directly increase the risk of getting a
- **[05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TIPd0tNnHU&t=352s)** — from chronic stress. Chronic stress causes a vasoconstriction, but it also creates
- **[05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TIPd0tNnHU&t=359s)** — a lot of inflammation and it creates your body running on glucose. That's right, glucose.
- **[06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TIPd0tNnHU&t=365s)** — I did another video on this and this is interesting because now this overlaps with
- **[06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TIPd0tNnHU&t=369s)** — number one, eating a lot of sugar. But in this case, you're not eating any sugar. The
- **[06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TIPd0tNnHU&t=374s)** — sugar that is there is coming from the stress state. So this combination of eating a high
- **[06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TIPd0tNnHU&t=379s)** — carb diet with stress is just a deadly combination for so many issues. These things I'm talking
- **[06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TIPd0tNnHU&t=385s)** — about are the true enemies that we need to understand and try to reduce as much as
- **[06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TIPd0tNnHU&t=390s)** — possible. And we get to chronic stress as many different types of stress. And I think the
- **[06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TIPd0tNnHU&t=394s)** — biggest stress is emotional stress, especially losses. Loss of a loved one, loss of a job,
- **[06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TIPd0tNnHU&t=399s)** — loss of money, loss of anything can be very, very devastating to your body. And then we also
- **[06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TIPd0tNnHU&t=406s)** — have the side effect for medication like HRT, hormonal replacement therapy. That would be the
- **[06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TIPd0tNnHU&t=411s)** — exposure to a lot of estrogen. Also birth control pills also increase the risk of
- **[06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TIPd0tNnHU&t=415s)** — getting these strokes. And then number four is smoking. Now, how good smoking? You're
- **[07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TIPd0tNnHU&t=421s)** — breathing it in with your lungs that cause a stroke. Well, where does that smoke and chemicals
- **[07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TIPd0tNnHU&t=427s)** — go? It goes to your lungs and right into your bloodstream that's carried up to the brain.
- **[07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TIPd0tNnHU&t=433s)** — And this smoke that ends up in your brain creates a lot of oxidation, free radical damage,
- **[07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TIPd0tNnHU&t=438s)** — and a lot of other issues. And then we have number five. This is another thing. It's
- **[07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TIPd0tNnHU&t=444s)** — hypertension. Now, this might not be the enemy either, just kind of like the tip of the
- **[07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TIPd0tNnHU&t=448s)** — iceberg that there's something else underneath it. But just the fact that you have hypertension
- **[07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TIPd0tNnHU&t=452s)** — can cause a different type of a stroke, which is a hemorrhagic, which you're bleeding
- **[07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TIPd0tNnHU&t=457s)** — because it blew a blood vessel. But if we take a look at hypertension, and what's interesting
- **[07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TIPd0tNnHU&t=462s)** — about hypertension is that 90% of hypertension is classified as essential, or another name for
- **[07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TIPd0tNnHU&t=470s)** — essential is primary. And what does that mean? Well, both of those terms describe
- **[07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TIPd0tNnHU&t=477s)** — hypertension of an unknown cause. Yet so many people are being treated by high blood pressure.
- **[08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TIPd0tNnHU&t=482s)** — I mean, it's pretty wild. I think there's probably a great advantage of keeping that cause
- **[08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TIPd0tNnHU&t=487s)** — unknown because you can actually make a lot of money on medication. But the point is that if you
- **[08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TIPd0tNnHU&t=492s)** — research hypertension and all the different mechanisms, you're pretty much going to end up
- **[08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TIPd0tNnHU&t=497s)** — with the real cause being either one of three things. Okay, most commonly. Number one,
- **[08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TIPd0tNnHU&t=505s)** — insulin resistance. If you take a look at high sugar diets or high carb diets, it thickens
- **[08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TIPd0tNnHU&t=510s)** — the wall of the artery. It makes the artery stiff. Okay, so there's no more elasticity.
- **[08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TIPd0tNnHU&t=517s)** — So you're going to increase pressure just from that. So again, that crosses over with the
- **[08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TIPd0tNnHU&t=521s)** — number one thing, which is the high sugar in the diet. Number two, a potassium deficiency.
- **[08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TIPd0tNnHU&t=526s)** — Now, what does potassium have to do with the arteries? Well, potassium keeps the arteries
- **[08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TIPd0tNnHU&t=531s)** — elastic. It keeps them flexible. And without potassium, your arteries can become very
- **[08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TIPd0tNnHU&t=537s)** — hardened and your blood pressure can go up. There's a lot of data on having enough
- **[09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TIPd0tNnHU&t=542s)** — potassium in keeping your blood pressure normalized. And where does potassium come from?
- **[09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TIPd0tNnHU&t=547s)** — Well, it comes from a lot of the foods that are high in magnesium too. And that would be
- **[09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TIPd0tNnHU&t=551s)** — the leafy greens. The average person consumes only like a cup and a half of vegetables a day
- **[09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TIPd0tNnHU&t=557s)** — where they really need about, you know, seven to 10 cups of salad per day or four to five
- **[09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TIPd0tNnHU&t=563s)** — cups of regular vegetables. And a lack of potassium also can cause problems with arrhythmias
- **[09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TIPd0tNnHU&t=569s)** — like atrial fibrillation, which is another predisposing factor of getting a stroke.
- **[09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TIPd0tNnHU&t=575s)** — And then we also have a lack of vitamin D, which a lot of people are deficient in.
- **[09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TIPd0tNnHU&t=579s)** — Lack of vitamin D will create more inflammation. It will increase your chance of getting,
- **[09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TIPd0tNnHU&t=584s)** — you know, prediabetes and diabetes and insulin resistance. And so I always recommend
- **[09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TIPd0tNnHU&t=588s)** — a good amount of vitamin D, potassium, and they get on a low carb diet. That seems to
- **[09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TIPd0tNnHU&t=595s)** — handle a lot of hypertension, which will indirectly put you at a much lower risk of getting a stroke.
- **[10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TIPd0tNnHU&t=600s)** — So when we talk about predicting a sudden stroke, if someone is eating a lot of carbs,
- **[10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TIPd0tNnHU&t=605s)** — okay, and they're diabetic, and they don't eat much salad, and they're going through a lot
- **[10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TIPd0tNnHU&t=610s)** — of stress, and they're sedentary, those are the true enemies, the factors that will
- **[10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TIPd0tNnHU&t=615s)** — predict a stroke. And one last concept I want to talk about in this book.
- **[10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TIPd0tNnHU&t=619s)** — The first part of the book is all about getting intel, intelligence. So you're able to evaluate
- **[10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TIPd0tNnHU&t=626s)** — and then predict and have the knowledge before you go to battle. Because if you go to battle,
- **[10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TIPd0tNnHU&t=631s)** — or battled with an illness, a sickness, let's say you're battling cancer, for example,
- **[10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TIPd0tNnHU&t=636s)** — directly with chemotherapy and everything else, and just throwing everything out the wall to try
- **[10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TIPd0tNnHU&t=642s)** — reverse the situation, the outcomes are not that great. If we understand the body, as well as a
- **[10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TIPd0tNnHU&t=649s)** — lot of these other conditions, and that is what my YouTube channel is all about. Giving you the
- **[10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TIPd0tNnHU&t=653s)** — information so you can estimate things or evaluate things, and you can predict things, and you can
- **[10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TIPd0tNnHU&t=658s)** — prevent a lot of health problems down the road. So number one, get on keto and intermittent
- **[11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TIPd0tNnHU&t=663s)** — fasting. Number two, make sure you have enough salad in your diet. That way you get the
- **[11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TIPd0tNnHU&t=668s)** — potassium and magnesium. Number three, start a regular exercise program to flesh out the
- **[11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TIPd0tNnHU&t=674s)** — adrenaline and the stress that builds up, that ends up creating a lot of problems and killing a
- **[11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TIPd0tNnHU&t=677s)** — lot of people. And also make sure that you're eating nutrient-dense foods to provide the B
- **[11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TIPd0tNnHU&t=682s)** — vitamins. Vitamin C, vitamin E, vitamin D, for all the other support for creating a healthy
- **[11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TIPd0tNnHU&t=688s)** — body. Now if you haven't seen this very popular video on the best meal to clean out
- **[11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TIPd0tNnHU&t=692s)** — your arteries, I put it up right here. Check it out.

- **[00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZV1oYv5Ddo&t=0s)** — Is it possible that your depression or anxiety is coming from a missing microbe in your gut?
- **[00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZV1oYv5Ddo&t=7s)** — This video is going to blow you away. I want to share some very new and powerful information
- **[00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZV1oYv5Ddo&t=13s)** — on the gut microbiome and its association with your overall mood. And I have a dynamite solution
- **[00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZV1oYv5Ddo&t=19s)** — that I think you are going to love. And it's a whole recipe and I'm going to walk you through
- **[00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZV1oYv5Ddo&t=24s)** — Let's just take digestive enzymes. Humans make 17 digestive enzymes. The microbiome makes over
- **[00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZV1oYv5Ddo&t=33s)** — 60 digestive enzymes. And these microbes are the only thing that can digest fiber. We as humans do
- **[00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZV1oYv5Ddo&t=39s)** — not have the ability to break down fiber. But microbes do. They take the fiber, they break it
- **[00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZV1oYv5Ddo&t=44s)** — down into this certain fat. And that's called acetic acid that actually helps feed the colon
- **[00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZV1oYv5Ddo&t=49s)** — There's also another breakdown molecule that mimics ketones called butyric acid.
- **[00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZV1oYv5Ddo&t=54s)** — And one of the biggest things that microbes do in relationship to your mood is contribute to the
- **[00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZV1oYv5Ddo&t=59s)** — production of neurotransmitters. Neurotransmitters are like hormones, but they travel through the
- **[01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZV1oYv5Ddo&t=65s)** — nervous system. I'm talking about serotonin, dopamine, GABA. 90% of all the serotonin in your
- **[01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZV1oYv5Ddo&t=75s)** — made in your gut. And so we have also a highway between the gut and our brain. It's called the
- **[01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZV1oYv5Ddo&t=80s)** — vagus nerve and it goes two ways. So in other words, you can have depression or anxiety
- **[01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZV1oYv5Ddo&t=86s)** — if your gut is not right. And if you have depression or anxiety up here, that will affect
- **[01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZV1oYv5Ddo&t=93s)** — the gut microbiome. The gut microbiome also has the ability to break down toxins,
- **[01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZV1oYv5Ddo&t=98s)** — medications. They turn certain antioxidants in your food into other amazing compounds that help
- **[01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZV1oYv5Ddo&t=105s)** — us. And what I really want you to know about this topic is that you have mostly good bacteria.
- **[01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZV1oYv5Ddo&t=111s)** — Okay. And we also have some bad bacteria that's kept in check by the quantity of good bacteria
- **[01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZV1oYv5Ddo&t=118s)** — over here. And the good bacteria maintain and support the gut wall to prevent the bad guys from
- **[02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZV1oYv5Ddo&t=125s)** — crossing over. And so what happens when we have antibiotics, glyphosate, that's an herbicide,
- **[02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZV1oYv5Ddo&t=131s)** — which by the way, it's in a lot of your foods. When we junk foods, medications, we go through
- **[02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZV1oYv5Ddo&t=135s)** — stress, alcohol, smoking, pollution, all of that diminishes the microbiome. We get less
- **[02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZV1oYv5Ddo&t=141s)** — neurotransmitters made. We get an alteration of the blood sugar, but we also get a migration
- **[02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZV1oYv5Ddo&t=147s)** — of certain pathogens that start traveling up into the small intestine, which is about 20 to
- **[02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZV1oYv5Ddo&t=153s)** — 23 feet. So normally we don't want a lot of bacteria in the small intestine. And when these
- **[02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZV1oYv5Ddo&t=158s)** — bad guys go up into the small intestine, there's competition of nutrients. So now we
- **[02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZV1oYv5Ddo&t=162s)** — develop nutrient deficiencies. We get small intestinal bacterial overgrowth. And then
- **[02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZV1oYv5Ddo&t=168s)** — this leads to more inflammation, leaky gut, allergies, inability to eat certain things. All
- **[02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZV1oYv5Ddo&t=174s)** — right. Now I want to talk about something very interesting. The doctor who wrote the book,
- **[03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZV1oYv5Ddo&t=180s)** — Wheat Belly, and also a new book called Super Gut, who I'm going to interview shortly,
- **[03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZV1oYv5Ddo&t=186s)** — came up with the most amazing protocol where you can actually grow your own probiotics in
- **[03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZV1oYv5Ddo&t=192s)** — a certain dairy product, but it's not even a yogurt. It's a super concentrated
- **[03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZV1oYv5Ddo&t=198s)** — probiotic that can do tremendous good for your body. Dr. Davis found a way to grow a very
- **[03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZV1oYv5Ddo&t=204s)** — specific microbe. And I want to share a little bit with you. And then we'll talk to
- **[03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZV1oYv5Ddo&t=208s)** — First of all, this microbe has been highly studied. Quite a few studies relate to
- **[03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZV1oYv5Ddo&t=213s)** — how this microbe can lower depression. And also if someone is on an SSRI for a period of time,
- **[03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZV1oYv5Ddo&t=220s)** — that's one of the side effects as well. So the good news is that there could be a
- **[03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZV1oYv5Ddo&t=225s)** — potential solution for that specific problem. So Dr. Davis talks about this in his book.
- **[03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZV1oYv5Ddo&t=230s)** — When you typically make yogurt, they usually ferment it for like four hours. So what Dr.
- **[03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZV1oYv5Ddo&t=235s)** — Davis did is he found that you have to ferment it for 36 hours. And to grow this specific microbe,
- **[04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZV1oYv5Ddo&t=242s)** — you want to use a certain temperature. You want to use body temperature, which is 98.6,
- **[04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZV1oYv5Ddo&t=247s)** — but we rounded up to 99 degrees Fahrenheit. So what Dr. Davis has put together is a way to
- **[04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZV1oYv5Ddo&t=252s)** — kind of use a yogurt maker. And you're going to use a dairy product, which I'm
- **[04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZV1oYv5Ddo&t=257s)** — going to demonstrate all this. And you're going to put a certain microbe in there.
- **[04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZV1oYv5Ddo&t=261s)** — And then you're going to feed it a little fiber, which I'll explain. And then you're just going to
- **[04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZV1oYv5Ddo&t=266s)** — leave it at 99 degrees for 36 hours. And you come back and it's going to be a very delicious
- **[04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZV1oYv5Ddo&t=270s)** — product. And then he recommends to take a half a cup a day. Now I've been doing this and I've
- **[04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZV1oYv5Ddo&t=274s)** — been taking him right before bed. Wow. I'll share the results with you. But let me just
- **[04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZV1oYv5Ddo&t=278s)** — first complete talking about this microbe. First of all, it survives the stomach acids.
- **[04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZV1oYv5Ddo&t=282s)** — Second thing, it releases a chemical that does not affect any of the good microbes,
- **[04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZV1oYv5Ddo&t=288s)** — just the bad. And a lot of people get benefits by taking antibiotics with their skin. They might
- **[04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZV1oYv5Ddo&t=294s)** — get rid of like rashes and certain infections like styes in the eye and all these things.
- **[04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZV1oYv5Ddo&t=299s)** — But of course they're using a regular antibiotic and that comes with a package. Well, this is
- **[05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZV1oYv5Ddo&t=304s)** — a natural process that you don't develop resistance against. So that's just one thing.
- **[05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZV1oYv5Ddo&t=309s)** — It has this chemical, wipes out the bad guys in the small intestine. It also makes
- **[05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZV1oYv5Ddo&t=315s)** — oxytocin. Oxytocin is an amazing hormone that does a lot more than we thought. It not only
- **[05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZV1oYv5Ddo&t=321s)** — helps with like social bonding, but it really helps to lower cortisol, which is involved
- **[05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZV1oYv5Ddo&t=326s)** — in anxiety and even depression. So it's an amazing stress hormone. There's been some
- **[05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZV1oYv5Ddo&t=332s)** — interesting anecdotal reports of increased muscle mass, great deep delta wave sleep,
- **[05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZV1oYv5Ddo&t=339s)** — thicker hair, better younger skin. But the main thing is an overall better mood. So let's do this.
- **[05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZV1oYv5Ddo&t=347s)** — Let's interview Dr. Davis and then I'm going to roll right into how to make this amazing,
- **[05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZV1oYv5Ddo&t=353s)** — highly concentrated probiotic that you can take every night before you go to sleep or take
- **[05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZV1oYv5Ddo&t=357s)** — it during the day to help you with whatever you're going through. All right, let's go to
- **[06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZV1oYv5Ddo&t=361s)** — Dr. Davis right now. How did you kind of isolate or stumble on this very specific
- **[06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZV1oYv5Ddo&t=366s)** — microbe? I mean, there's other microbes, but I think the main one you talk about a lot is the
- **[06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZV1oYv5Ddo&t=371s)** — L or lactobacillus ruderi. So can you tell me a little bit about how you kind of stumbled
- **[06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZV1oYv5Ddo&t=375s)** — on that microbe versus other ones? Well, it was real simple. I make most of my
- **[06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZV1oYv5Ddo&t=381s)** — ideas by mistake, by making big blunders. So that's how I came to the wheat belly
- **[06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZV1oYv5Ddo&t=388s)** — idea, trying to minimize the expression of small L-veal particles. As you know,
- **[06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZV1oYv5Ddo&t=391s)** — the real cause for heart disease, not this nonsense about L-veal cholesterol.
- **[06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZV1oYv5Ddo&t=396s)** — So I saw people, you and I have a lot of success in helping people regain health. And so
- **[06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZV1oYv5Ddo&t=400s)** — with wheat grain and grain elimination, sugar elimination, and a handful of common nutrients
- **[06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZV1oYv5Ddo&t=404s)** — that are lacking in modern life, we see all kinds of wonderful things like a reversal of
- **[06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZV1oYv5Ddo&t=409s)** — type 2 diabetes, loss of fatty liver, weight loss, etc. But it was clear that was
- **[06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZV1oYv5Ddo&t=414s)** — incomplete. Even when I added some basic microbiome strategies, like a high potency
- **[06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZV1oYv5Ddo&t=419s)** — of multi-species probiotic or prebiotic fibers, fermented foods, I still saw some residual
- **[07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZV1oYv5Ddo&t=424s)** — problems. For instance, somebody says, my rheumatoid arthritis is much better. I got
- **[07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZV1oYv5Ddo&t=430s)** — rid of the biologic injections. I got rid of the prednisone, but I'm still taking the proxen
- **[07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZV1oYv5Ddo&t=436s)** — as needed for occasional mild flare-ups. Why? So I looked for what else was there was.
- **[07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZV1oYv5Ddo&t=442s)** — I started thinking about the hormone oxytocin. I don't remember why.
- **[07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZV1oYv5Ddo&t=446s)** — There's a really crazy set of Frankenstein experiments being conducted by a woman named
- **[07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZV1oYv5Ddo&t=453s)** — Irina Conboy. She's been at Harvard, Stanford, I think she's now at UC Berkeley.
- **[07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZV1oYv5Ddo&t=458s)** — And she did something really creepy. They took an old rat and cloned it so that they
- **[07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZV1oYv5Ddo&t=465s)** — got a young rat that was immunologically and genetically identical and then connected their
- **[07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZV1oYv5Ddo&t=471s)** — circulatory systems. Yuck! Well, then they called it heterochronic parabiosis, two times
- **[08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZV1oYv5Ddo&t=480s)** — next to life. Well, lo and behold, the old rat becomes young. And so they asked,
- **[08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZV1oYv5Ddo&t=486s)** — what are the mediators? That work is ongoing. But the first mediator they isolated,
- **[08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZV1oYv5Ddo&t=492s)** — they're a bunch of peptides. The first media they isolated was oxytocin. What people
- **[08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZV1oYv5Ddo&t=497s)** — regard as the hormone of love and empathy. What some ladies regard as the drug they get to
- **[08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZV1oYv5Ddo&t=502s)** — induce labor when they're pregnant at term delivery, term pregnancy. Well, then an MIT
- **[08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZV1oYv5Ddo&t=509s)** — group, a cancer group, were exploring the anti-cancer effects of lactobacillus rhodoride.
- **[08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZV1oYv5Ddo&t=515s)** — And they discovered all kinds of unexpected effects. The first thing they observed was
- **[08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZV1oYv5Ddo&t=519s)** — that their fur, in their words, became rich and luxurious. Wow. So they started doing
- **[08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZV1oYv5Ddo&t=525s)** — crazy things to these mice, like inflicting wounds in their skin and watch healing time cut
- **[08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZV1oYv5Ddo&t=531s)** — by half. They watched old mice become young again. So for instance, if you look at muscle,
- **[08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZV1oYv5Ddo&t=537s)** — that's atrophied in older mice, young muscle cells come back. Their libido, their mating
- **[09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZV1oYv5Ddo&t=543s)** — behavior comes back. The immune system is amplified. In other words, it changed. They
- **[09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZV1oYv5Ddo&t=550s)** — did this. They did crazy study. They gave two groups of mice a lousy diet, purposefully meant
- **[09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZV1oYv5Ddo&t=556s)** — to mimic fast food. The mice that got just fast food got fat and old, lost their hair, stopped
- **[09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZV1oYv5Ddo&t=563s)** — mating. They got old and died. The mice who got the same crappy diet, but with rhodoride,
- **[09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZV1oYv5Ddo&t=569s)** — stayed slender, rich fur, mated. They stayed young until death. So, okay, so this experiment
- **[09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZV1oYv5Ddo&t=577s)** — I think that was the missing point. They gave them a certain microbe, l-rhodoride, because of
- **[09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZV1oYv5Ddo&t=583s)** — oxytocin. They wanted to increase it. They did, but they didn't set out to do just that.
- **[09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZV1oYv5Ddo&t=589s)** — They kind of stumbled on that. So like a lot of things I do, this was by accident. So they
- **[09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZV1oYv5Ddo&t=594s)** — wanted to understand, first of all, why that rich, luxuriant fur issue. It became clear they
- **[09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZV1oYv5Ddo&t=599s)** — opened a whole Pandora's box of effects. Well, I got that same microbe. It was available
- **[10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZV1oYv5Ddo&t=606s)** — commercially from a Swedish company, but it was available as tablets for infants. So very
- **[10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZV1oYv5Ddo&t=613s)** — teensy weensy dose. So I simply reasoned, let's ferment it as something that looks like
- **[10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZV1oYv5Ddo&t=618s)** — yogurt, but we're going to ferment it using prolonged fermentation. So rhodoride will,
- **[10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZV1oYv5Ddo&t=623s)** — you know, as you recall, microbes don't have sex. There's no mommy, daddy, male, female,
- **[10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZV1oYv5Ddo&t=627s)** — microbes. They just double. So rhodoride doubles every three hours at human body temperature.
- **[10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZV1oYv5Ddo&t=633s)** — So I made yogurts, not yogurt, of course. It looks and smells like yogurt, but I used
- **[10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZV1oYv5Ddo&t=638s)** — prolonged fermentation. I allowed 12 doublings. I performed something called flow cytometry,
- **[10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZV1oYv5Ddo&t=644s)** — just a way to count microbes. And we get 300 billion. So far more, about a thousandfold
- **[10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZV1oYv5Ddo&t=650s)** — more than the original tablets for babies. I just started talking about it. Gave it to
- **[10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZV1oYv5Ddo&t=655s)** — my neighbors. I started eating it. Okay. So the question I have is, so when you,
- **[11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZV1oYv5Ddo&t=661s)** — did you initially know how to do that? Or you just go, okay, let me try something. And
- **[11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZV1oYv5Ddo&t=666s)** — I guess that didn't work. Did you, how did you know to ferment it for 36 hours?
- **[11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZV1oYv5Ddo&t=670s)** — Hit and miss. Okay. And then I did repeated flow cytometry counts. It became clear.
- **[11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZV1oYv5Ddo&t=676s)** — The number I first picked 36 hours was the sweet spot. That's where you get
- **[11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZV1oYv5Ddo&t=680s)** — maximum number, at least as yogurt. And if you go to 48 hours, you get a plateau. You actually
- **[11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZV1oYv5Ddo&t=686s)** — get an increase in dead microbes. So 36 hours, which by the way is very different than what they
- **[11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZV1oYv5Ddo&t=691s)** — do in commercial yogurt making, which is six to 12 hours. It's ridiculous. So I guess the reason,
- **[11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZV1oYv5Ddo&t=698s)** — at first did you think, well, I think we'll just take this microbe as a supplement, right?
- **[11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZV1oYv5Ddo&t=703s)** — Were you thinking at first like, oh, we'll just take it and it'll work just by taking it?
- **[11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZV1oYv5Ddo&t=707s)** — You know, you can, but the quantity of in the original product, which called
- **[11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZV1oYv5Ddo&t=712s)** — bio-gaiogastrous, G-A-S-T-R-U-S, the infant tablets. So when you take it, nothing happens.
- **[12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZV1oYv5Ddo&t=720s)** — When I called the company, I talked to the exact, I said, Hey, I'm playing with this,
- **[12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZV1oYv5Ddo&t=724s)** — your tablet is making yogurt. They said, you can't, no one's ever made yogurt from it.
- **[12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZV1oYv5Ddo&t=728s)** — And they said, we don't know anything about that MIT nonsense. Don't call us again.
- **[12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZV1oYv5Ddo&t=732s)** — They essentially shut it all down. So I thought, okay, fine. So I made the yogurt
- **[12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZV1oYv5Ddo&t=736s)** — and now we have thousands and thousands of people doing it. And the crazy thing is,
- **[12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZV1oYv5Ddo&t=741s)** — so as elegant as that MIT work was, we're learning new lessons, both from human experience
- **[12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZV1oYv5Ddo&t=748s)** — and some limited efforts in clinical trials. We're seeing all kinds of things happen. But you
- **[12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZV1oYv5Ddo&t=753s)** — know what? As you know, usually when you see stuff happen in mice, it's usually not
- **[12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZV1oYv5Ddo&t=758s)** — corroborated in humans. It falls apart. In this instance, to my great surprise, everything
- **[12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZV1oYv5Ddo&t=763s)** — seen in mice has proven true in humans. So we see a restoration of youthful musculature,
- **[12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZV1oYv5Ddo&t=771s)** — an increase in strength, guys, older guys over 50 get about a 50% rise in testosterone.
- **[12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZV1oYv5Ddo&t=777s)** — Ladies get a rest, older ladies get a restoration of vaginal moisture and sensation.
- **[13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZV1oYv5Ddo&t=782s)** — There's an increase in libido, which leads some very embarrassing stories. There is a presumptive
- **[13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZV1oYv5Ddo&t=788s)** — increase in the immune responses. People seem to get better faster. There's an acceleration
- **[13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZV1oYv5Ddo&t=792s)** — of healing from minor wounds. And I tell this to ladies, and you know, I'm sure your audience
- **[13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZV1oYv5Ddo&t=799s)** — is a lot like mine. My audience is 87% female. They all say this to me, incredibly. They say,
- **[13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZV1oYv5Ddo&t=806s)** — oh, we don't care about muscle and the immune response. We just want better skin.
- **[13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZV1oYv5Ddo&t=813s)** — I said, what? Fine. So I did a little clinical trial on ladies, big ladies. I said,
- **[13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZV1oYv5Ddo&t=820s)** — don't change your diet. Don't change your exercise program. Just take these. That was
- **[13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZV1oYv5Ddo&t=824s)** — the Rhoeteri. I added some other things to amplify the skin effects, collagen peptides,
- **[13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZV1oYv5Ddo&t=829s)** — hyaluronic acid, and the carotenoid acesanthin. And we did high resolution skin ultrasound.
- **[13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZV1oYv5Ddo&t=834s)** — And we showed a big increase in dermal thickness. Ladies are thrilled because they lose
- **[13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZV1oYv5Ddo&t=837s)** — their crows feet and their smile lines. But I happen to measure their waist circumference.
- **[14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZV1oYv5Ddo&t=843s)** — It's free. You and I don't have the budget of pharma. We don't have billions of dollars
- **[14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZV1oYv5Ddo&t=847s)** — to spend. We have maybe tens or hundreds of thousands of dollars to spend in our
- **[14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZV1oYv5Ddo&t=851s)** — clinical trials. So I measured waist circumference free. And to my great surprise,
- **[14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZV1oYv5Ddo&t=856s)** — this was Christmas Eve, I get the waist circumference. I said, no way. They lost
- **[14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZV1oYv5Ddo&t=861s)** — huge amount of waist circumference, up to eight and a half inches. No change in diet.
- **[14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZV1oYv5Ddo&t=866s)** — Even more remarkably, they didn't lose weight. Well, how can that be? Well, I think consistent
- **[14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZV1oYv5Ddo&t=872s)** — with the animal evidence and what I'm seeing anecdotally play out in thousands of people
- **[14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZV1oYv5Ddo&t=876s)** — is you lose abdominal fat, but you restore youthful muscle. We're seeing that play out. So I don't
- **[14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZV1oYv5Ddo&t=883s)** — believe what I stumbled on by accident is a way to shift body composition. The complete opposite,
- **[14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZV1oYv5Ddo&t=891s)** — by the way, of these garbage GLP-1 agonist drugs that of course cause huge loss of muscle,
- **[14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZV1oYv5Ddo&t=899s)** — guarantees weight regain. So a person has a choice, stop the drug and see your health
- **[15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZV1oYv5Ddo&t=904s)** — deteriorate when you regain all the weight as fat or stay on the drug forever and be held
- **[15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZV1oYv5Ddo&t=910s)** — hostage by the pharmaceutical industries. I think even one of your videos you mentioned,
- **[15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZV1oYv5Ddo&t=914s)** — you personally gained how much muscle mass? So in my 60s, I gained about 13 pounds of muscle
- **[15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZV1oYv5Ddo&t=923s)** — and fit my strength increased by 50%. And I mentioned to you in emails, I hate going to
- **[15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZV1oYv5Ddo&t=931s)** — gym. I can't stand it. So I go 15 minutes on a busy week. I go 15 minutes once a week. I have
- **[15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZV1oYv5Ddo&t=938s)** — been to the gym five months, but I do other things. But so that's what I'm seeing. Now,
- **[15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZV1oYv5Ddo&t=943s)** — I don't know if that happens to everybody. I do see ladies, they get mad at me. They say,
- **[15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZV1oYv5Ddo&t=949s)** — hey, I'm doing your program in the rotor. I gained eight pounds. I asked them, have you
- **[15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZV1oYv5Ddo&t=954s)** — looked in the mirror? Have you measured your waist? I said, well, yeah, my waist is
- **[15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZV1oYv5Ddo&t=957s)** — smaller. My shoulders are firmer. My thighs and buttocks and neck are firmer. So presumptive,
- **[16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZV1oYv5Ddo&t=963s)** — we got to do this more formally, like do a DEXA study or something like that,
- **[16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZV1oYv5Ddo&t=967s)** — formally quantify the shift in muscle and all that business. But you know, all we're doing
- **[16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZV1oYv5Ddo&t=971s)** — though, right, is replacing things that you should have had in your body all along.
- **[16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZV1oYv5Ddo&t=977s)** — So I just wanted to stop at that one point. Okay, so this microbe, obviously,
- **[16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZV1oYv5Ddo&t=983s)** — we're supposed to have it initially, and I'm guessing some past antibiotic wiped it out or
- **[16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZV1oYv5Ddo&t=988s)** — bad food or something. And I think you mentioned even in your book or another video that
- **[16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZV1oYv5Ddo&t=994s)** — what percentage of the population just doesn't have this microbe anymore.
- **[16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZV1oYv5Ddo&t=998s)** — About 96%. So it is very susceptible, as are many lactobacilli, to common antibiotics. So
- **[16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZV1oYv5Ddo&t=1006s)** — if you took Amoxicillin 30 years ago for an upper respiratory, if they wiped out all your
- **[16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZV1oYv5Ddo&t=1012s)** — right, which is so fascinating about that, is if we sequence the microbiomes of some living
- **[16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZV1oYv5Ddo&t=1017s)** — the highlands of New Guinea, or the Brazilian rainforest and the Amazon,
- **[17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZV1oYv5Ddo&t=1023s)** — people unexposed to antibiotics, etc. They all have right, they all have sequence wild mammals,
- **[17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZV1oYv5Ddo&t=1031s)** — like deer or giraffes or lions, they all have right, suggesting it's necessary for
- **[17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZV1oYv5Ddo&t=1037s)** — mammalian health. It's us who've lost it. The original discoverer, Dr. Gerhard Reuter,
- **[17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZV1oYv5Ddo&t=1043s)** — said it was everywhere in the 1960s. He got it from the breast milk of a German breastfeeding
- **[17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZV1oYv5Ddo&t=1047s)** — mom, and he found it in stool and other body fluids. Over his 40-year academic career,
- **[17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZV1oYv5Ddo&t=1052s)** — he found it increasingly difficult to find it started to disappear. And since then,
- **[17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZV1oYv5Ddo&t=1056s)** — it's been corroborated. It's virtually disappeared from the human microbiome.
- **[17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZV1oYv5Ddo&t=1060s)** — And I think that's why we're seeing such over the top effects, restoring something people
- **[17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZV1oYv5Ddo&t=1064s)** — have lost, and doing so at very high counts. Wow. So then what happens, you lose this microbe,
- **[17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZV1oYv5Ddo&t=1073s)** — which also, by the way, tends to protect against small intestinal bacteria overgrowth,
- **[17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZV1oYv5Ddo&t=1078s)** — right? It does a lot of things in the small intestine too. And then it probably,
- **[18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZV1oYv5Ddo&t=1083s)** — because it's not there, then you start getting this invasion from the large intestine
- **[18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZV1oYv5Ddo&t=1088s)** — climbing up to the small intestine. Is that what happens too sometimes?
- **[18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZV1oYv5Ddo&t=1092s)** — Exactly. Yes. So loss of those beneficial species, this species of lactobacillus and others,
- **[18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZV1oYv5Ddo&t=1099s)** — allow the over-proliferation of proteobacterium, fecal microbes like E. coli and Klebsiella,
- **[18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZV1oYv5Ddo&t=1105s)** — that have taken up residence in virtually half the U.S. population. So it's probably the
- **[18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZV1oYv5Ddo&t=1111s)** — worst epidemic to ever occur in our species. And there's science behind that. So we have 24
- **[18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZV1oYv5Ddo&t=1119s)** — feet of small intestine infested by fecal microbes. Now, as you recall, the small
- **[18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZV1oYv5Ddo&t=1124s)** — intestine is very permeable. That's where we absorb nutrients. So when those microbes that
- **[18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZV1oYv5Ddo&t=1129s)** — live and die over just a period of a few hours, they don't live very long, they release some
- **[18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZV1oYv5Ddo&t=1133s)** — of the components of their cell wall, such as the endotoxin component. And that gains access
- **[18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZV1oYv5Ddo&t=1137s)** — to your bloodstream. That's called endotoxemia, of course, and that is a major driver of
- **[19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZV1oYv5Ddo&t=1142s)** — weight gain, dementia. It's probably one of the most important factors causing multiple forms
- **[19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZV1oYv5Ddo&t=1147s)** — of cancer, type 2 diabetes, cognitive impairment. So in other words, it's going to cause us to
- **[19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZV1oYv5Ddo&t=1154s)** — reconsider virtually all human disease in light of the contribution, initiation or exacerbation
- **[19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZV1oYv5Ddo&t=1160s)** — of endotoxemia. So just on the topic of endotoxemia. So there's somehow some of these
- **[19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZV1oYv5Ddo&t=1167s)** — bad microbes, these pathogens, they either leak off or release something negative about
- **[19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZV1oYv5Ddo&t=1174s)** — that that then forms this infection that gets into the bloodstream that starts creating a
- **[19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZV1oYv5Ddo&t=1180s)** — cascade of bad effects. Yes. So people have suspected this issue of gut leak for many
- **[19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZV1oYv5Ddo&t=1187s)** — decades, but it finally got corroborated by Patrice Canney and his Belgian group in 2007,
- **[19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZV1oYv5Ddo&t=1192s)** — and since corroborated numerous times since. It is a major driver. It terrifies me to think
- **[19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZV1oYv5Ddo&t=1198s)** — how we didn't know about this thing. The great thing about Rhetoride is,
- **[20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZV1oYv5Ddo&t=1203s)** — so most microbes colonize the colon only. Right, the large intestine. Yeah.
- **[20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZV1oYv5Ddo&t=1208s)** — The Rhetoride colonize the 24 feet of small intestine and the colon. Wow. Where it takes
- **[20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZV1oYv5Ddo&t=1214s)** — up residence and does something wonderful. It produces what are called bacteriocins,
- **[20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZV1oYv5Ddo&t=1219s)** — natural antibiotics effective against fecal microbes. So the loss of Rhetoride probably
- **[20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZV1oYv5Ddo&t=1225s)** — big part of the reason why this happened and restoring Rhetoride is a big part of the solution
- **[20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZV1oYv5Ddo&t=1230s)** — to correct that problem. So we're seeing SIBO recede via normalization of breath hydrogen gas
- **[20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZV1oYv5Ddo&t=1236s)** — with restoration of lactobacillus Rhetoride, but I've combined it with
- **[20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZV1oYv5Ddo&t=1240s)** — lactobacillus gasseri because that's another big bacteriocin producer and small intestinal
- **[20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZV1oYv5Ddo&t=1246s)** — colonizer. And then we've thrown in a strand of bacillus subtilis or subtilis
- **[20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZV1oYv5Ddo&t=1250s)** — because of its extraordinary bacteriocin. And so far making yogurt, yogurt out of those three,
- **[20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZV1oYv5Ddo&t=1259s)** — we get about 90% normalization of breath hydrogen gas and all the wonderful effects that accompany
- **[21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZV1oYv5Ddo&t=1264s)** — that weight loss, plateaus are broken, hemoglobin A1c finally goes below five,
- **[21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZV1oYv5Ddo&t=1270s)** — all that kind of great stuff happens just by restoring these keystone, what I think are
- **[21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZV1oYv5Ddo&t=1275s)** — keystone microbes via something that looks and smells like yogurt. And also your sleep,
- **[21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZV1oYv5Ddo&t=1280s)** — and oh, I'm a chronic insomniac, terrible for decades. With Rhetoride, I sleep wonderfully.
- **[21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZV1oYv5Ddo&t=1290s)** — Not everybody gets that. Maybe half the people get that. And by the way,
- **[21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZV1oYv5Ddo&t=1294s)** — there are some other microbes that have magnificent effects on sleep. Another one
- **[21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZV1oYv5Ddo&t=1298s)** — is lactobacillus KCI-Sherota strain that's available as this goofy little product called
- **[21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZV1oYv5Ddo&t=1304s)** — Yakult. It's an awful little product, it's skin, milk and sugar, but it's a good source.
- **[21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZV1oYv5Ddo&t=1310s)** — Of that microbe. And so as a chronic insomniac, I take the Rhetoride sleeping eight, nine hours
- **[21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZV1oYv5Ddo&t=1315s)** — straight through rare awakenings. I add the KCI-Sherota as yogurt, I sleep 12 hours a night,
- **[22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZV1oYv5Ddo&t=1322s)** — I had to stop it because it was so overwhelming. That varies among people.
- **[22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZV1oYv5Ddo&t=1328s)** — And these are effects not yet described in the scientific literature,
- **[22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZV1oYv5Ddo&t=1333s)** — because we're experiencing it on a large scale.
- **[22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZV1oYv5Ddo&t=1337s)** — You stumbled on something that's so fascinating to me, because I'm into the farming and the soil
- **[22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZV1oYv5Ddo&t=1342s)** — and the microbes. This is like, but this is all human body stuff. I definitely want to stay
- **[22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZV1oYv5Ddo&t=1346s)** — connected and keep picking your brain. But so there's a book that I highly recommend everyone
- **[22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZV1oYv5Ddo&t=1352s)** — go out and get. It's SuperGut. And also, I'm going to put your website down below. And you
- **[22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZV1oYv5Ddo&t=1358s)** — also have a course. I'll put some information about what the specific microbe that you
- **[22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZV1oYv5Ddo&t=1365s)** — recommend because there's different strains. And you have you figured out the right strains.
- **[22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZV1oYv5Ddo&t=1369s)** — So that's going to be really key to get that I'll put that link down below. But,
- **[22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZV1oYv5Ddo&t=1374s)** — wow, this is huge. I'm so interested in this topic. I'm just blown away. But anyway,
- **[23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZV1oYv5Ddo&t=1382s)** — I wanted to just pull you on and don't take too much of your time. But I want to thank
- **[23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZV1oYv5Ddo&t=1386s)** — you for that data. And, and also, I'm gonna, I'll just gonna roll right into next to how to
- **[23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZV1oYv5Ddo&t=1393s)** — make this if someone wants to make it. And if they want details, they can go to your blog site.
- **[23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZV1oYv5Ddo&t=1399s)** — How about that? Terrific. Yeah, you know, my one of my interests is this is all happening,
- **[23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZV1oYv5Ddo&t=1404s)** — right? Yeah. At a time of record social isolation. Right. Of course. Suicide is
- **[23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZV1oYv5Ddo&t=1411s)** — at record levels. 36% increase between 2000, 2020. And I did not know this, the psychology
- **[23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZV1oYv5Ddo&t=1420s)** — community has been formally measuring and tabulating the rise of narcissistic behavior.
- **[23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZV1oYv5Ddo&t=1425s)** — And that curve looks like this 45 degree incline. So now we have a way, perhaps,
- **[23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZV1oYv5Ddo&t=1433s)** — we can address all social ills, of course, with yogurt. Perhaps we can have an impact
- **[23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZV1oYv5Ddo&t=1437s)** — because of the restoration. What I'm seeing is a restoration of the intensity of love
- **[24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZV1oYv5Ddo&t=1442s)** — and affection for other people, desire for human companionship, increase in generosity,
- **[24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZV1oYv5Ddo&t=1447s)** — and acceptance of other people's opinions. So that's my goal in doing all this. I think we
- **[24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZV1oYv5Ddo&t=1453s)** — can change human behavior in a good way. I can get behind that. That's awesome. Well done.
- **[24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZV1oYv5Ddo&t=1460s)** — Thank you so much. Thank you. This is very simple how we make this. We're going to take
- **[24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZV1oYv5Ddo&t=1465s)** — the probiotic, one capsule, and then we will open it up. And then we're going to take
- **[24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZV1oYv5Ddo&t=1472s)** — inulin. This is a tablespoon. Take two. Take organic half and a half.
- **[24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZV1oYv5Ddo&t=1483s)** — Just to make a paste. Mix it up really good. Don't put too much of that
- **[24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZV1oYv5Ddo&t=1488s)** — half and half in there right off the bat. Just about two tablespoons. And then we can
- **[24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZV1oYv5Ddo&t=1493s)** — pour the rest of this half and half in there. One quart. We're going to mix this up really
- **[25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZV1oYv5Ddo&t=1500s)** — good. Take a container. Two containers. We'll pour some of this in here.
- **[25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZV1oYv5Ddo&t=1509s)** — Even it out pretty good.
- **[25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZV1oYv5Ddo&t=1513s)** — Okay, we're putting this mixture into the yogurt maker. We have two of them,
- **[25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZV1oYv5Ddo&t=1518s)** — right? Very carefully. Okay, now we have to add water to it. So I'm going to pour the
- **[25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZV1oYv5Ddo&t=1526s)** — water like so. And I want that level to be at the same level as the mixture inside the
- **[25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZV1oYv5Ddo&t=1538s)** — containers. We now have the water at the level of a little bit more than I wanted, so
- **[25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZV1oYv5Ddo&t=1545s)** — that's fine. Okay, here's the next part. And of course, if you have a different machine,
- **[25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZV1oYv5Ddo&t=1550s)** — you're going to have to just do the same type of thing. On the left, we have temperature
- **[25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZV1oYv5Ddo&t=1554s)** — and time. So we can press this once. Okay, and then we want this at 99 degrees Fahrenheit. So
- **[26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZV1oYv5Ddo&t=1561s)** — we're going to bring this down. Okay, and then press start on that. And then now what we're
- **[26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZV1oYv5Ddo&t=1567s)** — going to do, we have eight hours. We're going to go up to 36 hours. Okay, and then we press
- **[26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZV1oYv5Ddo&t=1574s)** — start again. And guess what? We're done. We're going to put the top on it. And then we're
- **[26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZV1oYv5Ddo&t=1583s)** — done. We are going to then put it in the refrigerator for storage. Okay, we're pulling
- **[26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZV1oYv5Ddo&t=1591s)** — it out of the refrigerator after 36 hours and leaving in the fridge for a couple
- **[26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZV1oYv5Ddo&t=1595s)** — hours to cool down. And now we're going to consume a half of a cup of this every single
- **[26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZV1oYv5Ddo&t=1603s)** — day. It's amazing. It's rich. It's delicious. You can add berries to it. If you need to add
- **[26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZV1oYv5Ddo&t=1609s)** — sweetener, go ahead. But I think you'll find it quite delicious. A half a cup a day.

- **[00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mZPQ0bgqoq8&t=0s)** — There are a lot of videos on Alzheimer's. I've talked about amyloid plucking.
- **[00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mZPQ0bgqoq8&t=5s)** — I've talked about some falsified research relating to amyloid plucking. I've talked about
- **[00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mZPQ0bgqoq8&t=11s)** — the genetic factor of getting Alzheimer's or putting you at risk by 30 to 50 percent.
- **[00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mZPQ0bgqoq8&t=18s)** — If you have a very specific, it's called an APOE4, if you have that mutation,
- **[00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mZPQ0bgqoq8&t=25s)** — 30 to 50 percent more at risk. I've done all these videos as I find more information,
- **[00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mZPQ0bgqoq8&t=30s)** — but I stumbled on something that is groundbreaking. It's actually quite amazing. You have to hear
- **[00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mZPQ0bgqoq8&t=35s)** — about it. The more you understand the true mechanism of a problem, the more a solution
- **[00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mZPQ0bgqoq8&t=41s)** — will pop out. If you were to take a match and you were in the woods and you would light the
- **[00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mZPQ0bgqoq8&t=45s)** — match and start the woods on fire, would it help to focus all your energy on putting out
- **[00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mZPQ0bgqoq8&t=50s)** — match? The answer is no. As a child, I loved to play with matches. Unfortunately, it got me
- **[00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mZPQ0bgqoq8&t=56s)** — into trouble. I remember one time when I was really small, probably... actually, this was
- **[01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mZPQ0bgqoq8&t=62s)** — last year. No, I was eight years old and a friend and I were playing with matches. I found
- **[01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mZPQ0bgqoq8&t=69s)** — some matches and we went in the back of the field. I wanted to see what would happen
- **[01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mZPQ0bgqoq8&t=75s)** — if I lit a match into this empty bird nest that was just sitting there. There's no birds in it.
- **[01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mZPQ0bgqoq8&t=80s)** — I just want to see what would happen. So I light it and fire and my friend says,
- **[01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mZPQ0bgqoq8&t=86s)** — put it out. I said, no, let it go a little bit longer. Well, within a matter of seconds,
- **[01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mZPQ0bgqoq8&t=90s)** — it just starts spreading like crazy. We bolted to the back of the neighborhood,
- **[01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mZPQ0bgqoq8&t=96s)** — to someone's house to get water. And then we turn around and the entire field is on fire.
- **[01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mZPQ0bgqoq8&t=101s)** — Okay. And so I had to run home and tell my father that I lit the field on fire. And as
- **[01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mZPQ0bgqoq8&t=109s)** — he looked across, you can see the neighborhood with these flames behind the entire neighborhood
- **[01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mZPQ0bgqoq8&t=113s)** — that's spreading to the next neighborhood. And you can imagine how much trouble I got into
- **[01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mZPQ0bgqoq8&t=118s)** — and how I felt. But just my luck, it started raining. I just seemed to luck out. It started
- **[02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mZPQ0bgqoq8&t=126s)** — raining and it put the fire out. But that was a scare. I don't know why I told you the
- **[02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mZPQ0bgqoq8&t=130s)** — story, but it does relate to the match forest concept. Well, that's what research has been
- **[02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mZPQ0bgqoq8&t=136s)** — doing the last 20 years, focusing on the match. Okay. With very, very little results,
- **[02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mZPQ0bgqoq8&t=143s)** — if any. In fact, sometimes the treatment for Alzheimer's is worse. It can actually
- **[02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mZPQ0bgqoq8&t=149s)** — progress the condition. And so most of the research has been focusing on this
- **[02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mZPQ0bgqoq8&t=152s)** — theory that this amyloid placking is this metabolic junk that shouldn't be there. It has
- **[02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mZPQ0bgqoq8&t=157s)** — no purpose. We should just target and get rid of it. Well, it is true that there's amyloid
- **[02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mZPQ0bgqoq8&t=163s)** — placking involved in Alzheimer's, right? But amyloid placking would be equivalent to that
- **[02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mZPQ0bgqoq8&t=169s)** — match that starts to fire. Trying to wipe out the amyloid placking is going to be a waste
- **[02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mZPQ0bgqoq8&t=175s)** — of your time. The gene that makes this amyloid placking, which is kind of this fibrous
- **[03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mZPQ0bgqoq8&t=180s)** — tissue in the brain that ends up destroying the neurons in the brain, has been around for
- **[03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mZPQ0bgqoq8&t=185s)** — very, very long time, like 400 million years, because this gene is also an other species.
- **[03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mZPQ0bgqoq8&t=191s)** — So why has it been unchanged in the genetics for this long? Unless there was a very important
- **[03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mZPQ0bgqoq8&t=198s)** — purpose of this placking. Well, incidentally, two researchers, which I'm going to put down
- **[03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mZPQ0bgqoq8&t=203s)** — below, stumbled on something that is just quite amazing. They found out that this beta
- **[03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mZPQ0bgqoq8&t=209s)** — very potent antimicrobial peptide, 100 times more potent than penicillin. Well, let me first give
- **[03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mZPQ0bgqoq8&t=217s)** — you some background. There's two parts of the immune system. You have the innate immune system
- **[03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mZPQ0bgqoq8&t=222s)** — that you're born with. It's the ancient first line of defense immune system, part of your army.
- **[03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mZPQ0bgqoq8&t=229s)** — And then you acquire this other immune system. It's called the acquired immune system. And
- **[03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mZPQ0bgqoq8&t=235s)** — that's when you have all the antibodies and the T cells and the B cells and all these other
- **[03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mZPQ0bgqoq8&t=238s)** — things. And that usually is delayed. It takes time for your body to develop that. But in the
- **[04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mZPQ0bgqoq8&t=245s)** — brain, there is only the innate immune system. We don't have this other immune system in the
- **[04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mZPQ0bgqoq8&t=251s)** — brain because it might, maybe because it's just too powerful, it can create a lot of
- **[04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mZPQ0bgqoq8&t=255s)** — collateral damage and the brain is very sensitive. So this is what they found. They found
- **[04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mZPQ0bgqoq8&t=260s)** — that this amyloid placking is really an innate immune system reaction to a microbe that
- **[04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mZPQ0bgqoq8&t=270s)** — seeds or triggers this reaction. And so there's always this kind of this cascade between amyloid
- **[04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mZPQ0bgqoq8&t=277s)** — placking and this other thing called neurofibular tangles. Okay. So that's a mouthful.
- **[04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mZPQ0bgqoq8&t=284s)** — Basically, if you look at that like fishing line, the placking and these tangles work
- **[04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mZPQ0bgqoq8&t=289s)** — together to entrap and contain pathogens. And so when they grab these microbes, right,
- **[04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mZPQ0bgqoq8&t=297s)** — let's say virus, they start to release certain chemicals. And one is bleach. Yeah, bleach.
- **[05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mZPQ0bgqoq8&t=304s)** — And so that just kills the microbe instantly. Bam. Envision like this ball of fishing line.
- **[05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mZPQ0bgqoq8&t=310s)** — That's just gets all fused and just gets all tangled around this pathogen. And so if you
- **[05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mZPQ0bgqoq8&t=315s)** — were to look inside this placking, you'd find this dead microbe, right? If there's
- **[05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mZPQ0bgqoq8&t=318s)** — anything remaining. And then because we have this reaction, okay, we get inflammation in the
- **[05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mZPQ0bgqoq8&t=325s)** — nerves. It's called neuroinflammation. And so now we have all this collateral damage that's
- **[05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mZPQ0bgqoq8&t=330s)** — occurring. Okay. And then we basically it's all reacting to dead nerve cells. Okay. So we have
- **[05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mZPQ0bgqoq8&t=336s)** — this whole cascade thing that's happening. Alzheimer's is an innate immune reaction
- **[05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mZPQ0bgqoq8&t=343s)** — to an infection. Now, usually that infection is not necessarily a full blown infection.
- **[05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mZPQ0bgqoq8&t=351s)** — It's usually a subclinical infection that tends to brew in the oven. This is why placking
- **[05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mZPQ0bgqoq8&t=357s)** — usually develops over 20 years. And by the time you have the first symptom, you're at the
- **[06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mZPQ0bgqoq8&t=362s)** — peak of placking. Okay. And then it kind of goes down from there. And so the question is
- **[06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mZPQ0bgqoq8&t=367s)** — like, what seeds this whole thing? What is the triggers? Well, there are several really key
- **[06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mZPQ0bgqoq8&t=376s)** — pathogens that are associated with Alzheimer's. You have the herpes simplex one virus. Okay.
- **[06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mZPQ0bgqoq8&t=384s)** — That's been known to trigger Alzheimer's. You also have spiral keats in Lyme disease.
- **[06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mZPQ0bgqoq8&t=390s)** — You have something else called chlamytophilia, pneumonia, which is a microbe involved in
- **[06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mZPQ0bgqoq8&t=395s)** — And there's several others. And as far as someone having this gene susceptibility to Alzheimer's,
- **[06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mZPQ0bgqoq8&t=401s)** — that's that APOE4, which has a risk between 30 and 50% of getting Alzheimer's. Apparently,
- **[06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mZPQ0bgqoq8&t=408s)** — if you have that gene, you're more susceptible to allowing the herpes virus to cross the
- **[06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mZPQ0bgqoq8&t=414s)** — blood brain barrier into the brain, which explains a lot. And so then this got me thinking,
- **[07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mZPQ0bgqoq8&t=420s)** — isn't there a microbiome in the brain? And apparently there's been this long-standing
- **[07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mZPQ0bgqoq8&t=427s)** — thought that, no, it's all sterile, just like the blood was sterile until they found out,
- **[07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mZPQ0bgqoq8&t=433s)** — no, it's filled with microbes. Well, the brain does have a microbiome. That's right.
- **[07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mZPQ0bgqoq8&t=438s)** — And it's there probably to help protect you. Okay. And there's a huge relationship between
- **[07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mZPQ0bgqoq8&t=443s)** — Alzheimer's and an altered microbiome in your gut, but people don't talk about the brain. And
- **[07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mZPQ0bgqoq8&t=449s)** — there's just not a lot of research with this microbiome. What can we do about it? Right? Well,
- **[07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mZPQ0bgqoq8&t=456s)** — the most important thing is to do whatever you can to prevent it. There's some other things
- **[07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mZPQ0bgqoq8&t=461s)** — that are involved in this as well. Okay. Having a strong immune system, having a strong
- **[07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mZPQ0bgqoq8&t=467s)** — diversified microbiome, and also doing whatever you can to fix insulin resistance,
- **[07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mZPQ0bgqoq8&t=473s)** — which also makes you very, very susceptible. I mean, over 50% of the population has insulin
- **[07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mZPQ0bgqoq8&t=478s)** — resistance and that alone adds to the fire, the inflammation in the brain, not being on the
- **[08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mZPQ0bgqoq8&t=486s)** — ketogenic diet. Being on too many carbs adds more inflammation to the brain. You want to run
- **[08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mZPQ0bgqoq8&t=491s)** — your body on ketones that bypasses the whole thing. And so I think if you get it in time,
- **[08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mZPQ0bgqoq8&t=498s)** — you can turn things around really nice. Once you have it, it's just more difficult. I think
- **[08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mZPQ0bgqoq8&t=501s)** — you can improve it. It all depends on how much damage that's there. And the other thing is if
- **[08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mZPQ0bgqoq8&t=506s)** — you have this genetic weakness, this APOE4, you should definitely not be drinking alcohol,
- **[08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mZPQ0bgqoq8&t=511s)** — being exposed to smoking. Okay. You should be exercising, which will help the genes.
- **[08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mZPQ0bgqoq8&t=517s)** — You should be doing keto. You should be eating extremely healthy things with antioxidants. So
- **[08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mZPQ0bgqoq8&t=523s)** — some other things to think about since 95% of the population has herpes, simplex one,
- **[08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mZPQ0bgqoq8&t=529s)** — okay, is to keep that darn virus in remission as much as you can, right? Do what you can to
- **[08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mZPQ0bgqoq8&t=535s)** — keep your body healthy. Because I've noticed people that get head injuries and go through
- **[09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mZPQ0bgqoq8&t=543s)** — major losses and stresses and then develop Alzheimer's, right? I think it kind of just
- **[09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mZPQ0bgqoq8&t=549s)** — activates what's already there. The herpes virus that kind of comes out of remission
- **[09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mZPQ0bgqoq8&t=554s)** — and then just makes things worse. So we have some key factors to look at. We have the
- **[09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mZPQ0bgqoq8&t=559s)** — epigenetic things you can do right now. Okay. And I have a lot of data on this,
- **[09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mZPQ0bgqoq8&t=563s)** — getting enough sleep, the exercise, keeping your stress low, eating extremely healthy,
- **[09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mZPQ0bgqoq8&t=568s)** — avoiding chemicals that can trigger this. If you keep your stress really low and keep your
- **[09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mZPQ0bgqoq8&t=573s)** — resistance high with your immune system, you can keep these viruses in remission. I think that's
- **[09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mZPQ0bgqoq8&t=578s)** — really the key, but there's also one more thing. If you also practice fasting, anyone
- **[09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mZPQ0bgqoq8&t=584s)** — who has Alzheimer's must be doing intermittent fasting, one meal a day, not two meals, but
- **[09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mZPQ0bgqoq8&t=591s)** — one meal a day. Why? Because you need a good amount of fasting to put your body into an
- **[09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mZPQ0bgqoq8&t=597s)** — autophagy situation. Autophagy is where your body is cleaning house. It's cleaning up old
- **[10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mZPQ0bgqoq8&t=601s)** — dead proteins. It's also strengthening your immune system. It's also bringing your inflammation
- **[10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mZPQ0bgqoq8&t=608s)** — down in your brain. It's also going to help increase your resistance to pathogens. And on
- **[10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mZPQ0bgqoq8&t=616s)** — that note, I have a great video on epigenetics right here. Check it out.

- **[00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7yszU0-Molc&t=0s)** — Today, I'm going to interview someone who should have been dead six years ago, and he's still alive.
- **[00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7yszU0-Molc&t=9s)** — So we're going to talk about why he's still alive. He had stage 4 cancer. Now, what is stage 4 cancer?
- **[00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7yszU0-Molc&t=16s)** — Stage 4 cancer is also known as metastatic cancer, which means it has spread to at least one organ.
- **[00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7yszU0-Molc&t=23s)** — And in his case, it spread to his bones.
- **[00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7yszU0-Molc&t=25s)** — But here's the thing, the normal lifespan of someone with a stage 4 cancer is from a few weeks to a few months,
- **[00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7yszU0-Molc&t=36s)** — and in rare cases, several months to up to a year. But it's been six years since Guy has been told he had cancer, so he's still alive.
- **[00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7yszU0-Molc&t=50s)** — Hello, Guy. Good to see you.
- **[00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7yszU0-Molc&t=52s)** — Hi. Hi, Eric. Nice to see you again.
- **[00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7yszU0-Molc&t=55s)** — Very nice to see you. And we're going to talk about this because I have to give a disclaimer.
- **[01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7yszU0-Molc&t=62s)** — This is not meant to bypass your medical doctor, check with your doctor before implementing any of the things we're going to talk about.
- **[01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7yszU0-Molc&t=69s)** — We're not here to tell you we have the absolute positive guaranteed cure. Okay, we're not going to tell you that.
- **[01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7yszU0-Molc&t=77s)** — However, that being said, if I had cancer, I would want to know what I'm about to tell you because there's some fascinating information that I want to put on your radar to consider.
- **[01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7yszU0-Molc&t=89s)** — And in this presentation, we want to be very reasonable as far as make it as sane as possible and as easy to do because when someone gets cancer, they're getting so many different opinions.
- **[01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7yszU0-Molc&t=104s)** — So our thought in this presentation was to do several things at once, not to only do one thing, just to make sure we cover all bases because there's different conflicting theories.
- **[01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7yszU0-Molc&t=118s)** — You know, there's one theory that says that if you just starve the cancer off with glucose during the ketogenic diet, you'll kill the cancer off.
- **[02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7yszU0-Molc&t=127s)** — Okay. And there's another theory that states that, well, cancer can live on ketones.
- **[02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7yszU0-Molc&t=133s)** — Okay, so that conflicts with that first theory. So we have an idea to actually cover both sides of the spectrum, including if someone also wants to do some medical care.
- **[02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7yszU0-Molc&t=147s)** — We're not here to tell you what to do, but we want to tell you that there's things to look at, there's things you should consider, and there's some fascinating information that we're going to share with you today.
- **[02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7yszU0-Molc&t=159s)** — So in other words, the protocol that we want to talk about today involves even someone doing chemo.
- **[02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7yszU0-Molc&t=167s)** — Okay, so there's some research that Guy and I both worked on with a very famous competent physician researcher that we published, and we will put all those links down below.
- **[03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7yszU0-Molc&t=183s)** — We could spend an hour going through the study and put you completely asleep, but we're not going to do that because it's very tactical.
- **[03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7yszU0-Molc&t=190s)** — But to really give you the simplicity of this, a cancer cell really came from a normal cell.
- **[03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7yszU0-Molc&t=198s)** — And what happened is there's damage in the mitochondria. The body then has a Plan B to survive.
- **[03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7yszU0-Molc&t=205s)** — And so it uses more of an older ancient pathway to get its fuel. So the cancer then loses its programmed cell death and it can live forever, but it gets its energy from another source outside the mitochondria.
- **[03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7yszU0-Molc&t=218s)** — So that's kind of the nature of cancer and the cancer then can live without oxygen and it can spread and create all sorts of problems.
- **[03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7yszU0-Molc&t=229s)** — But there's some unique things that we're going to share with you today that are very important when you have cancer.
- **[03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7yszU0-Molc&t=236s)** — Okay, Guy, I want you just to briefly, you know, in a short little paragraph of information, tell us when you were first told that you had cancer six years ago, what did the doctor tell you to do about this?
- **[04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7yszU0-Molc&t=253s)** — Absolutely nothing because it was too late. They told me, enjoy the rest of your life.
- **[04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7yszU0-Molc&t=261s)** — And that's it. So they didn't propose me any treatment because it was no more treatment. My cancer was too much everywhere. And it was too late.
- **[04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7yszU0-Molc&t=276s)** — So did it spread into the bones? Did it spread into other?
- **[04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7yszU0-Molc&t=280s)** — In the bones, in the bones, in the lymph nodes, and it spread in my lungs too, a little bit. It was not a lot compared to the lymph node or to the bones, of course.
- **[04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7yszU0-Molc&t=292s)** — So that must have been frightening. And at that point, of course, you disagreed. You, I mean, the thing about Guy is he is a survivor. He basically reached out to everyone that he knew. He started to kind of get more information. And I think you flew around the world trying to find someone that could help you.
- **[05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7yszU0-Molc&t=310s)** — Yes. And what who helped me? You with your video. I already told you that. Thomas Seyfried, because I went to see him. I did a lot of fast, the prolonged fasting.
- **[05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7yszU0-Molc&t=328s)** — And I was in this moment, absolutely sure that ketones can help to kill cancer cells, because you know the autophagy. Another Nobel Prize in 2016, a Japanese guy.
- **[05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7yszU0-Molc&t=351s)** — And OK, I was, it works. It works because I'm still here. And little by little, I add a lot of things because what I still, what still scares me is the relapse.
- **[06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7yszU0-Molc&t=375s)** — Because we have a lot of people who have relapse. If we don't change the way we try to fight cancer, we are dead. We are dead.
- **[06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7yszU0-Molc&t=391s)** — Yeah. And the other thing is that I don't think you did not use any chemo, correct?
- **[06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7yszU0-Molc&t=397s)** — No, absolutely no chemo. No radiation, because they didn't propose to me because I was not different than anybody. If they told me chemo can prolong your life or save you, I will do it.
- **[06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7yszU0-Molc&t=416s)** — Of course, I was lucky. My cancer was too spread too much. Then they have no solution for me. So I start to read the publication on, I search on PubMed, on NIH, on Nature, on all the famous scientific publications.
- **[07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7yszU0-Molc&t=445s)** — I was, I had no knowledge of nothing, but I was obliged to try to learn, to understand. And when I understood what is cancer, I discovered that probably I can save my life.
- **[07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7yszU0-Molc&t=467s)** — I went to see Thomas Sieffried. He helped me a lot, explained me a lot of things. And today I would like to continue to his Guinea Pig. He proposed me to do a study.
- **[08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7yszU0-Molc&t=485s)** — Guinea Pig. Okay.
- **[08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7yszU0-Molc&t=488s)** — Guinea Pig. Yes. I would like to continue to be his Guinea Pig.
- **[08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7yszU0-Molc&t=495s)** — Yeah. Okay, good.
- **[08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7yszU0-Molc&t=499s)** — That's great because
- **[08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7yszU0-Molc&t=504s)** — obviously, Guy, you did something that was very successful. So I want to break it down what you did. Okay.
- **[08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7yszU0-Molc&t=511s)** — Now, I think probably the big difference, the big difference, the elephant in the room, the thing that was stands out the most is you did prolonged fasting.
- **[08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7yszU0-Molc&t=521s)** — Now, you have the ability to apparently fast for a long time. I mean, I think you went to, I think up to 40 days.
- **[08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7yszU0-Molc&t=531s)** — And then what you'll do on a regular basis is you might do a seven day fast and then you might do a 48 hour fast and then you might do a 72 hour fast and there's no pattern.
- **[09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7yszU0-Molc&t=541s)** — And I think that was that's smart too, because cancer tends to figure you out. And so you really have to switch things up.
- **[09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7yszU0-Molc&t=547s)** — I don't want to give a cancer a routine. Right. So I didn't know the day after what I will do tomorrow.
- **[09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7yszU0-Molc&t=556s)** — Yeah. Because perhaps my brain can, my cancer cells can read my brain. Right. So it's perhaps stupid, but I don't think so.
- **[09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7yszU0-Molc&t=566s)** — Yeah. Yeah. Cancer is very smart and it adapts and it survives like crazy.
- **[09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7yszU0-Molc&t=575s)** — So the big thing, though, is you did the long term fasting. And so if the theory of cancer can live on ketones is true.
- **[09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7yszU0-Molc&t=586s)** — And then the question is, well, if you're doing fasting, you're living on ketones. But there is also data that show that those ketones are different than the ketones you get from the diet.
- **[10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7yszU0-Molc&t=601s)** — So and there's a lot of other things that happen when you go fasting as far as the survival proteins, all sorts of tumor suppressor genes kick in.
- **[10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7yszU0-Molc&t=611s)** — There's a lot of things that happen when you do fasting, prolonged fasting and and also the strength of the immune system.
- **[10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7yszU0-Molc&t=616s)** — And also, if someone does chemo, the tolerance for that chemo goes up. And so people have less symptoms.
- **[10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7yszU0-Molc&t=626s)** — And so as I get a lot of emails, you get a lot of emails from people asking questions about cancer.
- **[10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7yszU0-Molc&t=632s)** — So we just wanted to lay out a lot of these questions and answers in this presentation.
- **[10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7yszU0-Molc&t=637s)** — Even now, 99.9% of all my cancer videos, I had to get them off YouTube and put them on Rumble.
- **[10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7yszU0-Molc&t=646s)** — This one is a bit conservative, and we're just going to talk about some concepts.
- **[10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7yszU0-Molc&t=651s)** — So one of the normal things that happens in our bodies, if we have strong mitochondria, is this interesting process of the cell.
- **[11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7yszU0-Molc&t=661s)** — If it's damaged, it actually ends up committing suicide to get rid of the cell, which is fascinating.
- **[11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7yszU0-Molc&t=668s)** — But it takes a lot of energy. So when there's mitochondrial damage, it doesn't have enough energy.
- **[11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7yszU0-Molc&t=674s)** — Apoptosis stops working to a certain degree. That has a lot to do with this whole cancer transition, which I'm not going to get too into the woods.
- **[11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7yszU0-Molc&t=682s)** — But I will say that you have people that can do fasting. You have people that can't do fasting.
- **[11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7yszU0-Molc&t=688s)** — You have people that are really, really frail and skinny. And if you put them on a long fast, I mean, they're going to lose all their muscles.
- **[11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7yszU0-Molc&t=695s)** — Then you get other people that can have some muscle to lose with some prolonged fasting.
- **[11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7yszU0-Molc&t=700s)** — So it's really going to be a judgment call. So what we're going to recommend, if you can't do fasting,
- **[11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7yszU0-Molc&t=707s)** — what you can do is what's called the fasting mimicking diet by Walter Lange. And he came up with that.
- **[11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7yszU0-Molc&t=715s)** — And, you know, we're not recommending the version where you're taking supplements like the food supplements.
- **[12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7yszU0-Molc&t=722s)** — The one that we're going to recommend is the is kind of a version of his own initial program.
- **[12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7yszU0-Molc&t=728s)** — And basically you're going to do for five days, you're going to go on a special eating plan that will mimic fasting, but it's not complete fasting
- **[12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7yszU0-Molc&t=739s)** — because it's a lot easier to mimic fasting than actually do the fasting program. You can go five days.
- **[12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7yszU0-Molc&t=745s)** — Now, when Guy does the fasting, he feels good. He can do it. Other people I've had try to do prolonged fast and they feel like crap.
- **[12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7yszU0-Molc&t=754s)** — And they just, you know, they haven't adapted yet. And, you know, it's tougher. So we're going to give you options. Right.
- **[12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7yszU0-Molc&t=760s)** — And so this fasting mimicking diet, you're going to get your calories down to like 800 calories a day.
- **[12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7yszU0-Molc&t=766s)** — And maybe the first day you do a thousand and then the next four days you'll do 800 calories.
- **[12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7yszU0-Molc&t=774s)** — And so to keep this really simple, what we're going to recommend is to do just vegetables, salad, steamed vegetables, steamed cruciferous vegetables, high quality extra virgin olive oil.
- **[13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7yszU0-Molc&t=788s)** — So that way you have something that you can it can be satisfying.
- **[13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7yszU0-Molc&t=794s)** — And plus you have all the phytochemicals from in the plants that can actually are anti carcinogenic.
- **[13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7yszU0-Molc&t=801s)** — So you can use herbs and all this detail we're going to put in this document that you'll be able to download.
- **[13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7yszU0-Molc&t=807s)** — But you can have herbs definitely have sea salt. There's there's going to be a supplement protocol that we're going to recommend.
- **[13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7yszU0-Molc&t=813s)** — We don't sell any of those supplements, just so you know, but these are going to do a certain thing.
- **[13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7yszU0-Molc&t=818s)** — But as far as the foods go, it's going to be basically vegetable and extra virgin olive oil and herbs.
- **[13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7yszU0-Molc&t=824s)** — You can do teas and you can make that in the soup. But that's it. That's it.
- **[13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7yszU0-Molc&t=829s)** — We're not recommending a lot of protein or any protein or other types of fats because what we want to do is we want to create a hormonal shift to really make sure that this
- **[14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7yszU0-Molc&t=841s)** — will leverage the fuel for this cancer to the point where it just doesn't have anything to live on and it can shrink and go away.
- **[14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7yszU0-Molc&t=849s)** — And you do that for five days. Now, let's say you're going to do chemo and usually do it for every third week.
- **[14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7yszU0-Molc&t=857s)** — So you would do this program every three weeks right before the chemo and through the chemo and right after because you're going to find that if you do this,
- **[14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7yszU0-Molc&t=866s)** — there's going to be a lot less complications and symptoms with your chemo.
- **[14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7yszU0-Molc&t=871s)** — But let's say you're not going to do chemo, then you would do this once a month.
- **[14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7yszU0-Molc&t=876s)** — And we'll also explain what to do on the other days. You want to eat clean and you want to get enough protein and other nutrition.
- **[14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7yszU0-Molc&t=885s)** — So you're basically doing a decent, prolonged fast once a month or once every three weeks.
- **[14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7yszU0-Molc&t=893s)** — Now, the more severe the cancer, the more frequent you should do this.
- **[15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7yszU0-Molc&t=900s)** — And if you can fast, you should probably fast and do exactly what Guy's doing. In fact, I mean, it's been six years.
- **[15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7yszU0-Molc&t=909s)** — And as soon as Guy found out that his cancer was no longer there, do you think he just stopped this protocol?
- **[15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7yszU0-Molc&t=915s)** — No, he's even do it right now. He started another 21 day fast.
- **[15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7yszU0-Molc&t=925s)** — So in other words, we can learn a lot about people that are successful.
- **[15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7yszU0-Molc&t=930s)** — And that's what we want to do is let other people learn from other people, right? Especially the ones that are successful.
- **[15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7yszU0-Molc&t=936s)** — And I have friends that have cancer that are going different directions.
- **[15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7yszU0-Molc&t=942s)** — And, you know, it's the bottom line is I always like to follow people that are successful and that are doing it.
- **[15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7yszU0-Molc&t=950s)** — And this guy here, he's still alive. He should have been dead six years ago.
- **[15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7yszU0-Molc&t=954s)** — So it's quite miraculous. So there's a lot of people looking at him closely under a magnifying glass to see what he's doing.
- **[16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7yszU0-Molc&t=961s)** — But fasting is important. If you can't do the fasting, do the fasting mimicking program.
- **[16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7yszU0-Molc&t=965s)** — Okay, so once a month, five days. And then the other days, if you could do OMAD one meal a day, that would be great.
- **[16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7yszU0-Molc&t=976s)** — But you're going to have to get all your calories and your nutrition.
- **[16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7yszU0-Molc&t=979s)** — And we do, of course, there's several key foods that are going to be important, like sardines, right?
- **[16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7yszU0-Molc&t=988s)** — Cruciferous. Cruciferous vegetables, a lot of garlic, things like that.
- **[16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7yszU0-Molc&t=994s)** — Green tea. Green tea. So let's go into the next part of this right here.
- **[16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7yszU0-Molc&t=999s)** — What kind of protocol? Well, based on the research that we did, led by Maurice Israel,
- **[16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7yszU0-Molc&t=1007s)** — you know, there's been a longstanding series of investigations into this. And just to keep it really simple.
- **[16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7yszU0-Molc&t=1017s)** — The theory that cancer can survive on ketones. Okay, so we're going to talk about that for a second.
- **[17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7yszU0-Molc&t=1022s)** — Some people will disagree with it. Some people will agree with it.
- **[17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7yszU0-Molc&t=1026s)** — But what we did is we did a mice study, put them on a protocol, a natural protocol,
- **[17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7yszU0-Molc&t=1032s)** — to block a certain enzyme that would starve the cancer from getting ketones. Okay?
- **[17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7yszU0-Molc&t=1042s)** — And this enzyme is called SCOT. I'm not going to give you the long name of it because you don't know it.
- **[17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7yszU0-Molc&t=1046s)** — But SCOT is an enzyme that allows this cancer cell to get ketones.
- **[17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7yszU0-Molc&t=1053s)** — So there's been a lot of experiments to figure out what would be the best SCOT inhibitors.
- **[17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7yszU0-Molc&t=1058s)** — And we wanted to use natural things that you could get that don't have toxic effects.
- **[17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7yszU0-Molc&t=1064s)** — And the research that we did showed a remarkable, significant improvement.
- **[17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7yszU0-Molc&t=1068s)** — And you can read up for yourself on what happened. But this was on animals, wasn't on humans.
- **[17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7yszU0-Molc&t=1075s)** — Okay? But still, I mean, it's very interesting to look at. And it's a starting point.
- **[18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7yszU0-Molc&t=1081s)** — So this SCOT inhibitor protocol, it uses about, I would say, seven or eight different natural remedies.
- **[18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7yszU0-Molc&t=1093s)** — And instead of going through each one and telling you the dosage,
- **[18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7yszU0-Molc&t=1096s)** — we're just going to have all that in writing for you so you can just look it up and take it.
- **[18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7yszU0-Molc&t=1101s)** — But some of these remedies addresses the SCOT inhibitor directly.
- **[18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7yszU0-Molc&t=1107s)** — Some handle various aspects of this, like one blocks glutamine.
- **[18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7yszU0-Molc&t=1114s)** — It's kind of a natural down inhibitor. And this is what Dr. Seyfried uses in his protocols.
- **[18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7yszU0-Molc&t=1121s)** — So we're using it. It's like a green tea extract.
- **[18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7yszU0-Molc&t=1125s)** — Absolutely. Yeah. So that's a really good protocol.
- **[18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7yszU0-Molc&t=1127s)** — And there's another one, allicin from garlic extract that helps another pathway with cancer.
- **[18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7yszU0-Molc&t=1136s)** — And so in other words, what we think is reasonable is to try a lot of different angles to this all at once,
- **[19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7yszU0-Molc&t=1145s)** — because there's a lot of things that will shrink the tumor.
- **[19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7yszU0-Molc&t=1149s)** — But then how do we really hit it from different angles?
- **[19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7yszU0-Molc&t=1153s)** — Just when you think you got it figured out, there's this other thing that happens that the cancer goes back.
- **[19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7yszU0-Molc&t=1157s)** — So the combination of doing this fasting mimicking program or an actual fast with the SCOT inhibitors with a couple other things,
- **[19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7yszU0-Molc&t=1166s)** — which we'll mention, I think this would be the most reasonable way to address cancer.
- **[19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7yszU0-Molc&t=1171s)** — What I discovered, it's not me, that it's cancer find always a way.
- **[19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7yszU0-Molc&t=1180s)** — When you try to find something to fight cancer and it works the day after or one year after, it doesn't work anymore.
- **[19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7yszU0-Molc&t=1191s)** — So that's why I try to find a way to avoid relapse.
- **[20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7yszU0-Molc&t=1200s)** — And I know that ketones saved me the first time.
- **[20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7yszU0-Molc&t=1207s)** — We had a friend, his name was Fred, and he developed cancer.
- **[20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7yszU0-Molc&t=1214s)** — He cured his cancer, but he has relapsed.
- **[20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7yszU0-Molc&t=1220s)** — And one year after, he died.
- **[20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7yszU0-Molc&t=1224s)** — So it's very disturbing for me.
- **[20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7yszU0-Molc&t=1228s)** — And I said, because I did the same thing than you, than him.
- **[20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7yszU0-Molc&t=1233s)** — So I started searching another way to cure cancer in case if the cancer tried another way.
- **[20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7yszU0-Molc&t=1248s)** — If the cancer finds a way to eat ketones, what I have to do to avoid that?
- **[20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7yszU0-Molc&t=1256s)** — So we searched, we studied the result of a lot of people who explained to me.
- **[21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7yszU0-Molc&t=1268s)** — We spoke with me, they called me, they asked me.
- **[21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7yszU0-Molc&t=1274s)** — And we discovered that perhaps there is another way to cure cancer.
- **[21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7yszU0-Molc&t=1283s)** — We know that there are a lot of things who give cancer.
- **[21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7yszU0-Molc&t=1288s)** — And we are sure that there are a lot of things that can cure cancer.
- **[21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7yszU0-Molc&t=1295s)** — And the things to have a lot of protocols, different protocols, in case if one is not working, it's very important.
- **[21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7yszU0-Molc&t=1307s)** — But if we don't search before, it's too late.
- **[21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7yszU0-Molc&t=1313s)** — So what I try to do is to have ideas to what I have to do if today what was working before doesn't work anymore.
- **[22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7yszU0-Molc&t=1328s)** — Exactly. And then just to piggyback on that, there are several things that are very important to avoid when you have cancer.
- **[22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7yszU0-Molc&t=1340s)** — Number one is iron. Make sure you're not taking iron in any supplements.
- **[22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7yszU0-Molc&t=1344s)** — Iron can feed the cancer. If cancer likes to eat iron, they use it.
- **[22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7yszU0-Molc&t=1350s)** — Calcium. Don't take any calcium supplements when you have cancer. That's another one that is not recommended.
- **[22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7yszU0-Molc&t=1356s)** — In fact, probably not have any dairy. Dairy is more anabolic, so it tends to make things grow.
- **[22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7yszU0-Molc&t=1363s)** — So avoid the dairy. As far as taking vitamin D, I think that would be super important because vitamin D feeds the immune system.
- **[22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7yszU0-Molc&t=1373s)** — So we want to keep your immune system really, really strong. There's so many different types of cancer that are linked to a vitamin D deficiency as far as triggering or lowering your immune system or adding more risk.
- **[23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7yszU0-Molc&t=1388s)** — I mean, you take a lot of cancer patients. They nearly always have low vitamin D levels.
- **[23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7yszU0-Molc&t=1394s)** — As far as exercise goes, it would probably be good to do walking but not do high type intense exercise when you're doing either a long prolonged fasting, unless you're really healthy.
- **[23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7yszU0-Molc&t=1408s)** — Or if you're doing...
- **[23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7yszU0-Molc&t=1410s)** — Not too lazy.
- **[23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7yszU0-Molc&t=1411s)** — Right. But long walks are going to be good in the sun, getting sun, getting... you'll get melatonin from the infrared.
- **[23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7yszU0-Molc&t=1423s)** — I would like to precise something very important for me.
- **[24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7yszU0-Molc&t=1440s)** — Thomas Seyfried, Professor Thomas Seyfried, helped me a lot. He explained me a lot of things and he helped me to save my life.
- **[24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7yszU0-Molc&t=1450s)** — And what I try to do today, it's not to say I'm a better biologist than Thomas Seyfried.
- **[24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7yszU0-Molc&t=1464s)** — I have no knowledge at all.
- **[24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7yszU0-Molc&t=1468s)** — But I think if my cancer comes back, what I have to do to save my life. If the cancer finds a way to eat my ketones, what I have to do. It's only this. It's only this. And I need to be prepared.
- **[24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7yszU0-Molc&t=1492s)** — Exactly. And on that note, we're going to put a link down below of where you can get the summary of what we talked about.
- **[24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7yszU0-Molc&t=1499s)** — So if you want to just study the information and share it, but I at least want to put this on your radar that...
- **[25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7yszU0-Molc&t=1505s)** — I don't know, if I had cancer, I would want to know this data. There's a lot of very interesting things that we're in the middle of right now with doing more research.
- **[25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7yszU0-Molc&t=1515s)** — But we're not going to get into them quite yet. We're going to wait till we get that done.
- **[25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7yszU0-Molc&t=1520s)** — But anyway, I want to thank you for being on Guy. And thank you for watching this long. We'll put the link down below and stay tuned for more information on this topic.
- **[25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7yszU0-Molc&t=1531s)** — Thank you, Dr. Berg. I'm sure we will continue to fight to find the best solution against cancer.
- **[25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7yszU0-Molc&t=1539s)** — Great.

- **[00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MuVMHPuXWAQ&t=0s)** — I want to show you something. You see this book right here? This is an endocrinology book.
- **[00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MuVMHPuXWAQ&t=4s)** — On page 84, we have this body type right here. And you can see this round face. I used to have this.
- **[00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MuVMHPuXWAQ&t=11s)** — I mean, my face was round, it was swollen, I had puffiness underneath my eyes. I had no idea it was
- **[00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MuVMHPuXWAQ&t=16s)** — not normal until I got rid of it. And I'm like, oh my gosh, that wasn't normal. So today I'm
- **[00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MuVMHPuXWAQ&t=21s)** — going to show you exactly what this is and how to get rid of it pretty simply. But this
- **[00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MuVMHPuXWAQ&t=26s)** — particular picture is in the chapter on a condition called Cushing's syndrome. And one of the symptoms
- **[00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MuVMHPuXWAQ&t=34s)** — is moon face. Now Cushing's syndrome is basically high levels of cortisol. And cortisol is a stress
- **[00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MuVMHPuXWAQ&t=40s)** — hormone. Now with cortisol, you have your body's production of cortisol. And if it's too high
- **[00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MuVMHPuXWAQ&t=45s)** — over a long period of time, that could be the problem. Or you're taking a medication that's a
- **[00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MuVMHPuXWAQ&t=49s)** — synthetic version of cortisol. It's called prednisone. And in fact, if you've ever seen
- **[00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MuVMHPuXWAQ&t=53s)** — picture of Jerry Lewis, when he took prednisone, his face just swoll up like that. And what's also
- **[00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MuVMHPuXWAQ&t=58s)** — interesting is I had prednisone every single year for probably 10 years straight, starting
- **[01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MuVMHPuXWAQ&t=64s)** — in my 20s and my 30s from getting this darn poison ivy every year. So whether that contributed
- **[01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MuVMHPuXWAQ&t=69s)** — to it or something else, I'm not exactly 100% sure. But I do want to share what I know on
- **[01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MuVMHPuXWAQ&t=73s)** — this topic. Now what's interesting about cortisol is cortisol has the power to redistribute
- **[01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MuVMHPuXWAQ&t=78s)** — where the fat goes in the body. It starts going around the face and in this part right here
- **[01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MuVMHPuXWAQ&t=84s)** — called the midsection. So belly fat. Sometimes over time, if you start getting that buffalo
- **[01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MuVMHPuXWAQ&t=89s)** — hump on the back there, and also red cheeks, thinner legs, weak muscles in the legs,
- **[01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MuVMHPuXWAQ&t=95s)** — especially the thigh muscle, you start losing the glutamous maximus, the butt muscle right
- **[01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MuVMHPuXWAQ&t=100s)** — here. Other things that happen is your cholesterol and your lipids start going higher.
- **[01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MuVMHPuXWAQ&t=104s)** — You start losing potassium and retaining sodium. So there goes your blood pressure. It's going
- **[01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MuVMHPuXWAQ&t=110s)** — to go straight up. What's also interesting is your vitamin D level goes down. The immune
- **[01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MuVMHPuXWAQ&t=113s)** — system usually suffers and they've even tested cortisol levels. And when people get emotionally
- **[01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MuVMHPuXWAQ&t=118s)** — upset, the cortisol goes straight up and vertical. So if someone is always or chronically
- **[02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MuVMHPuXWAQ&t=124s)** — emotionally upset, they're going to have high levels of cortisol. This next part is very
- **[02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MuVMHPuXWAQ&t=128s)** — interesting because the cortisol itself is not causing the face to look like a moon face.
- **[02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MuVMHPuXWAQ&t=135s)** — It's indirectly doing it. That hormone starts to break down your own proteins,
- **[02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MuVMHPuXWAQ&t=140s)** — starting with your thigh muscles and your butt muscle. And it turns that into glucose or
- **[02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MuVMHPuXWAQ&t=146s)** — sugar. And that's coming from a protein. And so your body is making new sugar, not out of
- **[02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MuVMHPuXWAQ&t=153s)** — the dietary sugar. I mean, this does not just happen in women. It happens in men,
- **[02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MuVMHPuXWAQ&t=157s)** — you can see the adrenal glands are basically flooding the midsection with cortisol. And
- **[02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MuVMHPuXWAQ&t=164s)** — then that turns into sugar and then fat. So insulin is a fat storing hormone. And the
- **[02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MuVMHPuXWAQ&t=169s)** — presence of just a little bit too much insulin, you're not going to be able to lose fat.
- **[02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MuVMHPuXWAQ&t=174s)** — And you go to the doctor and they might say, well, you just need to lose weight,
- **[02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MuVMHPuXWAQ&t=177s)** — right? Lose weight, go on a diet. But stress can activate insulin. People have high
- **[03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MuVMHPuXWAQ&t=183s)** — levels of insulin. They get something called metabolic syndrome. What is that? That is a
- **[03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MuVMHPuXWAQ&t=187s)** — combination of high cholesterol, hypertension, and high blood glucose. All of that comes from
- **[03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MuVMHPuXWAQ&t=195s)** — too much insulin. Overexercising. Now I had this lady come to my office once and I had to do a
- **[03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MuVMHPuXWAQ&t=199s)** — little exercise and her pulse rate went up to 150. Okay. And then I had her come back the
- **[03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MuVMHPuXWAQ&t=204s)** — next day. The pulse rate was still at 150. I was like, what the heck? Her recovery was
- **[03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MuVMHPuXWAQ&t=210s)** — terrible. And that was a situation because typically in a healthy body, you'll raise the
- **[03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MuVMHPuXWAQ&t=216s)** — pulse rate and it comes down. So if someone like that with poor recovery would continue to
- **[03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MuVMHPuXWAQ&t=222s)** — exercise every day, it would just create a tremendous amount of stress and cortisol in
- **[03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MuVMHPuXWAQ&t=228s)** — the body. But also lack of sleep will raise your cortisol. Think about this. When you don't
- **[03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MuVMHPuXWAQ&t=232s)** — sleep, you're hungry. Your appetite goes up. But boy, when you get a good night's rest,
- **[03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MuVMHPuXWAQ&t=237s)** — oh my gosh, you're not hungry as much. Cravings go away. You're doing great. And
- **[04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MuVMHPuXWAQ&t=241s)** — you have something like surgery and trauma and being in pain can also increase cortisol. Not to
- **[04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MuVMHPuXWAQ&t=248s)** — mention alcohol and even certain medications. All right. So those are the triggers. But now
- **[04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MuVMHPuXWAQ&t=252s)** — what about insulin? What increases insulin? Carbohydrates. This is a really big confusion
- **[04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MuVMHPuXWAQ&t=256s)** — with carbohydrates because when you do keto, okay, ketogenic diet, this is basically you're
- **[04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MuVMHPuXWAQ&t=262s)** — getting your body to burn fat. They will tell you to reduce your carbs below 50 grams.
- **[04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MuVMHPuXWAQ&t=268s)** — There's a lot of confusion what a carb is. A carb makes up several things. One is fiber. Fiber
- **[04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MuVMHPuXWAQ&t=274s)** — is a carbohydrate. Sugar is a carbohydrate. But if we take something like this, right, this is a
- **[04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MuVMHPuXWAQ&t=280s)** — Pop-Tart, okay. And we look at the total carbs. We have 78 carbs and then we have 42
- **[04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MuVMHPuXWAQ&t=289s)** — sugars. Okay, so a sugar is a carb. And if we deduct the fiber and the sugar from the carb,
- **[04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MuVMHPuXWAQ&t=295s)** — it leaves us with 34 additional grams of something. What is that something? A lot of people don't
- **[05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MuVMHPuXWAQ&t=303s)** — know what that is. Well, that something is starch. Usually when you're talking about
- **[05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MuVMHPuXWAQ&t=308s)** — junk food, you're talking about something like this starch, cornstarch. This is why it's so
- **[05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MuVMHPuXWAQ&t=313s)** — important to read the ingredients, okay, not just this other thing right here, but the
- **[05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MuVMHPuXWAQ&t=317s)** — ingredients to see what you're eating. But there's some other things that can increase
- **[05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MuVMHPuXWAQ&t=322s)** — insulin that you need to know about. Frequent eating. If you're snacking a lot, you're raising
- **[05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MuVMHPuXWAQ&t=328s)** — insulin. But what if it's not carbohydrates? Doesn't matter. If you're eating, you're going
- **[05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MuVMHPuXWAQ&t=332s)** — to raise insulin to a certain degree. And so the frequency of eating is a killer. Seed oils,
- **[05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MuVMHPuXWAQ&t=339s)** — soy, corn, canola, cottonseed, safflower, sunflower seed, those can actually really mess up
- **[05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MuVMHPuXWAQ&t=346s)** — your insulin as well. These next few are very interesting. Nutrient deficiencies, like a
- **[05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MuVMHPuXWAQ&t=351s)** — B1 deficiency, magnesium deficiency, and a vitamin D deficiency can all indirectly start
- **[05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MuVMHPuXWAQ&t=358s)** — elevating insulin because those are the key nutrients that allow insulin to work. And when
- **[06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MuVMHPuXWAQ&t=363s)** — you're deficient, you have more problems with that hormone. And of course, the last one is
- **[06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MuVMHPuXWAQ&t=368s)** — medications, especially by taking insulin. They used to do what's called insulin shock
- **[06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MuVMHPuXWAQ&t=373s)** — therapy. Wow, insulin shock therapy. What is that? They would inject people with tremendous
- **[06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MuVMHPuXWAQ&t=377s)** — of insulin, put them in a coma, wake them up a few weeks later as their therapy for mental
- **[06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MuVMHPuXWAQ&t=383s)** — illness, and they would wake up fat. Incredible. They used to do that. Okay, so what do we do to
- **[06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MuVMHPuXWAQ&t=388s)** — to get the face back to normal? Okay, because it's not that your bones are round like that.
- **[06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MuVMHPuXWAQ&t=394s)** — Your face has layers of fat on it. So the first thing to do is to start eating less
- **[06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MuVMHPuXWAQ&t=400s)** — frequently by cutting out the snacks between the meals. That alone will be huge. Okay,
- **[06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MuVMHPuXWAQ&t=406s)** — then what you need to do is do intermittent fasting, which is you're going to start reducing
- **[06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MuVMHPuXWAQ&t=411s)** — the number of meals. I would recommend starting out with two meals a day. And when you wake up
- **[06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MuVMHPuXWAQ&t=415s)** — in the morning, try to go as long as you can before you eat the first meal. Okay, and then
- **[06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MuVMHPuXWAQ&t=419s)** — maybe it's like 11 o'clock or even 12. Have your first meal and then have your dinner. Now
- **[07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MuVMHPuXWAQ&t=425s)** — you're at two meals a day. That's going to be huge because you're going to allow your body
- **[07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MuVMHPuXWAQ&t=428s)** — to fast. And when you're fasting, you're forcing your body to reduce insulin and use
- **[07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MuVMHPuXWAQ&t=435s)** — your own fat as fuel. Because what we want to do is we want to force our body to use up the
- **[07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MuVMHPuXWAQ&t=440s)** — fat around our face, which will come off first before the belly. So it's not going to take long
- **[07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MuVMHPuXWAQ&t=446s)** — to reshape the face. If you ever look at a diabetic that's just filled with sugar in their
- **[07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MuVMHPuXWAQ&t=449s)** — blood, they're just waterlogged, especially in their lower legs. So when you do this,
- **[07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MuVMHPuXWAQ&t=453s)** — you're going to lose a lot of water weight initially. Probably 11 pounds of water weight in
- **[07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MuVMHPuXWAQ&t=457s)** — the first week or two. And then your weight loss is going to be down and you're going to
- **[07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MuVMHPuXWAQ&t=460s)** — think, oh my gosh, I'm not losing weight anymore. No, no, you have to get rid of the
- **[07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MuVMHPuXWAQ&t=464s)** — water first and then you'll start burning more fat, which is a lot less. You can't burn 11
- **[07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MuVMHPuXWAQ&t=468s)** — pounds of fat per week. The most it's going to be two pounds. But for most people, it might be
- **[07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MuVMHPuXWAQ&t=474s)** — one pound a week. So that's intermittent fasting. And then number two, you want to
- **[07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MuVMHPuXWAQ&t=478s)** — start changing the diet. You want to start cutting down the carbs, very specifically,
- **[08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MuVMHPuXWAQ&t=483s)** — sugar and starches. If you want a little card cutout that you can put in your wallet
- **[08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MuVMHPuXWAQ&t=488s)** — to show you what to avoid, I'll put the link down below. Okay, you just print it out,
- **[08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MuVMHPuXWAQ&t=493s)** — cut it out, put it in your wallet and now you can see what you should avoid. Number three,
- **[08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MuVMHPuXWAQ&t=498s)** — increase your protein. Your body needs a certain amount of protein to really fix all these
- **[08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MuVMHPuXWAQ&t=504s)** — issues. Plant source protein powders and all that stuff. It doesn't really work. You need
- **[08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MuVMHPuXWAQ&t=508s)** — like a high quality meat protein. And the highest quality meat that you could possibly eat
- **[08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MuVMHPuXWAQ&t=514s)** — is grass fed. It can be beef, it could be lamb, it could be goat, but grass fed is what
- **[08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MuVMHPuXWAQ&t=520s)** — you want to do. Number four, stress. Okay, long walks every day. Your exercise program should be
- **[08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MuVMHPuXWAQ&t=526s)** — not too frequent if you're doing higher intensity. I would do also things like physical work because
- **[08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MuVMHPuXWAQ&t=532s)** — you're taking your mind off something versus walking on a treadmill reading your cell phone.
- **[08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MuVMHPuXWAQ&t=536s)** — I really think the cell phone stresses people out more than anything. So you have to take
- **[09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MuVMHPuXWAQ&t=540s)** — part of the day and just put it to the side. Go for your walk without any cell phone,
- **[09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MuVMHPuXWAQ&t=544s)** — anything because these cell phones give off EMF waves, electromagnetic fields, and that can raise
- **[09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MuVMHPuXWAQ&t=551s)** — cortisol. And then the last thing, and this is really important, is try to get some extra
- **[09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MuVMHPuXWAQ&t=555s)** — sleep. Even if you wake up in the middle of the night, go back to bed and try to sleep
- **[09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MuVMHPuXWAQ&t=561s)** — in a little bit. That'll be so, so important. I used to really push it and think I can get
- **[09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MuVMHPuXWAQ&t=566s)** — away with it. I'd get up at four. Now I sleep in more, so I'm trying to get like eight
- **[09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MuVMHPuXWAQ&t=571s)** — hours of sleep. I should have done that a long time ago. I highly recommend it. I know people
- **[09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MuVMHPuXWAQ&t=576s)** — have to get a lot of stuff done, but the sleep will allow you to focus and it keeps you a lot
- **[09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MuVMHPuXWAQ&t=582s)** — healthier. So lastly, click the link down below to get that little card so you can cut it
- **[09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MuVMHPuXWAQ&t=586s)** — out and keep it in your wallet and it'll make things really easy.

- **[00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Wd5a4veej8&t=0s)** — Today I'm going to show you how to cleanse your liver within three days.
- **[00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Wd5a4veej8&t=5s)** — I've done every single cleanse that has ever been invented.
- **[00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Wd5a4veej8&t=10s)** — And I'm going to tell you many many cleanses that I've done. I've gotten sick.
- **[00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Wd5a4veej8&t=14s)** — I start the cleanse and then I'm in bed for two weeks.
- **[00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Wd5a4veej8&t=17s)** — This particular liver cleanse that I'm going to talk about is very different
- **[00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Wd5a4veej8&t=21s)** — than my usual cleanses that I talk about in a lot of other videos where I'm talking about
- **[00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Wd5a4veej8&t=26s)** — drinking apple cider vinegar, lemon drinks, ginger, but they're not going to even produce
- **[00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Wd5a4veej8&t=32s)** — close in results of what I'm going to show you today.
- **[00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Wd5a4veej8&t=35s)** — The question is how does your liver actually clean the body?
- **[00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Wd5a4veej8&t=40s)** — What are the things that are the most powerful so we can speed this process up?
- **[00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Wd5a4veej8&t=44s)** — We have the detoxification of the poisons and chemicals, whether it's medication,
- **[00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Wd5a4veej8&t=49s)** — the chemicals in your food, alcohol, etc.
- **[00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Wd5a4veej8&t=53s)** — And then you have also the cleaning of all the dead cells, the waste,
- **[00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Wd5a4veej8&t=58s)** — the pathogens that are in your body. If you've ever taken biology,
- **[01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Wd5a4veej8&t=62s)** — this is a cell and inside the cell you have these different things.
- **[01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Wd5a4veej8&t=66s)** — And this little thing right here is the garbage disposal of the cell.
- **[01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Wd5a4veej8&t=71s)** — That's called a lysosome. A lysosome is the little incinerator,
- **[01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Wd5a4veej8&t=77s)** — the garbage disposal that burns up the waste and cleans up the dead cell.
- **[01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Wd5a4veej8&t=83s)** — And it actually helps recycle dead cells and pathogens like microbes and viruses and bacteria
- **[01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Wd5a4veej8&t=90s)** — and fungus and turns all that into new cells. So that whole process is called autophagy.
- **[01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Wd5a4veej8&t=98s)** — So the body is actually eating some of its own tissue and it's recycling this waste into new
- **[01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Wd5a4veej8&t=105s)** — cells. So let's go through the seven things that trigger autophagy, starting with the
- **[01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Wd5a4veej8&t=110s)** — maybe the weakest trigger to autophagy. And that would be certain
- **[01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Wd5a4veej8&t=115s)** — phytonutrients. It has a mild effect of triggering this autophagy, this recycling effect.
- **[02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Wd5a4veej8&t=120s)** — Then number six, we get the ketogenic diet, cutting down your carbohydrates.
- **[02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Wd5a4veej8&t=125s)** — Then number five, we get into exercise. Exercise will trigger autophagy. Then we get
- **[02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Wd5a4veej8&t=130s)** — into sleep. Okay, when you sleep, you go through this process. Then we get into calorie restriction.
- **[02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Wd5a4veej8&t=138s)** — Okay, when you cut down your calories, that also helps this process to occur. And then
- **[02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Wd5a4veej8&t=144s)** — number two, we have water fasting. And water fasting is basically you're not eating anything
- **[02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Wd5a4veej8&t=149s)** — except you're drinking water. But there's one additional thing that is three times more
- **[02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Wd5a4veej8&t=157s)** — than water fasting. And that is... are you sitting down?
- **[02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Wd5a4veej8&t=164s)** — Dry fasting. No food in no water. Dry fasting hands down is probably one of the most
- **[02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Wd5a4veej8&t=172s)** — powerful things you can do to stimulate autophagy and truly cleanse the cells.
- **[02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Wd5a4veej8&t=179s)** — And I'm not talking about doing dry fasting for 12 days. Okay, that's for a different video.
- **[03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Wd5a4veej8&t=184s)** — I'm talking about doing dry fasting for only a day. So in other words, you start dry fasting,
- **[03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Wd5a4veej8&t=190s)** — sunrise, and then you stop at sunset. And at first, I didn't think there was anything to this.
- **[03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Wd5a4veej8&t=196s)** — But the more I got into it, I'm like, wow, this is incredible. Because one day of dry
- **[03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Wd5a4veej8&t=203s)** — fasting is equivalent to three days of water fasting. You've probably been told that you
- **[03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Wd5a4veej8&t=209s)** — only survive three days without water. I'm not going to get into that in this video,
- **[03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Wd5a4veej8&t=215s)** — but that's a complete myth. That's absolutely not true. And that's just because when you
- **[03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Wd5a4veej8&t=219s)** — stop drinking water, what happens is your fat cells, as they're burned, start releasing a lot
- **[03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Wd5a4veej8&t=227s)** — of water. But my whole point on this is we're only talking about 12 hours of not drinking
- **[03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Wd5a4veej8&t=231s)** — water. Okay, so you're going to be fine. You're going to greatly enhance your immune
- **[03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Wd5a4veej8&t=236s)** — system. Another benefit is your kidneys and your liver finally have a chance to rest.
- **[04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Wd5a4veej8&t=244s)** — Sometimes we have this idea that we have to drink all this water to flush the toxins out.
- **[04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Wd5a4veej8&t=250s)** — Right? Guess what you're doing all day long when you're drinking a lot of water?
- **[04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Wd5a4veej8&t=253s)** — You're peeing. Okay, so you're causing your kidneys to work really hard to get rid of this
- **[04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Wd5a4veej8&t=259s)** — extra water. Another cool benefit is mental clarity. You're going to grow new brain cells
- **[04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Wd5a4veej8&t=264s)** — when you do this. And another big benefit is your inflammation is going to come down.
- **[04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Wd5a4veej8&t=269s)** — And what's also cool about this is you're going to go to sleep and you're going to get
- **[04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Wd5a4veej8&t=274s)** — more hours of dry fasting as well. This second part involves getting rid of
- **[04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Wd5a4veej8&t=282s)** — toxins, poisons, chemicals. And this happens in the liver. It happens in the kidney. It
- **[04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Wd5a4veej8&t=287s)** — happens in different parts of the body as well. You have these enzymes that go through
- **[04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Wd5a4veej8&t=292s)** — series of steps that take the poisons and then they break them down to the point where they're
- **[05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Wd5a4veej8&t=300s)** — harmless. And so this program is kind of like what's called OMAD, which is one meal a day.
- **[05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Wd5a4veej8&t=304s)** — What are you going to eat that one meal of the day? And by the way, you'll eat that
- **[05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Wd5a4veej8&t=309s)** — when the sun sets. You're just going to eat two things. Some type of cruciferous vegetable
- **[05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Wd5a4veej8&t=314s)** — and you're going to eat meat. Well, what is a cruciferous vegetable? Broccoli,
- **[05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Wd5a4veej8&t=319s)** — Brussels sprouts, cauliflower, arugula. Now you can do broccoli sprouts and that's going to be
- **[05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Wd5a4veej8&t=328s)** — 20 to 50 times stronger than adult broccoli. And you can have that in a salad. That would be
- **[05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Wd5a4veej8&t=333s)** — considered a great thing. You can do kale or even blend kale and you drink that as a shake.
- **[05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Wd5a4veej8&t=340s)** — Then you get something called bok choy. And then the other thing that I consume a lot is
- **[05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Wd5a4veej8&t=344s)** — different forms. Raw sauerkraut is really awesome because it's fermented. So then we get to the
- **[05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Wd5a4veej8&t=350s)** — meat part. Now meat is loaded with certain amino acids, which are the building blocks of protein.
- **[05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Wd5a4veej8&t=357s)** — Some of these amino acids work in different ways. Like for example, glutamine helps build
- **[06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Wd5a4veej8&t=362s)** — up your glutathione, which is the most powerful antioxidant in the cells to help you get rid of
- **[06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Wd5a4veej8&t=368s)** — free radicals and things that create rusting in the body. Meat also has iron as well as
- **[06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Wd5a4veej8&t=374s)** — the B vitamins, which also help you detox. And then if we add on top of that, this dry
- **[06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Wd5a4veej8&t=380s)** — fasting, you have a sure winner to help clean out not just your liver and your kidneys,
- **[06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Wd5a4veej8&t=387s)** — but the entire body. And you're going to do this three days, a month. Now one last point,
- **[06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Wd5a4veej8&t=392s)** — how do we prevent the detox reaction that a lot of people get when they cleanse?
- **[06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Wd5a4veej8&t=397s)** — Well, with this cleanse, we're not necessarily using herbal remedies to push toxins out of the
- **[06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Wd5a4veej8&t=405s)** — cells. However, anytime you do any type of cleansing, anything, the key is making sure
- **[06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Wd5a4veej8&t=412s)** — that you do not have any bile sludge or any type of blockage within the little bile ducts.
- **[06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Wd5a4veej8&t=419s)** — And those are little tubes between your liver and your gallbladder. You know, some people
- **[07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Wd5a4veej8&t=423s)** — might have gallstones, but a lot of people have like gall sludge. And what happens is
- **[07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Wd5a4veej8&t=429s)** — start a cleanse and it backs up to the liver and they get really sick. So it wouldn't hurt
- **[07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Wd5a4veej8&t=434s)** — before you do this to take some bile salts, okay, in a supplement. You can also do
- **[07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Wd5a4veej8&t=441s)** — another type of bile salt that I've recommended in other videos called
- **[07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Wd5a4veej8&t=446s)** — Tudka. Okay, and I'll put that down below if you want more information on that.
- **[07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Wd5a4veej8&t=449s)** — You can also use food to help thin the bile. One of the best things to thin the bile would be to
- **[07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Wd5a4veej8&t=456s)** — consume beets. One last thing is apple cider vinegar with water. I've known of people who
- **[07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Wd5a4veej8&t=460s)** — started to cleanse and they get this rock right stuck in their stomach and they become
- **[07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Wd5a4veej8&t=466s)** — really severely constipated. And it happened after they started a cleanse. And the quick
- **[07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Wd5a4veej8&t=472s)** — remedy that I always give them is some bile salts and on an empty stomach and that starts
- **[07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Wd5a4veej8&t=477s)** — opening up the sludge and they get relief within hours. So don't forget that. Now since
- **[08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Wd5a4veej8&t=483s)** — we're talking about the liver and phase one, phase two detoxification, there's a little bit
- **[08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Wd5a4veej8&t=488s)** — more information about the liver that you really need to know about. And for that information,
- **[08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Wd5a4veej8&t=493s)** — watch this video right here.

## Video 45: How to Flatten Your Belly (FOR GOOD)

**Watch on YouTube:** [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqNsoFSbbWA](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqNsoFSbbWA)

## Full Transcript with Timestamps

*Click any timestamp to jump to that moment in the video*

- **[00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqNsoFSbbWA&t=0s)** — In this video, we're going to talk about how to flatten your belly in the fastest time possible.
- **[00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqNsoFSbbWA&t=4s)** — And you do see these videos out there that, hey, you just need to drink this one thing or take this one pill before bed,
- **[00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqNsoFSbbWA&t=9s)** — and you will wake up with a flat stomach.
- **[00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqNsoFSbbWA&t=11s)** — Well, that may only be true if that belly is really just coming from bloating.
- **[00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqNsoFSbbWA&t=17s)** — And the other very common question is, how many sit-ups do I have to do?
- **[00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqNsoFSbbWA&t=21s)** — How many crunches do I have to do to achieve a six-pack ab?
- **[00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqNsoFSbbWA&t=25s)** — First of all, what is your abs?
- **[00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqNsoFSbbWA&t=28s)** — Well, we're talking about mainly a muscle called the rectus abdominis.
- **[00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqNsoFSbbWA&t=32s)** — And it's not just one muscle. It's a series of little packets of muscle, aka six-pack abs.
- **[00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqNsoFSbbWA&t=41s)** — Crunches might make them stronger and slightly bigger, but that's not the answer for a six-pack ab.
- **[00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqNsoFSbbWA&t=47s)** — And when we deal with this rectus abdominis muscle, that muscle is mainly there to keep the insides, your guts, from coming out.
- **[00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqNsoFSbbWA&t=56s)** — It's there to stabilize your torso or your what they call the core, which is your entire midsection, not just your front part, but your back as well.
- **[01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqNsoFSbbWA&t=66s)** — And so if you're going to do crunches and you just really focus on that all the time and you don't at the same time balance it by working out your back muscles,
- **[01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqNsoFSbbWA&t=74s)** — you are going to develop either poor posture or back pain.
- **[01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqNsoFSbbWA&t=78s)** — So crunches are good as long as you balance them out with other types of things.
- **[01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqNsoFSbbWA&t=82s)** — But don't expect to flatten your stomach by doing crunches that's not the right thing to do.
- **[01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqNsoFSbbWA&t=87s)** — I mean, you want to do some, but it's not the thing that's going to make the big difference.
- **[01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqNsoFSbbWA&t=91s)** — And there's two different types of fat related to your midsection.
- **[01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqNsoFSbbWA&t=95s)** — You have the superficial fat, which is called the subcutaneous.
- **[01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqNsoFSbbWA&t=98s)** — That's right below the skin. And then you have the deeper visceral fat.
- **[01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqNsoFSbbWA&t=103s)** — That's the fat around the organs underneath it that presses it out.
- **[01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqNsoFSbbWA&t=107s)** — So right now, if you were just to relax your stomach and if it extended outward, that would be more visceral fat,
- **[01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqNsoFSbbWA&t=114s)** — which is the fat that's spilling over from the liver.
- **[01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqNsoFSbbWA&t=116s)** — Now the superficial fat can be best addressed with diet and a certain type of exercise,
- **[02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqNsoFSbbWA&t=125s)** — which basically is aerobic or long walks or hikes.
- **[02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqNsoFSbbWA&t=128s)** — On the same time, I also recommend you do high intensity interval training because that's going to stimulate
- **[02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqNsoFSbbWA&t=134s)** — certain hormones like growth hormone and another fat burning hormone called glucagon.
- **[02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqNsoFSbbWA&t=140s)** — Also another fat burning hormone called testosterone.
- **[02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqNsoFSbbWA&t=143s)** — These are fat burning hormones. Those are triggered by intensity of exercise.
- **[02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqNsoFSbbWA&t=149s)** — But now the visceral fat is mainly dealt with through your diet.
- **[02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqNsoFSbbWA&t=155s)** — Exercise is important, but diet is way, way more important to get rid of the visceral fat
- **[02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqNsoFSbbWA&t=159s)** — because that visceral fat is mainly coming from too much insulin because you're eating too many carbs.
- **[02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqNsoFSbbWA&t=166s)** — You're eating an excess that's just ending up with extra fat around the liver and then spills off around the abdominal area.
- **[02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqNsoFSbbWA&t=173s)** — So just by going on a low carb diet within two weeks,
- **[02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqNsoFSbbWA&t=177s)** — you literally have the ability to remove up to 50% of the fat off the liver.
- **[03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqNsoFSbbWA&t=182s)** — Okay, and then you give it more time and then you're going to see your stomach start shrinking more and more and more.
- **[03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqNsoFSbbWA&t=187s)** — Alright, let's shift gears to fat burning foods.
- **[03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqNsoFSbbWA&t=192s)** — Okay, now these are foods that stimulate the fat burning hormones.
- **[03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqNsoFSbbWA&t=196s)** — So exercise is one way to stimulate fat burning hormones, but certain foods can also do it like protein, for example.
- **[03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqNsoFSbbWA&t=204s)** — Protein can simulate not just growth hormone and testosterone, but that other hormone called glucagon as well.
- **[03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqNsoFSbbWA&t=210s)** — And so people have these protein shakes.
- **[03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqNsoFSbbWA&t=212s)** — Sometimes they do the green shakes or protein powders combined with low starch vegetables.
- **[03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqNsoFSbbWA&t=219s)** — So really the meat and vegetables put you in a state of what's called ketosis where your body is starting to burn fat.
- **[03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqNsoFSbbWA&t=225s)** — So you notice I didn't say a high fat diet because that's not necessarily what keto is.
- **[03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqNsoFSbbWA&t=230s)** — It's low carb. One big reason I do recommend adding more fat initially to that diet is because it makes it easier to fast for longer periods of time because you're more satisfied.
- **[04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqNsoFSbbWA&t=241s)** — And then when you start to lose more fat, you might want to cut that back if you're really targeting the midsection.
- **[04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqNsoFSbbWA&t=246s)** — Because what we want to have happen is we want you in a state of fat burning.
- **[04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqNsoFSbbWA&t=252s)** — But if at the same time you are eating things that are causing a fat storage situation or stimulating the fat making hormone that's called insulin,
- **[04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqNsoFSbbWA&t=262s)** — it's the thing that nullifies all the good work when you eat carbs.
- **[04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqNsoFSbbWA&t=267s)** — I'm talking about refined carbs like the bread, pasta, cereal, crackers, biscuits, fruit, sodas, all of those.
- **[04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqNsoFSbbWA&t=275s)** — And by the way, those things actually make you hungry, which is not going to help this plan because you're going to be starving all the time.
- **[04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqNsoFSbbWA&t=282s)** — When we lower insulin by not eating carbohydrates, we actually live off our own fat and our hunger goes away.
- **[04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqNsoFSbbWA&t=289s)** — Now, you also have probably heard of all the fat burning supplements out there like garcinia,
- **[04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqNsoFSbbWA&t=295s)** — camboja, raspberry ketones, or green tea extract, or caffeine, or certain extracts of chili peppers.
- **[05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqNsoFSbbWA&t=303s)** — All of these things tend to stimulate your metabolism.
- **[05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqNsoFSbbWA&t=306s)** — But again, if you're consuming things that are increasing your insulin, those are going to be very expensive urine because they're going to go right through you.
- **[05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqNsoFSbbWA&t=314s)** — They're not going to work.
- **[05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqNsoFSbbWA&t=315s)** — So I wanted to make a big point about that because you have to understand levels of importance.
- **[05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqNsoFSbbWA&t=321s)** — Things that are really, really important and things that are trivial and things that are dependent on other things.
- **[05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqNsoFSbbWA&t=327s)** — Because the last thing I want you to do is have this great diet, but you're eating these little carbs on the side and you kind of nullify all this good results.
- **[05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqNsoFSbbWA&t=335s)** — Another factor that's very important is the frequency of eating.
- **[05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqNsoFSbbWA&t=339s)** — Okay, if you're snacking, if you're eating between meals, that can slow things down.
- **[05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqNsoFSbbWA&t=343s)** — Why? Because one of the triggers for insulin, the fat storing hormone, is eating in general.
- **[05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqNsoFSbbWA&t=349s)** — So the less you eat, the better. Like two meals a day or even one meal a day.
- **[05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqNsoFSbbWA&t=356s)** — And one really important point about that, which relates to the next topic, which is bloating, is how snacking keeps you bloated.
- **[06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqNsoFSbbWA&t=365s)** — Think about what bloating is. Bloating involves your digestive system.
- **[06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqNsoFSbbWA&t=368s)** — So many people have a big belly because of bloating.
- **[06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqNsoFSbbWA&t=373s)** — They're bloated 24-7 and they think that's fat when in fact it's sometimes it's not.
- **[06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqNsoFSbbWA&t=378s)** — It's just their digestive system is in a constant state of working really hard and not digesting.
- **[06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqNsoFSbbWA&t=385s)** — And so this intermittent fasting is so important to give your digestive system a chance to take a break.
- **[06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqNsoFSbbWA&t=390s)** — So the combination of eating too frequent and overeating will create bloating.
- **[06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqNsoFSbbWA&t=394s)** — And I see it all the time, especially when people after they eat, they just like their stomach is just completely, you know, distended.
- **[06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqNsoFSbbWA&t=402s)** — If you do infrequent eating, I promise you, you'll do much, much better.
- **[06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqNsoFSbbWA&t=407s)** — This happens if you eat and you get bloated right away.
- **[06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqNsoFSbbWA&t=409s)** — It could mean that you need more acid in your stomach.
- **[06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqNsoFSbbWA&t=412s)** — And I recommend butane hydrochloride.
- **[06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqNsoFSbbWA&t=415s)** — That's a natural remedy for bloating and gas, things like that.
- **[07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqNsoFSbbWA&t=420s)** — And you would probably want to take quite a few in the beginning, maybe five, six or seven small little tablets right before you eat.
- **[07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqNsoFSbbWA&t=428s)** — And you take that and you eat and then you'll find that extra acid will help break things down much, much better.
- **[07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqNsoFSbbWA&t=435s)** — And in some people they need more bile salts from their gallbladder.
- **[07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqNsoFSbbWA&t=438s)** — So you would take like a gallbladder formula right after the meal, maybe one or two to help more of that.
- **[07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqNsoFSbbWA&t=445s)** — And so the lack of acid and the lack of bile can create a lot of digestive bloating, things like that.
- **[07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqNsoFSbbWA&t=451s)** — And of course, certain things like fruit will bloat people all day long.
- **[07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqNsoFSbbWA&t=456s)** — The sugar in yogurt can bloat you.
- **[07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqNsoFSbbWA&t=459s)** — And of course, the obvious stuff like the beans and the grains and all that will totally keep you bloated.
- **[07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqNsoFSbbWA&t=465s)** — And even when someone gets on a ketogenic diet and they have these little snacks with almond flour and sugar,
- **[07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqNsoFSbbWA&t=471s)** — alcohols like xylitol, rethrotol.
- **[07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqNsoFSbbWA&t=473s)** — Oh, it's low sugar, but they put all these sugar alcohols that will just bloat the heck out of you.
- **[07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqNsoFSbbWA&t=478s)** — And then also these new functional fibers like tapioca fiber or soluble corn fiber.
- **[08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqNsoFSbbWA&t=486s)** — Boy, that will just bloat you.
- **[08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqNsoFSbbWA&t=487s)** — And these so-called clean, healthy plant-based green shakes or protein shakes.
- **[08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqNsoFSbbWA&t=496s)** — You look at the ingredients, there's like millions of things in there.
- **[08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqNsoFSbbWA&t=500s)** — All these fruits, all these different fibers.
- **[08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqNsoFSbbWA&t=502s)** — Well, you drink that, you're just going to be bloated, walk around, just feel distended.
- **[08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqNsoFSbbWA&t=506s)** — Not good if you're trying to have a flat stomach.
- **[08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqNsoFSbbWA&t=508s)** — And that relates to if you have IBS or some type of inflammatory condition in your gut
- **[08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqNsoFSbbWA&t=514s)** — and you're doing salads and you're doing nuts and things like that,
- **[08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqNsoFSbbWA&t=517s)** — you probably want to go on the carnivore for a while because if you have bloating,
- **[08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqNsoFSbbWA&t=522s)** — you're not going to be able to digest these things.
- **[08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqNsoFSbbWA&t=523s)** — And all it's going to do is it's going to ferment in the wrong place.
- **[08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqNsoFSbbWA&t=527s)** — It's going to ferment in your small intestine when it should ferment in the large intestine.
- **[08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqNsoFSbbWA&t=532s)** — And fermentation is basically where the microbes are eating up the sugars in it.
- **[08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqNsoFSbbWA&t=536s)** — The last thing I'm going to mention, and that is stress.
- **[09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqNsoFSbbWA&t=540s)** — Cortisol. Cortisol is a stress hormone that will literally not only cause bloating,
- **[09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqNsoFSbbWA&t=548s)** — but also the stress basically turns things into more sugar.
- **[09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqNsoFSbbWA&t=551s)** — And then that causes more fat.
- **[09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqNsoFSbbWA&t=554s)** — So when I mentioned the insulin being a really key factor in whether you're going to lose weight or not,
- **[09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqNsoFSbbWA&t=560s)** — cortisol is almost at the same level.
- **[09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqNsoFSbbWA&t=562s)** — If you're going through high stress, it's going to nullify some of the other results.
- **[09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqNsoFSbbWA&t=567s)** — So this is why the best thing for stress is the walking,
- **[09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqNsoFSbbWA&t=571s)** — other types of exercise, physical work and sleeping.
- **[09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqNsoFSbbWA&t=574s)** — Okay, very important to fix the sleep as well.
- **[09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqNsoFSbbWA&t=577s)** — The other challenge that happens with women that are postmenopausal
- **[09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqNsoFSbbWA&t=582s)** — is that their adrenal glands are now having to back up the ovaries.
- **[09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqNsoFSbbWA&t=587s)** — And so we have the situation where now they get more belly fat.
- **[09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqNsoFSbbWA&t=590s)** — So make note of that and do what you can if you're going into menopause.
- **[09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqNsoFSbbWA&t=594s)** — But I can't overemphasize the very important diet that you need to be on.
- **[09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqNsoFSbbWA&t=598s)** — And for that, you should watch this video right here.

- **[00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M5ADM_V3bJY&t=0s)** — Out of all the nutrients that our body needs, potassium is at the very top of the list as far as the huge requirements.
- **[00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M5ADM_V3bJY&t=6s)** — We're talking 4,700 milligrams. No other nutrient comes even close to that.
- **[00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M5ADM_V3bJY&t=11s)** — Now the question is why? Why do we need so much potassium?
- **[00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M5ADM_V3bJY&t=15s)** — Because potassium fulfills a very, very important enzyme that's involved in the sodium potassium pump.
- **[00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M5ADM_V3bJY&t=23s)** — This pump is in all of your nerve cells. It's in all of your muscle cells.
- **[00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M5ADM_V3bJY&t=27s)** — It is the pump that establishes the battery of our cells.
- **[00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M5ADM_V3bJY&t=32s)** — We need this pump to move electrical impulses.
- **[00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M5ADM_V3bJY&t=35s)** — We also need this pump for muscle contraction that are in your arteries.
- **[00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M5ADM_V3bJY&t=40s)** — We need it in the heart, for the heart muscle, as well as in your kidney.
- **[00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M5ADM_V3bJY&t=44s)** — And today we're going to talk about the consequences of not having enough potassium in our diet.
- **[00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M5ADM_V3bJY&t=48s)** — But there's some new information I want to share with you from a paper entitled,
- **[00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M5ADM_V3bJY&t=53s)** — Achieving the Benefits of a High Potassium Paleolithic Diet Without the Toxicity.
- **[01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M5ADM_V3bJY&t=61s)** — Apparently, thousands of years ago in the Stone Age, humans have consumed a lot more than 4,700 milligrams.
- **[01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M5ADM_V3bJY&t=69s)** — In fact, there's evidence to show that humans consumed up to 15,000 milligrams of potassium every single day.
- **[01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M5ADM_V3bJY&t=76s)** — That's four times the current RDAs, which is still quite high, 4,700.
- **[01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M5ADM_V3bJY&t=81s)** — And then if we look at the relationship of potassium to sodium with those levels,
- **[01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M5ADM_V3bJY&t=85s)** — we're talking 16 times more potassium than sodium.
- **[01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M5ADM_V3bJY&t=89s)** — So there's some really interesting, credible data to show that we need even more potassium than we really think.
- **[01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M5ADM_V3bJY&t=96s)** — And what backs that up is the kidney.
- **[01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M5ADM_V3bJY&t=99s)** — Our kidneys have a very robust capacity to get rid of excess potassium, but not sodium, but potassium.
- **[01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M5ADM_V3bJY&t=108s)** — So sometimes people say that, oh yeah, potassium is bad for the kidneys. It can create problems.
- **[01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M5ADM_V3bJY&t=114s)** — That's only in like stage five kidney disease, which is end stage kidney disease.
- **[01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M5ADM_V3bJY&t=119s)** — If you take large amounts of potassium before you get kidney disease, it actually has been shown to be protective against kidney disease.
- **[02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M5ADM_V3bJY&t=127s)** — I mean, the average person consumes like 1.5 cups of vegetables, which are the primary source of potassium.
- **[02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M5ADM_V3bJY&t=135s)** — And no, you're not going to get a lot of potassium from bananas.
- **[02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M5ADM_V3bJY&t=138s)** — Bananas have roughly about 300 milligrams.
- **[02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M5ADM_V3bJY&t=141s)** — So you'd have to eat a lot of bananas to get your fulfillment of potassium.
- **[02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M5ADM_V3bJY&t=145s)** — And of course, bananas have a lot of fructose, which comes with other issues.
- **[02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M5ADM_V3bJY&t=150s)** — Potatoes are also supposed to have a lot of potassium.
- **[02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M5ADM_V3bJY&t=152s)** — But of course, the starch creates other issues.
- **[02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M5ADM_V3bJY&t=156s)** — One medium sized potato has about 600 milligrams of potassium.
- **[02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M5ADM_V3bJY&t=161s)** — But just one cup of leafy greens is between 500 to 800 milligrams.
- **[02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M5ADM_V3bJY&t=167s)** — That's one cup.
- **[02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M5ADM_V3bJY&t=169s)** — And if you consumed like five, seven or even 10 cups, boy, that would give you a tremendous amount of potassium.
- **[02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M5ADM_V3bJY&t=175s)** — The point is we need a lot of potassium.
- **[02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M5ADM_V3bJY&t=178s)** — We probably need more than we're consuming.
- **[03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M5ADM_V3bJY&t=180s)** — Unfortunately, the average person is not consuming enough potassium from the diet.
- **[03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M5ADM_V3bJY&t=184s)** — And you might say, well, maybe they're getting it from their supplements, right?
- **[03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M5ADM_V3bJY&t=187s)** — Well, the majority of supplements only give you like between 49 to at the very most, 99 milligrams per tablet.
- **[03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M5ADM_V3bJY&t=197s)** — So how many pills would you have to take per day to even get your daily requirement of potassium?
- **[03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M5ADM_V3bJY&t=203s)** — Well, you'd have to have 47 pills.
- **[03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M5ADM_V3bJY&t=207s)** — OK, 47 pills. No one's going to do that.
- **[03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M5ADM_V3bJY&t=209s)** — And if we look at a potassium deficiency, it's often missed.
- **[03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M5ADM_V3bJY&t=212s)** — It's omitted because most of the potassium is inside the cell, like 98 percent.
- **[03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M5ADM_V3bJY&t=219s)** — So you can't accurately determine if you have a low potassium situation just by the blood,
- **[03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M5ADM_V3bJY&t=224s)** — because most of the potassium is inside the cell.
- **[03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M5ADM_V3bJY&t=227s)** — You would have to do a different type of test called an intracellular potassium test.
- **[03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M5ADM_V3bJY&t=231s)** — Not to mention the symptoms of a potassium deficiency are sometimes very vague, especially in the beginning.
- **[03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M5ADM_V3bJY&t=238s)** — You might have a little bit of weakness in your diaphragm that affects your breathing a little bit.
- **[04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M5ADM_V3bJY&t=242s)** — It's hard to breathe. You might feel a little fatigue.
- **[04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M5ADM_V3bJY&t=246s)** — You might have heart palpitations.
- **[04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M5ADM_V3bJY&t=249s)** — But these are all just early signs of a potassium deficiency.
- **[04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M5ADM_V3bJY&t=253s)** — But eventually, as that deficiency becomes worse, you can develop high blood pressure.
- **[04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M5ADM_V3bJY&t=258s)** — You can actually have an increased risk of stroke. You can get fluid retention.
- **[04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M5ADM_V3bJY&t=263s)** — You can even get loss of bone and kidney stones.
- **[04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M5ADM_V3bJY&t=266s)** — Because potassium helps keep calcium out of the arteries and out of the urine.
- **[04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M5ADM_V3bJY&t=274s)** — Because sometimes when people get their urine tested, they have high levels of calcium in their urine,
- **[04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M5ADM_V3bJY&t=278s)** — which is kind of an environment to form a kidney stone.
- **[04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M5ADM_V3bJY&t=283s)** — As you can see, potassium is really, really important and it can create a lot of problems.
- **[04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M5ADM_V3bJY&t=287s)** — Now, there's some interesting reasons why people are deficient that go beyond just not consuming enough greens.
- **[04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M5ADM_V3bJY&t=295s)** — If you take penicillin, that can create a potassium deficiency.
- **[04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M5ADM_V3bJY&t=299s)** — Or diuretics, or steroids, or go through chronic stress, or have higher levels of insulin with a high carb diet.
- **[05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M5ADM_V3bJY&t=307s)** — Another interesting reason why people are deficient is even going on the ketogenic diet.
- **[05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M5ADM_V3bJY&t=313s)** — So let's say, for example, you start the ketogenic diet, which is a low carb diet,
- **[05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M5ADM_V3bJY&t=317s)** — and you're going into this already deficient in potassium and you take no potassium electrolytes or supplements, right?
- **[05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M5ADM_V3bJY&t=323s)** — What happens is potassium helps you store glycogen.
- **[05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M5ADM_V3bJY&t=328s)** — That's the stuff in your liver and your muscles, stored sugar.
- **[05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M5ADM_V3bJY&t=331s)** — So as you use that up, what comes with that is a lot of water release and a loss of potassium as well.
- **[05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M5ADM_V3bJY&t=340s)** — So if you don't take potassium when you start the ketogenic diet, you may end up with a potassium deficiency from that reason.
- **[05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M5ADM_V3bJY&t=348s)** — But also you have, if you're fasting for like three or four days, right?
- **[05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M5ADM_V3bJY&t=352s)** — And you don't take supplements, especially electrolytes like potassium, trace minerals or B vitamins,
- **[05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M5ADM_V3bJY&t=358s)** — and you're doing this prolonged fast, you can start having problems from that.
- **[06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M5ADM_V3bJY&t=362s)** — Not to mention, let's say you fasted for three or four or five days and then you eat too much too quickly.
- **[06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M5ADM_V3bJY&t=370s)** — And then you also ate too many carbohydrates. That's called refeeding syndrome, which is a severe potassium deficiency.
- **[06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M5ADM_V3bJY&t=376s)** — Now, I'm not going to get into the details, but it can create a sudden shift of potassium from your blood right into the cell.
- **[06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M5ADM_V3bJY&t=382s)** — And you can end up with a serious low potassium problem, which could be dangerous.
- **[06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M5ADM_V3bJY&t=387s)** — Did you realize that the average person in the U.S. consumes like 60 percent of their calories from ultra processed foods where they strip the nutrients out?
- **[06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M5ADM_V3bJY&t=398s)** — I mean, let's just take Doritos, for example. I used to love Doritos.
- **[06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M5ADM_V3bJY&t=402s)** — I would consume huge bags of Doritos in college.
- **[06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M5ADM_V3bJY&t=406s)** — I mean, just massive amounts. And the next morning I would end up with all sorts of fluid retention in my fingers and my feet.
- **[06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M5ADM_V3bJY&t=413s)** — And at the time I had no information about health. I was the worst.
- **[06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M5ADM_V3bJY&t=418s)** — So back then, I think they put 11 ingredients in these Doritos.
- **[07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M5ADM_V3bJY&t=422s)** — And now it's, I think, up to 30 ingredients, different flavors that just make it taste like you're dipping a taco with hot wings
- **[07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M5ADM_V3bJY&t=432s)** — into ranch dressing. And so is there a lot of potassium in Doritos?
- **[07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M5ADM_V3bJY&t=438s)** — No, there's a lot of sodium in all these fast food restaurants.
- **[07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M5ADM_V3bJY&t=441s)** — So it gives you this flavoring, which is kind of addicting.
- **[07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M5ADM_V3bJY&t=444s)** — So you eat too much of it and then you end up with a potassium deficiency.
- **[07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M5ADM_V3bJY&t=448s)** — So all these fast food restaurants, as you see them as you're driving down the street, are just pumping out empty calories filled with a lot of sodium, very little nutrients, if anything.
- **[07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M5ADM_V3bJY&t=460s)** — Practically zero potassium. And you can see it too.
- **[07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M5ADM_V3bJY&t=463s)** — If you watch people coming out of these these restaurants and look at their eyes, it's all swollen around the eyes.
- **[07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M5ADM_V3bJY&t=470s)** — They don't look healthy. They're also going to lose the power of their cellular batteries.
- **[07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M5ADM_V3bJY&t=476s)** — So they're going to be walking around tired.
- **[07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M5ADM_V3bJY&t=478s)** — And each one of those symptoms will then probably be addressed by a separate drug.
- **[08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M5ADM_V3bJY&t=481s)** — So they're on high blood pressure medication. They're on a blood thinner.
- **[08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M5ADM_V3bJY&t=484s)** — They're probably taking high energy drinks and of course, a diuretic for the edema and the high blood pressure, which causes further potassium deficiencies.
- **[08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M5ADM_V3bJY&t=493s)** — I challenge you to do this experiment with your own body.
- **[08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M5ADM_V3bJY&t=496s)** — Start consuming a lot of high potassium foods, a lot of leafy greens, just for a week.
- **[08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M5ADM_V3bJY&t=503s)** — And if you don't like greens, you can make shakes.
- **[08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M5ADM_V3bJY&t=505s)** — Blend kale with blueberries. There's a lot of different recipes.
- **[08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M5ADM_V3bJY&t=509s)** — But start to increase more potassium rich foods.
- **[08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M5ADM_V3bJY&t=513s)** — And just notice how many of these problems start disappearing.
- **[08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M5ADM_V3bJY&t=517s)** — And if you wanted a really good demo on what this potassium requirement looks like in actual food, I did a video on that.
- **[08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M5ADM_V3bJY&t=525s)** — So check that out. I put it up right here.

- **[00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sfl-kS9Xyg&t=0s)** — I want to share with you a very interesting, powerful technique
- **[00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sfl-kS9Xyg&t=4s)** — to be able to go to sleep within minutes.
- **[00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sfl-kS9Xyg&t=7s)** — But first I want to kind of remove some of the
- **[00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sfl-kS9Xyg&t=9s)** — other things that can interfere with this technique.
- **[00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sfl-kS9Xyg&t=12s)** — Number one, overtraining. If you're exercising too much
- **[00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sfl-kS9Xyg&t=15s)** — your sympathetic nervous system will go up
- **[00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sfl-kS9Xyg&t=17s)** — and that will keep your adrenaline high
- **[00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sfl-kS9Xyg&t=20s)** — and you will not be able to go to sleep.
- **[00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sfl-kS9Xyg&t=21s)** — For some people, the best
- **[00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sfl-kS9Xyg&t=23s)** — high intensity interval training exercise
- **[00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sfl-kS9Xyg&t=26s)** — should be done maybe
- **[00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sfl-kS9Xyg&t=28s)** — twice a week versus even every other day.
- **[00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sfl-kS9Xyg&t=31s)** — That can keep someone up.
- **[00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sfl-kS9Xyg&t=32s)** — Also, if your room is a little too hot
- **[00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sfl-kS9Xyg&t=35s)** — that can interfere with your ability to sleep.
- **[00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sfl-kS9Xyg&t=37s)** — If you do a lot of carbohydrates
- **[00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sfl-kS9Xyg&t=38s)** — that can deplete B1
- **[00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sfl-kS9Xyg&t=41s)** — which will then keep you up at night.
- **[00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sfl-kS9Xyg&t=44s)** — A real simple remedy is just to take some B1
- **[00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sfl-kS9Xyg&t=46s)** — right before you go to sleep. It helps so many people.
- **[00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sfl-kS9Xyg&t=48s)** — And you will feel like within minutes like this
- **[00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sfl-kS9Xyg&t=52s)** — calmness. Vitamin B1 is essential for
- **[00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sfl-kS9Xyg&t=54s)** — the parasympathetic nervous system.
- **[00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sfl-kS9Xyg&t=56s)** — And also it's not just the carbs that can reduce your B1
- **[00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sfl-kS9Xyg&t=59s)** — it could be also stress.
- **[01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sfl-kS9Xyg&t=61s)** — And too much tea.
- **[01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sfl-kS9Xyg&t=62s)** — That caffeine is still in their system.
- **[01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sfl-kS9Xyg&t=65s)** — It might seem like a real simple thing
- **[01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sfl-kS9Xyg&t=67s)** — but it seems to work for a lot of people.
- **[01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sfl-kS9Xyg&t=69s)** — If your gut microbiome is not right
- **[01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sfl-kS9Xyg&t=72s)** — that will greatly interfere with your ability to sleep.
- **[01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sfl-kS9Xyg&t=76s)** — Kefir as a probiotic
- **[01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sfl-kS9Xyg&t=78s)** — will greatly help your sleep.
- **[01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sfl-kS9Xyg&t=80s)** — Maybe half of a cup.
- **[01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sfl-kS9Xyg&t=81s)** — Not to mention giving you some calcium
- **[01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sfl-kS9Xyg&t=83s)** — which also can actually help you go to sleep as well.
- **[01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sfl-kS9Xyg&t=85s)** — If you are insulin resistant
- **[01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sfl-kS9Xyg&t=88s)** — you are not going to be able to absorb as much
- **[01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sfl-kS9Xyg&t=91s)** — tryptophan from your diet
- **[01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sfl-kS9Xyg&t=93s)** — turns into serotonin
- **[01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sfl-kS9Xyg&t=95s)** — and then into melatonin, the sleep hormone.
- **[01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sfl-kS9Xyg&t=100s)** — And that could be another reason why you're not sleeping.
- **[01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sfl-kS9Xyg&t=103s)** — Sometimes when people do the ketogenic diet
- **[01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sfl-kS9Xyg&t=105s)** — for a long period of time
- **[01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sfl-kS9Xyg&t=106s)** — or even the carnivore for a long period of time
- **[01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sfl-kS9Xyg&t=108s)** — your insulin level will go really low.
- **[01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sfl-kS9Xyg&t=111s)** — And you're going to become insulin sensitive.
- **[01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sfl-kS9Xyg&t=114s)** — So that means your insulin receptors are going to work really well
- **[01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sfl-kS9Xyg&t=118s)** — but you might be on the low side with insulin.
- **[02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sfl-kS9Xyg&t=121s)** — And remember we need insulin for all sorts of things.
- **[02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sfl-kS9Xyg&t=123s)** — We need insulin to help us absorb more amino acids, nutrients.
- **[02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sfl-kS9Xyg&t=128s)** — But here's what I noticed.
- **[02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sfl-kS9Xyg&t=128s)** — Some people who have done the ketogenic diet
- **[02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sfl-kS9Xyg&t=132s)** — for a period of time and then the sleep isn't as great
- **[02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sfl-kS9Xyg&t=136s)** — will benefit from adding
- **[02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sfl-kS9Xyg&t=139s)** — maybe one to two cups of berries
- **[02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sfl-kS9Xyg&t=142s)** — with their last meal.
- **[02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sfl-kS9Xyg&t=143s)** — And that's still going to be under that 50 gram of carb.
- **[02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sfl-kS9Xyg&t=146s)** — So that will be enough carbs with the fiber
- **[02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sfl-kS9Xyg&t=150s)** — to raise that insulin a little bit
- **[02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sfl-kS9Xyg&t=153s)** — to allow more tryptophan to enter the blood-brain barrier
- **[02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sfl-kS9Xyg&t=156s)** — and help you sleep a little bit better.
- **[02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sfl-kS9Xyg&t=158s)** — You should try it. It might help you.
- **[02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sfl-kS9Xyg&t=159s)** — And then you have another factor.
- **[02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sfl-kS9Xyg&t=161s)** — If you're deficient in sodium
- **[02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sfl-kS9Xyg&t=162s)** — because maybe you're fasting, you're doing one meal a day
- **[02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sfl-kS9Xyg&t=164s)** — and you're not really adding enough sodium or salt to the diet
- **[02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sfl-kS9Xyg&t=168s)** — your sympathetic nervous system will have a tendency to go up.
- **[02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sfl-kS9Xyg&t=172s)** — And that can keep you from sleeping.
- **[02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sfl-kS9Xyg&t=175s)** — So a little more salt during the day
- **[02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sfl-kS9Xyg&t=178s)** — helps you sleep.
- **[02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sfl-kS9Xyg&t=179s)** — Now I'm going to show you the technique.
- **[03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sfl-kS9Xyg&t=181s)** — And this is legitimate. It's an actual technique
- **[03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sfl-kS9Xyg&t=183s)** — that is based on science.
- **[03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sfl-kS9Xyg&t=185s)** — What you're going to do is you're going to synchronize
- **[03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sfl-kS9Xyg&t=188s)** — your heart to your lungs.
- **[03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sfl-kS9Xyg&t=191s)** — Basically we're going to
- **[03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sfl-kS9Xyg&t=193s)** — breathe in a certain way
- **[03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sfl-kS9Xyg&t=196s)** — to create this
- **[03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sfl-kS9Xyg&t=199s)** — optimized synchronization between your heartbeat,
- **[03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sfl-kS9Xyg&t=201s)** — your blood pressure
- **[03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sfl-kS9Xyg&t=203s)** — and the rhythm of your breathing with your lungs.
- **[03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sfl-kS9Xyg&t=206s)** — And it's going to help you
- **[03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sfl-kS9Xyg&t=208s)** — stimulate something called the parasympathetic
- **[03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sfl-kS9Xyg&t=211s)** — which will induce a wonderful sleep.
- **[03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sfl-kS9Xyg&t=215s)** — So here's a secret.
- **[03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sfl-kS9Xyg&t=215s)** — And you might want to practice this with a timer first because
- **[03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sfl-kS9Xyg&t=219s)** — it's hard to be exact.
- **[03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sfl-kS9Xyg&t=220s)** — But this is how you do it.
- **[03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sfl-kS9Xyg&t=222s)** — You want to breathe in
- **[03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sfl-kS9Xyg&t=224s)** — for five and a half seconds
- **[03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sfl-kS9Xyg&t=226s)** — and breathe out five and a half seconds.
- **[03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sfl-kS9Xyg&t=228s)** — But if you synchronize your breathing in
- **[03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sfl-kS9Xyg&t=231s)** — and out at five and a half seconds each,

- **[00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTpnF4V8stA&t=5s)** — he was a type 1 diabetic. I brought him on today to talk to him on how the hell he did it and how
- **[00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTpnF4V8stA&t=11s)** — he survived. I would argue it's more difficult to get into ketosis as a type 1 because we have to
- **[00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTpnF4V8stA&t=15s)** — inject insulin. A fat burning body has to have low insulin levels in order to release the fat.
- **[00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTpnF4V8stA&t=21s)** — Do they ever advise to go five days without any food?
- **[00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTpnF4V8stA&t=26s)** — I think you know the answer to that.
- **[00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTpnF4V8stA&t=29s)** — So I have a fascinating interview today. I mean, this is going to be a bizarre interview because
- **[00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTpnF4V8stA&t=34s)** — here's a person, a doctor, Dr. Ian Lake, who did some wild, wild, crazy things that
- **[00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTpnF4V8stA&t=42s)** — he probably shouldn't even have survived this. But what he did,
- **[00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTpnF4V8stA&t=47s)** — not only did he fast for five days, but he ran five almost complete marathons,
- **[00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTpnF4V8stA&t=52s)** — 100 miles in five days. But not only that, he was a type 1 diabetic. So I brought him on today
- **[00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTpnF4V8stA&t=59s)** — to talk to him on how the hell he did it and how he survived. Welcome, Ian. Thanks for coming
- **[01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTpnF4V8stA&t=64s)** — on. Hello. Thank you. Nice to meet you. Nice meeting you. So first of all, you're a medical
- **[01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTpnF4V8stA&t=70s)** — doctor. You're a type 1 diabetic. If we take a look at like the main consensus of the
- **[01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTpnF4V8stA&t=76s)** — medical community with type 1, do they ever advise to go five days without any food?
- **[01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTpnF4V8stA&t=84s)** — I think you know the answer to that. It's very difficult to persuade anyone to ask us to
- **[01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTpnF4V8stA&t=91s)** — fast and skip one meal. So I was trying to work out a workaround for how we can convince
- **[01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTpnF4V8stA&t=98s)** — people that one meal skipping would be safe. So this was an extreme version of skipping a
- **[01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTpnF4V8stA&t=103s)** — meal, really. You know, to prove this point, you went to the extreme and you did this with
- **[01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTpnF4V8stA&t=110s)** — how many people? Eight people. Eight people did this. So you basically did a combination of
- **[01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTpnF4V8stA&t=117s)** — a few things that were very difficult to do on their own. Let's first talk about
- **[02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTpnF4V8stA&t=122s)** — how many calories you actually burned within five days. Was it roughly about what, 20,000
- **[02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTpnF4V8stA&t=127s)** — calories? Yeah, it was roughly 20,000 calories. So we worked out how many calories we'd need
- **[02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTpnF4V8stA&t=133s)** — if you believe in the glycogen storage depletion idea to exhaust our glycogen
- **[02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTpnF4V8stA&t=139s)** — storage tenfold to make absolutely sure we were in ketosis. So we worked out about 20,000 calories
- **[02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTpnF4V8stA&t=145s)** — would be required. I think we used a little bit more than that from memory, but we didn't
- **[02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTpnF4V8stA&t=149s)** — actually physically record it. The other thing we wanted to do really was to show how safe
- **[02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTpnF4V8stA&t=160s)** — the nutritional ketosis really is. So we wanted to put ourselves into very deep ketosis. So
- **[02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTpnF4V8stA&t=164s)** — that was the rationale for doing this. Okay. So just to back up on... it's just for those
- **[02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTpnF4V8stA&t=170s)** — people that don't know what the word glycogen is. You depleted your glycogen. That's just the
- **[02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTpnF4V8stA&t=175s)** — stored sugar in your liver, right? So when you exercise, you're going to use that as
- **[03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTpnF4V8stA&t=180s)** — fuel. And then after that's gone, you're going to tap into your fat reserves, right?
- **[03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTpnF4V8stA&t=184s)** — Exactly. Yeah. So typically, first let's start with a diabetic. What is the difference between
- **[03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTpnF4V8stA&t=192s)** — a type one and a type two? Someone with type one diabetes cannot produce their own insulin
- **[03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTpnF4V8stA&t=197s)** — in enough volume to maintain blood sugar. Because one of the key features of insulin,
- **[03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTpnF4V8stA&t=202s)** — functions of insulin is to reduce blood sugar and keep blood sugar at an even rate.
- **[03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTpnF4V8stA&t=209s)** — And someone with type two diabetes has more than enough insulin. In fact, most people
- **[03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTpnF4V8stA&t=214s)** — type two diabetes have too much insulin. And theirs is due to an over fueling issue such
- **[03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTpnF4V8stA&t=219s)** — that their body cannot handle the amount of fuel that they're putting into their bodies,
- **[03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTpnF4V8stA&t=224s)** — mostly carbohydrates. So there's a big difference between the two conditions.
- **[03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTpnF4V8stA&t=228s)** — Type ones, we need to inject insulin because we don't produce any. And in type twos, they
- **[03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTpnF4V8stA&t=233s)** — need to adopt a lifestyle strategy that naturally reduces the amount of insulin they're
- **[03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTpnF4V8stA&t=238s)** — producing. So they're not at all comparable conditions. So if insulin lowers blood glucose
- **[04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTpnF4V8stA&t=244s)** — and a type two has high insulin, shouldn't they have low blood glucose? They become insulin
- **[04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTpnF4V8stA&t=251s)** — resistant. This is the problem. Now people with type two diabetes, various ideas on it,
- **[04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTpnF4V8stA&t=257s)** — their fat cells sort of stop the body sort of taking on more fat and they become
- **[04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTpnF4V8stA&t=262s)** — resistant to the amount of insulin they've got. Because as well as lowering blood sugar,
- **[04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTpnF4V8stA&t=266s)** — insulin is a hormone that stimulates fat deposition. So it's a fat storage hormone,
- **[04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTpnF4V8stA&t=273s)** — as well as a glucose lowering hormone. And the two things work together. So in order to lower
- **[04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTpnF4V8stA&t=278s)** — blood sugar, you either exercise or you put it into your liver initially, and then into your
- **[04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTpnF4V8stA&t=284s)** — adipose tissue or fat tissues as fat. So we think of insulin as a glucose lowering hormone
- **[04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTpnF4V8stA&t=290s)** — and a fat storage hormone primarily. Okay, so when someone is a type one, they don't have
- **[04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTpnF4V8stA&t=296s)** — insulin to regulate blood glucose. So what's going to happen when they start exercising and
- **[05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTpnF4V8stA&t=302s)** — not eating? They don't have fuel. Obviously they have to cap into their fat reserves, right?
- **[05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTpnF4V8stA&t=310s)** — And talk a little bit about that as well as a really key issue, which is
- **[05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTpnF4V8stA&t=318s)** — is adapting to running on fat or ketones. Explain that process.
- **[05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTpnF4V8stA&t=324s)** — Our body can multi fuel. So we can use sugars, and we can use fats for our fuel. And of course,
- **[05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTpnF4V8stA&t=332s)** — fats will break down into ketone bodies and we can use ketone bodies as fuel as well.
- **[05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTpnF4V8stA&t=338s)** — So in the ideal situation, our bodies can flick between whatever fuel they need for
- **[05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTpnF4V8stA&t=343s)** — the requirements at the time. So whether you have type one diabetes or not, if you're
- **[05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTpnF4V8stA&t=349s)** — performing exercise as like a sprint without any oxygen, you will have to use glucose
- **[05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTpnF4V8stA&t=354s)** — for your energy source. But if you're doing a more aerobic or more relaxed
- **[06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTpnF4V8stA&t=361s)** — amount of physical activity, you're burning oxygen and you can choose really whether you're
- **[06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTpnF4V8stA&t=366s)** — using glucose or fat as your fuel. However, you're limited a little bit as to how you can
- **[06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTpnF4V8stA&t=374s)** — because if you have too much insulin on board, you're blocking fat burning. So
- **[06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTpnF4V8stA&t=379s)** — fat burning is impossible if you've got too much insulin on board.
- **[06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTpnF4V8stA&t=383s)** — Now, people do burn fat when they are exercising. And there's this fat burning zone,
- **[06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTpnF4V8stA&t=389s)** — which is otherwise known as zone two, because there's a hormone that called hormone
- **[06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTpnF4V8stA&t=394s)** — sensitive lipase, which is which enables fat to be burned. And that is also stimulated by
- **[06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTpnF4V8stA&t=403s)** — lowering insulin or adrenaline cortisol growth hormone, things like that. So stress hormones
- **[06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTpnF4V8stA&t=408s)** — will release that. But if you have too much insulin, it will override those hormones and
- **[06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTpnF4V8stA&t=413s)** — block fat burning. So then you become entirely dependent on glucose. So most people with
- **[06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTpnF4V8stA&t=418s)** — type one diabetes will be dependent on glucose because they're not encouraged to burn fat.
- **[07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTpnF4V8stA&t=424s)** — So we tend to have too much insulin on board. So our body is a multi fuel. We can flick
- **[07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTpnF4V8stA&t=429s)** — between fuels as we need them. And if we're fat adapted, all that means is that your
- **[07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTpnF4V8stA&t=437s)** — fueling choice for your just your food will be low carbohydrate. So low carbohydrates
- **[07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTpnF4V8stA&t=444s)** — require less insulin to either be injected or for your own body to produce insulin.
- **[07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTpnF4V8stA&t=451s)** — Because as type ones, we're exactly the same as people with no diabetes and our
- **[07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTpnF4V8stA&t=455s)** — requirements, except we just know how much insulin and non diabetic body would need for
- **[07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTpnF4V8stA&t=460s)** — the same for the same requirements. So a fat burning body has to have low insulin levels
- **[07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTpnF4V8stA&t=468s)** — in order to release the fat. Am I still with me? Yeah, yeah. So basically, in order to
- **[07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTpnF4V8stA&t=476s)** — get into the fat burning, we must lower insulin. That's really the key factor, right?
- **[08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTpnF4V8stA&t=481s)** — So then then we can free up the fat burning and when we're adapted and takes about two to
- **[08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTpnF4V8stA&t=487s)** — three weeks to fully adapt, some people would say it takes even longer. And then your body
- **[08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTpnF4V8stA&t=493s)** — will naturally burn fat quite happily produce ketone bodies and have a very low requirement
- **[08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTpnF4V8stA&t=498s)** — for sugar. The important thing about glucose or sugar is that we don't need to eat sugar
- **[08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTpnF4V8stA&t=504s)** — in order to produce it. Our body will produce more than enough for our requirements.
- **[08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTpnF4V8stA&t=508s)** — And an obvious example of that is those poor people that get pulled out of disaster zones,
- **[08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTpnF4V8stA&t=513s)** — like earthquake zones, and they haven't eaten for six or seven days, but they haven't expired
- **[08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTpnF4V8stA&t=518s)** — because they are producing enough energy for their body requirements, some of which will be
- **[08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTpnF4V8stA&t=524s)** — sugar. So we respect the fact that our body is multi fuel. And we wanted to show in this
- **[08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTpnF4V8stA&t=530s)** — 100 mile run that we can safely use ketone bodies and fat as fuel and have no requirement for
- **[08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTpnF4V8stA&t=539s)** — insulin. Sorry, no requirement for sugar at all. Incredible. Okay, so there are a lot of people
- **[09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTpnF4V8stA&t=546s)** — that are trying to lose more weight. They're plateaued. I've been telling people
- **[09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTpnF4V8stA&t=551s)** — the most you can lose for a week is two pounds of fat. That's if you're healthy.
- **[09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTpnF4V8stA&t=557s)** — But this experiment that you did, if I'm not mistaken, correct me if I'm wrong, but I think
- **[09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTpnF4V8stA&t=563s)** — on average, all of you lost about what almost almost seven pounds of fat in five days, right?
- **[09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTpnF4V8stA&t=570s)** — Yes. Okay. So to get into this keto adaptation, obviously, you're going to have to either
- **[09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTpnF4V8stA&t=578s)** — lower your carbs. And of course, fasting is lowering your carbs. Yes. And, and then on top
- **[09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTpnF4V8stA&t=585s)** — of everything else you're exercising. So if someone were even to think about doing fast,
- **[09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTpnF4V8stA&t=592s)** — do you have to work up to it? I mean, you're not going to just start running and not eating
- **[09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTpnF4V8stA&t=598s)** — right away. I mean, you're going to have to you said it takes weeks to get into the keto
- **[10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTpnF4V8stA&t=603s)** — adaptation or fat adaptation. Tell us a little bit about how someone can work on getting
- **[10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTpnF4V8stA&t=610s)** — themselves into the keto adaptation state. Is it just a matter of low carbs? Or do you have
- **[10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTpnF4V8stA&t=615s)** — maybe combine fasting at the same time? Both are very useful to do. The only way you're
- **[10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTpnF4V8stA&t=621s)** — going to produce ketones being ketosis is to burn fat. And ketones are a natural product
- **[10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTpnF4V8stA&t=628s)** — of fat burning. So in order to fat burn, you have to lower your insulin. In order to lower
- **[10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTpnF4V8stA&t=632s)** — your insulin, you have to reduce the main fuel that stimulates insulin, namely carbohydrates.
- **[10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTpnF4V8stA&t=638s)** — So carbohydrates are the prime driver in our diet for insulin production. So cutting down
- **[10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTpnF4V8stA&t=644s)** — carbohydrates is very important and severely restricting your carbohydrates to what we call
- **[10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTpnF4V8stA&t=649s)** — the ketogenic zone. So your body has then to burn fat, you have to force your body into fat
- **[10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTpnF4V8stA&t=654s)** — burning. That's around about 30 to 50 grams of carbs a day, which is about a tenth of
- **[10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTpnF4V8stA&t=659s)** — what most people would naturally eat. It's not difficult to do, but you have to sort of
- **[11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTpnF4V8stA&t=667s)** — you have to concentrate on it, especially if you're you like sugar or you're a little
- **[11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTpnF4V8stA&t=672s)** — addicted to sugar, it takes a little bit more willpower. Don't forget when your insulin levels
- **[11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTpnF4V8stA&t=677s)** — drop naturally as a result of not eating carbohydrates, you will actually urinate a
- **[11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTpnF4V8stA&t=684s)** — little bit more because your insulin will enable your body to excrete salt or sodium.
- **[11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTpnF4V8stA&t=689s)** — And with the salt goes the water. So it's important to replace the fluids and just drink
- **[11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTpnF4V8stA&t=694s)** — more. Some people say constipation is an issue. Fluids are very, very good for that. And it
- **[11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTpnF4V8stA&t=699s)** — doesn't last, it only lasts a few days if at all. And the other thing is you may need to think
- **[11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTpnF4V8stA&t=704s)** — about replacing some of your salts, magnesium, sodium table salt or whatever, because of this
- **[11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTpnF4V8stA&t=710s)** — salt excretion caused by the lower levels of insulin. And after that, it's pretty
- **[11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTpnF4V8stA&t=715s)** — straightforward. You go into ketosis within days. Type 1, we can go into ketosis after
- **[12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTpnF4V8stA&t=722s)** — the first meal because we have to inject our insulin so we don't have to wait for it to
- **[12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTpnF4V8stA&t=725s)** — in some ways. And fasting is useful because it makes you much more insulin sensitive.
- **[12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTpnF4V8stA&t=734s)** — So if you're fasting, you become more sensitive to the insulin you've got. So you'll naturally
- **[12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTpnF4V8stA&t=739s)** — be more able to get into ketosis. And that's it really. One of the big breakthroughs I had,
- **[12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTpnF4V8stA&t=745s)** — so when I learned about the ketogenic diet, just completely by accident, thank goodness
- **[12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTpnF4V8stA&t=750s)** — through the internet, you know, I'm a medical professional, I've never heard of it in the
- **[12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTpnF4V8stA&t=753s)** — materials that we're given. I started doing a half marathon a month, I thought that was good
- **[12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTpnF4V8stA&t=760s)** — for me, because I'm not really an athlete in many ways. I'm just an enthusiastic jogger.
- **[12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTpnF4V8stA&t=764s)** — And I thought, well, if I do a half marathon a month as a keto, that'd be a great
- **[12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTpnF4V8stA&t=767s)** — experiment. So the first two, I actually fueled up with protein, bacon, eggs or whatever.
- **[12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTpnF4V8stA&t=773s)** — And I thought, well, you've got to have some energy before you start running. You know,
- **[12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTpnF4V8stA&t=777s)** — that's what we're all was told. You've got to carb up, you know, you've got to have your
- **[13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTpnF4V8stA&t=780s)** — fat mass and your bananas or whatever, if you're carving up. So I thought, well,
- **[13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTpnF4V8stA&t=783s)** — I'll have that. And then I got involved in the bulletproof coffees, which are a bit of a
- **[13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTpnF4V8stA&t=786s)** — fad at the time in the sense of butter and coconut oil in your coffee. And then on the
- **[13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTpnF4V8stA&t=792s)** — third one, finally, finally, you know, stupid me, I thought, well, why am I actually giving
- **[13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTpnF4V8stA&t=798s)** — myself energy before I'm running, filling my stomach up, and then diverting blood flow away
- **[13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTpnF4V8stA&t=803s)** — from my muscles, if you like, when I'd worked out that with my body fat mass, I had 85,000
- **[13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTpnF4V8stA&t=811s)** — calories of fat, and I have a body mass index of 23. Plus I have 85,000 calories, I have
- **[13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTpnF4V8stA&t=819s)** — 17% fat mass. So it worked out about 85,000, I think. So that's our average sort of fat mass.
- **[13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTpnF4V8stA&t=826s)** — And so I thought, well, why can't I just burn the fat that I've got? Well, I take it in,
- **[13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTpnF4V8stA&t=830s)** — if you see what I mean. So it took a while to get out of the habit of doing physical activity for
- **[13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTpnF4V8stA&t=836s)** — doing sort of fueling up for physical activity. I thought, well, I've got the fuel,
- **[14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTpnF4V8stA&t=841s)** — all I'm doing is just burning it at probably, you know, my slow jogging speed, twice the rate
- **[14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTpnF4V8stA&t=846s)** — that I'm burning it when I'm walking. So it wasn't a big deal to think, well, you can fast,
- **[14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTpnF4V8stA&t=851s)** — actually, when you're doing physical activity. And of course, that was wonderful from the
- **[14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTpnF4V8stA&t=860s)** — worry about injecting insulin when you're having carbs. So that really freaked things up.
- **[14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTpnF4V8stA&t=867s)** — So on top of that, I thought, well, let's just extend the half marathon and try to just sort
- **[14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTpnF4V8stA&t=872s)** — of nudge the envelope to put beyond doubt this concern that type ones need insulin,
- **[14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTpnF4V8stA&t=879s)** — need carbs, carbohydrates, if they're taking insulin, and put beyond doubt the fact that if
- **[14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTpnF4V8stA&t=883s)** — you're in nutritional ketosis, it's not a risk for what's called diabetic ketoacidosis,
- **[14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTpnF4V8stA&t=889s)** — which is a very severe complication of type one diabetes. And the two aren't the same thing,
- **[14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTpnF4V8stA&t=894s)** — but they're often confused by clinicians as nutritional ketosis will lead to diabetic
- **[15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTpnF4V8stA&t=901s)** — ketoacidosis. Oh, okay. So let's talk about this because this is a complex topic. We'll
- **[15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTpnF4V8stA&t=905s)** — simplify it. Tell us in simple terms to a fifth grader, what is ketoacidosis?
- **[15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTpnF4V8stA&t=912s)** — Okay. So if your body is not producing insulin at all, you cannot then
- **[15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTpnF4V8stA&t=921s)** — put glucose anywhere. So any food that you eat or any sugar that your body is producing
- **[15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTpnF4V8stA&t=928s)** — naturally cannot be put into cells effectively. So you can't get rid of sugar in the blood.
- **[15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTpnF4V8stA&t=935s)** — So if the sugar can't be removed from the blood into the cells, the cells are relatively
- **[15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTpnF4V8stA&t=941s)** — starved of energy. So then because insulin is not existent, so this is a type one problem,
- **[15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTpnF4V8stA&t=946s)** — it's purely a type one problem. If insulin is not existent, then you cannot store fat,
- **[15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTpnF4V8stA&t=952s)** — you have to burn fat. So not only do you build up a blood glucose, but you get a runaway
- **[15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTpnF4V8stA&t=957s)** — fat burning. Now ketones normally feed back all of this process and stop themselves rising
- **[16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTpnF4V8stA&t=965s)** — all the time. And they make the body produce more insulin, but if you've got no insulin,
- **[16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTpnF4V8stA&t=970s)** — you can't stop that process. So you get a combination of high blood sugar, high ketones,
- **[16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTpnF4V8stA&t=975s)** — which the body tries to vent by getting you to breathe them out or pee them out. And also you
- **[16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTpnF4V8stA&t=980s)** — pass a lot of urine because your sugars in your kidneys is so concentrated, it drags the
- **[16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTpnF4V8stA&t=986s)** — fluid out with it. And that makes you thirsty. So that becomes a medical emergency.
- **[16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTpnF4V8stA&t=993s)** — Even people like myself who are in nutritional ketosis are at risk because sometimes if you
- **[16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTpnF4V8stA&t=998s)** — get septicemia or a very severe infection, it means you need a huge amount more insulin.
- **[16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTpnF4V8stA&t=1003s)** — And a lot of us are a little bit resistant to taking that. So for example, when I had COVID,
- **[16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTpnF4V8stA&t=1008s)** — which was only like a cold for me, luckily, my insulin requirements went up from 20 units
- **[16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTpnF4V8stA&t=1014s)** — a day to 60 units a day. So a person with no diabetes would have the same insulin
- **[17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTpnF4V8stA&t=1021s)** — requirement, but they would not go into ketoacidosis because they got natural insulin
- **[17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTpnF4V8stA&t=1026s)** — on board to protect themselves. We have to inject it. So it's totally different to
- **[17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTpnF4V8stA&t=1030s)** — nutritional ketosis, which is just a lowering of the insulin that you inject or your natural
- **[17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTpnF4V8stA&t=1036s)** — insulin. And it's just a regulated process. If you've got insulin in your body, it's
- **[17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTpnF4V8stA&t=1041s)** — sufficient. You will not go into diabetic ketoacidosis. So the risk of getting ketoacidosis
- **[17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTpnF4V8stA&t=1046s)** — really is if you're diabetic and you do forget to take your insulin. Yes. An average
- **[17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTpnF4V8stA&t=1053s)** — a healthy person starts a ketogenic diet and someone mentions, well, usually you're going
- **[17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTpnF4V8stA&t=1058s)** — to see this in the news. Oh yeah. You might develop ketoacidosis. That's pretty much a
- **[17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTpnF4V8stA&t=1063s)** — myth. Yes. 100%. It doesn't work with the science. Got it. Yeah, I know. I've seen that
- **[17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTpnF4V8stA&t=1073s)** — so many times. Now, as far as this adaptation into just keto adapted or fat adapted, you
- **[18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTpnF4V8stA&t=1082s)** — work with patients, I'm guessing you probably help them with their getting out of ketogenic
- **[18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTpnF4V8stA&t=1087s)** — diet. I'm guessing. Do you find that some people have a harder time fasting for a
- **[18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTpnF4V8stA&t=1093s)** — longer period of time than others, or is that dependent on insulin resistance and
- **[18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTpnF4V8stA&t=1096s)** — it's just a matter of time and doing it over a period of time where they can
- **[18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTpnF4V8stA&t=1100s)** — go longer and longer without eating? Or what's your experience on that? My personal
- **[18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTpnF4V8stA&t=1104s)** — experience of fasting was that it was quite difficult in the early stages. It's
- **[18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTpnF4V8stA&t=1108s)** — difficult getting through the first 24 hours because I think psychologically you're
- **[18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTpnF4V8stA&t=1113s)** — geared to have a hard time. You think you're going to have a hard time. And I think when
- **[18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTpnF4V8stA&t=1117s)** — your body suddenly gets this shock of not eating, it makes you hungry. But I think
- **[18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTpnF4V8stA&t=1124s)** — most of it is psychology. And certainly when I did my first fast, I was lying around in
- **[18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTpnF4V8stA&t=1130s)** — the afternoon. I started my fast in the morning thinking, oh, pull me. I'm hungry. I
- **[18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTpnF4V8stA&t=1138s)** — effect and it becomes normal. And from day two onwards with subsequent fasts,
- **[19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTpnF4V8stA&t=1143s)** — there's no hunger at all. And the choice to break the fast was just really you got to eat
- **[19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTpnF4V8stA&t=1149s)** — at some point, if you see what I mean. So subsequent fast became much easier to do.
- **[19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTpnF4V8stA&t=1156s)** — Because you were aware of the changes in your body. The trick was to dial down your insulin
- **[19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTpnF4V8stA&t=1161s)** — because you were not requiring as much insulin when you were fasting. So the trick was to
- **[19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTpnF4V8stA&t=1166s)** — insulin levels down to a safe level for you to not have hypose when you're exercising.
- **[19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTpnF4V8stA&t=1172s)** — But it was not difficult to do. Okay. And then what about... so then we put this layer
- **[19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTpnF4V8stA&t=1179s)** — on top of the fasting, this exercise. You know, people are... they have this idea that
- **[19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTpnF4V8stA&t=1186s)** — they have to eat, like you mentioned, they have to eat to get the energy to exercise. But
- **[19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTpnF4V8stA&t=1191s)** — once you're keto adapted after some weeks, you probably can then exercise and fast at the same
- **[19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTpnF4V8stA&t=1198s)** — time and get your fuel from fat. That's exactly what I do all the time. It's so much easier to
- **[20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTpnF4V8stA&t=1207s)** — manage physical activity when you're fasted. I mean, if you think about it, wild animals,
- **[20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTpnF4V8stA&t=1214s)** — you never see an eagle flying to hunt if it's not hungry. I mean, we tend as humans to go and get
- **[20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTpnF4V8stA&t=1223s)** — our food when we're hungry, because there's more of a desperation to go and get it.
- **[20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTpnF4V8stA&t=1227s)** — And then we will eat our food, satiate ourselves, and then we're just naturally
- **[20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTpnF4V8stA&t=1233s)** — lazy, aren't we, humans? So we wouldn't actually go out if we've got a cupboard full or if our
- **[20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTpnF4V8stA&t=1237s)** — tummies are full. So I don't think it's unusual to be exercising when you're fasting.
- **[20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTpnF4V8stA&t=1242s)** — And because you have such a store of fat in your body, it's 85,000 calories compared to say,
- **[20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTpnF4V8stA&t=1250s)** — 2000 calories of stored sugar, which is there more for some energy requirements.
- **[20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTpnF4V8stA&t=1258s)** — You don't need to worry about burning a couple of thousand calories of fat, which will be
- **[21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTpnF4V8stA&t=1264s)** — around 20 miles of walking or running. And you'll put that back on again when you get
- **[21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTpnF4V8stA&t=1270s)** — food source. So you're not talking of depleting your energy source to any significant amount.
- **[21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTpnF4V8stA&t=1277s)** — So I think that is the key to it. You just have to understand that nothing's going to
- **[21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTpnF4V8stA&t=1281s)** — happen in two or three days, five days of fasting. The reason we didn't go further than
- **[21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTpnF4V8stA&t=1286s)** — five days was because we were starting to worry then about, are we going to start breaking
- **[21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTpnF4V8stA&t=1291s)** — down protein? Because at some point, you're going to run out of your sugar stores and you're
- **[21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTpnF4V8stA&t=1299s)** — sugar that your body naturally needs to produce. So we wanted to restrict it to five days.
- **[21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTpnF4V8stA&t=1306s)** — So we were pretty sure we wouldn't be burning any protein because at some point, you're going
- **[21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTpnF4V8stA&t=1311s)** — to be burning your muscle mass or your protein stores. And we generally think that muscle mass
- **[21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTpnF4V8stA&t=1317s)** — is useful to have more of than less of. So we didn't want to get into the situation
- **[22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTpnF4V8stA&t=1322s)** — where we were criticized for starving ourselves because this wasn't starved. But it was sort
- **[22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTpnF4V8stA&t=1328s)** — of starvation because we weren't eating. But it wasn't what I would call serious starvation
- **[22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTpnF4V8stA&t=1332s)** — because we were controlling the fat burning and not encouraging protein degradation.
- **[22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTpnF4V8stA&t=1338s)** — We had some breath testing to show that we're in fat burning mode at our respiratory
- **[22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTpnF4V8stA&t=1343s)** — quotient test. And it showed that all of us were in fat burning mode all of the time.
- **[22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTpnF4V8stA&t=1347s)** — So that was quite good. And then you also tested your ketones. So typically, I know
- **[22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTpnF4V8stA&t=1353s)** — there's a couple different values. But the values that they use in the US would be probably
- **[22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTpnF4V8stA&t=1360s)** — a little more helpful. But if you're just doing a low carb diet, you're going to be
- **[22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTpnF4V8stA&t=1363s)** — within a certain range, like maybe 0.3 to maybe one to maybe two. And then you start fasting,
- **[22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTpnF4V8stA&t=1372s)** — you're going to be higher. If you had exercise, you're going to go higher. Can you just
- **[22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTpnF4V8stA&t=1375s)** — tell me roughly kind of how that works a little bit? Yeah. So 75% of people with type
- **[23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTpnF4V8stA&t=1380s)** — 1 diabetes are in the range 0.5 to 1.5. That's the blood ketones. That's pretty average.
- **[23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTpnF4V8stA&t=1388s)** — I would argue it's more difficult to get into ketosis as a type 1 because we have to inject
- **[23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTpnF4V8stA&t=1392s)** — insulin. And we tend to have to use more insulin because we put it into the skin and
- **[23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTpnF4V8stA&t=1396s)** — it doesn't act as naturally as it does in some of no diabetes. So that does tend to block
- **[23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTpnF4V8stA&t=1401s)** — a bit of fat burning. But we can get saved into ketosis. When we did the run, my ketones
- **[23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTpnF4V8stA&t=1408s)** — went up to six, five and a half, six or something like that for a couple of days.
- **[23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTpnF4V8stA&t=1414s)** — My other friend, John, the other type one who was running with me, he's went up to around
- **[23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTpnF4V8stA&t=1419s)** — about the same. We wanted to test ketones twice a day for five days. And we wanted every one
- **[23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTpnF4V8stA&t=1425s)** — of the eight participants to do the same because we wanted to show that you don't go
- **[23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTpnF4V8stA&t=1432s)** — into deep diabetic ketoacidosis if you're in nutritional ketosis. So when we pulled the
- **[23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTpnF4V8stA&t=1438s)** — graph of eight people twice a day for five days and just did a bar chart, you could not
- **[24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTpnF4V8stA&t=1445s)** — tell the type ones from the non type ones out of that group of eight. So we were confident
- **[24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTpnF4V8stA&t=1453s)** — that we were in the same nutritional ketosis state as our non diabetic peers.
- **[24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTpnF4V8stA&t=1459s)** — The other interesting thing that I heard or read in your website that as far as you would
- **[24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTpnF4V8stA&t=1465s)** — think that people would get extremely sore and really have to spend more time recovering.
- **[24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTpnF4V8stA&t=1473s)** — Wasn't there a point about there was not much soreness going on, which was very unusual?
- **[24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTpnF4V8stA&t=1480s)** — It was unusual. When we started, we were pretty confident that we'd be okay when we
- **[24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTpnF4V8stA&t=1485s)** — started. It was a bit tricky in the early stages, but not one of us had any injuries
- **[24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTpnF4V8stA&t=1490s)** — at all. None of us had recovery problems. We all managed every single day to complete our task.
- **[24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTpnF4V8stA&t=1498s)** — None of us had any aches or pains the next day, which was remarkable.
- **[25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTpnF4V8stA&t=1504s)** — Last year, about this time of year, I did a 150 mile run in a week. It was along the
- **[25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTpnF4V8stA&t=1509s)** — canal network of Britain, so it was flat. Equally, I was on a keto diet then. I wasn't
- **[25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTpnF4V8stA&t=1516s)** — equally, I had no injuries or no soreness at all. It seems to me that the anti-inflammatory
- **[25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTpnF4V8stA&t=1521s)** — effect of ketones is very powerful in sport. I've met lots of people. I've interviewed a
- **[25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTpnF4V8stA&t=1528s)** — professional rugby union player in the UK. He said when he went keto, he had type 1 diabetes.
- **[25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTpnF4V8stA&t=1536s)** — He had his best year as far as injuries went in the year after he started his diet.
- **[25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTpnF4V8stA&t=1541s)** — So there's something about keto which is anti-inflammatory and good for recovery.
- **[25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTpnF4V8stA&t=1547s)** — Fascinating. What's the longest you've ever... like I know,
- **[25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTpnF4V8stA&t=1552s)** — we're talking about 100 miles or 150 miles. What's the most you've ever ran
- **[25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTpnF4V8stA&t=1556s)** — in over a period of days? I guess in a row.
- **[26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTpnF4V8stA&t=1562s)** — Well, the longest distance I've ever run is 35 miles. That's the longest I've ever run.
- **[26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTpnF4V8stA&t=1568s)** — That's one day.
- **[26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTpnF4V8stA&t=1569s)** — One day. That was a run walk rather than the run, more like an ultra marathon type of thing.
- **[26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTpnF4V8stA&t=1574s)** — Mostly I just do 10K, 15K. I'm not a great fan of long distances in that sense.
- **[26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTpnF4V8stA&t=1583s)** — I'm not worried about doing 20 miles a day. It wouldn't worry me. But it takes a lot of
- **[26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTpnF4V8stA&t=1589s)** — time to keep practicing for that. So I'm a bit lazy in that sense.
- **[26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTpnF4V8stA&t=1592s)** — You're pretty a lean guy, right?
- **[26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTpnF4V8stA&t=1593s)** — Yes.
- **[26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTpnF4V8stA&t=1594s)** — So you still had how many calories of fat on your body with your lean body mass?
- **[26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTpnF4V8stA&t=1600s)** — Well, I had a normal body fat mass for my type and it was 85,000 calories.
- **[26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTpnF4V8stA&t=1606s)** — 85,000 calories and someone who doesn't have a weight problem.
- **[26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTpnF4V8stA&t=1610s)** — So that's plenty of extra energy to be able to do this activity.
- **[26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTpnF4V8stA&t=1616s)** — I think that's exactly it, isn't it? It's just getting the mindset right. And as I said,
- **[26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTpnF4V8stA&t=1619s)** — it took me quite a long time to realize that I can actually do physical activity without
- **[27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTpnF4V8stA&t=1626s)** — fueling it first. I could fuel it when I was doing it and not have to worry.
- **[27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTpnF4V8stA&t=1630s)** — And that is so freeing, especially anyone who has type 1 diabetes. You don't have to worry.
- **[27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTpnF4V8stA&t=1635s)** — So if someone came up to me and said, now, would you like to go for a run or would
- **[27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTpnF4V8stA&t=1639s)** — you like to go for a cycle ride? I'd say, yes, let's go. I wouldn't say, oh, my goodness,
- **[27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTpnF4V8stA&t=1643s)** — what am I doing with my insulin? I'd obviously check it and I'll carry sugar,
- **[27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTpnF4V8stA&t=1646s)** — glucose if I needed it. But I could go. I wouldn't need to prepare for it.
- **[27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTpnF4V8stA&t=1651s)** — And it's that spontaneity, certainly in type 1, that is so freeing for people.
- **[27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTpnF4V8stA&t=1656s)** — Wow. When people do marathons, I know they consume, I guess it's called,
- **[27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTpnF4V8stA&t=1661s)** — is it called goo or this gel? It's some type of starch or glucose. That creates a lot of
- **[27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTpnF4V8stA&t=1667s)** — digestive issues and a lot of side effects when they're running. I've heard anyway.
- **[27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTpnF4V8stA&t=1671s)** — I don't know if you've observed that. Certainly. I mean, before I went into the
- **[27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTpnF4V8stA&t=1677s)** — ketogenic lifestyle diet, I used carbs the same way as everyone else, because no one had told me.
- **[28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTpnF4V8stA&t=1683s)** — And obviously, the conventional way of managing diabetes with physical activity is to manage
- **[28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTpnF4V8stA&t=1689s)** — your insulin on board, which is the big problem. So if you've got too much insulin on board,
- **[28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTpnF4V8stA&t=1695s)** — which most of us have most of the time because of the way we inject it under our skin,
- **[28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTpnF4V8stA&t=1699s)** — not into a natural space, you're vulnerable to hypos. So the protocol for managing type 1 sports
- **[28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTpnF4V8stA&t=1707s)** — is to reduce your insulin even the night before and add carbohydrates to your fuelling
- **[28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTpnF4V8stA&t=1714s)** — regime. 60 grams of carbohydrates per hour is recommended. Imagine trying to eat that
- **[28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTpnF4V8stA&t=1720s)** — much when you're trying to do physical activity, because our stomachs really should be empty.
- **[28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTpnF4V8stA&t=1725s)** — My mum told me when I was eight that I shouldn't go swimming after a meal, because our bodies don't...
- **[28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTpnF4V8stA&t=1732s)** — we can't exercise as well when we've got fuel in our gut. Really, it needs to be in the
- **[28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTpnF4V8stA&t=1737s)** — right place. So it's so much easier. Yes, and you don't have that anymore. That's not an
- **[29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTpnF4V8stA&t=1743s)** — issue. If you do happen to go hypo, it's six grams of carbs or something. It's absolutely
- **[29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTpnF4V8stA&t=1749s)** — nothing. There's a lot of different versions of keto. I'm just curious what kind of
- **[29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTpnF4V8stA&t=1755s)** — diet you're in. I go from different ideas to different ideas. At the moment, I'm more
- **[29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTpnF4V8stA&t=1762s)** — carnivore than I have been for a while. I will eat green leafy vegetables and salads.
- **[29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTpnF4V8stA&t=1770s)** — I do eat fish and dairy. Nuts, I'm a little bit wary of because I think they cause insulin
- **[29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTpnF4V8stA&t=1775s)** — resistance. Some of the nut oils in me personally, and probably some of the oxalates
- **[29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTpnF4V8stA&t=1781s)** — joint pains. A little bit wary of that. I avoid all seed oils of any sort. And obviously,
- **[29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTpnF4V8stA&t=1790s)** — I don't eat sugar or anything like that. And I do take dairy. I find that milk and cream
- **[29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTpnF4V8stA&t=1797s)** — aren't very good, but cheese is okay. And for some reason, yoghurt seemed to be okay.
- **[30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTpnF4V8stA&t=1802s)** — So it's a mixed diet. At the moment, tending to carnivore, I can never make my mind up on
- **[30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTpnF4V8stA&t=1808s)** — protein. I'm still the jury's out for me on protein. I've been doing the Bernstein type of
- **[30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTpnF4V8stA&t=1814s)** — more protein than fat type of thing for a while. And then I felt that I don't know, I mean,
- **[30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTpnF4V8stA&t=1820s)** — I've gotten more fat than protein for now. But I always stick roughly within I'm 75 kilograms.
- **[30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTpnF4V8stA&t=1826s)** — And I last time I estimated the amount of protein over a week, it was 100 grams of
- **[30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTpnF4V8stA&t=1833s)** — per day. So 1.2 grams of protein per kilogram of ideal body weight. Most people would say 0.75
- **[30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTpnF4V8stA&t=1841s)** — to one. So it's on the higher side. But yeah, that's what I do. I find that some foods,
- **[30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTpnF4V8stA&t=1849s)** — certainly the leafy veg can be a little bit carby. And you have to be a little bit more
- **[30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTpnF4V8stA&t=1853s)** — careful with your blood sugar control. I do find that meat, fish, eggs are the easiest
- **[31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTpnF4V8stA&t=1860s)** — foods to use. There's no doubt about that. But I do eat a variety of foods as well.
- **[31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTpnF4V8stA&t=1870s)** — Alcohol, I've gone off it, strangely. I used to drink like red wine, Prosecco. I love beer,
- **[31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTpnF4V8stA&t=1876s)** — but I can't drink it anymore. I'll have probably two glasses if I'm out on a nice
- **[31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTpnF4V8stA&t=1880s)** — summer's day with friends or something. Because that's just what you do.
- **[31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTpnF4V8stA&t=1884s)** — Especially in the UK.
- **[31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTpnF4V8stA&t=1885s)** — Exactly. You have to live your life. Yeah, that's right. Sunny in the UK.
- **[31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTpnF4V8stA&t=1888s)** — And but alcohol, I find that it's just my body tells me I don't need it. But I have drunk it
- **[31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTpnF4V8stA&t=1895s)** — in the past and I will drink it. But it's not something that features heavily in my diet
- **[31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTpnF4V8stA&t=1900s)** — anymore. You used to more five, six years ago, probably. Yeah, me too. I can't tolerate
- **[31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTpnF4V8stA&t=1906s)** — any more than a six pack on a weekend. I can't tolerate any more than that. But no,
- **[31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTpnF4V8stA&t=1911s)** — I don't drink at all anymore. But wow, this has been fascinating. I think I want to send a
- **[31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTpnF4V8stA&t=1918s)** — lot of people to your website. I'm going to put your link down below. But thank you for coming
- **[32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTpnF4V8stA&t=1922s)** — on. And I really appreciate this. These insights on this crazy thing you did, which actually is
- **[32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTpnF4V8stA&t=1927s)** — not very crazy. You know, it goes against what's called what medical wisdom, which I don't
- **[32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTpnF4V8stA&t=1932s)** — even think is wisdom, right? It's just, again, there's certain fixed ideas that the
- **[32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTpnF4V8stA&t=1938s)** — medical profession has that end up, you know, not being 100% true. So this has been
- **[32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTpnF4V8stA&t=1943s)** — fascinating. Thank you so much. Thank you very much. Thank you.
- **[32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTpnF4V8stA&t=1950s)** — Thank you.

- **[00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6rjL0Lxn3Q&t=0s)** — How to lose weight without changing your diet one bit.
- **[00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6rjL0Lxn3Q&t=5s)** — Let's first talk about exercise. Jumping rope.
- **[00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6rjL0Lxn3Q&t=8s)** — At rest, you're burning about 50 calories, but when you're jumping rope,
- **[00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6rjL0Lxn3Q&t=11s)** — you burn about 560 calories per hour.
- **[00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6rjL0Lxn3Q&t=15s)** — One pound of fat is 3,500 calories.
- **[00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6rjL0Lxn3Q&t=18s)** — You would have to jump rope for 5.3 hours to burn one pound of fat.
- **[00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6rjL0Lxn3Q&t=24s)** — Let's say we wanted to walk off one pound of fat.
- **[00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6rjL0Lxn3Q&t=26s)** — You burn 340 an hour walking briskly, which means you would need to walk 10.2 hours.
- **[00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6rjL0Lxn3Q&t=32s)** — Next activity is laughing. For every 10 minutes of laughing,
- **[00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6rjL0Lxn3Q&t=36s)** — you can burn off an extra 40 calories. To burn off one pound of fat,
- **[00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6rjL0Lxn3Q&t=40s)** — you're going to have to laugh for about 14 and a half hours.
- **[00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6rjL0Lxn3Q&t=43s)** — Let's move on to the next one. Fidgeting.
- **[00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6rjL0Lxn3Q&t=45s)** — You can actually burn an extra 50 calories per hour.
- **[00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6rjL0Lxn3Q&t=49s)** — Just by fidgeting for 70 hours, you can burn off one pound of fat.
- **[00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6rjL0Lxn3Q&t=53s)** — Moving right along to the ice bath. When you go into an ice bath,
- **[00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6rjL0Lxn3Q&t=55s)** — for 15 minutes, you can burn an extra 250 calories.
- **[01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6rjL0Lxn3Q&t=61s)** — But if you're between, let's say, 45 to 50 degrees Fahrenheit,
- **[01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6rjL0Lxn3Q&t=65s)** — spending 14 sessions, which is basically doing it every day for two weeks,
- **[01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6rjL0Lxn3Q&t=70s)** — you could potentially lose one pound of fat.
- **[01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6rjL0Lxn3Q&t=73s)** — The reason why you burn fat is your body has to maintain this core temperature.
- **[01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6rjL0Lxn3Q&t=77s)** — So it's going to do whatever it can to keep you warm,
- **[01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6rjL0Lxn3Q&t=80s)** — and it's going to generate a lot of heat.
- **[01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6rjL0Lxn3Q&t=82s)** — And that's how you burn calories when you do the ice bath.
- **[01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6rjL0Lxn3Q&t=85s)** — You'll actually hear that if you breathe faster,
- **[01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6rjL0Lxn3Q&t=89s)** — okay, you can even burn more calories.
- **[01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6rjL0Lxn3Q&t=91s)** — To burn one pound of fat, you're going to have to breathe deeply for about 291 hours.
- **[01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6rjL0Lxn3Q&t=97s)** — Let's get to the next one. Sex. That's right, you can burn more calories with sex.
- **[01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6rjL0Lxn3Q&t=101s)** — You can actually burn four calories per minute.
- **[01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6rjL0Lxn3Q&t=104s)** — For every one hour of sex, you are burning 200 extra calories.
- **[01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6rjL0Lxn3Q&t=110s)** — So if you wanted to burn an extra pound of fat,
- **[01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6rjL0Lxn3Q&t=112s)** — you'd have to spend 14.58 hours of constant sex to burn off that one pound.
- **[01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6rjL0Lxn3Q&t=119s)** — Donating blood... when you donate blood, your body has to then make up that loss of blood.
- **[02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6rjL0Lxn3Q&t=125s)** — So it has to generate more energy to make up that blood.
- **[02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6rjL0Lxn3Q&t=128s)** — And so you can burn up an extra 350 calories.
- **[02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6rjL0Lxn3Q&t=131s)** — In 14 sessions of donating blood, you can lose a pound of fat.
- **[02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6rjL0Lxn3Q&t=134s)** — As you're probably realizing, it's going to be very difficult to lose even one pound of fat
- **[02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6rjL0Lxn3Q&t=139s)** — without changing your diet.
- **[02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6rjL0Lxn3Q&t=142s)** — On top of that, if you're adding certain foods that you shouldn't be eating,
- **[02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6rjL0Lxn3Q&t=145s)** — Big Mac or fries or a Coke, think about how many extra calories
- **[02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6rjL0Lxn3Q&t=149s)** — that you're going to have to add on top of all these other things that you're doing
- **[02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6rjL0Lxn3Q&t=153s)** — that are going to make it very difficult to lose any weight.
- **[02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6rjL0Lxn3Q&t=157s)** — If one slice of pizza is 285 calories, well, you can run three miles to burn that off.
- **[02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6rjL0Lxn3Q&t=162s)** — If the Big Mac is 550 calories, you can bike for an hour to burn that off.
- **[02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6rjL0Lxn3Q&t=166s)** — But we're not talking about weight loss. We're just talking about breaking even.
- **[02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6rjL0Lxn3Q&t=169s)** — And that soda that's 270 calories, that's doing Zumba for 45 minutes.
- **[02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6rjL0Lxn3Q&t=175s)** — Just to break even, unfortunately, 15% of all the activities that I just mentioned
- **[03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6rjL0Lxn3Q&t=181s)** — contribute to your actual weight loss.
- **[03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6rjL0Lxn3Q&t=185s)** — Whereas 85% of the results from weight loss come from diet.
- **[03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6rjL0Lxn3Q&t=189s)** — You're going to have to change your diet. There is no other way.
- **[03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6rjL0Lxn3Q&t=193s)** — You cannot exercise your way out of a poor diet.
- **[03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6rjL0Lxn3Q&t=196s)** — I love exercise. I recommend it. I do it.
- **[03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6rjL0Lxn3Q&t=198s)** — But not necessarily for weight loss.
- **[03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6rjL0Lxn3Q&t=201s)** — What you get from exercise is higher fitness.
- **[03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6rjL0Lxn3Q&t=204s)** — You get better muscle tone.
- **[03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6rjL0Lxn3Q&t=206s)** — You get tremendous health benefits, but not necessarily a lot of weight loss.
- **[03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6rjL0Lxn3Q&t=212s)** — And unfortunately, when you see people to gym week after week,
- **[03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6rjL0Lxn3Q&t=215s)** — trying to exercise off their stomach or trying to lose weight with exercise,
- **[03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6rjL0Lxn3Q&t=219s)** — it's very tempting for me to go up to them to give them some advice.
- **[03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6rjL0Lxn3Q&t=223s)** — But since you're watching the video, I want to give you some advice.
- **[03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6rjL0Lxn3Q&t=226s)** — If you want to lose actual fat, okay, we're talking about fat, not just water weight.
- **[03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6rjL0Lxn3Q&t=231s)** — There's one really important thing you need to do.
- **[03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6rjL0Lxn3Q&t=234s)** — We have to keep insulin low.
- **[03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6rjL0Lxn3Q&t=236s)** — But the cool thing about doing that is your appetite and your cravings will go away.
- **[04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6rjL0Lxn3Q&t=241s)** — That'll make it really easy to do and stick with.
- **[04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6rjL0Lxn3Q&t=244s)** — Because if you don't do that, you're going to have a massive struggle
- **[04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6rjL0Lxn3Q&t=247s)** — trying to lose weight with being hungry all the time with cravings.
- **[04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6rjL0Lxn3Q&t=252s)** — And that is torturous.
- **[04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6rjL0Lxn3Q&t=254s)** — To reduce insulin, you must go on a low carb diet, the ketogenic diet,
- **[04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6rjL0Lxn3Q&t=259s)** — where the primary thing you do is just lower your carbohydrates, not just sugar.
- **[04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6rjL0Lxn3Q&t=264s)** — You're going to have to look at the label and make sure they're between 20 and 30 grams
- **[04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6rjL0Lxn3Q&t=270s)** — for the entire day.
- **[04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6rjL0Lxn3Q&t=272s)** — But it's very important to point out that we're not just talking about sugar.
- **[04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6rjL0Lxn3Q&t=275s)** — We're talking about carbohydrate, which includes sugar.
- **[04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6rjL0Lxn3Q&t=279s)** — And starches are those hidden sugars that will keep you from losing weight.
- **[04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6rjL0Lxn3Q&t=282s)** — That would be the bread, pasta, cereal, crackers, biscuits,
- **[04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6rjL0Lxn3Q&t=285s)** — and ingredients like maltodextrin, wheat flour.
- **[04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6rjL0Lxn3Q&t=288s)** — Some people get rid of all the carbs.
- **[04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6rjL0Lxn3Q&t=291s)** — They just eat meat, eggs, fish, cheese.
- **[04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6rjL0Lxn3Q&t=295s)** — That's called carnivore. They don't have any plants.
- **[04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6rjL0Lxn3Q&t=298s)** — It's very simple to do and they'll lose a lot of weight
- **[05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6rjL0Lxn3Q&t=300s)** — because they're bringing their carbs down to zero.
- **[05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6rjL0Lxn3Q&t=303s)** — We can also add in one more powerful thing
- **[05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6rjL0Lxn3Q&t=306s)** — to put your fat burning in hyper warp speed.
- **[05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6rjL0Lxn3Q&t=309s)** — That is intermittent fasting.
- **[05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6rjL0Lxn3Q&t=311s)** — Because as you lower your carbs, it's going to be easier to stick with it
- **[05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6rjL0Lxn3Q&t=315s)** — because you're going to lose your appetite.
- **[05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6rjL0Lxn3Q&t=317s)** — And then if you just eat when you're hungry,
- **[05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6rjL0Lxn3Q&t=319s)** — you're going to be able to go longer without eating
- **[05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6rjL0Lxn3Q&t=321s)** — because you're going to lose your appetite.
- **[05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6rjL0Lxn3Q&t=322s)** — You may find that one day you just are hungry for one meal.
- **[05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6rjL0Lxn3Q&t=325s)** — And the next day, maybe it's two meals.
- **[05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6rjL0Lxn3Q&t=328s)** — But then the following day, you're not even hungry at all.
- **[05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6rjL0Lxn3Q&t=331s)** — So you're literally going a couple days without even eating a meal.
- **[05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6rjL0Lxn3Q&t=335s)** — When you do intermittent fasting or prolonged fasting,
- **[05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6rjL0Lxn3Q&t=338s)** — you are definitely not starving yourself.
- **[05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6rjL0Lxn3Q&t=340s)** — You are living off of your own fat.
- **[05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6rjL0Lxn3Q&t=343s)** — This is how you burn fat and you fix a lot of other health problems.
- **[05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6rjL0Lxn3Q&t=347s)** — Your inflammation goes down.
- **[05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6rjL0Lxn3Q&t=348s)** — If you have high blood pressure, that'll start going down.
- **[05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6rjL0Lxn3Q&t=351s)** — Diabetes, that will kind of come back to normal.
- **[05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6rjL0Lxn3Q&t=354s)** — Depression, that will lift up and you'll feel better.
- **[05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6rjL0Lxn3Q&t=357s)** — If you were fatigued, now you have energy.
- **[06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6rjL0Lxn3Q&t=360s)** — What you need to know is carbohydrates block fat burning.
- **[06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6rjL0Lxn3Q&t=364s)** — They block weight loss.
- **[06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6rjL0Lxn3Q&t=366s)** — Trying to lose weight with exercise and these other activities
- **[06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6rjL0Lxn3Q&t=369s)** — is really only going to be a tiny piece of that puzzle.
- **[06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6rjL0Lxn3Q&t=373s)** — Full circle.
- **[06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6rjL0Lxn3Q&t=374s)** — Is it possible to lose weight without changing your diet?
- **[06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6rjL0Lxn3Q&t=379s)** — The answer is yes, but it's only a tiny bit of weight.

*Click any timestamp to jump to that moment in the video*

- **[00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eAHG8G0BbKI&t=0s)** — You know, I want to do this video on sticking to your healthy weight loss plan because recently I'm doing a search on how to stick to your program.
- **[00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eAHG8G0BbKI&t=11s)** — And the amount of terrible advice is just spread all through social media, the Internet, especially the first five pages of Google.
- **[00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eAHG8G0BbKI&t=21s)** — And it literally makes me nauseous to see what information is being put out there by people that have zero experience in this area.
- **[00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eAHG8G0BbKI&t=31s)** — If you try their advice, you're just going to fail miserably. And the big problem with that is every time you do a diet that doesn't work over a period of time,
- **[00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eAHG8G0BbKI&t=40s)** — your metabolism becomes slower and slower and slower to the point where you're on 500 calories a day and you're not losing any weight.
- **[00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eAHG8G0BbKI&t=53s)** — I've seen this in practice with certain people who have dieted as a child and it just literally destroys their ability to lose weight down the road.
- **[01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eAHG8G0BbKI&t=61s)** — So before I get into how to solve this problem once and for all, I just want to read a few things that you should never follow as far as just bad advice, right?
- **[01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eAHG8G0BbKI&t=74s)** — It says, don't deprive yourself of those things that you love to eat. Just eat in moderation. Keep a detailed log of everything you eat.
- **[01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eAHG8G0BbKI&t=82s)** — Well, I mean, who has time to do that? That's just... I mean, it's crazy. Drink more water, okay?
- **[01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eAHG8G0BbKI&t=88s)** — Fill up with water. Well, water is not very satisfying. And don't ever let yourself get hungry. Okay, so that would be just frequent meals.
- **[01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eAHG8G0BbKI&t=98s)** — Okay, so all of that is very stupid advice if you're trying to stick to a program. You know, this is just not about having willpower or having discipline.
- **[01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eAHG8G0BbKI&t=106s)** — Because even if you have willpower or you have discipline and you're driving down the street and you're hungry and you're craving and you see Chick-fil-A or Kentucky Fried Chicken or Taco Bell,
- **[01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eAHG8G0BbKI&t=117s)** — it's going to call your name, right? It's going to haunt you. Or you're going through a grocery store and you're walking past potato chips or the bakery section.
- **[02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eAHG8G0BbKI&t=128s)** — It's going to be torture. Or even at home. Let's say you're sitting watching TV late at night and you have something in the pantry that's calling your name.
- **[02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eAHG8G0BbKI&t=138s)** — Eric, do you read those? I don't care how much willpower you have or discipline. You're not going to be able to resist that for very long.
- **[02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eAHG8G0BbKI&t=146s)** — So let's just talk about hunger and cravings for a moment. There's two main hormones involved. You have ghrelin, which is the hunger hormone. Makes you hungry.
- **[02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eAHG8G0BbKI&t=158s)** — So we would want to decrease ghrelin. And then we want to increase this other hormone that makes you satisfied. It's called leptin.
- **[02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eAHG8G0BbKI&t=165s)** — So if you look these two up, you can just isolate the factors to balance these out to help you. And I'll just quickly get on the list.
- **[02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eAHG8G0BbKI&t=176s)** — So we want to get more sleep because we know if you're tired and you're not sleeping, you're going to crave more. You're going to be hungrier.
- **[03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eAHG8G0BbKI&t=183s)** — Decreasing sugar. Okay, we know about that. Having adequate amount of protein. Right? I've talked about that recently in several videos.
- **[03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eAHG8G0BbKI&t=190s)** — If you're deficient in protein, I mean, think about how much of your body is protein. Not only do you have muscles and you have ligaments and tendons and even part of your bone.
- **[03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eAHG8G0BbKI&t=201s)** — All the chemicals, the enzymes are all protein. So from a survival standpoint, your body is going to keep eating until you get enough protein.
- **[03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eAHG8G0BbKI&t=208s)** — So we also have fiber. Your microbes eat fiber. We have also the reduction of stress. The more stress you have, the hungrier you are.
- **[03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eAHG8G0BbKI&t=218s)** — And then we also have caffeine. A little bit of caffeine can satisfy you, but a large amount can make you hungry.
- **[03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eAHG8G0BbKI&t=225s)** — And then they'll mention medication, especially antidepressants, can really make you hungry. And then they talk about gastric bypass.
- **[03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eAHG8G0BbKI&t=233s)** — Another factor is the amount of fat that you eat. If you eat more fat, you'll be more satisfied and less hungry.
- **[04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eAHG8G0BbKI&t=240s)** — And then you also have the speed at which you eat. If you eat really fast, it can also alter these hormones.
- **[04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eAHG8G0BbKI&t=245s)** — So the slower you eat and you chew your food, it can put these hormones back into balance.
- **[04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eAHG8G0BbKI&t=251s)** — And of course, I already talked about decreasing sugar, but also decreasing carbs. You have the menstrual cycle as well.
- **[04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eAHG8G0BbKI&t=258s)** — So when you have the menstrual cycle, you have this shift in hormones that will make you crave.
- **[04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eAHG8G0BbKI&t=263s)** — If that's your situation, just as a side note, a little L-chiptofan will go a long way.
- **[04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eAHG8G0BbKI&t=270s)** — That can totally handle cravings when you have your menstrual cycle.
- **[04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eAHG8G0BbKI&t=274s)** — But anytime you take L-chiptofan, always take it in an empty stomach because it can compete with other proteins and it won't work if you have it with meals.
- **[04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eAHG8G0BbKI&t=281s)** — Another factor is eating nutrient dense foods, right? That's going to be more satisfying.
- **[04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eAHG8G0BbKI&t=286s)** — So that would include like omega-3 fatty acids, the trace minerals like zinc especially from like seafood, for example, or organ meats, or just higher quality like grass fed beef, things like that.
- **[05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eAHG8G0BbKI&t=301s)** — This next thing is really the big factor of this whole video. It says eat frequent small meals to prevent hunger.
- **[05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eAHG8G0BbKI&t=313s)** — If you've been watching my videos in the past, you'll know that if you take on this advice, it's going to be a big problem because every time you eat, you increase insulin.
- **[05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eAHG8G0BbKI&t=324s)** — And you start developing insulin resistance. And in the presence of insulin, you're not going to be able to burn fat.
- **[05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eAHG8G0BbKI&t=332s)** — And if you're not burning fat, you're not going to lose weight.
- **[05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eAHG8G0BbKI&t=334s)** — And if we just look at the importance between these two things, lowering your carbohydrates and also eating less frequent. Eating less frequent is way, way, way, way more important.
- **[05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eAHG8G0BbKI&t=346s)** — In other words, we're talking about intermittent fasting. If you have any problem losing weight and you don't implement intermittent fasting, I don't think you're going to be successful.
- **[06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eAHG8G0BbKI&t=360s)** — And if we just take a look simply at hunger and cravings, what are we really talking about?
- **[06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eAHG8G0BbKI&t=367s)** — We're trying to solve the problem of fuel in your cells because if there's not enough fuel in your cells, you're going to crave and you're going to be hungry.
- **[06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eAHG8G0BbKI&t=376s)** — That's what it's all about. So is there possibly a way to feed the cells fuel between the meals without eating?
- **[06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eAHG8G0BbKI&t=387s)** — And the answer is absolutely. We can feed the cells your own body fat.
- **[06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eAHG8G0BbKI&t=393s)** — You're never going to be able to do that in the presence of frequent meals because to get your body to burn fat, it's all dependent on lowering your insulin by lowering your carbohydrates and eating less frequent.
- **[06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eAHG8G0BbKI&t=408s)** — You see, to get your body to burn fat, you have to adapt to fat. It's called being fat adapted.
- **[06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eAHG8G0BbKI&t=414s)** — And that does take about two to three days to get into that state. But once you're in that state, your hunger goes away and your cravings will go away.
- **[07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eAHG8G0BbKI&t=426s)** — If you still have cravings or hunger, all that means is you're not adapted yet.
- **[07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eAHG8G0BbKI&t=432s)** — But when you know how to get your body adapted and you can start running on fat fuel and other things called ketones.
- **[07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eAHG8G0BbKI&t=440s)** — Ketones are basically a byproduct of fat being burned. And you're actually burning both fat and ketones when you're adapted.
- **[07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eAHG8G0BbKI&t=450s)** — And to do that, you have to lower insulin through lowering your carbs and sugar and also eating less frequent.
- **[07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eAHG8G0BbKI&t=456s)** — So that way, regardless of what environment you are in, if you're at a party, if you're at a social event,
- **[07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eAHG8G0BbKI&t=463s)** — if you're driving down the street and you see a fast food restaurant or you're in a grocery store and you see those chocolate brownies, you can control yourself.
- **[07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eAHG8G0BbKI&t=473s)** — You can walk past those brownies and not have this incredible impulse to have to have it.
- **[08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eAHG8G0BbKI&t=480s)** — Why? Because your cells are finally getting fuel, even though you're not eating anything.
- **[08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eAHG8G0BbKI&t=485s)** — And whether you have resistance to leptin, it's called leptin resistance, or insulin resistance, which then will make you hungry all the time,
- **[08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eAHG8G0BbKI&t=495s)** — that will be quickly fixed because getting on a ketogenic diet fixes both of those problems versus being in another condition where you're having these frequent meals to prevent hunger.
- **[08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eAHG8G0BbKI&t=506s)** — Your carbs are too high. You're going off your program too frequent. You're not doing intermittent fasting.
- **[08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eAHG8G0BbKI&t=513s)** — And you're literally trying to lose weight on top of cravings and hunger, which is literally torture.
- **[08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eAHG8G0BbKI&t=521s)** — So I really want this to sink in. If you want to be successful, when you see all these little tricks to try to stick to a diet, ignore those.
- **[08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eAHG8G0BbKI&t=533s)** — Because now you really know how to do it the correct way. Right now we have almost 8,000 success stories on my website.
- **[09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eAHG8G0BbKI&t=541s)** — You can read them. These are from actual people. I don't know any website that has that many success stories.
- **[09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eAHG8G0BbKI&t=547s)** — So how do you do it? A healthy version of the ketogenic diet, intermittent fasting.
- **[09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eAHG8G0BbKI&t=553s)** — You want to add other things in there too, like a little bit of alpacet of vinegar and water, which will help and make it easier.
- **[09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eAHG8G0BbKI&t=559s)** — Berberine also helps to speed things up. It's a natural herb.
- **[09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eAHG8G0BbKI&t=562s)** — And I have a really good video to get started on this to make it very simple. And I put it up right here. Check it out.

- **[00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlT081VhRLM&t=9s)** — And it's really only two simple ingredients. The most important thing to teach you today is not only how to get rid of it, but how to prevent it from coming back.
- **[00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlT081VhRLM&t=17s)** — Because a wart or a skin tag is the tip of the iceberg. First question is what is the difference between a skin tag and a wart?
- **[00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlT081VhRLM&t=23s)** — With a wart, you're dealing with a virus called HPV. This is why you don't want to scratch it or try to cut it off because then it can form into a cluster.
- **[00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlT081VhRLM&t=32s)** — A skin tag usually occurs in areas where there's friction, like in a certain fold in your body. We're going to use the same remedy for a skin tag and a wart. And I'm going to explain why that's going to work.
- **[00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlT081VhRLM&t=43s)** — When we're dealing with a wart, we have to look at the triggers. You have stress that weakens the immune system. But with the skin tag, we don't really have the immune system involved.
- **[00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlT081VhRLM&t=51s)** — Let's first talk about insulin. Insulin is going to make things grow. When someone's insulin is too high, they're more at risk for these skin tags.
- **[00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlT081VhRLM&t=59s)** — This is why there's such a higher risk for skin tags with diabetics, people that are overweight, and women who have PCOS. How do we lower insulin?
- **[01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlT081VhRLM&t=70s)** — The problem with insulin with most people is that the body is producing a lot more insulin because they have what's called insulin resistance.
- **[01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlT081VhRLM&t=78s)** — Insulin resistance is a situation where the person had high levels of insulin over a period of time, and the body is blocking that to a certain degree.
- **[01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlT081VhRLM&t=89s)** — As a way to compensate, the pancreas is going to make a lot more insulin. Two big reasons why people have too much insulin is they're eating too many carbs or they're eating too frequently.
- **[01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlT081VhRLM&t=99s)** — What's interesting about insulin resistance is that the body has a more difficult time absorbing glucose if there's resistance because that's one of the purposes of insulin is to help you pull in and receive glucose.
- **[01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlT081VhRLM&t=113s)** — When someone has insulin resistance, they have a much more difficult time absorbing sugar or glucose into the cells because that's one of the functions of insulin to be able to help you absorb glucose.
- **[02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlT081VhRLM&t=125s)** — The brain cells don't get fuel and then over time things get worse. Memory problems, concentration problems, early dementia.
- **[02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlT081VhRLM&t=132s)** — A very simple solution to this is just to give your body an alternative fuel source. Stop giving the body fuel that it can't really deal with or absorb right now.
- **[02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlT081VhRLM&t=142s)** — Give the body ketones, fatty acids, and protein. This way we can kill three birds with one stone. Fix the insulin resistance. What's creating it is consuming too many carbs.
- **[02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlT081VhRLM&t=154s)** — The body will finally get fuel that it needs to work correctly, especially your brain. And the need for insulin goes down.
- **[02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlT081VhRLM&t=161s)** — So now there's no reason for insulin to be high to grow things like a skin tag or a wart. So how do we do that? Very simply lower your carbohydrates and eat less frequently.
- **[02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlT081VhRLM&t=174s)** — That's called intermittent fasting. Those two things would not just help you lose weight. It's going to help something like PCOS. It's going to help diabetes and normalize insulin.
- **[03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlT081VhRLM&t=184s)** — This way we're getting to the actual root cause of this entire problem in the first place. Before we get into the remedy to get rid of the skin tag and wart, I need to explain one last little point.
- **[03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlT081VhRLM&t=194s)** — If you have a wart, you have a virus. And there's something really interesting about this virus, what it does to your immune system.
- **[03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlT081VhRLM&t=203s)** — This virus will come out of remission and create warts if the immune system is compromised. We talked about stress. We talked about insulin. We didn't talk about vitamin D.
- **[03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlT081VhRLM&t=213s)** — Yes, there are hundreds of different types of human papilloma viruses. Human papilloma virus 16 and 18 very specifically cause your vitamin D receptors to shut down.
- **[03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlT081VhRLM&t=230s)** — Maybe not 100%, but they downgrade the vitamin D receptor. The fact that you have the virus or the wart already means that you're probably low in vitamin D because that's what the virus is doing.
- **[04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlT081VhRLM&t=241s)** — It's creating an environment where it can thrive. These viruses are very intelligent. Obviously, they know that vitamin D is the most important vitamin to control the immune system.
- **[04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlT081VhRLM&t=250s)** — So if they can inhibit that to a certain degree and create a deficiency in you, the virus can thrive. The immune system is compromised.
- **[04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlT081VhRLM&t=258s)** — It's not going to be as strong because one of the purposes of the immune system is to kill viruses.
- **[04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlT081VhRLM&t=263s)** — It's interesting because a lot more people get warts during the winter months than the summer months. I wonder why that is. Vitamin D because there's not enough sun.
- **[04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlT081VhRLM&t=273s)** — Vitamin D is a very potent antiviral compound. When someone has sufficient vitamin D, they can put these viruses in remission for a very long time.
- **[04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlT081VhRLM&t=282s)** — The vitamin D will actually help reduce the risk of certain types of cancer, especially those related to human papilloma viruses.
- **[04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlT081VhRLM&t=289s)** — Just to make it really simple, I would highly recommend not taking any less than 10,000 IUs of vitamin D3 every single day, especially through the winter.
- **[05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlT081VhRLM&t=301s)** — Unless you live near the equator where you're going to get a lot of sun, if you live in the north. But 10 to maybe 20,000 IUs per day would be enough to put you in a good place.
- **[05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlT081VhRLM&t=311s)** — We talked about the root causes. Now let's talk about how to get rid of skin tags and warts very quickly.
- **[05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlT081VhRLM&t=317s)** — You're going to use two remedies. One is a certain type of iodine. I recommend that you get a very specific type from the drugstore because it will penetrate the skin much deeper.
- **[05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlT081VhRLM&t=328s)** — The question is what is this iodine doing to the skin tag? Well, it's dissolving the protein. Iodine is also very antiviral, antimicrobial.
- **[05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlT081VhRLM&t=337s)** — So that's why it's good for warts too. Iodine is a very powerful dehydrator as well. It's going to dehydrate the wart or the skin tag.
- **[05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlT081VhRLM&t=344s)** — And if you have excess estrogen, iodine is one of the most potent regulators of estrogen. This is why it's also good for things like fibrocystic breasts or ovarian cysts.
- **[05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlT081VhRLM&t=357s)** — Both conditions occur when you have too much estrogen. And you're also going to use garlic. You can simply just take a clove and crush it and you just need one little drop.
- **[06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlT081VhRLM&t=367s)** — What's in garlic that's so special? There's a compound called allicin. This compound is super powerful against viruses.
- **[06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlT081VhRLM&t=375s)** — Because a skin tag is similar to a wart and a lot of times you're misdiagnosed, we don't really know exactly which one is which.
- **[06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlT081VhRLM&t=382s)** — We're just going to add the garlic in there because the garlic isn't necessarily going to shrink the skin tag. It's going to mainly work on the wart.
- **[06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlT081VhRLM&t=390s)** — All you need to do is crush garlic. Take one drop of garlic in a little dish with one drop of this iodine.
- **[06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlT081VhRLM&t=397s)** — Then you're going to take a little Q-tip, mix it together really nicely, apply it to the wart or skin tag tissue and put a bandaid over it and forget about it.
- **[06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlT081VhRLM&t=408s)** — And you're simply going to repeat this every day until there's nothing left.
- **[06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlT081VhRLM&t=413s)** — Some people are shocked to see even after 24 hours how much is left.
- **[06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlT081VhRLM&t=418s)** — Both these remedies together are the most powerful things that I know of to shrink a skin tag or a wart.
- **[07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlT081VhRLM&t=423s)** — But if you're not seeing rapid change, then I would recommend something called salicylic acid, which is the main chemical in aspirin.
- **[07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlT081VhRLM&t=431s)** — You crush it, add a little water, take your Q-tip, apply it to the wart, put a bandaid on it and just do that every single day.
- **[07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlT081VhRLM&t=438s)** — Other people use tea tree oil and use outsider vinegar or they might use castor oil, maybe oregano oil.
- **[07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlT081VhRLM&t=444s)** — I highly recommend using the garlic oil and the iodine as the first attempt because that usually creates the biggest impact and biggest change.
- **[07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlT081VhRLM&t=452s)** — Now, since we did mention something like low carb diet, if you want to know more about that, you can watch this video right here. Check it out.

- **[00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ug2F8Epd6Ug&t=0s)** — Today I'm going to give you some extremely valuable information if you want to make the transition off of alcohol, nicotine, drugs a lot smoother.
- **[00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ug2F8Epd6Ug&t=12s)** — And I recently just stumbled on this information from a Dr. William Kaufman.
- **[00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ug2F8Epd6Ug&t=17s)** — Nicotine addiction, alcohol addiction, eating disorders, anxiety all have something in common.
- **[00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ug2F8Epd6Ug&t=25s)** — There's something in your cells, deep in the mitochondria, the energy factory of the cell, that allows the body to help extract energy from food.
- **[00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ug2F8Epd6Ug&t=38s)** — All you need to know is that the major deficiency in all the problems I talked about is NAD.
- **[00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ug2F8Epd6Ug&t=46s)** — And NAD not only helps you create energy in the body, but many, many other things.
- **[00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ug2F8Epd6Ug&t=51s)** — It's involved in over 500 different chemical reactions. In fact, you can't live without it.
- **[00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ug2F8Epd6Ug&t=56s)** — You may have heard of NAD supplements and things like that. I'm not recommending those. I'm recommending the precursor for NAD.
- **[01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ug2F8Epd6Ug&t=64s)** — And that is vitamin B3 niacin. Now, niacin is typically known to help you lower cholesterol and increase HDL, but it does a lot more.
- **[01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ug2F8Epd6Ug&t=76s)** — There's some serious research on this. And of course, you're not going to hear from the medical profession because it goes right against all of the medical solutions, the drug solutions that are out there.
- **[01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ug2F8Epd6Ug&t=88s)** — When someone starts to smoke or drink or take drugs, this creates a huge impact on the person's ability to make NAD as well as niacin.
- **[01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ug2F8Epd6Ug&t=98s)** — And so what can a person do with an NAD deficiency? Well, you can't correct it by just eating food. It won't work.
- **[01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ug2F8Epd6Ug&t=106s)** — You need large amounts of niacin to correct this. And niacin B3 can help calm down the central nervous system.
- **[01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ug2F8Epd6Ug&t=117s)** — Because various chemicals and drugs and alcohol compete for this NAD, so they won't allow it to work.
- **[02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ug2F8Epd6Ug&t=123s)** — So you just need to increase more production of NAD to overcome a lot of the associated problems that come with addictions.
- **[02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ug2F8Epd6Ug&t=131s)** — So people with addictions are literally starving for energy because the neurons just don't work.
- **[02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ug2F8Epd6Ug&t=137s)** — And so there's all sorts of associated issues that come along with it.
- **[02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ug2F8Epd6Ug&t=141s)** — And even if you have successfully overcame an addiction, this NAD is going to be really important to making you feel good.
- **[02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ug2F8Epd6Ug&t=152s)** — Because there are six main symptoms that occur when you're deficient in NAD.
- **[02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ug2F8Epd6Ug&t=157s)** — Fatigue, muscle soreness, weight gain, difficulty getting a quality of sleep, brain fog, and decreased stamina.
- **[02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ug2F8Epd6Ug&t=167s)** — You just don't have the endurance. Now by taking high doses, and I'm going to tell you how much to take in a minute,
- **[02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ug2F8Epd6Ug&t=173s)** — you can recover much easier mentally and physically. Now there's many different forms of bottom B3.
- **[03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ug2F8Epd6Ug&t=181s)** — I would recommend straight niacin. Now one of the problems that people have with niacin is it creates this
- **[03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ug2F8Epd6Ug&t=187s)** — flushing response on your skin and people get freaked out about it. So if you have a problem with that
- **[03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ug2F8Epd6Ug&t=191s)** — and you don't like that, you can get a no-flush niacin. But the point is that if you want to
- **[03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ug2F8Epd6Ug&t=196s)** — reduce the withdrawal symptoms and the cravings and help you overcome this addiction and feel better,
- **[03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ug2F8Epd6Ug&t=203s)** — you want to take higher amounts of niacin. I'm talking about 1.5 to 3 grams. Not milligrams, grams.
- **[03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ug2F8Epd6Ug&t=210s)** — Okay, so I would get them in 500 milligram tablets. They're very inexpensive. I think you can get a
- **[03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ug2F8Epd6Ug&t=217s)** — bottle for like five dollars. I would start out taking a smaller amount, right? And then you kind
- **[03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ug2F8Epd6Ug&t=221s)** — of build up over a period of a week or two to 1.5 grams to 3 grams of niacin. And just see how
- **[03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ug2F8Epd6Ug&t=231s)** — you feel. There are also clinics around that give people IVs for NAD for addictions. So the
- **[04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ug2F8Epd6Ug&t=240s)** — supplement or NADH, which is another version of that. Yeah, you could. It's just more expensive.
- **[04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ug2F8Epd6Ug&t=246s)** — There's a lot more to this vitamin and what it does and how you can benefit from it. And I
- **[04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ug2F8Epd6Ug&t=251s)** — will be doing more videos on that. But I will say there's other things that you can do to
- **[04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ug2F8Epd6Ug&t=254s)** — also increase NAD. Combined with this NAD therapy or taking niacin, you can do intermittent
- **[04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ug2F8Epd6Ug&t=261s)** — fasting. You can go on the healthy version of the ketogenic diet. You can exercise. All of those
- **[04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ug2F8Epd6Ug&t=266s)** — will help you. And if you want some basic information on exactly what to eat,
- **[04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ug2F8Epd6Ug&t=271s)** — I put that up right here. Check it out.

## Video 53: How to STOP Waking Up Tired in the AM

- **[00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bkExpmFzMs&t=0s)** — Let's talk about how to stop being so darn tired when you wake up in the morning.
- **[00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bkExpmFzMs&t=4s)** — I used to be so tired for years. I'm talking probably about 15 years of fatigue in the morning.
- **[00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bkExpmFzMs&t=11s)** — I had no idea what it was. It was terrible. It felt like I had a helmet over my head all the time.
- **[00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bkExpmFzMs&t=17s)** — Like brain fog. And it took me until probably 11 o'clock in the morning before I can actually wake up.
- **[00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bkExpmFzMs&t=23s)** — So I guess you would say I'm an expert in fatigue. Okay?
- **[00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bkExpmFzMs&t=28s)** — So if you apply what I'm about to tell you, you can easily get rid of this fatigue and wake up feeling refreshed and rested.
- **[00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bkExpmFzMs&t=37s)** — The majority of your fatigue in the morning is really coming from your diet. Okay?
- **[00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bkExpmFzMs&t=44s)** — But there's other things. But the diet is the most important thing.
- **[00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bkExpmFzMs&t=47s)** — What you ate yesterday is going to affect you today. Especially if it's in the area of too many carbohydrates.
- **[00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bkExpmFzMs&t=54s)** — And starches and sugars. Why is that? Because when you're doing that, you're running on glucose.
- **[01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bkExpmFzMs&t=63s)** — And your brain is very susceptible to developing something called insulin resistance.
- **[01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bkExpmFzMs&t=68s)** — So what does that actually mean for the brain? It means that you don't have enough insulin in the brain to drive the glucose into the neuron cells.
- **[01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bkExpmFzMs&t=78s)** — So basically you're kind of starving off your brain cells of fuel. And that does not make your brain feel good.
- **[01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bkExpmFzMs&t=86s)** — It makes your brain feel tired and brain foggy. You're going to lack the concentration.
- **[01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bkExpmFzMs&t=94s)** — Now for me, I would say maybe late 20s. Maybe I might have been like, yeah, late 20s. Maybe 28, 29.
- **[01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bkExpmFzMs&t=104s)** — When I stumbled on changing my breakfast from a carb breakfast, which I did for years, to a protein breakfast, it was like a switch.
- **[01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bkExpmFzMs&t=117s)** — It was like this helmet lifted off. And I got really interested in why that was.
- **[02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bkExpmFzMs&t=124s)** — And I started doing deep dives into what's called a ketogenic diet. But for me, it was very quick.
- **[02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bkExpmFzMs&t=129s)** — But the point is, I mean, if you go to the IHOP or a restaurant where you have breakfast foods, it's orange juice, it's cereal, it's pancakes, it's muffins, it's carbs, it's sugar.
- **[02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bkExpmFzMs&t=142s)** — So I know a lot of people are waking up really, really grouchy and really, really tired. So it's not just fatigue. It's your mood.
- **[02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bkExpmFzMs&t=150s)** — Now, are there other symptoms that kind of prove this point? Yes. If you're waking up feeling hungry, if you're waking up craving anything, if you're waking up feeling grouchy, if you have any fog in your mind when you wake up, then your blood sugars are off.
- **[02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bkExpmFzMs&t=169s)** — The worst thing you can do is to add more carbs to raise your blood sugars. To treat this low blood sugar situation. Why?
- **[02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bkExpmFzMs&t=177s)** — Because you just, you make yourself feel a little better, but then it's going to get worse. Because the more carbs you do, the more sugar you do, your body is going to start protecting the cells from that even more and resisting it more and more and more.
- **[03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bkExpmFzMs&t=189s)** — It's just a, it's a never ending cycle. A better thing to do is just to skip the breakfast altogether. Now, if you cut down your carbs throughout the day, you will find the next day, and maybe it might take two days, you'll find you're not going to be hungry in the morning.
- **[03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bkExpmFzMs&t=206s)** — Your cravings are going to start going away. Why? Because you're restricting your body of carbs and sugar and your body then will start burning fat, your own fat, as well as the fat in your diet.
- **[03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bkExpmFzMs&t=218s)** — And if given the choice, your brain loves to burn ketones. Okay? And that's the byproduct of fat. If you wake up with a headache, if you wake up feeling kind of bloated, it could be that you went out to dinner the day before or went out to a restaurant the day before.
- **[03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bkExpmFzMs&t=236s)** — What you ate the day before has a huge impact on how you're going to feel today. Now, personally, my wife and I would in the past long time ago would go to Taiwanese restaurants, Chinese restaurants, we love that. Okay.
- **[04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bkExpmFzMs&t=250s)** — And we ate a lot of rice and we had a lot of carbs. And we had a lot of MSG, which is a flavor enhancer. And at the time, I didn't even connect the dots. But I would always wake up feeling bloated,
- **[04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bkExpmFzMs&t=264s)** — retaining fluid and feeling really irritable in the head, which made me crave certain things and want to do that same thing the next day. I mean, there was even a year I think I had pint of Ben and Jerry's ice cream right before bed. But if you're waking up feeling nauseous,
- **[04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bkExpmFzMs&t=280s)** — headache-y, bloated, it's usually that. And also stiffness, you wake up with stiffness. It's usually something you ate that's affecting your liver. And if you have a liver issue, you can create a lot of stiffness. Now, a couple key points to help you wake up feeling refreshed is you must do intermittent fasting. Okay.
- **[05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bkExpmFzMs&t=300s)** — So, I'm going to go ahead and skip that breakfast. In fact, this is what I would do. I would have your first meal at noon and your second meal at least five hours before you go to bed. Okay. I mean, even earlier, if you could, you will find a huge improvement in your sleep cycles if you don't eat so close to when you go to bed. I mean, you should just prove this to yourself. Okay.
- **[05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bkExpmFzMs&t=321s)** — One day you eat right before you go to bed. Next day you eat like at five. Okay. Or even at four in the afternoon. And nothing after that. Watch how well you sleep. One of the things that people have temptations, they have certain cravings, they have certain habits, and they're constantly giving into them. The way that you strengthen your willpower is just by avoiding these things. Okay. And it takes a while, but as soon as you start doing it, you'll get momentum. But to constantly give into the body and just
- **[05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bkExpmFzMs&t=351s)** — cave, just weakens your willpower over time. And don't ever ask your body, hmm, what is my body in the mood for? Because it's not going to give you the right answer. The attitude that I use with my body is basically, I'm going to give you the food that you need to survive and get healthy. And I see that my stomach is grumbling, but I'm not going to give into that. I will feed you when I'm good and ready. I have to constantly remind my body
- **[06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bkExpmFzMs&t=381s)** — who is boss. I mean, it's literally crazy what's happening with people out of control with food. I mean, completely out of control. I mean, they're just letting their bodies dictate exactly what they want at any given moment. So it's a trap. You got to get out of the trap and you have to start putting in control over your body. And when you start doing intermittent fasting, boy, your hunger goes right away. A couple other things now related to this fatigue in the morning. It's if you're sitting in front of a computer like I am, a good portion of the day, or you're staring at
- **[06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bkExpmFzMs&t=411s)** — your cell phone or a laptop, whatever, you're going to get a couple things happen. You're going to get EMF electromagnetic fields that are going to affect your body. And I bought this little trifield device to detect EMF. And I found the back wall where my bed is had a lot of problems and extended this electromagnetic field like eight feet out from the wall. And so I was sleeping in the bathing in this
- **[07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bkExpmFzMs&t=441s)** — electromagnetic field and I literally had an electrician take the wall down and fix some of the cross wires. And boy, did I sleep good after that. So you have that. And then you have this blue light that does not help your eyes. And then you also have the cell phone connected to your head. I mean, that is not good for your brain. You talk about brain fog. And then you also have these things right here, which I hate with a passion. But unfortunately, I have to use them when I'm reading certain things.
- **[07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bkExpmFzMs&t=471s)** — But the problem is when I use them, it makes things worse. So I literally have to take half the day, take them off and just go for a walk and just look at things in the distance to actually correct some of that. But you know, you might think that you're tired, but it could be just the glasses that are making your eyes tired, making your head tired. As far as exercise goes, very, very important to use exercise to flush out adrenaline and stress and cortisol through the day.
- **[08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bkExpmFzMs&t=501s)** — It's going to help increase your tolerance for stress. It's going to help you sleep deeper, especially if you do like three times a week, high intensity interval training. That can greatly help your sleep, as well as long walks or hikes, or even better yet, doing physical work around your house outside somewhere.
- **[08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bkExpmFzMs&t=523s)** — Very therapeutic to your sleep and the quality of waking up feeling good. Also jet lag. If you want to handle your jet lag, it's a real simple solution. If you fly somewhere, take about 30 or 40,000 units of vitamin D. Okay, and that pretty much resets the clock in your brain.
- **[09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bkExpmFzMs&t=542s)** — Temperature is another important thing when you're sleeping. It's best if you're on the cooler side. That will help the quality of sleep and make you wake up feeling better. Your mattress. Did you realize you spend one third of your entire life on a mattress? So invest in a good mattress. And keeping the window open, if at all possible, will greatly help your ability to sleep. And lastly, make sure that you're breathing through your nose when you're sleeping. I created a very interesting video on that. I'm going to put that up right here.
- **[09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bkExpmFzMs&t=572s)** — You should watch that video next.

- **[00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8gl002hqik&t=0s)** — How to tighten and flatten your stomach with just one move.
- **[00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8gl002hqik&t=3s)** — And we're not talking about sit-ups.
- **[00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8gl002hqik&t=4s)** — Everyone knows this as a fact.
- **[00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8gl002hqik&t=6s)** — You must absolutely make sure that the calories you're putting in your body
- **[00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8gl002hqik&t=9s)** — do not exceed what you're expending or using.
- **[00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8gl002hqik&t=12s)** — And that way, if we create a deficit,
- **[00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8gl002hqik&t=15s)** — then this is naturally going to ride right into a loss of weight.
- **[00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8gl002hqik&t=19s)** — Let's just take a look at this.
- **[00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8gl002hqik&t=20s)** — And that's fundamentally how you lose body fat,
- **[00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8gl002hqik&t=22s)** — by creating a calorie deficit.
- **[00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8gl002hqik&t=24s)** — The only true requirement is that you maintain a calorie deficit.
- **[00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8gl002hqik&t=27s)** — This puts you in an overall calorie deficit.
- **[00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8gl002hqik&t=28s)** — If you're having a hard time reaching a caloric deficit,
- **[00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8gl002hqik&t=32s)** — about how to stay in a calorie deficit...
- **[00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8gl002hqik&t=34s)** — Every time I would ask an older individual who is overweight,
- **[00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8gl002hqik&t=37s)** — that wanted to lose weight,
- **[00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8gl002hqik&t=39s)** — when did your stubborn metabolism start?
- **[00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8gl002hqik&t=43s)** — It was usually in their late 20s or early 30s,
- **[00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8gl002hqik&t=47s)** — after a series of calorie restrictive diets.
- **[00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8gl002hqik&t=52s)** — And it is a theory, it's not a fact.
- **[00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8gl002hqik&t=53s)** — I mean, we've tried this for decades and it just has not worked.
- **[00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8gl002hqik&t=56s)** — Here's the missing piece of the puzzle that you really need to understand.
- **[01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8gl002hqik&t=60s)** — Our bodies are not as simple as a car,
- **[01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8gl002hqik&t=63s)** — where you have inputs and outputs.
- **[01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8gl002hqik&t=65s)** — We have what's called the endocrine system.
- **[01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8gl002hqik&t=68s)** — And this system causes our body to adapt within its environment.
- **[01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8gl002hqik&t=73s)** — And so what the body is going to do when you lower your calories,
- **[01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8gl002hqik&t=77s)** — is it's going to adjust.
- **[01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8gl002hqik&t=79s)** — It's going to become more efficient,
- **[01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8gl002hqik&t=81s)** — which you may feel that it's a bit slow.
- **[01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8gl002hqik&t=83s)** — It can run further on the same amount of fuel as before.
- **[01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8gl002hqik&t=88s)** — The other problem with lowering your calories,
- **[01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8gl002hqik&t=91s)** — is that now we increase the battle of hunger, cravings,
- **[01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8gl002hqik&t=97s)** — and now it's going to be even harder,
- **[01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8gl002hqik&t=99s)** — because you're going to have to increase your willpower to stick to it.
- **[01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8gl002hqik&t=102s)** — So is this whole calorie deficit model sustainable?
- **[01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8gl002hqik&t=104s)** — No, it's not.
- **[01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8gl002hqik&t=105s)** — I want to bring up one book right here.
- **[01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8gl002hqik&t=108s)** — It's called Guyton's Physiology.
- **[01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8gl002hqik&t=110s)** — And I want to show you two quotes out of the book.
- **[01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8gl002hqik&t=114s)** — Page 927.
- **[01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8gl002hqik&t=116s)** — Right here. Let's take a look at this.
- **[01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8gl002hqik&t=118s)** — All aspects of fat metabolism are greatly enhanced in the absence of insulin.
- **[02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8gl002hqik&t=125s)** — Then we have page 822.
- **[02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8gl002hqik&t=127s)** — It says right here,
- **[02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8gl002hqik&t=128s)** — When carbohydrates are not utilized for energy,
- **[02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8gl002hqik&t=131s)** — almost all of the energy of the body must come from the metabolism of fats.
- **[02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8gl002hqik&t=137s)** — I really think that people who are stuck in this outdated model of calorie deficit,
- **[02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8gl002hqik&t=143s)** — just don't understand insulin.
- **[02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8gl002hqik&t=146s)** — And unfortunately, you know, when you're taking classes,
- **[02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8gl002hqik&t=150s)** — whether you're studying Guyton's Physiology, maybe in school,
- **[02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8gl002hqik&t=152s)** — they're not going to really emphasize that point.
- **[02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8gl002hqik&t=154s)** — To really understand this,
- **[02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8gl002hqik&t=155s)** — you're going to have to really dive into it and study it after you graduate,
- **[02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8gl002hqik&t=159s)** — because it's not really taught.
- **[02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8gl002hqik&t=161s)** — Insulin is the hormone that controls whether you burn fat or not.
- **[02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8gl002hqik&t=166s)** — If you reduce insulin, your body can then tap into your own fat for energy.
- **[02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8gl002hqik&t=171s)** — And the thing that triggers insulin is carbohydrates.
- **[02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8gl002hqik&t=174s)** — If we look at the three parts of food,
- **[02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8gl002hqik&t=175s)** — we have carbohydrates, protein, and fat.
- **[02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8gl002hqik&t=179s)** — It's the carbohydrates that stimulate insulin the most.
- **[03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8gl002hqik&t=182s)** — Fat actually is neutral.
- **[03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8gl002hqik&t=184s)** — Protein has a moderate effect on insulin,
- **[03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8gl002hqik&t=187s)** — but it doesn't even compare to carbohydrates.
- **[03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8gl002hqik&t=190s)** — This right there tells us you cannot treat all three of these equally.
- **[03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8gl002hqik&t=194s)** — All calories are not the same.
- **[03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8gl002hqik&t=196s)** — It is important to talk about the quality or the type of calorie we're talking about.
- **[03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8gl002hqik&t=201s)** — And if we really want to lose weight, we must lower insulin.
- **[03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8gl002hqik&t=204s)** — To do that, we must lower our carbohydrate calorie.
- **[03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8gl002hqik&t=207s)** — What's interesting about lowering our carbohydrate calorie and lowering insulin,
- **[03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8gl002hqik&t=212s)** — our body needs to get fuel.
- **[03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8gl002hqik&t=215s)** — Where is it going to get the fuel?
- **[03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8gl002hqik&t=216s)** — When you are eating, you're getting your energy from your food.
- **[03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8gl002hqik&t=220s)** — When you're not eating, where are you getting your energy from?
- **[03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8gl002hqik&t=223s)** — Are you getting it from fat?
- **[03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8gl002hqik&t=224s)** — If you're living on a higher carbohydrate diet,
- **[03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8gl002hqik&t=228s)** — it's very unlikely you're going to be able to tap in too much fat.
- **[03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8gl002hqik&t=230s)** — If you can lower your carbs, your body can then finally tap into your own fat.
- **[03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8gl002hqik&t=236s)** — Let's say, for example, you're living on 1500 calories with the low carb diet.
- **[04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8gl002hqik&t=240s)** — You're also, in addition to those 1500 calories,
- **[04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8gl002hqik&t=244s)** — using a good amount of fat calories.
- **[04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8gl002hqik&t=247s)** — It could be, I don't know, 500 or more, maybe 700, 800 additional calories
- **[04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8gl002hqik&t=253s)** — that we can put in the pool for energy.
- **[04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8gl002hqik&t=256s)** — Part of its diet, part of its your own fat.
- **[04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8gl002hqik&t=259s)** — And so guess what's so cool about that?
- **[04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8gl002hqik&t=260s)** — Your hunger goes away.
- **[04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8gl002hqik&t=261s)** — You're no longer craving carbs between meals. Why?
- **[04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8gl002hqik&t=264s)** — Your body is eating your own fat between the meal.
- **[04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8gl002hqik&t=267s)** — If you don't lower insulin, your body is not going to eat your own fat.
- **[04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8gl002hqik&t=271s)** — But if you do lower insulin with a low carb,
- **[04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8gl002hqik&t=274s)** — then the body will eat your own fat as fuel.
- **[04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8gl002hqik&t=277s)** — We can make it easy on yourself,
- **[04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8gl002hqik&t=279s)** — not have any cravings or hunger while you're doing your weight loss program.
- **[04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8gl002hqik&t=283s)** — Or you can cut your calories.
- **[04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8gl002hqik&t=284s)** — And the cool thing about the ketogenic diet,
- **[04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8gl002hqik&t=287s)** — which is the low carb diet,
- **[04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8gl002hqik&t=289s)** — is that a lot of the energy that your body is running off of
- **[04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8gl002hqik&t=292s)** — is not from the diet.
- **[04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8gl002hqik&t=294s)** — It's from your own body fat.
- **[04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8gl002hqik&t=297s)** — And I think one argument that some people bring up is,
- **[05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8gl002hqik&t=300s)** — yes, doing low carb, it's going to help you.
- **[05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8gl002hqik&t=303s)** — But then also when you do fasting,
- **[05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8gl002hqik&t=305s)** — you're naturally lowering your calories.
- **[05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8gl002hqik&t=308s)** — And some people will say the reason why the ketogenic diet helps you lose weight
- **[05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8gl002hqik&t=311s)** — is you're eating less calories because it's all about calories.
- **[05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8gl002hqik&t=315s)** — If that's true, then how do you explain
- **[05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8gl002hqik&t=317s)** — that when you go on a ketogenic diet
- **[05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8gl002hqik&t=319s)** — and you do intermittent fasting,
- **[05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8gl002hqik&t=321s)** — and yes, you might be eating less calories,
- **[05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8gl002hqik&t=323s)** — you don't crave anything.
- **[05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8gl002hqik&t=324s)** — We compare that to you just cutting your calories and not your carbohydrates.
- **[05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8gl002hqik&t=329s)** — You're going to be craving all day long.
- **[05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8gl002hqik&t=332s)** — If your body is getting enough fuel,
- **[05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8gl002hqik&t=335s)** — there's no reason to slow down the metabolism
- **[05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8gl002hqik&t=337s)** — because your body is getting all the energy it needs.
- **[05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8gl002hqik&t=340s)** — This is the purpose of fat, to be able to survive between meals.
- **[05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8gl002hqik&t=345s)** — You want to think about your fat as a biological pantry
- **[05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8gl002hqik&t=349s)** — that you're tapping into.
- **[05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8gl002hqik&t=351s)** — So you don't have to tap into your actual pantry.
- **[05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8gl002hqik&t=354s)** — This does work.
- **[05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8gl002hqik&t=356s)** — And I have 8,000 people to prove it.
- **[05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8gl002hqik&t=359s)** — Check this out on my website.
- **[06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8gl002hqik&t=360s)** — The other little point on this is that
- **[06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8gl002hqik&t=362s)** — Fat provides more than double the energy
- **[06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8gl002hqik&t=364s)** — than glucose provides.
- **[06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8gl002hqik&t=367s)** — It's very important to tap into fat
- **[06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8gl002hqik&t=369s)** — to use that as a nice sustainable amount of energy for your body.
- **[06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8gl002hqik&t=374s)** — The key to this whole thing is turning insulin way down.
- **[06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8gl002hqik&t=378s)** — I am almost to the exercise I'm going to show you
- **[06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8gl002hqik&t=380s)** — to tighten and tone the midsection.
- **[06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8gl002hqik&t=383s)** — But I wanted just to kind of mention just one thing.
- **[06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8gl002hqik&t=386s)** — It takes about two to three days to get into the state of ketosis.
- **[06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8gl002hqik&t=390s)** — So it's not that long.
- **[06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8gl002hqik&t=392s)** — But it does take two to three weeks
- **[06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8gl002hqik&t=394s)** — to fully get into hardcore fat adaptation.
- **[06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8gl002hqik&t=399s)** — And I want to explain the difference.
- **[06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8gl002hqik&t=401s)** — Fat adaptation is when your body is burning the most fat possible.
- **[06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8gl002hqik&t=406s)** — And your body can burn ketones, but it can also burn fat.
- **[06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8gl002hqik&t=410s)** — That's actually two different sources of fuel.
- **[06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8gl002hqik&t=412s)** — If we look at carbohydrates, proteins, and fats,
- **[06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8gl002hqik&t=415s)** — carbohydrates should be about 5% of the diet.
- **[06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8gl002hqik&t=418s)** — The protein should be about 20%.
- **[07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8gl002hqik&t=420s)** — And the rest should be the fat.
- **[07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8gl002hqik&t=422s)** — Inside your abdomen, you may have what's called visceral fat.
- **[07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8gl002hqik&t=426s)** — And that is going to come off with the diet that I just mentioned.
- **[07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8gl002hqik&t=430s)** — You also have the superficial layer of fat,
- **[07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8gl002hqik&t=433s)** — which is also like a spillover from the other fat
- **[07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8gl002hqik&t=436s)** — that is being backed up into the organs.
- **[07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8gl002hqik&t=438s)** — Deeper in there, you have a layer of fascia.
- **[07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8gl002hqik&t=441s)** — This fascia is like a gel-like connective tissue.
- **[07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8gl002hqik&t=444s)** — And it can atrophy if you don't use it.
- **[07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8gl002hqik&t=447s)** — And that atrophy can look like a flabby stomach.
- **[07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8gl002hqik&t=451s)** — What I'm going to show you is one of the best exercises
- **[07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8gl002hqik&t=455s)** — that is not a set-up, that is going to tone and tighten
- **[07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8gl002hqik&t=460s)** — this area around your abdomen to get rid of that flabby stomach
- **[07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8gl002hqik&t=466s)** — and almost act like a girdle that's keeping everything nice and tight and toned.
- **[07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8gl002hqik&t=471s)** — All we're going to do is this one exercise called...
- **[07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8gl002hqik&t=475s)** — it's a funny name... the dead bug.
- **[07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8gl002hqik&t=478s)** — And it's called a dead bug because it looks like a dead bug, upside down,
- **[08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8gl002hqik&t=483s)** — trying to flip over.
- **[08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8gl002hqik&t=485s)** — And I'm going to recommend you do this alternating your leg and your arm
- **[08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8gl002hqik&t=489s)** — when you reach back.
- **[08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8gl002hqik&t=490s)** — You see, this will give the optimum tension in the middle section
- **[08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8gl002hqik&t=494s)** — to stimulate the fascia and the muscles to get really nice and toned.
- **[08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8gl002hqik&t=499s)** — Versus if you did sit-ups or crunches, the problem with that is
- **[08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8gl002hqik&t=503s)** — you're going to activate the deeper muscles called the psoas,
- **[08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8gl002hqik&t=506s)** — which are the hip flexors, and that is going to eventually cause
- **[08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8gl002hqik&t=510s)** — your back to be out of balance.
- **[08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8gl002hqik&t=512s)** — But here's how you do it right here.
- **[08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8gl002hqik&t=514s)** — Today's exercise tutorial is the dead bug.
- **[08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8gl002hqik&t=516s)** — Dead bugs are great for helping to control front-to-back pelvic tilting.
- **[08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8gl002hqik&t=520s)** — That's also a good abdominal exercise that improves coordination.
- **[08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8gl002hqik&t=524s)** — And it generally makes you long and straight.
- **[08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8gl002hqik&t=526s)** — One of the secondary functions is to help you control rotation in the hips.
- **[08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8gl002hqik&t=531s)** — So to get started, you're going to lay down on your back.
- **[08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8gl002hqik&t=537s)** — We lay down on our back with our knees over our hips.
- **[09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8gl002hqik&t=541s)** — Our hips, knees, and ankles are bent at 90-degree angles.
- **[09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8gl002hqik&t=545s)** — Our back, our lower back is flat on the ground so that I cannot slide my hand
- **[09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8gl002hqik&t=549s)** — underneath my back.
- **[09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8gl002hqik&t=550s)** — So it's by controlling this pelvic tilting, we control the arch in our lower back.
- **[09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8gl002hqik&t=555s)** — Use your abdominals. Your arms are straight up, pointing at the ceiling.
- **[09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8gl002hqik&t=559s)** — From this position, fully extend your left leg.
- **[09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8gl002hqik&t=563s)** — Your toes remain pointing at the ceiling.
- **[09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8gl002hqik&t=565s)** — Your lower back remains in contact with the ground.
- **[09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8gl002hqik&t=568s)** — Reset to the starting position and then you can switch sides or finish your set on the same side.
- **[09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8gl002hqik&t=575s)** — To vary this exercise, we can move our arms and legs at the same time.
- **[09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8gl002hqik&t=580s)** — We can go same side.
- **[09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8gl002hqik&t=582s)** — Or we can go opposite side.
- **[09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8gl002hqik&t=586s)** — Again, the key is to keep your lower back in contact with the ground.
- **[09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8gl002hqik&t=591s)** — And to only move those limbs and those parts of our body that we want to move.
- **[09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8gl002hqik&t=597s)** — The lower back stays in contact with the ground.
- **[09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8gl002hqik&t=599s)** — Do this exercise every single day and within one or two weeks you're going to start to see some amazing results.
- **[10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8gl002hqik&t=605s)** — If you want details on how to do the diet, I put that video up right here. Check it out.

- **[00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1fCH6M6vZk&t=0s)** — Now there's some great new data I want to share with you about reversing diabetes by getting rid of the fat in your liver.
- **[00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1fCH6M6vZk&t=9s)** — Now of course they don't mention the word reversing diabetes. They call it putting diabetes in remission.
- **[00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1fCH6M6vZk&t=15s)** — But there's some interesting data I want to share with you.
- **[00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1fCH6M6vZk&t=17s)** — So apparently there's a tremendous amount of data pointing to insulin resistance starting in the muscles and then in your liver.
- **[00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1fCH6M6vZk&t=28s)** — But there's some conflicting data because other data points to it starting in your muscles and then it transfers to the liver.
- **[00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1fCH6M6vZk&t=36s)** — But all you need to know is if you fix insulin resistance, you can fix diabetes.
- **[00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1fCH6M6vZk&t=41s)** — And if you have a fatty liver, you're not going to be able to fix insulin resistance for any period of time.
- **[00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1fCH6M6vZk&t=46s)** — You might feel a little bit better, but that fat in your liver must be removed.
- **[00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1fCH6M6vZk&t=51s)** — So what is this connection between a fatty liver and diabetes?
- **[00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1fCH6M6vZk&t=55s)** — Well, one of the functions of the liver beyond the detoxification function is the storage of glucose as glycogen.
- **[01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1fCH6M6vZk&t=66s)** — So typically of a certain amount of storage of glycogen in your liver and also in your muscles.
- **[01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1fCH6M6vZk&t=70s)** — And that glucose in the liver supplies your brain and other organs with glucose between meals and then when you exercise.
- **[01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1fCH6M6vZk&t=77s)** — And that glycogen in your liver supplies the fuel to your brain between meals and also when you're exercising.
- **[01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1fCH6M6vZk&t=84s)** — Whereas the muscle glycogen pretty much only supplies the muscles with energy or glucose.
- **[01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1fCH6M6vZk&t=91s)** — But when you have insulin resistance, you don't really get that benefit.
- **[01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1fCH6M6vZk&t=94s)** — And so when you exercise, your performance isn't very good. You don't have good endurance.
- **[01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1fCH6M6vZk&t=99s)** — You get a lot of fatigue, especially with exercise.
- **[01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1fCH6M6vZk&t=102s)** — And then when you get insulin resistance in your liver over a period of time,
- **[01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1fCH6M6vZk&t=105s)** — that develops into pre-diabetes and diabetes because of the spill off of fat that then it's called ectopic.
- **[01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1fCH6M6vZk&t=112s)** — It actually goes out of the fat cell and then it starts accumulating around the pancreas.
- **[01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1fCH6M6vZk&t=117s)** — Okay, and inside the pancreas.
- **[01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1fCH6M6vZk&t=119s)** — And then because the pancreas controls insulin through beta cells,
- **[02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1fCH6M6vZk&t=124s)** — the beta cells start to malfunction and then you get diabetes.
- **[02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1fCH6M6vZk&t=128s)** — And it's been documented that you can't reverse that.
- **[02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1fCH6M6vZk&t=131s)** — But that is absolutely positively not true. You can reverse beta cell dysfunction.
- **[02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1fCH6M6vZk&t=137s)** — Now, I'm not talking about in type 1 diabetes. I'm talking about type 2 diabetes.
- **[02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1fCH6M6vZk&t=142s)** — And the way you would reverse it is you just need to get rid of the fat in the pancreas.
- **[02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1fCH6M6vZk&t=146s)** — Okay, and allow the cell to come back.
- **[02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1fCH6M6vZk&t=150s)** — But to fix the pancreas, you have to first fix the liver.
- **[02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1fCH6M6vZk&t=153s)** — You have to remove the fat from the liver so you can improve insulin resistance,
- **[02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1fCH6M6vZk&t=157s)** — which by the way can happen in six days.
- **[02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1fCH6M6vZk&t=161s)** — But the pancreas could take a little bit longer. It could take like eight weeks.
- **[02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1fCH6M6vZk&t=164s)** — So what am I actually saying? I'm saying this.
- **[02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1fCH6M6vZk&t=166s)** — If you have diabetes or pre-diabetes or insulin resistance,
- **[02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1fCH6M6vZk&t=170s)** — you need to focus on removing the fat from your liver.
- **[02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1fCH6M6vZk&t=174s)** — Okay, as a primary goal. And then as you do that,
- **[02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1fCH6M6vZk&t=178s)** — the fat from your pancreas will also decrease.
- **[03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1fCH6M6vZk&t=181s)** — And then the function of the beta cell of the pancreas will start to improve.
- **[03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1fCH6M6vZk&t=185s)** — Now the question is, how do you do it? Right? How do you do it?
- **[03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1fCH6M6vZk&t=189s)** — Do you just start going on a low-fat diet? Do you start to exercise more?
- **[03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1fCH6M6vZk&t=194s)** — What is the best thing to do?
- **[03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1fCH6M6vZk&t=196s)** — Well, first I need to explain something to you because a lot of people don't know that
- **[03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1fCH6M6vZk&t=202s)** — your brain can run on two types of fuel.
- **[03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1fCH6M6vZk&t=206s)** — Okay, it can run on glucose and it can run on ketones.
- **[03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1fCH6M6vZk&t=209s)** — And because there's so much bad PR on ketones, right?
- **[03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1fCH6M6vZk&t=212s)** — Like, oh yeah, if you go on a ketogenic diet over a period of time,
- **[03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1fCH6M6vZk&t=216s)** — you'll develop ketoacidosis and that's a very severe pathology.
- **[03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1fCH6M6vZk&t=221s)** — So you need to avoid ketones, right? That's completely and utterly false.
- **[03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1fCH6M6vZk&t=225s)** — That only occurs when you're type 1 diabetic.
- **[03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1fCH6M6vZk&t=228s)** — So if people drink that Kool-Aid and they buy into that,
- **[03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1fCH6M6vZk&t=231s)** — then they're left with this fuel source called glucose.
- **[03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1fCH6M6vZk&t=234s)** — Because mainstream medicine will tell you that, well, the brain
- **[03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1fCH6M6vZk&t=236s)** — prefers glucose and that's really the only fuel that you need to focus on.
- **[04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1fCH6M6vZk&t=240s)** — And so if that's all the data you have,
- **[04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1fCH6M6vZk&t=243s)** — boy, you're going to have a hard time fixing this problem.
- **[04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1fCH6M6vZk&t=246s)** — So let me just mention this word hypoglycemia, right? We have low blood sugars.
- **[04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1fCH6M6vZk&t=250s)** — Think about all of the brain symptoms with hypoglycemia.
- **[04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1fCH6M6vZk&t=256s)** — You have problems with your thinking, memory, learning.
- **[04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1fCH6M6vZk&t=261s)** — Think about how many kids in school that have low blood sugars, right?
- **[04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1fCH6M6vZk&t=264s)** — And they're trying to learn on top of that headache, tired, blurred vision,
- **[04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1fCH6M6vZk&t=270s)** — lightheadedness, all these issues with your head.
- **[04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1fCH6M6vZk&t=274s)** — Hypoglycemia originates in your liver. Why?
- **[04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1fCH6M6vZk&t=277s)** — Because of the glycogen restored being inhibited because of the fatty liver or dysfunctional liver.
- **[04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1fCH6M6vZk&t=284s)** — So when your liver doesn't work, you can't store glycogen properly.
- **[04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1fCH6M6vZk&t=290s)** — The stored sugar in your muscles is not readily available to you.
- **[04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1fCH6M6vZk&t=293s)** — It's only going to supply your muscles.
- **[04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1fCH6M6vZk&t=295s)** — The brain glucose is dependent on the liver function.
- **[04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1fCH6M6vZk&t=298s)** — But if you have a fatty liver, which a lot of people do, especially if they're overweight,
- **[05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1fCH6M6vZk&t=303s)** — they're not going to be able to store glycogen properly.
- **[05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1fCH6M6vZk&t=305s)** — And the more fat they accumulate in the liver, the more insulin resistance they have.
- **[05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1fCH6M6vZk&t=309s)** — And the more insulin that's going to go higher, pushing your blood sugars down,
- **[05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1fCH6M6vZk&t=315s)** — giving you this hypoglycemia and all the symptoms that are associated with it.
- **[05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1fCH6M6vZk&t=319s)** — Now you might think that it takes a lot of fat in your liver to cause insulin resistance,
- **[05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1fCH6M6vZk&t=324s)** — but it doesn't.
- **[05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1fCH6M6vZk&t=326s)** — I just found some interesting data that you can develop insulin resistance
- **[05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1fCH6M6vZk&t=330s)** — with less than 2% of the liver being fatty.
- **[05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1fCH6M6vZk&t=334s)** — I think this specific number was 1.85% of your liver being fatty,
- **[05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1fCH6M6vZk&t=339s)** — and you developing insulin resistance symptoms, which is, to me, very, very low.
- **[05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1fCH6M6vZk&t=344s)** — So in other words, it only takes a little bit of this fat on your liver to start this process.
- **[05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1fCH6M6vZk&t=348s)** — You see, this insulin resistance happens all over the place.
- **[05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1fCH6M6vZk&t=350s)** — It's in the liver, okay?
- **[05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1fCH6M6vZk&t=352s)** — It's also in your muscles, like I mentioned.
- **[05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1fCH6M6vZk&t=354s)** — It's also in your brain.
- **[05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1fCH6M6vZk&t=356s)** — So if your diet has too much glucose, you literally are slowly killing off your neurons,
- **[06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1fCH6M6vZk&t=362s)** — which is kind of a paradox because apparently, like even Alzheimer's and a lot of
- **[06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1fCH6M6vZk&t=367s)** — brain issues occur because you're starving the neurons of glucose.
- **[06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1fCH6M6vZk&t=373s)** — But too much glucose will actually kill the neurons.
- **[06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1fCH6M6vZk&t=376s)** — So the neurons die if you don't feed the glucose,
- **[06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1fCH6M6vZk&t=379s)** — and the neurons die if you feed the neurons glucose.
- **[06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1fCH6M6vZk&t=382s)** — So what's going on here?
- **[06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1fCH6M6vZk&t=383s)** — Well, maybe the brain wasn't designed to run on glucose in the first place.
- **[06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1fCH6M6vZk&t=388s)** — So just maybe when you increase glucose to the brain cells,
- **[06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1fCH6M6vZk&t=392s)** — the body protects the brain cells by developing this resistance,
- **[06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1fCH6M6vZk&t=397s)** — making it more difficult to penetrate.
- **[06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1fCH6M6vZk&t=400s)** — And maybe your body's trying to tell you,
- **[06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1fCH6M6vZk&t=402s)** — don't consume glucose because then that's going to create a problem.
- **[06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1fCH6M6vZk&t=405s)** — And of course, in the background, we have the mechanism being insulin resistance.
- **[06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1fCH6M6vZk&t=409s)** — So the more insulin resistance, the less glucose you can absorb in the neuron,
- **[06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1fCH6M6vZk&t=414s)** — because the neuron needs insulin to be able to absorb glucose.
- **[06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1fCH6M6vZk&t=418s)** — And this is why one of the treatments that they're using for this,
- **[07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1fCH6M6vZk&t=423s)** — like Alzheimer's or dementia, is an intranasal insulin spray,
- **[07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1fCH6M6vZk&t=428s)** — where they spray this insulin up your sinuses.
- **[07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1fCH6M6vZk&t=431s)** — It goes directly in the brain and it improves dementia symptoms.
- **[07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1fCH6M6vZk&t=435s)** — Now that's adding more insulin to your brain.
- **[07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1fCH6M6vZk&t=438s)** — When you try to increase your insulin in your brain by eating more glucose,
- **[07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1fCH6M6vZk&t=442s)** — all you do is you just increase more resistance.
- **[07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1fCH6M6vZk&t=444s)** — Okay, so it doesn't work.
- **[07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1fCH6M6vZk&t=446s)** — So if we just step back for a moment and take a look at this problem,
- **[07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1fCH6M6vZk&t=450s)** — how do we reverse diabetes?
- **[07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1fCH6M6vZk&t=453s)** — Okay, how do we reverse all these cognitive problems
- **[07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1fCH6M6vZk&t=456s)** — that we have associated with this blood sugar issue
- **[07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1fCH6M6vZk&t=459s)** — that's associated with a fatty liver?
- **[07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1fCH6M6vZk&t=462s)** — First of all, you have to realize that the brain prefers,
- **[07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1fCH6M6vZk&t=465s)** — not glucose, but ketones.
- **[07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1fCH6M6vZk&t=467s)** — The way to fix the liver is to run your body on ketones, not glucose.
- **[07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1fCH6M6vZk&t=472s)** — The way to reverse the fat on your pancreas
- **[07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1fCH6M6vZk&t=474s)** — and reverse the beta cell function is to run the body on ketones.
- **[08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1fCH6M6vZk&t=480s)** — Ketones will improve cholesterol, triglyceride, and other lipids in your liver.
- **[08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1fCH6M6vZk&t=487s)** — Ketones will help decrease fat on your liver.
- **[08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1fCH6M6vZk&t=491s)** — This is why the ketogenic diet has been shown to decrease
- **[08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1fCH6M6vZk&t=495s)** — 50% of the fat on your liver within two weeks.
- **[08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1fCH6M6vZk&t=499s)** — How can it do that?
- **[08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1fCH6M6vZk&t=500s)** — Because when you actually decrease the glucose,
- **[08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1fCH6M6vZk&t=502s)** — you switch the body into ketones, and within even six days,
- **[08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1fCH6M6vZk&t=508s)** — you're improving significantly insulin resistance on your liver.
- **[08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1fCH6M6vZk&t=512s)** — So now everything's going to start working.
- **[08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1fCH6M6vZk&t=514s)** — You're also going to have decreased inflammation in the liver.
- **[08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1fCH6M6vZk&t=517s)** — You're going to have less fibrosis.
- **[08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1fCH6M6vZk&t=518s)** — You're going to have improved liver function and decreased liver enzymes.
- **[08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1fCH6M6vZk&t=522s)** — And I'm going to put some links down below to just show you that I'm
- **[08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1fCH6M6vZk&t=525s)** — I'm not just making this up. All of this data is validated.
- **[08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1fCH6M6vZk&t=528s)** — In summary, you fix a fatty liver.
- **[08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1fCH6M6vZk&t=531s)** — You fix your brain.
- **[08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1fCH6M6vZk&t=533s)** — You fix diabetes.
- **[08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1fCH6M6vZk&t=535s)** — If we want to just keep it simple.
- **[08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1fCH6M6vZk&t=537s)** — All right. So what are some key things that you can do right now to turn this around?
- **[09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1fCH6M6vZk&t=541s)** — Get on the ketogenic diet.
- **[09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1fCH6M6vZk&t=542s)** — Very simply, make the carbohydrates you eat vegetable carbohydrates.
- **[09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1fCH6M6vZk&t=547s)** — One type of carbohydrate is fiber.
- **[09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1fCH6M6vZk&t=550s)** — And vegetables have a lot of fiber.
- **[09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1fCH6M6vZk&t=551s)** — And fiber is one of the only things that will not increase insulin.
- **[09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1fCH6M6vZk&t=556s)** — So now you can have your carbohydrates as long as they're high fiber carbohydrates.
- **[09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1fCH6M6vZk&t=562s)** — And so when you eat a meal, I do recommend that you start with your vegetables first.
- **[09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1fCH6M6vZk&t=567s)** — Right. And your salad.
- **[09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1fCH6M6vZk&t=569s)** — That way you get a lot of the phytonutrients and other nutrients from those foods that can
- **[09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1fCH6M6vZk&t=573s)** — actually help to decrease the complications of the diabetes you have.
- **[09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1fCH6M6vZk&t=577s)** — Then you have your protein. Right.
- **[09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1fCH6M6vZk&t=580s)** — Protein is very important.
- **[09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1fCH6M6vZk&t=581s)** — Don't have like a high amount of protein.
- **[09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1fCH6M6vZk&t=583s)** — Have a moderate amount of protein.
- **[09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1fCH6M6vZk&t=585s)** — I think the best way to identify the amounts, to keep it really simple,
- **[09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1fCH6M6vZk&t=590s)** — is if you're female, have protein the size of the palm of your hand.
- **[09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1fCH6M6vZk&t=595s)** — If you are a male, consume twice that.
- **[09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1fCH6M6vZk&t=598s)** — Two pieces of protein the size of the palm of your hand.
- **[10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1fCH6M6vZk&t=602s)** — And I think it's a good idea to start with the vegetables first, then the protein.
- **[10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1fCH6M6vZk&t=605s)** — Because if you start with the protein first,
- **[10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1fCH6M6vZk&t=607s)** — a lot of times people won't consume those vegetables.
- **[10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1fCH6M6vZk&t=610s)** — Also add apple cider vinegar, like a tablespoon or two in a glass of water.
- **[10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1fCH6M6vZk&t=615s)** — And you drink that down.
- **[10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1fCH6M6vZk&t=617s)** — Not only is that going to help you with digestion,
- **[10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1fCH6M6vZk&t=619s)** — that is going to greatly help you with your blood sugars,
- **[10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1fCH6M6vZk&t=624s)** — specifically making insulin more sensitive.
- **[10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1fCH6M6vZk&t=628s)** — Apple cider vinegar is an amazing remedy for speeding up the process of
- **[10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1fCH6M6vZk&t=634s)** — reversing this insulin resistance situation.
- **[10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1fCH6M6vZk&t=636s)** — When you think about it, what is apple cider vinegar?
- **[10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1fCH6M6vZk&t=639s)** — It's acetic acid.
- **[10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1fCH6M6vZk&t=641s)** — Apple cider vinegar is actually a fatty acid.
- **[10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1fCH6M6vZk&t=644s)** — It's a type of fat. We don't think about it as a type of fat.
- **[10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1fCH6M6vZk&t=648s)** — But fats in general are the other thing that doesn't stimulate insulin.
- **[10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1fCH6M6vZk&t=653s)** — But with apple cider vinegar, you can actually use that to get energy.
- **[10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1fCH6M6vZk&t=657s)** — And you can use that as one strategy to speed up the process.
- **[11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1fCH6M6vZk&t=661s)** — And also there's some great data to show that acetic acid
- **[11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1fCH6M6vZk&t=664s)** — speeds up the removal of fat from your liver.
- **[11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1fCH6M6vZk&t=668s)** — And I would also add some lemon as well because that would help you.
- **[11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1fCH6M6vZk&t=671s)** — Okay, next point.
- **[11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1fCH6M6vZk&t=672s)** — Let your appetite dictate when you eat.
- **[11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1fCH6M6vZk&t=675s)** — You're going to find as you do this and you switch to ketones,
- **[11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1fCH6M6vZk&t=679s)** — you're going to lose your appetite and your cravings.
- **[11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1fCH6M6vZk&t=680s)** — It's going to make it very easy to stay on this program.
- **[11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1fCH6M6vZk&t=683s)** — So just don't eat if you're not hungry.
- **[11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1fCH6M6vZk&t=685s)** — And only eat when you're hungry.
- **[11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1fCH6M6vZk&t=686s)** — So really pay attention to your appetite because
- **[11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1fCH6M6vZk&t=689s)** — what we want to do is we want you to eat less, less frequent.
- **[11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1fCH6M6vZk&t=693s)** — We want you to avoid snacks because we want to get rid of this habit
- **[11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1fCH6M6vZk&t=696s)** — that we have to eat three times a day, which is absolutely not true.
- **[11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1fCH6M6vZk&t=700s)** — That we have to have these snacks to prevent hypoglycemia, which is not true.
- **[11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1fCH6M6vZk&t=704s)** — Because every time you eat, you stimulate insulin.
- **[11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1fCH6M6vZk&t=707s)** — And at the very maximum, I would only eat two meals a day.
- **[11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1fCH6M6vZk&t=710s)** — This is going to greatly speed up getting rid of the fat off your liver
- **[11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1fCH6M6vZk&t=714s)** — and turning this whole diabetes thing upside down.
- **[11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1fCH6M6vZk&t=718s)** — It puts you in remission.
- **[12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1fCH6M6vZk&t=720s)** — We'll call it remission.
- **[12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1fCH6M6vZk&t=721s)** — And the last thing, just to put the icing on the cake,
- **[12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1fCH6M6vZk&t=723s)** — is to implement exercise on a regular basis.
- **[12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1fCH6M6vZk&t=727s)** — Exercise will greatly help you with insulin resistance,
- **[12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1fCH6M6vZk&t=730s)** — actually improve the resistance, making insulin more sensitive.
- **[12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1fCH6M6vZk&t=734s)** — All right, so I hope I gave you a new viewpoint on this diabetes thing and
- **[12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1fCH6M6vZk&t=737s)** — how to reverse it.
- **[12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1fCH6M6vZk&t=739s)** — Now all you need to do is get the details of how to do it.
- **[12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1fCH6M6vZk&t=742s)** — And for that information, I put it up right here.

- **[00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=0s)** — Today we have something very interesting with Justin Richard. Now, if you haven't watched
- **[00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=6s)** — Justin's videos in the past, you have to check them out. I'll put his link down below. But
- **[00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=10s)** — he does this channel with evaluating his blood sugars on a continuous basis. And the type of
- **[00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=16s)** — information that he has found with experimenting with different foods is amazing. We're going
- **[00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=21s)** — to share with you some fascinating data about what happens with different foods. And if you
- **[00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=29s)** — check your blood sugars over a period of time, rather than just a one-time test,
- **[00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=33s)** — what you're going to reveal. So welcome, Justin. Thank you very much. I'm super pleased to be
- **[00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=39s)** — here. I'm a big fan of your content. I've been watching you for many, many years.
- **[00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=44s)** — And I'm happy to be here. Thank you. Awesome. I stumbled on your video and it gets right
- **[00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=53s)** — the point. And you use this continuous glucose monitor and you just basically
- **[01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=60s)** — test out all these different foods. Let's just dive in and just talk about some of the things
- **[01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=65s)** — that surprised you that you would never think would create that big of a spike. But I think
- **[01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=70s)** — just before that, what I need to mention is what we're testing. Because if you're new to
- **[01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=75s)** — this channel, I'll just kind of explain what we're testing. So anytime you eat certain
- **[01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=80s)** — foods, especially carbohydrates, depending on the type of carbohydrate, the blood sugar is going
- **[01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=85s)** — to either go slightly up or really high. And then it will eventually come down, hopefully.
- **[01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=94s)** — And so what's happening is we have different hormones that come in there and help regulate
- **[01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=98s)** — your blood sugars like insulin. And so when you don't get this leveling off, there could
- **[01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=109s)** — be more pre-diabetes. And a lot of people have that. So that's kind of my introduction.
- **[01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=114s)** — So jump right in, Justin. Well, it's really the most important factor for me was insulin
- **[02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=122s)** — resistance. And I have a history of type 2 diabetes in my family. Ants and uncles
- **[02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=126s)** — have it. My mom has it. And my whole reason for starting this channel was I wanted to do
- **[02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=133s)** — something to preempt this scenario. I don't want to end up with type 2 diabetes. And as I was
- **[02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=141s)** — in my late 40s, I was noticing that I was getting low energy year after year. My energy
- **[02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=146s)** — levels were diminishing year after year. And especially after I ate food and particular foods,
- **[02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=153s)** — highly processed, sugary foods, this really took my... it zapped my energy. And I was
- **[02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=159s)** — having a hard time working through the day. And given the history of type 2 diabetes in my
- **[02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=164s)** — family, I realized that I needed to do something quickly to get this under control because I was
- **[02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=171s)** — on that road to diminishing my health year after year. So that's the reason I did this.
- **[02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=179s)** — And I'm so grateful that I did get the CGM because it really takes the guesswork out of
- **[03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=187s)** — managing your blood sugar. And there are a lot of surprises that happen along the way. You
- **[03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=192s)** — realize what these foods are actually doing. In particular, these highly processed sugary
- **[03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=200s)** — foods, they really have a great impact on your blood sugar levels. And it really is an
- **[03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=207s)** — eye-opener when you get this CGM and you really see what's going on.
- **[03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=211s)** — Yeah, CGM is the continuous glucose monitor for those of you that
- **[03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=216s)** — didn't quite understand what that is. But yeah, that's awesome.
- **[03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=221s)** — Yeah. So, you know, when I first got it, I was just continuing what I was eating just to see
- **[03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=229s)** — what the foods that I would commonly eat were doing to my blood sugar. And I ate a lot of
- **[03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=237s)** — a lot of baked goods. Baked goods are my favorite thing. I grew up with them and I am not ashamed
- **[04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=243s)** — to say that I believe I have a sugar addiction to a certain degree. I crave sugar quite often.
- **[04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=251s)** — It's hard for me sometimes to say no to sugar, especially these baked goods and things like
- **[04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=255s)** — that. So when I first got the continuous glucose monitor, I was just testing out
- **[04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=259s)** — what these foods that I commonly ate are doing to my blood sugar. And it was a
- **[04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=265s)** — shocking surprise that these are really high elevations in blood sugar for me.
- **[04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=270s)** — And also they had quite a long duration. So that's not something that I wanted to continue.
- **[04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=276s)** — So it really brought this to light for me. And I started to alter my diet accordingly. Now,
- **[04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=284s)** — I do want to mention as well too that I still eat sugar from time to time. But I've
- **[04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=289s)** — cut back that intake significantly. So if someone eats sugar, obviously it's going to go up.
- **[04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=297s)** — What surprised you the most? What kind of food that you ate? You're like, wow,
- **[05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=301s)** — I had no idea it spiked that high. Well, besides the obvious sugary treats and
- **[05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=307s)** — stuff like that, white flour, any even bread or even whole wheat breads for me
- **[05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=313s)** — really spiked my blood sugar more than I thought they would. For some people,
- **[05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=317s)** — that may be different. That may be potatoes or rice for other people if we're off the track
- **[05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=324s)** — of the highly processed foods. Those are the standard foods that a lot of people are eating
- **[05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=329s)** — all the time. They have a significant impact or they can have a significant impact. So for
- **[05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=334s)** — me, it's that white flour, anything with white flour, that's pasta, breads, things like that.
- **[05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=341s)** — Then you're going to get people a little sad, well, I'm going to have whole wheat bread
- **[05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=345s)** — versus white bread. Have you ever tested those two? I've tested that. There's a minimal
- **[05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=352s)** — difference between the two. It's all highly processed. A lot of that is marketing. They
- **[05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=357s)** — tell you that it's brown bread and it's really not that much different. I've also tested
- **[06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=364s)** — sourdough bread and not much of a difference. Then of course, there's the argument that
- **[06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=369s)** — the bread that you buy, the sourdough bread that you buy at the grocery store is not
- **[06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=374s)** — authentic sourdough. That requires a fermentation process that you usually only get at a bakery.
- **[06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=382s)** — So I went to a local bakery. I got the authentic sourdough bread and it did not have
- **[06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=388s)** — that reduction that I was hoping for. So a lot of these things that you see and read online,
- **[06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=395s)** — you really have to test them for yourself because they may have studies behind them
- **[06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=400s)** — but not everybody reacts the same way. Unfortunately, it's not entirely accurate
- **[06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=408s)** — when you're taking those into account. I've tried freezing bread to increase the
- **[06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=413s)** — resistance starch overnight, freezing it and toasting it. It has a slight difference but
- **[06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=419s)** — all in all, these breads or these flowers really have a high impact on the blood sugar for me,
- **[07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=431s)** — at least anyway, and many people as well too. Darn it. What about Ezekiel breads? People are
- **[07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=438s)** — going to wonder about that sprouted bread. Have you tested that? I do. And that's my go
- **[07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=443s)** — to bread. I use that all the time. It seems to have the smallest impact on my blood sugar
- **[07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=448s)** — with the breads. Part of the reason is because the slices of that Ezekiel bread are a little
- **[07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=453s)** — bit smaller as well too. So that's something to take into account. But it is a healthier
- **[07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=458s)** — bread when you read the ingredient list and it's lower on the glycemic index than most breads
- **[07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=463s)** — that are using this white flour. So it is a good choice for me and all the recipes that I do
- **[07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=470s)** — that when I'm trying to cut back on the glycemic load, I use the Ezekiel bread.
- **[07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=475s)** — Interesting. So I have a question. So, you know, we talked about sugar, but if we take a look
- **[08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=483s)** — sugar and then we deduct the fiber and the sugar from it, we have what's called the net
- **[08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=487s)** — carb. People don't really know what that is. But I'm just going to tell you right now,
- **[08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=493s)** — for those of you watching, it's a starch, right? So sometimes you'll see
- **[08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=497s)** — products like this right here. Doritos. It has zero sugar, right? Zero sugar.
- **[08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=504s)** — So it must be okay. But have you ever tested maybe, I don't know, like a starch potato versus
- **[08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=513s)** — modified food starch or a starch, a refined starch like this, like really refined?
- **[08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=518s)** — Yeah, generally products like that that have corn as the ingredient really spike my blood
- **[08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=524s)** — sugar as well, too. They're generally really high on the glycemic index. And they can be
- **[08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=529s)** — me. So I try to avoid those as well, too. There's a lot of
- **[08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=534s)** — seed oils in those fried foods as well, too. Those are deep fried as well. So there's some
- **[09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=541s)** — issues with that for me as well, too. So I try to stay away from that. So it's not only
- **[09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=545s)** — about the blood sugar for me. I'm trying to eat healthier all the way around. Blood sugar is
- **[09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=549s)** — one of the things that I'm trying to watch. But I do consider things like that as well, too.
- **[09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=554s)** — Well, you know, you were into the pastries, bread stuff. I was into the salty chips in college.
- **[09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=562s)** — I would do a much bigger bag of Doritos in one sitting. But this right here doesn't seem
- **[09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=566s)** — like that much, right? So this is 14 serving sizes. Okay, 14. So you think anyone's going
- **[09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=573s)** — to have one 14th of this in one sitting? So if we just multiply the hidden sugars,
- **[09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=580s)** — which is the refined carbs and starch in here, this is how much sugar you're getting
- **[09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=586s)** — in this one bag. Yeah, that's incredible. It's just... and it's so deceiving.
- **[09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=594s)** — These foods are so highly palatable. These companies that manufacture these take a lot of
- **[09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=599s)** — time to get their recipes to have the maximum effect on your biochemistry to make you crave
- **[10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=606s)** — them more and more. I did some research on Doritos and they actually hook people up to
- **[10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=613s)** — a brain scanner to see how their brain is reacting to these chips when you eat them.
- **[10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=620s)** — And they're looking... they have their whole set of terminology. They're looking for the
- **[10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=623s)** — bliss point. So when you eat something, it's the right amount of dopamine that keeps you
- **[10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=628s)** — coming back for more of these chips. It makes this stuff really, really hard to resist. And
- **[10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=634s)** — that's why, like me, a lot of people are hooked on this stuff and it's hard to get off it.
- **[10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=640s)** — When you're comparing that food to a healthy food like broccoli, it's difficult to say,
- **[10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=648s)** — oh, I like the flavor of that broccoli better than these Doritos. It's a hard thing to
- **[10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=653s)** — shake when you're up against that. But part of understanding what is happening when
- **[11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=662s)** — you're eating that and having that data of your blood sugar can really show you
- **[11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=669s)** — what is going on. And that can scare you straight, so to speak. It can say, you know
- **[11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=674s)** — what? The consequences of me eating this stuff are not as... they're not good and I need to
- **[11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=680s)** — start doing something about it. When you start to get those symptoms later in life,
- **[11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=685s)** — you have to make a decision. Say, do I want to continue down this path
- **[11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=689s)** — or do I want to do something to make myself feel better and to regain my health that I once
- **[11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=695s)** — had when I was younger? But that's the battle is trying to stay away from these highly
- **[11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=705s)** — processed foods, increase the consumption of the whole foods that are high in fiber,
- **[11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=711s)** — rich in nutrients, vitamins and minerals, and low in this highly refined sugar that
- **[11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=717s)** — we're getting a lot of. So that's the challenge that I faced. And I think a lot of people face.
- **[12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=722s)** — That's what gets a lot of people in trouble with their metabolic health is this food addiction.
- **[12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=728s)** — We all have our favorite snacks. We all have our favorite foods. Ice cream for some people,
- **[12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=732s)** — potato chips or baked goods or chocolate, whatever that is, those are highly addictive foods.
- **[12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=739s)** — And they can really do a number on your blood sugar. There's a book called, I think,
- **[12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=745s)** — Dorito Effect. And what's interesting, they talk about the history of it. They manipulate
- **[12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=750s)** — the food to give this spike in burst of chemical, joy, dopamine, but then it drops
- **[12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=758s)** — really fast. So it's almost like, I need another one. It's like, I fell for it for years.
- **[12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=764s)** — I was in the trap. It took me a very long time to eventually come off those things,
- **[12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=771s)** — even if I was like, my stomach is in pain. So I know a lot of people are stuck in that trap.
- **[12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=778s)** — The advantage of this continuous glucose monitor is that you can't really necessarily know
- **[13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=785s)** — what's going on other than just feeling it like with your blood sugars. But now you can
- **[13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=789s)** — actually really see it and measure it. But without measuring it, you can't really control
- **[13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=795s)** — it. So be able to see the effects, not just like right after the food, but even hours later
- **[13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=802s)** — is super valuable, especially since not just food can affect your blood sugars.
- **[13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=810s)** — For me, a lack of sleep can increase my fasting blood sugar levels by 10,
- **[13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=816s)** — 15, even 20 points the next day. And my insulin sensitivity is not as good as well,
- **[13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=822s)** — so when I do eat the carbohydrates, I'll spike higher and for longer periods of time.
- **[13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=827s)** — Sleep is a big factor. Stress is also a big factor. And everybody says that,
- **[13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=832s)** — but nobody really understands the real consequences of that. When you have the
- **[13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=835s)** — continuous glucose monitor, you can see on the graph, oh, my fasting blood sugar level
- **[14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=841s)** — is actually up 15 points today because I only got five hours sleep last night or highly
- **[14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=848s)** — It really is something to see that because you don't consider that it would have that much of
- **[14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=856s)** — an impact. But when you see it, it's significant. Another thing that having the continuous glucose
- **[14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=863s)** — monitor that is an advantage is this test your blood sugar every five minutes. So it's
- **[14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=868s)** — like doing a finger stick every five minutes, 24 hours a day. So you get a chance to see your
- **[14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=878s)** — I used to eat a couple of hours, one hour before bed sometimes. And if I eat something like
- **[14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=886s)** — pizza or popcorn, caramel popcorn, I've done some tests on my page with that and went to
- **[14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=892s)** — sleep, my blood sugar will spike 50, 60, 65 milligrams per deciliter. And it will stay up
- **[14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=899s)** — for six, seven hours all through the night. And I would never have known that had I not
- **[15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=906s)** — the continuous glucose monitor to show me what's going on overnight, because you're not going to
- **[15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=910s)** — get up every five minutes and prick your finger to do the test. So that information is valuable.
- **[15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=917s)** — And that is enough to say, look, I am not going to be eating late at night before bed,
- **[15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=924s)** — especially high carbohydrate meals like that. Now my rule is I try to give myself three to
- **[15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=928s)** — four hours before I go to bed to digest that food. And I also try to make my last meal of
- **[15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=935s)** — day more of a keto style, low carbohydrates, higher proteins, higher fats. So if I am hungry,
- **[15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=941s)** — I can still satiate myself, but I'm not going to do these high carbs because going to sleep
- **[15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=948s)** — with a full stomach of carbohydrates is not good for my blood sugar.
- **[15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=952s)** — You said six hours.
- **[15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=955s)** — Six, seven hours even.
- **[15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=957s)** — Oh my gosh.
- **[15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=957s)** — Yeah. And I'm not even considered type two diabetic. But that is alarming when you see that
- **[16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=966s)** — because you've got your stomach is filled with these carbohydrates. You're not active.
- **[16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=972s)** — You don't have a chance to burn these calories off while you're sleeping as
- **[16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=976s)** — much as you do when you're up and you're active. So that revelation to me really made
- **[16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=981s)** — a big change with my behavior. I try not to eat. I do eat carbohydrates throughout the day
- **[16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=987s)** — sometimes I fall off the wagon and I eat these highly refined foods. But now I do them with some
- **[16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=995s)** — very specific hacks or ways to mitigate those blood sugar spikes in mind. I keep that in mind.
- **[16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=1002s)** — So I'm not going to eat those high carbohydrate meals before bed. If I am going to have some
- **[16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=1007s)** — carbohydrates, I'll include some proteins and some fats and something fibrous to help slow
- **[16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=1013s)** — down those carbohydrates.
- **[16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=1015s)** — So let's talk about that. So what we want to do... it's getting impossible to say,
- **[17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=1022s)** — no, you never can have this for the rest of your life. But if you do, there's things you
- **[17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=1026s)** — could do to buffer this insulin response. So let's talk about that. So you found fiber
- **[17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=1032s)** — will do it, right? Fiber. So if you're going to have a salad or something before a meal
- **[17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=1037s)** — or even vegetables, raw vegetables, things like that, even having an apple can help as well,
- **[17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=1046s)** — too. If you're just going to eat a chocolate bar by itself, I get a pretty big spike. But
- **[17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=1051s)** — I've done some tests on my page where I've had some hard boiled eggs before that,
- **[17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=1056s)** — or some broccoli before that. And I've done the test. It can bring...
- **[17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=1060s)** — So are you saying protein also can help?
- **[17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=1062s)** — These three things, fats, fibers, and proteins, they have a significant impact.
- **[17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=1066s)** — They slow down the rate at which that food moves through your digestive system.
- **[17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=1071s)** — And that can reduce the blood sugar spike, the post meal blood sugar spikes. So I've tested
- **[17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=1077s)** — each of them individually, proteins, fats, and fibers. They all do a pretty good job.
- **[18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=1083s)** — But if I'm going to have a chocolatey treat or a piece of cake or something like that,
- **[18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=1091s)** — I can have proteins, fats, and fibers beforehand. It fills me up so I'm less likely to eat more
- **[18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=1100s)** — of the junk food that I'm going to eat. And it helps to dampen or bring down that blood
- **[18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=1106s)** — sugar spike from that highly processed food. So that's a good rule of thumb that I've been
- **[18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=1111s)** — incorporating. You can also take supplements. You can also take apple cider vinegar,
- **[18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=1116s)** — which I know you've talked about. That has acetic acid in it, which helps to slow down
- **[18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=1121s)** — that digestion process as well. That can bring a blood sugar spike down by as much as 30%.
- **[18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=1127s)** — That really works. Wow. Wow. I mix a tablespoon of apple cider vinegar in a glass of water.
- **[18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=1132s)** — You drink that right before your meal, and it can really help to reduce that blood sugar spike.
- **[18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=1137s)** — I wonder if that's why some people unknowingly take a piece of bread, toast it, add butter,
- **[19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=1144s)** — and then cinnamon to help buff for the response. I don't know if that would do anything, but
- **[19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=1148s)** — that would be an interesting test. Yeah. And also, when you look at the sequence
- **[19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=1152s)** — of how people eat their meal, they usually start with a salad. Then they have the meal
- **[19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=1157s)** — and they finish with dessert. Well, that is the correct way to eat. And that may have been
- **[19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=1164s)** — developed or recognized over the years of tradition. You eat your salad first,
- **[19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=1169s)** — your meal, and then your dessert last. That is going to slow down the absorption or the
- **[19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=1175s)** — digestion of that sweet treat at the end. So that's the proper sequence to eat things.
- **[19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=1180s)** — It's to save the sweet treats for last. And plus when you eat a salad, because if you eat
- **[19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=1184s)** — the protein first, and even the salad after that, I noticed that people don't finish their
- **[19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=1190s)** — salad because the protein is the biggest satisfier, not the salad. So I always have
- **[19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=1197s)** — salad first. Not everyone does that, but I think that works for me. When we talked before,
- **[20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=1203s)** — you had a great tip. You know, just to minimize the temptation and try to do a lifestyle that
- **[20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=1210s)** — this stuff is not in your face all the time. So let's talk about like
- **[20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=1214s)** — tips that people can do that can minimize even the exposure of this junk food.
- **[20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=1220s)** — Other than just seeing, wow, my blood sugars are high, but what else can we do?
- **[20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=1224s)** — It's true. It's all about developing habits for me. So all this time that I spent eating
- **[20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=1232s)** — these junk foods all through my life have become habits for me. So I want a sweet treat after
- **[20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=1238s)** — a meal. I want something sweet in the morning. It's all about changing those habits from bad
- **[20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=1244s)** — habits into good habits. So I work on one or two at a time. The last one I've been trying
- **[20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=1249s)** — is obviously don't go to the grocery store. And this is simple. These are simple habits
- **[20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=1253s)** — that we've all probably heard before, but when you use them, they actually can really work.
- **[20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=1258s)** — Don't go to the grocery store when you're hungry. Go after you've eaten some food. You
- **[21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=1262s)** — make better choices there. And it's important for me when I do see something at the store
- **[21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=1268s)** — that I want to buy like something that's sweet, donuts or something like that. I say no to
- **[21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=1273s)** — it at the grocery store because at the grocery store, I only need to say no to it one time.
- **[21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=1278s)** — If I bring that item home and I put it in my fridge or my cupboard, every time I open the
- **[21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=1283s)** — fridge, I have to say no to that. That might be four, five, six times a day. I say no to it
- **[21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=1289s)** — once at the grocery store. Don't bring it into your environment. Don't make it easy to
- **[21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=1294s)** — access that food. That's a really important tip. And if you can implement that and stick
- **[21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=1300s)** — with that little habit, it can have a significant impact for the rest of your life.
- **[21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=1306s)** — Developing even simple little things like that can make big changes. If you're going to
- **[21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=1311s)** — have a big meal, another great one is you know you're going to eat a big meal. There's a high
- **[21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=1316s)** — carbohydrate load. Go for a 10-15 minute walk after that meal. That can have a really
- **[22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=1322s)** — significant impact to help bring that blood sugar spike down or keep it at a nicer level.
- **[22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=1329s)** — So walking just like that 10-15 minutes is a really good habit to start doing. And those
- **[22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=1335s)** — small little things that most people can do, it's free and they have a significant impact.
- **[22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=1341s)** — I like that. Yeah, because the first 30 minutes of walking, you're burning up all your extra
- **[22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=1347s)** — sugar and your blood. So that's very important. But I'm going to use that because
- **[22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=1352s)** — what you said before, because yeah, like if you buy it, it's in your fridge. Now you
- **[22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=1357s)** — have to constantly say no every single day. Every single night, you're like, no, no, no.
- **[22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=1361s)** — It keeps calling out to you. You know, when I was in my 20s and then 28, I think that's when
- **[22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=1369s)** — I got married and then early 30s, right before keto, I couldn't sleep. This is probably my
- **[22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=1377s)** — late 20s. I couldn't sleep. So the only way I could sleep is have a pint of Ben and Jerry's
- **[23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=1383s)** — ice cream before bed. You can imagine my blood sugars. And I think now looking back,
- **[23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=1388s)** — it was a sugar coma. Like, you start spiking the sugar too high and it's going to put you out.
- **[23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=1393s)** — Of course, I'd wake up like I had a hangover. But at least it helped me sleep because I had
- **[23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=1398s)** — the restless legs from the vitamin B deficiency that was created from all the carbohydrates.
- **[23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=1403s)** — So I was in that mode for quite some years. And it wasn't until and I don't know if this
- **[23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=1410s)** — happened to you or not. But, you know, there's a certain point in your life where
- **[23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=1413s)** — you make a shift of like, okay, I'm going to change my diet. And then you realize,
- **[23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=1418s)** — oh my gosh, I feel better. It was when I added protein for breakfast instead of my
- **[23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=1424s)** — carbohydrate, big, huge muffin, and my orange juice. I don't know what you did. But
- **[23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=1431s)** — I had a protein breakfast. That was like the biggest simple change that made me feel
- **[23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=1435s)** — better. What about you? What did you do? I started to do intermittent fasting. So I started
- **[24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=1443s)** — 16 eight intermittent fast. So all the tests that I do, by the way, are after a 16 hour
- **[24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=1448s)** — fast on an empty stomach. So I've put that into my life. And that's something that I can
- **[24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=1453s)** — stick with rather easily. So I'm never usually hungry first thing in the morning. So that was
- **[24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=1458s)** — an easy habit for me to pick up intermittent fasting. And then I started after that, I
- **[24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=1463s)** — started to add protein into the first meal of the day. So about 30 to 40 grams of protein,
- **[24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=1469s)** — I found that when I did that, I was satiated. I had better energy levels throughout that whole
- **[24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=1475s)** — morning or after breaking the fast, usually around noon. So after eating protein,
- **[24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=1481s)** — including that, that made a significant difference. And then of course,
- **[24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=1485s)** — what were you eating before that? Oh, donuts and junky stuff, sugary, sugary,
- **[24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=1491s)** — like breakfast cereals. Breakfast cereals are so high in sugar and they really spike blood
- **[24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=1496s)** — sugar. So, you know, and that's what everybody does. You grow up with cocoa puffs and fruit
- **[25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=1503s)** — loops and all these things and you think that's normal. That's a normal diet for a lot of
- **[25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=1507s)** — people. And we're unknowingly spiking our blood sugar significantly first thing in the morning.
- **[25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=1513s)** — And when you do that first thing in the morning, that sets you up to be hungry
- **[25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=1517s)** — and tired for the rest of the day. Setting your biochemistry up with a proper meal
- **[25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=1524s)** — first thing when you break your fast really has a positive effect for the rest of the day.
- **[25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=1530s)** — So I find that when I do the test, like the other day was national donut day. So I said,
- **[25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=1535s)** — all right, I'm going to do two donuts. I'm going to eat two donuts. I'm going to test them.
- **[25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=1539s)** — So I did it after my 16 hour fast on an empty stomach. It had a pretty big blood sugar
- **[25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=1544s)** — spike there. But for the rest of the day, I was tired. I was craving more sugar. I wanted
- **[25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=1551s)** — more. I wanted more sweets. So that first meal of the day is really, really important.
- **[25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=1557s)** — And I discovered that. Did you... how was that? Well, just have you noticed a big change from
- **[26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=1564s)** — in your mood, your overall mood when in the past versus when you are doing good foods?
- **[26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=1571s)** — Yeah. And for me, my mood is really directly correlated with my level of energy.
- **[26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=1576s)** — So if I have low energy, I don't feel like doing anything. And I'm not productive. When
- **[26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=1582s)** — I'm not productive, I say, why am I not doing this? Why am I not motivated? And that can get
- **[26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=1587s)** — me down because I don't feel productive. And I feel like I've lost the day. It can bring me
- **[26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=1592s)** — down a little bit. I've also experienced some anxiety if I have too many carbohydrates.
- **[26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=1598s)** — But that energy level was a big thing for me. I was getting... after I would eat a meal,
- **[26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=1603s)** — any of these meals, I would get so tired, I would be falling asleep in my chair, literally.
- **[26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=1610s)** — So it has a direct effect on my energy level, which in turn has an effect on my mood.
- **[26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=1615s)** — Getting that under control has been a real game changer in my life. That energy level
- **[27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=1622s)** — is where it all started for me. I realized, you know, late forties, it started mid to late
- **[27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=1627s)** — year after year, just getting tired, just tired every day and not having the energy that I once
- **[27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=1634s)** — had. And I said, what is going on here? And then I was researching insulin resistance.
- **[27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=1639s)** — And that's one of the symptoms. When you start to lose your energy, you're not using
- **[27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=1643s)** — the food properly. It's not metabolizing properly. And your blood sugar levels are
- **[27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=1649s)** — altered, making you tired. A lot of things go on with that. And that really has a
- **[27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=1654s)** — significant impact on a lot of people. You know, you don't have the time and energy,
- **[27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=1658s)** — you don't have the energy to do what you want to get done during the day. You don't have
- **[27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=1661s)** — the energy to connect with the people in your life that you want to. That has a serious
- **[27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=1666s)** — impact besides your health. Massive. When you were growing up, were you like a serious
- **[27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=1675s)** — junk food junkie or were you moderately eating poorly and then just snacking and then kind
- **[28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=1680s)** — of going through your 20s? Like what severity were you at as far as junk foods?
- **[28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=1684s)** — I would say, you know, I've been 40 pounds heavier than I am now. And you know, I would
- **[28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=1689s)** — say I have a sugar addiction. I would say that and I think a lot of people do that. I think
- **[28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=1696s)** — a lot of us are afraid to admit that. But I would find a lot of pleasure in going to the
- **[28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=1702s)** — store and buying a variety of junk foods and going home and eating them. That was a real
- **[28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=1707s)** — treat for me. I felt really good. Would you also do like healthier foods too at the same time?
- **[28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=1712s)** — Like growing up? Not then. Not at that time. Growing up that was a way for me to have
- **[28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=1719s)** — like a guarantee that I would feel good. I would go to the store. I would buy some
- **[28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=1724s)** — chocolate. I would buy some potato chips and maybe a soda and then I would come home and I
- **[28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=1729s)** — would eat them. I would really get a lot of delight out of that. So it was a way for me
- **[28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=1736s)** — too. I'm sorry. Did you have it in your house too? Was there always junk food in the house?
- **[29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=1741s)** — Well, not so much when I was very young. My mom didn't do that. But when I got out on my own,
- **[29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=1747s)** — when I got... I remember when I got my first job, I was 12. I was doing some stuff and I
- **[29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=1751s)** — had my own income. I could go to the store and buy this stuff that I wanted. And for me,
- **[29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=1757s)** — it was just a real treat. And you know, looking back on that now probably was, you
- **[29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=1763s)** — know, I was just looking at myself in some way. But yeah, I am still drawn to those foods.
- **[29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=1771s)** — And every once in a while I do fall off the wagon. Like the other day I did the donuts and
- **[29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=1775s)** — I said, wow, these really are good. But again, knowing the consequences of that really
- **[29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=1783s)** — put things into perspective and it really can hold you accountable for that.
- **[29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=1788s)** — You know, you could just schedule those days on the days you do the videos to
- **[29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=1791s)** — kill two birds with one stone, right? So it's for the video.
- **[29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=1796s)** — And that's what I've been doing. And then, you know, when I do those videos,
- **[30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=1800s)** — oftentimes I'll follow it up the next day with some way to mitigate this. So either going for
- **[30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=1807s)** — a walk or taking supplements like berberine or apple cider vinegar, which I did after the
- **[30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=1811s)** — donuts. I did that the following day. And that can really help to reduce those blood sugar
- **[30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=1816s)** — spikes too. So I'm realistic in the sense that it's very difficult to drop all this highly
- **[30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=1821s)** — processed food. Like 80% of the food out there is highly processed. Yeah.
- **[30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=1826s)** — 83%. It's difficult to give that up entirely and just switch over to whole foods.
- **[30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=1830s)** — That's a tough challenge. So my goal is to bring this down, bring the balance of this,
- **[30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=1836s)** — the ratio of highly processed foods to these whole foods. I want to bring that down. If I'm
- **[30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=1843s)** — 80% processed foods and 20% whole foods, I want to bring that up to 50%. My goal is to bring
- **[30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=1851s)** — that up so I'm eating more whole foods to processed foods. And that can have a tremendous
- **[30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=1856s)** — impact alone. But to be conscious of what category the foods I'm eating are in,
- **[31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=1862s)** — highly processed versus whole foods, that is a big thing as well too. That's a good habit
- **[31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=1868s)** — get into. What am I eating here? Is this processed or is this a whole food? And then being
- **[31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=1874s)** — conscious of that, bringing that ratio up. But again, it's really hard to do that entirely
- **[31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=1879s)** — just to quit that processed food, sugary food, cold turkey. I can't do that. So
- **[31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=1886s)** — to me, it's about making incremental steps towards evening out this ratio of processed
- **[31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=1893s)** — to high-level. I think that's one of the advantages of the continuous glucose
- **[31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=1897s)** — monitors. Number one, you can really finally face and look inside your body and go,
- **[31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=1904s)** — oh my gosh, this is what's happening. Because before you're like, I don't want
- **[31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=1908s)** — to think about it. But if it's in your face, you're checking your glucose and you're
- **[31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=1911s)** — looking at that. That's motivating. Yes, you feel better, but then you see it and then like,
- **[31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=1918s)** — so I mean, and then you also have just the experience of going through this. I think
- **[32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=1927s)** — if a person had the basic understanding and they experienced it for at least a week or two,
- **[32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=1933s)** — I don't think they're going to ever go back to where they were originally because
- **[32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=1938s)** — now they know that they feel so much better. I think this is what the glucose monitors
- **[32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=1944s)** — helping with is like making more of a longer change and not ever going back because
- **[32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=1950s)** — now you know it's in your knowledge base. It's not just you've experienced it because I
- **[32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=1956s)** — would I don't know if you would agree with this. I had to go through some suffering.
- **[32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=1963s)** — And then I had to change my diet to really prove to myself, this was correct. I mean,
- **[32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=1969s)** — I mean, you don't have to once you feel that way. It's like, there's a point where what am I
- **[32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=1974s)** — gonna ever go back now because I know I know I know I don't want to feel that way.
- **[32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=1979s)** — That's like me with late night eating carbohydrates that at night I say to myself,
- **[33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=1984s)** — do I want to go through an all night spike again for this? Yeah, right. It's not worth
- **[33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=1990s)** — it. So one tip that I use is I'll see something that I like. I like popcorn,
- **[33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=1995s)** — for example. I'll just put myself okay, let me just envision myself eating it.
- **[33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=2000s)** — Okay, what the pleasure? And then what am I going to feel like about a half hour later,
- **[33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=2004s)** — an hour later? Like, now I think I'll pass. But there's a, you know, if we take a look at
- **[33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=2011s)** — processed food, I recently started looking at all the processed foods and looking at the
- **[33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=2018s)** — common denominator, what really makes it up as far as like ingredients. And there's a lot of
- **[33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=2023s)** — complexities in the label. But really, when you come down to it, there's just three things that
- **[33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=2027s)** — make up 99% of it. And that would be this right here, which is maybe not in the form of
- **[33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=2035s)** — even sugar cane, it's too expensive, they use beet sugar or, or glucose syrup. And then of
- **[34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=2041s)** — course, you have seed oils, there's always seed oils. Now, what's interesting about that is
- **[34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=2047s)** — people think of saturated fats in junk food? No, they're all unsaturated fat. I mean, you
- **[34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=2054s)** — do you ever see any more like lard or Taylor in here? No, it's seed oils. And then you
- **[34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=2061s)** — have, of course, modified food storage, modified cornstarch, maltodextrin. So those
- **[34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=2068s)** — are that's it. And if you were just to take those three ingredients and mix them up and
- **[34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=2072s)** — put some flavoring on there, you wouldn't eat it. It has to be packaged in a really nice
- **[34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=2078s)** — thing like this. And it has to be in the right texture. And but I think more education
- **[34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=2084s)** — is going to be the key to get people off of it. And then I think I want to close with
- **[34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=2090s)** — the continuous glucose monitor. I personally went out to get one. And I think it was that was
- **[34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=2097s)** — the free free bird or what was that called? The lifestyle Libre. Yeah, it's the lifestyle Libre.
- **[35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=2105s)** — Yeah, I tried that. You know what? I it didn't work. It just had it was actually really bad
- **[35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=2111s)** — reviews. And then I, I tried it again. And I tried a third time and it just broke down.
- **[35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=2115s)** — And then I'm right now I just got the one that you recommended. So what and I don't
- **[35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=2121s)** — even remember what it's called because I just got it in the mail. What Which one do you use?
- **[35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=2125s)** — I use the brand at Cygnus. And they, they cater to people that are trying to improve
- **[35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=2132s)** — their metabolic health. And I really like them because of the software. The software is very
- **[35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=2138s)** — intuitive and easy to use. And once you get the data, how what you do with the data is
- **[35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=2143s)** — important. So being able to read that data properly is important. And some of the
- **[35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=2153s)** — not as intuitive, not as easy to use. Customer service is an important one as well. If you
- **[35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=2158s)** — have any questions, you want to be able to get a quick answer so you can move on and get
- **[36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=2164s)** — things going. So that's another issue as well, too. I like this company. I've been
- **[36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=2169s)** — working with them for over a year and a half now. And not all of these things run
- **[36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=2175s)** — perfectly all the time. There are little hiccups along the way. But of all the ones
- **[36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=2178s)** — I've tried, this one seems to be the most stable. And it works very, very well.
- **[36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=2184s)** — So yeah, even the reviews are much better. That's important. But also, is it small or too?
- **[36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=2191s)** — It's small. Yeah, it's a nice small. So these companies usually use one of two
- **[36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=2196s)** — hardware. So the biotech is there's two companies that really do it. One is the
- **[36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=2203s)** — lifestyle Libre. And the other one is the Dexcom. And the Dexcom has higher ratings. A
- **[36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=2208s)** — lot of people like it more. But it's the service that you get. They have different
- **[36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=2214s)** — software, different applications that you have on your phone. And I've tried a lot of
- **[36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=2218s)** — different ones. And again, you want ease of use. And you want something with it with an
- **[37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=2224s)** — interface that gives you suggestions on what to do. So when I'm eating something and I
- **[37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=2229s)** — have a blood sugar spike, it'll notify me. It'll make suggestions for me to lower that
- **[37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=2234s)** — like go for a walk. Now's the time to do some exercise. I can log the foods that I eat.
- **[37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=2240s)** — And it will tell me, you know, give me suggestions on what to do to manage my blood
- **[37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=2245s)** — sugar, which is a really good thing. So you're not just stuck with a bunch of data that you
- **[37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=2250s)** — don't really know what to do with. So a lot of the brands out there kind of don't offer
- **[37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=2258s)** — as much as what the Signos does. And that's part of the reason I like it so much.
- **[37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=2262s)** — I'm excited to use it. I'll be doing some experiments myself and then I will have to
- **[37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=2267s)** — do another video. But I will put your link down below also, Cigna. There's a link down
- **[37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=2272s)** — there as well. And hey, thanks for this collaboration. I think this is a great video
- **[37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=2279s)** — that people will start to kind of maybe start using this data to change their lifestyle.
- **[38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=2287s)** — Yeah, I think it's an exciting time to have this information. It really takes the guesswork
- **[38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=2291s)** — of managing your blood sugar. And for me, it's really helped a lot. I really appreciate
- **[38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=2295s)** — you having me on the show. Absolutely. Okay, great. Have a good one. Take care.

- **[00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uQvuJhWzOc&t=0s)** — So I always like to do these success stories when you find an amazing story you want to share with people.
- **[00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uQvuJhWzOc&t=8s)** — Today we have special guest Jim Buzot. And welcome Jim, how are you doing?
- **[00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uQvuJhWzOc&t=15s)** — I'm doing great. Thanks for having me.
- **[00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uQvuJhWzOc&t=17s)** — Absolutely. You know, it's interesting. My sister is about, I think, eight years younger than me.
- **[00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uQvuJhWzOc&t=23s)** — And she went to school with Jim and he went to the same middle school and high school and college.
- **[00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uQvuJhWzOc&t=31s)** — And so he was also a wrestler. So we have definitely have something in common.
- **[00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uQvuJhWzOc&t=35s)** — He wrestled heavyweight and I think two time national championship, right?
- **[00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uQvuJhWzOc&t=39s)** — Yes.
- **[00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uQvuJhWzOc&t=40s)** — Wow. Well done.
- **[00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uQvuJhWzOc&t=42s)** — Thank you.
- **[00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uQvuJhWzOc&t=44s)** — So, Jim, tell me a little bit about... did you always have... since you were a heavyweight, I'm guessing you've been big for a while, right?
- **[00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uQvuJhWzOc&t=52s)** — Or you've been overweight? I don't know, you tell me.
- **[00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uQvuJhWzOc&t=55s)** — Yeah, I was always on the heavy side. You know, always chunky, I guess.
- **[01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uQvuJhWzOc&t=60s)** — Wrestling was a good outlet for me to get in shape. Wrestling and football and sports, I always kind of got in better shape when I was participating in that stuff.
- **[01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uQvuJhWzOc&t=71s)** — And then I'd always kind of fall off when the season was over. And it was always a struggle.
- **[01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uQvuJhWzOc&t=76s)** — So you're going along for how many years before you said, you know, I just need I need to lose this weight?
- **[01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uQvuJhWzOc&t=83s)** — I was gradually getting higher and higher at one point reached 395. And I was sitting with one of my friends and I said, hey, five more pounds and I'm in the 400 club.
- **[01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uQvuJhWzOc&t=93s)** — And he said, what are you doing? You're crazy. Stop it. So that kind of dropped me, you know, down to I think I got down to 360 and stayed there probably for the last five years.
- **[01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uQvuJhWzOc&t=105s)** — I was probably in the 350, 360 range. At that point, did you have any other health problems?
- **[01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uQvuJhWzOc&t=111s)** — Yeah, I had a lot of health problems. I was hospitalized a couple of times with cellulitis in my legs.
- **[01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uQvuJhWzOc&t=119s)** — It was kind of I was always kind of sickly and you don't realize it at the time.
- **[02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uQvuJhWzOc&t=124s)** — But you just think it's normal, you know, that that you occasionally get ill.
- **[02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uQvuJhWzOc&t=128s)** — And I did that. And I and then and you just feel like this is kind of the end, you know, you're gradually get older and then you'll just get sick and die.
- **[02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uQvuJhWzOc&t=139s)** — And hopefully you can make it as long as possible. So it's something you kind of got used to.
- **[02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uQvuJhWzOc&t=144s)** — I mean, especially like being that heavy. I mean, I would imagine you probably get used to it.
- **[02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uQvuJhWzOc&t=148s)** — But I mean, just the weight of like close to 400 pounds on your joints, on your knees and your back. I can't imagine.
- **[02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uQvuJhWzOc&t=153s)** — But you probably just adapted to it. Yeah, it just seemed I think everybody got comfortable with it.
- **[02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uQvuJhWzOc&t=158s)** — My family, me. Yeah, I just thought it was I would just stay.
- **[02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uQvuJhWzOc&t=165s)** — Medicated and and, you know, just keep going that way, you know, was there something that when you started to figure out keto, what what how do you run into keto?
- **[03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uQvuJhWzOc&t=180s)** — Well, I always knew that, you know, whenever I would shift to a high protein diet, I would.
- **[03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uQvuJhWzOc&t=189s)** — I lose weight, you know, I was just kind of something clicked and I knew how to do it.
- **[03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uQvuJhWzOc&t=194s)** — You know, I knew that if I cut out, you know, processed foods and then carbs, I would lose weight.
- **[03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uQvuJhWzOc&t=201s)** — But what happened was I went to a wrestling meet up at Parkside and I seen their heavyweight get beat and I thought, you know what?
- **[03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uQvuJhWzOc&t=208s)** — I'm going to go. I can help this kid. I'm going to go in the room and help them.
- **[03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uQvuJhWzOc&t=211s)** — So I went into the room and realized I can't move anymore like I used to.
- **[03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uQvuJhWzOc&t=217s)** — You know, I I can't help this kid.
- **[03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uQvuJhWzOc&t=220s)** — So I thought, you know what? You need to start start working out, start eating right.
- **[03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uQvuJhWzOc&t=225s)** — And I really shifted towards as much protein as possible and really cut out.
- **[03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uQvuJhWzOc&t=237s)** — You know, every every carb I could think of, you know, and I.
- **[04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uQvuJhWzOc&t=246s)** — And then the weight, this is February of this year that this started and it just fell off me like.
- **[04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uQvuJhWzOc&t=253s)** — You know, it just it was amazing and I and I did work out throughout the process, but it wasn't like it was crazy workouts.
- **[04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uQvuJhWzOc&t=260s)** — You know, I was maybe twice a week up at the wrestling room, you know, getting on the bike, slowly getting back into I knew how to work out because I've done it, you know, pretty much my whole life.
- **[04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uQvuJhWzOc&t=272s)** — And. But this there was something different. And when I really.
- **[04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uQvuJhWzOc&t=278s)** — Kind of pushed out the processed foods and sugars that.
- **[04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uQvuJhWzOc&t=283s)** — It just changed my life, you know, it really did. So you went from how much weight to your current weight now, but tell me how much what you went from to currently.
- **[04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uQvuJhWzOc&t=292s)** — I was in February. I was probably in mid three sixties, maybe three sixty five and I right now I'm two fifty five.
- **[05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uQvuJhWzOc&t=301s)** — So it's 100 plus and that's that short amount of time, which was is really it's crazy that it happened that fast.
- **[05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uQvuJhWzOc&t=311s)** — And, you know, I follow kind of the three like I follow carnivore.
- **[05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uQvuJhWzOc&t=319s)** — Diet, but it's almost impossible to stay that, you know, that.
- **[05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uQvuJhWzOc&t=326s)** — Regimented so, but I really don't eat a lot of fruits and vegetables, you know, I think I get I mean I multi vitamins is kind of where I'm getting, you know, and and from your advice.
- **[05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uQvuJhWzOc&t=341s)** — Organ meat is where I get a lot of my my vitamins, but I mean, I don't eat any pasta, any sugar and I.
- **[05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uQvuJhWzOc&t=351s)** — I just think. Yeah, I just think I agree. It's crazy what happened to me in this short amount of time.
- **[05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uQvuJhWzOc&t=358s)** — It was it's been it's been amazing. It's life changing.
- **[06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uQvuJhWzOc&t=361s)** — You know, and it's been so many different aspects that that have happened to me.
- **[06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uQvuJhWzOc&t=366s)** — It's different positive things, you know, one thing that did happen.
- **[06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uQvuJhWzOc&t=371s)** — I did have I had a seizure because.
- **[06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uQvuJhWzOc&t=375s)** — I wasn't used to not holding the water that I had, so I went to my daughter's softball tournament and spent the whole day.
- **[06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uQvuJhWzOc&t=385s)** — I had some coffee in the morning. I'm kind of nervous when I watch her pitch.
- **[06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uQvuJhWzOc&t=388s)** — So I I didn't drink any water throughout the day.
- **[06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uQvuJhWzOc&t=393s)** — I got home and I went to bed and I had a seizure and I ended up in the hospital and it kind of broke it down.
- **[06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uQvuJhWzOc&t=399s)** — The neurologist and everybody that it was heat stroke and dehydration and maybe a salt deficiency that kind of caused this thing.
- **[06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uQvuJhWzOc&t=407s)** — So, I mean, that's kind of a warning to other people.
- **[06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uQvuJhWzOc&t=411s)** — If they go through this to really keep an eye on, you know, their electrolyte intake, which I which I do.
- **[07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uQvuJhWzOc&t=420s)** — You know, so. Yeah, I'll just mention one point for those of you that are watching.
- **[07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uQvuJhWzOc&t=426s)** — What happens when you when you start this, when you cut out carbs, you lose all tremendous amount of water weight.
- **[07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uQvuJhWzOc&t=431s)** — And with that comes electrolyte loss. So if you don't, especially potassium, too.
- **[07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uQvuJhWzOc&t=436s)** — So if you don't add either electrolytes and sea salt, you're going to end up pretty dehydrated.
- **[07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uQvuJhWzOc&t=443s)** — So that's just a really important little factor. I'm glad that you you figure that out.
- **[07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uQvuJhWzOc&t=447s)** — But yeah, that's amazing. So, Jim, when you do the carnivore, of course, you can get all your nutrients.
- **[07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uQvuJhWzOc&t=452s)** — You just have to know what to do. So you're adding probably beef liver, organ meats, eggs, fish,
- **[07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uQvuJhWzOc&t=460s)** — the omega three fatty acids, probably, and also shellfish for all the trace minerals.
- **[07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uQvuJhWzOc&t=466s)** — And you can even get some vitamin C from liver as well. And you've been doing that, right?
- **[07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uQvuJhWzOc&t=471s)** — I mean, you're like, because so many people just do the steak, which is it's not going to give you everything, a lot of things, but not everything.
- **[07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uQvuJhWzOc&t=479s)** — Yeah, I eat a lot of chicken liver. I eat a lot of beef liver.
- **[08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uQvuJhWzOc&t=484s)** — We blend up the liver and add it to the to the beef, make hamburgers with it, kind of takes that that funk away from the taste a little bit.
- **[08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uQvuJhWzOc&t=494s)** — Yeah, salt. No seasonings really except salt. I use sea salt.
- **[08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uQvuJhWzOc&t=503s)** — I do go, like I said, if I in the morning, I'll drink a protein shake, carnivore protein shake.
- **[08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uQvuJhWzOc&t=514s)** — A premiere protein bar. If, you know, if I try not to get hungry, I try not if I'm I always keep something with me just so I'm not ever really tempted.
- **[08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uQvuJhWzOc&t=527s)** — These days, I'm not. It's weird how I like Fourth of July, I stood in the tent where all the food was and just looked around at everything.
- **[08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uQvuJhWzOc&t=534s)** — And I was thinking, why don't I want this food anymore? Wow.
- **[08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uQvuJhWzOc&t=537s)** — And I grabbed a brat and ate a brat. And yeah, it's really has I because the way I feel just outweighs that that need.
- **[09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uQvuJhWzOc&t=550s)** — Yeah, you know, that's that's that's with me too. When I get to the point where I'm like, you know what, I already know what I'm going to feel like if I go this other direction.
- **[09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uQvuJhWzOc&t=557s)** — It's like, no, it's not worth it, because I'm sure people around you are not doing what you're doing.
- **[09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uQvuJhWzOc&t=562s)** — And then and they're they're probably looking at you kind of weird. But you're like, no, I'm good. I'm good.
- **[09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uQvuJhWzOc&t=566s)** — I did get it. I think I got it for a month from my wife until she started seeing what was happening to me.
- **[09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uQvuJhWzOc&t=573s)** — And now she's probably about 90 percent on board. You know, she eats what I eat.
- **[09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uQvuJhWzOc&t=580s)** — And I seen her eat an onion ring the other day. But she's she's had miraculous with her skin, you know, and and it's just those little byproducts of this diet that are just amazing.
- **[09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uQvuJhWzOc&t=592s)** — I feel like my hair is coming back on top of my head. You know, it's the weirdest, you know, skin tags gone.
- **[10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uQvuJhWzOc&t=601s)** — Wow. And it's and I see people that I've known for 20 years and I walk by them and they double take, you know, because they don't recognize me.
- **[10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uQvuJhWzOc&t=611s)** — I mean, you have those before and after pictures. It's a different a different person.
- **[10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uQvuJhWzOc&t=616s)** — And so then the people I talked to and I explained today, I was at the gym and I was talking to a guy and I mean, the results that have happened, you just can't deny what has happened to me.
- **[10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uQvuJhWzOc&t=629s)** — So they there's a lot of people on board, you know, and I and I appreciate the info I get from you.
- **[10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uQvuJhWzOc&t=636s)** — And there's several doctors that I kind of pull stuff from and, you know, Barry, Dr. Barry, I pull some stuff from and Dr. Chafee, he's kind of an extremist.
- **[10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uQvuJhWzOc&t=648s)** — But I think you've all kind of done this for me. And thank you for that.
- **[10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uQvuJhWzOc&t=655s)** — Hey, you're welcome. My pleasure. That's that's why I do it. It's really it's a lot of enjoyment just to get people just to at least try it to see that they can do it.
- **[11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uQvuJhWzOc&t=664s)** — And that's why I wanted to create this video to inspire the people who are sitting there haven't done it yet.
- **[11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uQvuJhWzOc&t=669s)** — You might want to, you know, try it out. And because, you know, it's not it's there's like thousands and thousands of people that we have on the website to just before and afters.
- **[11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uQvuJhWzOc&t=679s)** — But, you know, what you did is you just cut out the carbs. That's the that's the most important thing is cutting out carbs.
- **[11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uQvuJhWzOc&t=687s)** — And then you substituted the protein and the fat. And then once you started feeling the difference, then no one can convince you otherwise.
- **[11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uQvuJhWzOc&t=696s)** — I mean, you probably also have how about your energy or even your cognitive function?
- **[11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uQvuJhWzOc&t=703s)** — I drive when I'm driving through Kenosha, sometimes I look at a house and I realize I got babysat there when I was seven.
- **[11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uQvuJhWzOc&t=711s)** — That's the kind of weird stuff is happening with my brain and energy.
- **[11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uQvuJhWzOc&t=717s)** — These people say you're working out a ton, right? I said, I'm not working out a ton, but I cannot not work out.
- **[12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uQvuJhWzOc&t=723s)** — I got to be doing something because of the energy level is so high.
- **[12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uQvuJhWzOc&t=726s)** — You know, I probably rode my bike to the four miles to the gym today, four miles back.
- **[12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uQvuJhWzOc&t=732s)** — I lifted, but it's not crazy. I'm not, you know, maybe it was half hour, 45 minute workout and then came back because otherwise that gives me the best.
- **[12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uQvuJhWzOc&t=746s)** — If I if I get rid of this energy, I sleep better.
- **[12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uQvuJhWzOc&t=748s)** — And it's really doesn't feel restrictive, the diet, because there's such a, you know, people ask me, what you eat?
- **[12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uQvuJhWzOc&t=754s)** — And I said anything that any animal, if it comes from an animal to eat cheese still, I drink milk.
- **[12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uQvuJhWzOc&t=761s)** — And it's the ultimate elimination diet, because, you know, milk makes my shoulders a little sore, a little bit of inflammation, I think, from the sugar in the milk.
- **[12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uQvuJhWzOc&t=770s)** — But I know what it does to me. And that's kind of what what's happened.
- **[12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uQvuJhWzOc&t=775s)** — I know, you know, I know what everything how everything affects me.
- **[12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uQvuJhWzOc&t=779s)** — Yeah, you're in tune to the food and you can, you know, it's almost good sometimes they go off just so you could really see for sure like, OK, yeah, that that's going to create some inflammation.
- **[13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uQvuJhWzOc&t=789s)** — No, thank you. You know, and when I wrestled, unfortunately, I was I had always cut weight.
- **[13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uQvuJhWzOc&t=794s)** — You probably didn't have to worry about that. But cutting a lot of weight, if I only would have known what I know now, I mean, back then, have been incredible because I was trying to live on carbs.
- **[13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uQvuJhWzOc&t=806s)** — And lose weight by just not just starving for like three days. Right.
- **[13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uQvuJhWzOc&t=811s)** — The worst, worst for your energy. And so not not that someone wants to do.
- **[13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uQvuJhWzOc&t=819s)** — You know, if you're an athlete, you know, you're going to have to eat a lot more calories or else you're going to get really lean.
- **[13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uQvuJhWzOc&t=826s)** — So and actually probably more fat, too. But but yeah, so this is amazing.
- **[13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uQvuJhWzOc&t=831s)** — So also, what about like your your your exercise?
- **[13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uQvuJhWzOc&t=835s)** — And I don't know if you're still wrestling now or coaching or working with people.
- **[13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uQvuJhWzOc&t=839s)** — What about your physical strength or agility and endurance?
- **[14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uQvuJhWzOc&t=846s)** — It's it is through the roof. It's the muscle mass at this age to be putting on, you know, and abs.
- **[14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uQvuJhWzOc&t=855s)** — I didn't have I've never had abs before.
- **[14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uQvuJhWzOc&t=858s)** — You know, it's just a whole different body.
- **[14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uQvuJhWzOc&t=862s)** — It really is. It's I walk by the mirror sometimes at night on the way to the bathroom and I kind of stop and look at the mirror.
- **[14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uQvuJhWzOc&t=869s)** — And I'm just flabbergasted what has happened.
- **[14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uQvuJhWzOc&t=872s)** — And wow, it's yeah, it's I never I couldn't believe that at this age I could have this much energy.
- **[14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uQvuJhWzOc&t=881s)** — And I've wrestled I've wrestled in two tournaments since this.
- **[14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uQvuJhWzOc&t=886s)** — I've lost all and four.
- **[14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uQvuJhWzOc&t=889s)** — But I went the distance and lost an overtime.
- **[14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uQvuJhWzOc&t=892s)** — The two of these are 30 guys that I'm wrestling and I lost to nothing to two of them and an overtime to the other two.
- **[14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uQvuJhWzOc&t=899s)** — And I don't even mind, you know, that I lost as I just being able to participate at this age.
- **[15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uQvuJhWzOc&t=906s)** — And I'm going to do it again.
- **[15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uQvuJhWzOc&t=907s)** — And I'm I plan on the wrestling season is going to start here in a minute up at Parkside.

- **[15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uQvuJhWzOc&t=924s)** — I'll be 53 in a week and a half.
- **[15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uQvuJhWzOc&t=927s)** — Yeah.
- **[15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uQvuJhWzOc&t=928s)** — OK. So now are you saying you wrestled in like an old timers tournament or what?
- **[15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uQvuJhWzOc&t=932s)** — Basically, yeah, basically an old time.
- **[15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uQvuJhWzOc&t=934s)** — The Badger State games I wrestled in.
- **[15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uQvuJhWzOc&t=937s)** — So I had a couple of guys at my weight class in the early 30s.
- **[15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uQvuJhWzOc&t=941s)** — And then I wrestled in an old timers tournament in Franklin.
- **[15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uQvuJhWzOc&t=946s)** — And those guys were a little younger.
- **[15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uQvuJhWzOc&t=949s)** — But I feel like, yeah, it's just.
- **[15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uQvuJhWzOc&t=953s)** — And I can't wait to do it again.
- **[15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uQvuJhWzOc&t=955s)** — And, I mean, my knees feel better than they probably ever have.
- **[15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uQvuJhWzOc&t=959s)** — You know, I just I don't have any inflammation is what it is.
- **[16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uQvuJhWzOc&t=964s)** — Incredible. Yeah, it is.
- **[16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uQvuJhWzOc&t=967s)** — It's incredible.
- **[16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uQvuJhWzOc&t=968s)** — If I could only find like an old terms tournament around here, I would jump into that and do that.
- **[16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uQvuJhWzOc&t=973s)** — My wife let me because I just would love it because you train.
- **[16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uQvuJhWzOc&t=976s)** — You do that for so long and all of a sudden, like, OK, you stop and you have you want to keep doing it because it's like it's a game.
- **[16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uQvuJhWzOc&t=983s)** — But unfortunately, there's not much around in southern Virginia.
- **[16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uQvuJhWzOc&t=987s)** — But yeah, that would be interesting because I'm about one hundred eighty seven.
- **[16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uQvuJhWzOc&t=993s)** — So I guess I'd have to maybe lose a couple pounds for the one eighty.
- **[16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uQvuJhWzOc&t=1000s)** — Yeah, there's probably something down there you could find.
- **[16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uQvuJhWzOc&t=1002s)** — I think there's something I'm going to have to check it out.
- **[16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uQvuJhWzOc&t=1005s)** — I have some serious endurance because I live on a farm and I'm talking about hills.
- **[16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uQvuJhWzOc&t=1009s)** — I think I mean, I know even people that come here that are a lot younger.
- **[16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uQvuJhWzOc&t=1013s)** — They can't keep up because of the environment, you know, the high altitude, the work around the farm.
- **[17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uQvuJhWzOc&t=1020s)** — It's like I'm in better shape now than I was 20 years ago.
- **[17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uQvuJhWzOc&t=1024s)** — So yeah, totally into it.
- **[17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uQvuJhWzOc&t=1026s)** — When people say that in the past, I wouldn't believe it, you know, but I believe it now.
- **[17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uQvuJhWzOc&t=1031s)** — I find it hard to lose my wind.
- **[17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uQvuJhWzOc&t=1035s)** — I'm on my bike going uphill and I and and yeah, it's a whole new it's a whole new life for me.
- **[17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uQvuJhWzOc&t=1042s)** — And I can't wait to see what's next.
- **[17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uQvuJhWzOc&t=1045s)** — You know how? Yeah, how I how I improve more, you know, literally have gotten younger as you're getting older.
- **[17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uQvuJhWzOc&t=1054s)** — So as far as advice, if you were just to give someone some advice and they're sitting on the edge thinking, you know what?
- **[17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uQvuJhWzOc&t=1061s)** — I need to do this. But I what tip when you give them more advice to motivate them?
- **[17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uQvuJhWzOc&t=1068s)** — It's not as hard as it's not as hard as you think.
- **[17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uQvuJhWzOc&t=1071s)** — And I think a lot of people think especially if they're obese, because I feel like I was obese when you put up that picture.
- **[17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uQvuJhWzOc&t=1078s)** — I was obese.
- **[18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uQvuJhWzOc&t=1081s)** — You think it's going to take two years.
- **[18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uQvuJhWzOc&t=1083s)** — It's the thing it's going to take. I haven't got two years to I can't do this for two years, but it don't.
- **[18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uQvuJhWzOc&t=1088s)** — And the other thing is you have such a large range of food you can eat from the chicken and and you don't bypass.
- **[18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uQvuJhWzOc&t=1096s)** — You know, in my brain, it's not the animal fats that are clogging arteries.
- **[18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uQvuJhWzOc&t=1100s)** — My mom died at 56 in her sleep from a clogged heart.
- **[18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uQvuJhWzOc&t=1105s)** — And it's in her mom, the same thing.
- **[18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uQvuJhWzOc&t=1108s)** — You know, my father's still alive. They have strong hearts, luckily.
- **[18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uQvuJhWzOc&t=1113s)** — And I don't I don't feel like it's animal fats that are clogging the hearts.
- **[18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uQvuJhWzOc&t=1118s)** — It's it's that gluten in the animal in the starch mixed together.
- **[18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uQvuJhWzOc&t=1123s)** — So now in my brain is I know if I start adding that back into my diet, I feel like it's just going to stop everything up again.
- **[18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uQvuJhWzOc&t=1130s)** — So that's kind of but you got to look at it the big range of food you can eat.
- **[18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uQvuJhWzOc&t=1136s)** — And I mean, if you look at I know I get some I get some plant based stuff from my from my bars and stuff that I'll eat.
- **[19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uQvuJhWzOc&t=1143s)** — And I think that's kind of the key to I talk to people.
- **[19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uQvuJhWzOc&t=1146s)** — They say I can't I can't give up chocolate.
- **[19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uQvuJhWzOc&t=1148s)** — I'm like, well, have some protein bars sitting there.
- **[19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uQvuJhWzOc&t=1151s)** — And if you got to have one, have one, you know, but.
- **[19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uQvuJhWzOc&t=1158s)** — The big group of food you can eat makes it easy, you know, because I've tried, you know, you try if you try to just eat salad and you deprive yourself of of calories to lose weight.
- **[19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uQvuJhWzOc&t=1169s)** — I did a juice fast one time for 30 days and I sure I lost like 60 pounds, but I was awfully weak.
- **[19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uQvuJhWzOc&t=1177s)** — And.
- **[19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uQvuJhWzOc&t=1179s)** — I didn't feel like I feel now, you know, and then soon as soon as it was over, it was.
- **[19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uQvuJhWzOc&t=1185s)** — That bloomed up again right away.
- **[19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uQvuJhWzOc&t=1188s)** — You can't do it for any period of time.
- **[19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uQvuJhWzOc&t=1189s)** — Right. This you can live on.
- **[19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uQvuJhWzOc&t=1191s)** — And if you and people say, well, I can't eat a I can't eat steak with your salt on it.
- **[19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uQvuJhWzOc&t=1195s)** — I need to put well then do that.
- **[19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uQvuJhWzOc&t=1197s)** — If you have to do that, do that to stay on it.
- **[20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uQvuJhWzOc&t=1200s)** — You know, don't you know.
- **[20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uQvuJhWzOc&t=1203s)** — Do whatever you can to stick with it.
- **[20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uQvuJhWzOc&t=1206s)** — You know, if it takes some vanilla yogurt at night and with a little bit of sugar in it, do it.
- **[20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uQvuJhWzOc&t=1213s)** — You know, that's going to keep you on track because that's what I do once in a while.
- **[20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uQvuJhWzOc&t=1217s)** — I have a cup of vanilla vanilla yogurt to get me through the evening when I'm what I got a little sweet tooth, you know.
- **[20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uQvuJhWzOc&t=1224s)** — But I think it's easier than you think.
- **[20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uQvuJhWzOc&t=1226s)** — And the way I tell them, I tell the people that question me and I could tell they're on the fence.
- **[20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uQvuJhWzOc&t=1232s)** — I say do it 10 days, you know, do it for 10 days, cut out all your carbs and sugars and don't eat anything that grows for 10 days.
- **[20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uQvuJhWzOc&t=1241s)** — That's what I say. Try that.
- **[20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uQvuJhWzOc&t=1243s)** — Just try it. Eat, you know, eat some beef, bacon.
- **[20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uQvuJhWzOc&t=1247s)** — They say I can have bacon. Yeah, you can have bacon.
- **[20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uQvuJhWzOc&t=1250s)** — You can, you know, you can drink milk. You can.
- **[20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uQvuJhWzOc&t=1253s)** — I went for a stint where I was drinking raw milk.
- **[20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uQvuJhWzOc&t=1255s)** — I was getting it from a farm.
- **[20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uQvuJhWzOc&t=1257s)** — One of my wrestler buddies, his dad has a farm.
- **[21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uQvuJhWzOc&t=1261s)** — And I was going to the farm and getting the milk.
- **[21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uQvuJhWzOc&t=1263s)** — And I felt when I was drinking that, even now, I feel like I can't get sick.
- **[21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uQvuJhWzOc&t=1269s)** — That's one thing. My immune system is so solid right now.
- **[21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uQvuJhWzOc&t=1274s)** — My daughter has a cold right now.
- **[21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uQvuJhWzOc&t=1276s)** — I don't mind her.
- **[21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uQvuJhWzOc&t=1279s)** — She can give me a kiss if she wants.
- **[21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uQvuJhWzOc&t=1280s)** — She I am not getting sick.
- **[21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uQvuJhWzOc&t=1282s)** — I feel like I mean, that's how I and I really haven't had any illness besides that.
- **[21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uQvuJhWzOc&t=1287s)** — Besides the seizure, which I think was caused from the excessive weight loss.
- **[21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uQvuJhWzOc&t=1292s)** — But I haven't been sick in months.
- **[21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uQvuJhWzOc&t=1294s)** — And I that's how you kind of feel like you can't, you know, that's what my wife said.
- **[21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uQvuJhWzOc&t=1299s)** — I think your hair is getting darker.
- **[21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uQvuJhWzOc&t=1301s)** — I said, let me go check.
- **[21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uQvuJhWzOc&t=1303s)** — And I act like I was going to fly away because that's how you it just gets better and better and better.
- **[21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uQvuJhWzOc&t=1309s)** — So that's awesome.
- **[21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uQvuJhWzOc&t=1310s)** — Yeah, if you're on the fence and you're thinking about doing this, just kind of write down all the foods.
- **[21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uQvuJhWzOc&t=1316s)** — You can eat and there's a lot, you know, if you like chicken, you know, eat the skin, eat the fat.
- **[22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uQvuJhWzOc&t=1323s)** — You know, that's my that's my philosophy.
- **[22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uQvuJhWzOc&t=1327s)** — And but I do like I said, I do take a multivitamin still amount of blood pressure medicine.
- **[22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uQvuJhWzOc&t=1333s)** — I found out I thought my blood pressure would just naturally go down when I lost all this weight and it didn't.
- **[22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uQvuJhWzOc&t=1341s)** — And so I kind of came in and still kind of stayed up.
- **[22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uQvuJhWzOc&t=1343s)** — So I have it in a perfect spot right now.
- **[22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uQvuJhWzOc&t=1346s)** — It's half of what I took when it all started.
- **[22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uQvuJhWzOc&t=1350s)** — But it's you know, I take a magnesium vitamin D3.
- **[22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uQvuJhWzOc&t=1356s)** — I do take I do get a lot of sun, but I'm going to again, your cod liver suggestion will be my winner vitamin D, I believe.

- **[23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uQvuJhWzOc&t=1398s)** — I think about 100. Well, like I said, I was three I was I want to say 110 is probably where I went to the doctor's office.

- **[23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uQvuJhWzOc&t=1409s)** — And I stopped her. I said, now get back here. That's something wrong with the scale.
- **[23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uQvuJhWzOc&t=1413s)** — And she came back in and she zeroed it out and I got on it and it was 252 and I could not believe it.
- **[23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uQvuJhWzOc&t=1419s)** — Wow. So yeah, right now I'm going to it's it's 100 plus pounds lost since February.

- **[00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8dfLN5qpsI&t=0s)** — The more I look at health, the more that you cannot create health without stress and some bit of
- **[00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8dfLN5qpsI&t=7s)** — destruction. You've heard the concept, no pain, no gain, or what doesn't kill you will make you
- **[00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8dfLN5qpsI&t=14s)** — stronger. I mean, what's up with that? So today I'm going to do a little bit of a deep dive into
- **[00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8dfLN5qpsI&t=18s)** — this term hormesis. Now, what is this term hormesis? What does that mean? It's a term
- **[00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8dfLN5qpsI&t=23s)** — to describe two things that might oppose each other in outcome. And I'm going to give a lot
- **[00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8dfLN5qpsI&t=27s)** — examples, but I think we all know that when we exercise we're creating destruction in our cells.
- **[00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8dfLN5qpsI&t=33s)** — And then the outcome of that is something that's stronger, it's healthier, it's more fit.
- **[00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8dfLN5qpsI&t=37s)** — So hormesis is really about a controlled dose of stress. And deep inside ourselves we have
- **[00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8dfLN5qpsI&t=44s)** — this very interesting adaptation mechanism. And the system that actually is controlling this is
- **[00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8dfLN5qpsI&t=52s)** — part endocrine system and part autonomic nervous system. So both of these work together to help
- **[01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8dfLN5qpsI&t=60s)** — your body adapt to becoming stronger. And the key word is adaptation. And you've probably heard
- **[01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8dfLN5qpsI&t=65s)** — of the concept of survival of the fittest. It should be called survival of those who can
- **[01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8dfLN5qpsI&t=73s)** — adapt the best. So with hormesis you can adapt from various stresses, radiation, exercise
- **[01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8dfLN5qpsI&t=81s)** — cold stress, heat stress, like sauna, things like that. Also reducing your oxygen and increasing
- **[01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8dfLN5qpsI&t=87s)** — your CO2 can create a hormetic effect. And even various plant chemicals. A lot of different
- **[01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8dfLN5qpsI&t=95s)** — insecticides, pesticides, and even fungicides. Of course they're in very very low doses because
- **[01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8dfLN5qpsI&t=101s)** — they're meant to kill these small little insects. But when we consume them we're creating
- **[01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8dfLN5qpsI&t=107s)** — a hormetic effect. So let's just take for example sulforaphane like in broccoli sprouts
- **[01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8dfLN5qpsI&t=112s)** — or radish sprouts. What it does is it triggers certain proteins, certain chemical pathways.
- **[02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8dfLN5qpsI&t=121s)** — One protein that it triggers is called a heat shock protein that activates certain things
- **[02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8dfLN5qpsI&t=126s)** — that allow us to strengthen our detoxification enzymes. So here we are exposed to a small dose
- **[02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8dfLN5qpsI&t=134s)** — of a poison that strengthens our own ability to get rid of poisons. In our liver we have these
- **[02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8dfLN5qpsI&t=142s)** — enzyme systems called phase one phase two detoxification where we can take a poison and
- **[02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8dfLN5qpsI&t=146s)** — turn into a harmless particle. Well guess what triggers that system? The sulforaphane,
- **[02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8dfLN5qpsI&t=152s)** — this poison. You're causing all these different enzymes and proteins to then
- **[02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8dfLN5qpsI&t=158s)** — rebuild and repair. And so the rebuilding and repair mechanism won't occur until you trigger
- **[02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8dfLN5qpsI&t=164s)** — it. So in other words exercise induces micro inflammation that then allows our bodies to
- **[02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8dfLN5qpsI&t=171s)** — get rid of inflammation. And then we get into this wild concept of starving our bodies, right?
- **[02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8dfLN5qpsI&t=177s)** — We call that fasting. And all of a sudden all of these amazing things occur. Our brain cells
- **[03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8dfLN5qpsI&t=182s)** — start growing more, our mitochondria starts increasing in number, our immune system gets
- **[03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8dfLN5qpsI&t=189s)** — regenerated from new stem cells. Deepen our genes from years of adaptation, the different
- **[03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8dfLN5qpsI&t=196s)** — mechanisms that were strengthened and created to counter starvation so we could survive.
- **[03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8dfLN5qpsI&t=202s)** — Because when you think about it starvation can kill you if you go on too long. But short term
- **[03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8dfLN5qpsI&t=207s)** — it's amazing. Same thing with exercise, right? You can over train to the point where
- **[03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8dfLN5qpsI&t=211s)** — you're completely dead, right? But just a little bit of exercise is really good. Same
- **[03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8dfLN5qpsI&t=215s)** — thing with cold therapy, right? I mean think about it's only so much time you're going to
- **[03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8dfLN5qpsI&t=218s)** — spend in this 35 degree temperature before you're going to have problems. Each person
- **[03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8dfLN5qpsI&t=226s)** — has their own individual tolerance for certain stress that they can take to be able to do this.
- **[03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8dfLN5qpsI&t=233s)** — We cannot create health just by being sedentary all the time and doing nothing.
- **[03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8dfLN5qpsI&t=237s)** — Now there's some other interesting counterintuitive things about health too. And this is not a
- **[04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8dfLN5qpsI&t=241s)** — hormesis thing but it's just very counterintuitive, right? Because we
- **[04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8dfLN5qpsI&t=244s)** — used to think that if we cut the amount of fat that we eat then we will lose our fat.
- **[04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8dfLN5qpsI&t=248s)** — Well we found that that didn't work because people tend to change the type of calories
- **[04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8dfLN5qpsI&t=254s)** — to more carbs, right? And then that converts to fat. Then we have another concept of
- **[04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8dfLN5qpsI&t=259s)** — the more sugar that you eat the less sugar you will eventually absorb. Why? Because your
- **[04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8dfLN5qpsI&t=267s)** — body develops this adaptation, this resistance against it. It's called insulin resistance. It's
- **[04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8dfLN5qpsI&t=273s)** — a protective mechanism. Our blood only really has about a teaspoon of sugar in it to be normal.
- **[04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8dfLN5qpsI&t=279s)** — An average person consumes a lot of sugar so we're dumping all the sugar and this is not
- **[04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8dfLN5qpsI&t=284s)** — normal. So our body protects itself with insulin resistance to the point where now you can't
- **[04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8dfLN5qpsI&t=289s)** — really absorb sugar that well. And it creates problems because now the brain cells, for example,
- **[04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8dfLN5qpsI&t=294s)** — can't get fuel and then you have all sorts of issues. Another counterintuitive situation is
- **[05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8dfLN5qpsI&t=302s)** — becoming more sterile. The more that we clean our bacteria and get rid of bacteria
- **[05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8dfLN5qpsI&t=307s)** — and sterilize ourselves, especially when you're growing up as like babies or small children,
- **[05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8dfLN5qpsI&t=314s)** — the more you set yourself up for getting sick, the more allergies you get. Kids that live on
- **[05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8dfLN5qpsI&t=321s)** — farms have very strong immune systems. Kids that are overly clean get sick a lot more
- **[05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8dfLN5qpsI&t=328s)** — often. I mean you can't create a strong immune system if you never get sick. The action of
- **[05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8dfLN5qpsI&t=335s)** — getting sick exercises your immune system and creates your defenses. And the same thing
- **[05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8dfLN5qpsI&t=340s)** — goes when you take an antibiotic. You're destroying, getting rid of all this bacteria
- **[05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8dfLN5qpsI&t=347s)** — and what do you end up with? An overgrowth of pathogens. You have stronger pathogens that
- **[05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8dfLN5qpsI&t=353s)** — are now resistant against that antibiotic. So it comes with a package. And then you have like
- **[05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8dfLN5qpsI&t=359s)** — when you take antacids, right? And then you end up with more heartburn. How can that be? Well,
- **[06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8dfLN5qpsI&t=364s)** — just understanding the mechanism, what causes heartburn is this acid that is regurgitating
- **[06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8dfLN5qpsI&t=371s)** — up through the valve. It's called an acid reflux, right? It takes an acid to get rid of
- **[06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8dfLN5qpsI&t=379s)** — the acid. When you take apple cider vinegar or butane hydrochloride, you can find your acid
- **[06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8dfLN5qpsI&t=384s)** — reflux goes away. Why? Because the true cause is a lack of acid, not too much acid. When you
- **[06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8dfLN5qpsI&t=392s)** — don't have enough acid in your stomach, the valve doesn't close. Here's another one. This is
- **[06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8dfLN5qpsI&t=395s)** — interesting. When you don't expose yourself to the sun, you put yourself more at risk for
- **[06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8dfLN5qpsI&t=403s)** — certain types of cancer. Now, wait a second. We've all been told that the sun causes cancer,
- **[06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8dfLN5qpsI&t=410s)** — right? Well, maybe not. The sun gives us vitamin D. A vitamin D deficiency really can set you up
- **[06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8dfLN5qpsI&t=418s)** — for cancer because it lowers the immune system. We need the vitamin D desperately for every
- **[07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8dfLN5qpsI&t=422s)** — single part of our immune system. Here's another one that's interesting. The more dieting
- **[07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8dfLN5qpsI&t=427s)** — that you do in your lifetime, the more weight you're going to gain. And that's really a
- **[07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8dfLN5qpsI&t=431s)** — When you start to diet, especially doing it incorrectly, you start to develop this
- **[07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8dfLN5qpsI&t=439s)** — extreme efficiency with your metabolism to the point where it becomes very, very efficient. It
- **[07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8dfLN5qpsI&t=445s)** — can run on just a little bit of fuel. This way, it's so hard to get rid of the fat now
- **[07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8dfLN5qpsI&t=449s)** — to make your fat cells more inefficient. The term for that is called mitochondrial uncoupling,
- **[07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8dfLN5qpsI&t=456s)** — where you're wasting a lot of energy. And you can do that with getting in the ketogenic diet.
- **[07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8dfLN5qpsI&t=462s)** — You can do that with doing fasting. You can do that with cold therapy. But an efficient
- **[07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8dfLN5qpsI&t=467s)** — metabolism is created from going on lots of diets. So the theme of this video is you cannot
- **[07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8dfLN5qpsI&t=473s)** — create health without some bit of stress. And exercise would be a good place to start. So if
- **[07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8dfLN5qpsI&t=478s)** — you want to check that video out, I put it up right here.

## Full Transcript with Timestamps

- **[00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6WCY_tqys8&t=0s)** — We all know how important vitamin D is, but it's also incredibly confusing to know amounts that you need.
- **[00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6WCY_tqys8&t=7s)** — And does the amount of vitamin D in your blood really tell you what's going on in the cells?
- **[00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6WCY_tqys8&t=12s)** — Now, when you get your blood test done with vitamin D, some references give you this normal
- **[00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6WCY_tqys8&t=18s)** — range between 20 to 40 nanograms per milliliter. Other references are between 30 and 50 nanograms
- **[00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6WCY_tqys8&t=28s)** — per milliliter. And of course, if you're in a different part of the world, there's different values.
- **[00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6WCY_tqys8&t=33s)** — So, for example, if you have 50 nanograms per milliliter, that would be 125 nanomoles per liter.
- **[00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6WCY_tqys8&t=41s)** — So, as you can see, it's very, very confusing. And especially if you take vitamin D, which is
- **[00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6WCY_tqys8&t=46s)** — in a different measurement altogether, which is in international units. Even that's very
- **[00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6WCY_tqys8&t=59s)** — micrograms. And when you talk about other things like beta carotene or retinol,
- **[01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6WCY_tqys8&t=65s)** — it's in a completely different system. It doesn't equal what I just mentioned. So it's very
- **[01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6WCY_tqys8&t=70s)** — confusing. Even the RDAs for vitamin D for someone that's under 70 years old is 600 IUs.
- **[01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6WCY_tqys8&t=80s)** — Okay. Which is 15 micrograms. And the studies that validate that amount, which is
- **[01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6WCY_tqys8&t=86s)** — extremely low, were done years ago designed to prevent rickets. But that was way before
- **[01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6WCY_tqys8&t=92s)** — all this new information on how vitamin D supports the immune system and so many other
- **[01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6WCY_tqys8&t=98s)** — biological systems. So checking your vitamin D levels in the blood is all fine. And that's
- **[01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6WCY_tqys8&t=103s)** — great. But the most important thing about vitamin D is does it reach the cell? And it
- **[01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6WCY_tqys8&t=116s)** — the blood levels of vitamin D to determine what's going on in your cell.
- **[02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6WCY_tqys8&t=121s)** — Simply because there are so many problems with the vitamin D receptor. Certain viruses and
- **[02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6WCY_tqys8&t=126s)** — other pathogens have a mechanism, a survival mechanism of blocking your vitamin D receptor
- **[02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6WCY_tqys8&t=133s)** — for their survival because they know that that vitamin D goes into that cell. They're
- **[02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6WCY_tqys8&t=146s)** — receptor to make sure you don't get enough because of this huge association between vitamin
- **[02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6WCY_tqys8&t=152s)** — D and the reduction of cancer risk. I mean, if you think about even in a benign tumor,
- **[02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6WCY_tqys8&t=157s)** — you get it like a 93% absorption with that vitamin D receptor. But in a malignant cancer,
- **[02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6WCY_tqys8&t=164s)** — the vitamin D receptor now goes from 93 down to 56 absorption. So you can see that cancer
- **[02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6WCY_tqys8&t=171s)** — tends to block the absorption of vitamin D. And about 30% of the population has a genetic
- **[02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6WCY_tqys8&t=176s)** — problem with the vitamin D receptor, including myself. So normal amounts of vitamin D do not
- **[03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6WCY_tqys8&t=183s)** — make the changes that I need. So what do we do? How do we solve this problem? Well,
- **[03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6WCY_tqys8&t=188s)** — number one might be a good idea to get a genetic test to measure your vitamin D receptor.
- **[03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6WCY_tqys8&t=192s)** — But there's some other simple things you can do. Does vitamin D receptor diseases and
- **[03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6WCY_tqys8&t=198s)** — problems run in your family or do you have a problem with those? And I'm going to list them
- **[03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6WCY_tqys8&t=202s)** — right now, but there are so many diseases and health related conditions that are directly
- **[03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6WCY_tqys8&t=209s)** — related to a problem with the vitamin D receptor. So let me just go down the list right now.
- **[03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6WCY_tqys8&t=214s)** — Autoimmune diseases. And this includes MS, lupus, rheumatoid arthritis, psoriasis,
- **[03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6WCY_tqys8&t=222s)** — Hashimoto's, ankylosing spinalitis. The next category, certain types of cancer,
- **[03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6WCY_tqys8&t=228s)** — especially breast cancer and colon cancer. You just have to realize how important vitamin D is
- **[03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6WCY_tqys8&t=235s)** — for so many things, including every aspect of your immune system that fights off cancer.
- **[04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6WCY_tqys8&t=241s)** — Normally the immune cells are supposed to kill cancer if they have enough vitamin D,
- **[04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6WCY_tqys8&t=246s)** — but not if they don't have enough vitamin D. Certain cardiovascular diseases are related
- **[04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6WCY_tqys8&t=251s)** — to a problem with the vitamin D receptor. Certain cognitive diseases, including Alzheimer's,
- **[04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6WCY_tqys8&t=256s)** — Parkinson's are associated with a problem with the vitamin D receptor. Then we have diabetes,
- **[04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6WCY_tqys8&t=261s)** — type 1 and type 2. And type 1 is an autoimmune disease. So that would definitely fit into
- **[04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6WCY_tqys8&t=266s)** — that vitamin D problem. Next one is metabolic syndrome, which includes high blood pressure,
- **[04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6WCY_tqys8&t=272s)** — lipid problems, high blood glucose or diabetes. Next one is TB. Okay.
- **[04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6WCY_tqys8&t=280s)** — Tuberculosis, which is a huge problem with the vitamin D receptor. In fact, years ago,
- **[04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6WCY_tqys8&t=286s)** — some of the earlier treatments for TB was just getting out in the sun. And that would greatly
- **[04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6WCY_tqys8&t=290s)** — help TB because of the production of vitamin D. And if you ever have the choice between
- **[04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6WCY_tqys8&t=295s)** — getting your vitamin D from a pill form versus the sun, you'd be better to get it from the
- **[05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6WCY_tqys8&t=301s)** — sun. Okay. That would be the ideal situation if you can get vitamin D from the sun. So we
- **[05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6WCY_tqys8&t=306s)** — have TB. We also have certain viruses, parasites, some bacteria. Lyme disease,
- **[05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6WCY_tqys8&t=312s)** — definitely associated with a vitamin D receptor issue. Hair loss, Crohn's, other types of GI
- **[05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6WCY_tqys8&t=319s)** — inflammation issues. Because what you have to remember is that vitamin D is probably one of
- **[05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6WCY_tqys8&t=325s)** — the best natural anti-inflammatories. And then we get respiratory infections, huge association
- **[05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6WCY_tqys8&t=333s)** — with a vitamin D receptor, probably because there's certain viruses involved that tend to
- **[05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6WCY_tqys8&t=337s)** — hijack the vitamin D receptor. And then we get asthma. If a child has asthma and you get them
- **[05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6WCY_tqys8&t=343s)** — to be outside in the fresh air and the sun, boy, their rate of getting asthma just goes way
- **[05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6WCY_tqys8&t=349s)** — down. Food allergies. Okay. The more food allergies you have, the more problems you have
- **[05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6WCY_tqys8&t=354s)** — with the vitamin D receptor. And then we get a really common thing, a low back pain,
- **[05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6WCY_tqys8&t=358s)** — definitely associated with the vitamin D. Vitiligo, a situation where you have a lack of pigment
- **[06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6WCY_tqys8&t=364s)** — in certain places in your body. Then you have osteoporosis, COPD, which is chronic
- **[06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6WCY_tqys8&t=369s)** — obstructive pulmonary disease. And then even PTSD is associated with low vitamin D,
- **[06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6WCY_tqys8&t=376s)** — probably because vitamin D greatly helps depression. All right. So beyond checking your
- **[06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6WCY_tqys8&t=382s)** — blood, which is good to do, but if you still have problems, you're probably going to
- **[06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6WCY_tqys8&t=388s)** — take more vitamin D. So number one, take more vitamin D. It's that simple. And you might
- **[06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6WCY_tqys8&t=394s)** — need 20, 30, 40, 50,000 IUs. If you start seeing changes, then we know, regardless of
- **[06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6WCY_tqys8&t=402s)** — how much vitamin D you have in your blood, that you were deficient in the cell because you
- **[06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6WCY_tqys8&t=407s)** — had a vitamin D receptor issue. All right. Number two, take it inconsistently. Like
- **[06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6WCY_tqys8&t=412s)** — instead of taking it on a regular basis, okay. You might want to take it once every three
- **[06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6WCY_tqys8&t=417s)** — days or once every four days and take a good amount. Apparently that's a good strategy for
- **[07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6WCY_tqys8&t=422s)** — certain people that have a problem with the vitamin D receptor. Even though I personally have
- **[07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6WCY_tqys8&t=426s)** — a problem with vitamin D, I do take it consistently each day just because it's easy
- **[07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6WCY_tqys8&t=431s)** — to remember. But if I had an autoimmune disease or some of these other problems,
- **[07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6WCY_tqys8&t=434s)** — I might take it sporadically. You can take magnesium. That will help the vitamin D
- **[07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6WCY_tqys8&t=440s)** — receptor. You can take zinc. You can take bile salts. Now, bile salts are interesting
- **[07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6WCY_tqys8&t=446s)** — because they act as a vitamin D receptor analog. What does that mean? It means that you can
- **[07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6WCY_tqys8&t=452s)** — trigger the gene for vitamin D without necessarily taking vitamin D. It's pretty wild. You can
- **[07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6WCY_tqys8&t=460s)** — take it in the form of tutka as well or just bile salts. Omega-3 has been known to increase
- **[07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6WCY_tqys8&t=467s)** — the vitamin D receptor. Vitamin K2 also helps. And then you have various plant chemicals
- **[07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6WCY_tqys8&t=475s)** — that are also really good to increase the reception of the vitamin D receptor, like
- **[08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6WCY_tqys8&t=481s)** — resveratrol, curcumin, curcetin, and sulforaphane. All of those can greatly help. And the last
- **[08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6WCY_tqys8&t=489s)** — thing that can help vitamin D is butyrate. Now, what's butyrate? That is a short-chain
- **[08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6WCY_tqys8&t=494s)** — fatty acid that's produced by your own microbes. And you can increase the production of that if
- **[08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6WCY_tqys8&t=501s)** — you consume vegetables. Because the vegetables provide fiber for the microbes, they eat that,
- **[08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6WCY_tqys8&t=506s)** — they convert it to butyrate, and then that can help your absorption of vitamin D. It can also
- **[08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6WCY_tqys8&t=511s)** — help you with insulin resistance. And butyrate is a form of a ketone. So, of course, I would
- **[08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6WCY_tqys8&t=517s)** — recommend also being on the ketogenic diet, which will help insulin resistance. Now, the
- **[08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6WCY_tqys8&t=523s)** — question that I always get about vitamin D is this toxicity question. I have a very good
- **[08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6WCY_tqys8&t=529s)** — explanation of the true toxicity from vitamin D. If you haven't seen this video, check it out.
- **[08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6WCY_tqys8&t=536s)** — I put it up right here.

- **[00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roCcBO2l1Bs&t=0s)** — I'm going to show you how to get rid of hypoglycemia with just one tiny, simple change.
- **[00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roCcBO2l1Bs&t=8s)** — Now, what is hypoglycemia? Well, technically, it's a blood sugar that's below 70 milligrams per
- **[00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roCcBO2l1Bs&t=14s)** — deciliter. And it's actually rare to have blood sugar being low when you have hypoglycemic
- **[00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roCcBO2l1Bs&t=22s)** — symptoms. The great majority of time, you have all the symptoms, yet your blood sugars are
- **[00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roCcBO2l1Bs&t=27s)** — normal. And when I talk about symptoms, I'm talking about shakiness, irritable, anxiety,
- **[00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roCcBO2l1Bs&t=32s)** — hungry, sweating, headache, can't concentrate, blurry eyes. And so you hear this a lot where,
- **[00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roCcBO2l1Bs&t=38s)** — oh, my blood sugars are crashing. I need to go eat something, right? But most of the time,
- **[00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roCcBO2l1Bs&t=43s)** — if you were to check your blood sugars, it's just normal. So what is going on? Well,
- **[00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roCcBO2l1Bs&t=47s)** — I want to explain this by using earplugs. Okay, if I were to put these earplugs
- **[00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roCcBO2l1Bs&t=53s)** — in my ears right now, and you were to talk to me, I wouldn't be able to hear you. In fact,
- **[00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roCcBO2l1Bs&t=58s)** — you would have to shout at me for me to hear you to penetrate this resistance. So with
- **[01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roCcBO2l1Bs&t=67s)** — hypoglycemia, you have something going on. You have this resistance. It's called insulin
- **[01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roCcBO2l1Bs&t=75s)** — resistance. Okay, now, insulin is the hormone that helps to lower blood glucose. And just
- **[01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roCcBO2l1Bs&t=82s)** — so you know, regarding blood sugars, your body has this superior, I don't know if it's like a
- **[01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roCcBO2l1Bs&t=89s)** — law in the body or superior principle that no matter what, it's very, very, very important
- **[01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roCcBO2l1Bs&t=95s)** — to keep your blood sugars normal. And it's even more important to keep the blood sugars
- **[01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roCcBO2l1Bs&t=99s)** — higher than lower for survival. Your body will do all sorts of things to prevent this
- **[01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roCcBO2l1Bs&t=106s)** — lowering of your blood sugar. Your brain needs glucose or certain parts of it. And without
- **[01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roCcBO2l1Bs&t=110s)** — glucose, you will not be able to survive. And so insulin is the main hormone that comes in there
- **[01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roCcBO2l1Bs&t=115s)** — and lowers your blood glucose if it's too high after you eat. And insulin is triggered by two
- **[02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roCcBO2l1Bs&t=121s)** — things. It's the carbohydrates that you eat and how refined they are or how much concentrated
- **[02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roCcBO2l1Bs&t=127s)** — sugar. And also it's the frequency of eating. So if you eat a lot of meals, a lot of snacks,
- **[02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roCcBO2l1Bs&t=131s)** — you're going to keep spiking insulin over and over and over. And the problem is that when you
- **[02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roCcBO2l1Bs&t=137s)** — spiking insulin chronically over a period of time, you develop what's called insulin resistance.
- **[02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roCcBO2l1Bs&t=143s)** — It doesn't lower the blood sugars as well as it should because you have these earplugs in here.
- **[02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roCcBO2l1Bs&t=149s)** — So if I had these earplugs in there and you were talking to me, you would literally have to
- **[02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roCcBO2l1Bs&t=154s)** — shout at me with high volume of communication to penetrate so I can hear just a little bit.
- **[02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roCcBO2l1Bs&t=160s)** — Well, that's what happens with hypoglycemia. You have a situation where you may normally
- **[02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roCcBO2l1Bs&t=165s)** — have normal blood sugar, but you have high insulin in the background to try to penetrate
- **[02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roCcBO2l1Bs&t=171s)** — this resistance. So you can at least get some control of that insulin to help lower the blood
- **[02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roCcBO2l1Bs&t=177s)** — glucose. So the body keeps compensating over time to stabilize this blood sugars. Because if
- **[03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roCcBO2l1Bs&t=182s)** — you eat a carb, the blood sugars go up, the insulin kicks in there and pushes it down.
- **[03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roCcBO2l1Bs&t=188s)** — Well, we can't have low blood sugar. So the body will start to develop resistance
- **[03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roCcBO2l1Bs&t=192s)** — against the thing that is pushing the glucose down. Now, what's abnormal about this whole thing
- **[03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roCcBO2l1Bs&t=200s)** — is that a body is not designed to consume the amount of carbohydrates that we consume.
- **[03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roCcBO2l1Bs&t=205s)** — So that's really the underlying root cause. And the glucose in the blood might be normal,
- **[03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roCcBO2l1Bs&t=210s)** — but because insulin controls glucose absorption, you probably have very low amounts of glucose in
- **[03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roCcBO2l1Bs&t=217s)** — the actual cell. In other words, glucose absorption in your cells is dependent on insulin. So the
- **[03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roCcBO2l1Bs&t=226s)** — more insulin resistance you have, the less glucose you're going to have in the cell.
- **[03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roCcBO2l1Bs&t=230s)** — And if you have low insulin in the cell, which I don't even know if they have a way to
- **[03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roCcBO2l1Bs&t=235s)** — test that, but the point is you're going to have hypoglycemia symptoms with normal blood
- **[03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roCcBO2l1Bs&t=239s)** — glucose. And in the background, high insulin. The medical term for this is called hyper
- **[04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roCcBO2l1Bs&t=246s)** — insulinemic. That means high insulin in the blood, hypoglycemia. Hyp meaning low,
- **[04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roCcBO2l1Bs&t=252s)** — glycemia meaning sugar. It's probably one of the most common types of hypoglycemia,
- **[04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roCcBO2l1Bs&t=256s)** — especially for kids and infants. Now, the worst thing you can do for hypoglycemia
- **[04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roCcBO2l1Bs&t=264s)** — is to continue to have these small meals. Even small protein meals to try to
- **[04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roCcBO2l1Bs&t=272s)** — fix it or even worse, some sugar to raise your blood glucose higher. That's the worst
- **[04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roCcBO2l1Bs&t=279s)** — thing you can do because that's going to trigger more insulin. It's going to make things
- **[04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roCcBO2l1Bs&t=283s)** — worse and worse. You'll feel better temporarily, but it's going to be worse and worse over time.
- **[04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roCcBO2l1Bs&t=288s)** — So it's a complete myth or even a lie that you should have small frequent meals to prevent
- **[04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roCcBO2l1Bs&t=296s)** — low blood sugar. And it's also a lie that these frequent small meals somehow stoke the metabolic
- **[05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roCcBO2l1Bs&t=303s)** — fire or stimulate your metabolism. Absolutely not true. And it's also a myth that breakfast is the
- **[05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roCcBO2l1Bs&t=310s)** — most important meal, even though I used to recommend it. I don't recommend it anymore
- **[05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roCcBO2l1Bs&t=315s)** — because actually when you eat, it stimulates more hunger about an hour and a half later. Why?
- **[05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roCcBO2l1Bs&t=322s)** — Because of this whole insulin thing that's going on in the background. How do we fix this? You have
- **[05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roCcBO2l1Bs&t=328s)** — a couple different types of fuel that you can run your body off of. The majority of the
- **[05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roCcBO2l1Bs&t=331s)** — population is running their body off of glucose. And so when you're doing that, oh my gosh,
- **[05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roCcBO2l1Bs&t=337s)** — you are dependent on trying to get glucose all the time. Because we don't store a lot of
- **[05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roCcBO2l1Bs&t=342s)** — glucose, we only have a very small storage of glucose. It's called glycogen. It's in your
- **[05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roCcBO2l1Bs&t=346s)** — liver. And when that runs out, oh my gosh, we need quick energy, right? We need glucose.
- **[05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roCcBO2l1Bs&t=353s)** — But what about fat? Why not just run your body on fat fuel? You have a lot more storage
- **[05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roCcBO2l1Bs&t=359s)** — of fat than you do glucose. An average person who is not skinny has literally a hundred
- **[06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roCcBO2l1Bs&t=364s)** — thousand calories of stored fat on their body. That's enough to last at least three months or
- **[06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roCcBO2l1Bs&t=371s)** — The world record of the person who fasted the longest was over a year without food,
- **[06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roCcBO2l1Bs&t=377s)** — and they survived and they lost a lot of weight. The point is you have almost an unlimited
- **[06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roCcBO2l1Bs&t=382s)** — ability to run your body off fat fuel. And our bodies were designed to do that. And I'm now
- **[06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roCcBO2l1Bs&t=388s)** — going to convince you that that is the best fuel to run your body off of. And when I say
- **[06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roCcBO2l1Bs&t=394s)** — I'm talking about fatty acids and ketones. Ketones are one of the byproducts out of fat. So you can
- **[06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roCcBO2l1Bs&t=402s)** — run the body on a combination of fatty acids and ketones, but they both come from fat.
- **[06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roCcBO2l1Bs&t=407s)** — What's really cool about running your body off of fat is it only takes a few days to
- **[06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roCcBO2l1Bs&t=414s)** — switch over to this new fuel system that your body's going to be like, wow, this is
- **[07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roCcBO2l1Bs&t=420s)** — better than the glucose because my appetite went away and I feel so much better. The big thing
- **[07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roCcBO2l1Bs&t=426s)** — that's so beneficial about ketones and fatty acids is that you don't need insulin as a hormone
- **[07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roCcBO2l1Bs&t=434s)** — to be involved. So this glucose fuel is dependent on insulin. So anything that is
- **[07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roCcBO2l1Bs&t=442s)** — connected with insulin resistance, like all the problems like metabolic syndrome, high blood
- **[07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roCcBO2l1Bs&t=448s)** — pressure, high cholesterol, belly fat, liver fat, inflammation, dementia, all these body problems.
- **[07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roCcBO2l1Bs&t=457s)** — And there's quite a few. And you pretty much bypass any of these problems that are associated
- **[07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roCcBO2l1Bs&t=462s)** — with insulin resistance. They tend to go bye-bye when you start changing over the fuel
- **[07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roCcBO2l1Bs&t=467s)** — system. Now deep inside your cells, you have the mitochondria. That's the energy factory of
- **[07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roCcBO2l1Bs&t=473s)** — And deep inside the mitochondria, you have something called the Krebs cycle.
- **[07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roCcBO2l1Bs&t=477s)** — And it's really complex, but it's basically converting glucose into energy. But when you
- **[08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roCcBO2l1Bs&t=483s)** — run your body on ketones and fatty acids, you don't need to involve all those different
- **[08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roCcBO2l1Bs&t=488s)** — steps that are involved with glucose. You only need to use one or maybe two of these
- **[08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roCcBO2l1Bs&t=493s)** — many different alchemical steps that glucose needs. This saves you a lot of energy. So
- **[08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roCcBO2l1Bs&t=500s)** — it's like running your body off of a much better machine, and it produces a lot more energy.
- **[08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roCcBO2l1Bs&t=506s)** — When you run your body on ketones and fatty acids, you actually take a huge stress off
- **[08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roCcBO2l1Bs&t=512s)** — the mitochondria. And if you don't already know this, the majority of non-infectious
- **[08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roCcBO2l1Bs&t=518s)** — diseases that we experience involve the mitochondria, including cancer at the top of
- **[08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roCcBO2l1Bs&t=526s)** — When you run your body off too much glucose, it destroys the mitochondria with all sorts of
- **[08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roCcBO2l1Bs&t=532s)** — reactive oxygen molecules. I'm not going to get into the weeds with that, but the point is that
- **[08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roCcBO2l1Bs&t=537s)** — there's a lot of side effects when you run your body off too much glucose. You get
- **[09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roCcBO2l1Bs&t=542s)** — enhanced mitochondria function. You have more oxygen involved with the mitochondria. You
- **[09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roCcBO2l1Bs&t=547s)** — need less fuel to run the body. You even need less thyroid hormones to keep your metabolism
- **[09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roCcBO2l1Bs&t=553s)** — up, because the thyroid gland runs more efficiently. And your liver doesn't have to work so hard.
- **[09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roCcBO2l1Bs&t=559s)** — You have to realize that the liver has to do a lot of different things. It's like 500 different
- **[09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roCcBO2l1Bs&t=564s)** — functions. And when you run your body off of fat, and you decrease the need for glucose
- **[09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roCcBO2l1Bs&t=570s)** — in the brain, because the brain can also run on ketones, or most of it can. Only a small
- **[09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roCcBO2l1Bs&t=576s)** — portion needs actual glucose, that your liver can now just focus on that really important
- **[09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roCcBO2l1Bs&t=583s)** — action of producing new glucose for the brain and certain other tissues like red blood cells.
- **[09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roCcBO2l1Bs&t=589s)** — And that's called gluconeogenesis. You basically give your brain a chance to chill out. You
- **[09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roCcBO2l1Bs&t=594s)** — give your heart a chance to work better, because the heart is a muscle, just like your
- **[09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roCcBO2l1Bs&t=599s)** — skeletal muscles. So you actually take a big stress off your muscles. You also take a big
- **[10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roCcBO2l1Bs&t=603s)** — stress off your liver. There's only one thing, just one simple thing you need to do.
- **[10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roCcBO2l1Bs&t=606s)** — And that is this. Lower your carbohydrates below 50 grams per day. That's it. And when you do
- **[10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roCcBO2l1Bs&t=616s)** — that, the body will start to transition over within a few days to this new fuel system.
- **[10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roCcBO2l1Bs&t=624s)** — And in this transition, you're going to have more ketones in your blood, in your urine,
- **[10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roCcBO2l1Bs&t=630s)** — in your breath. And there's ways to test that. And those are extra ketones that are
- **[10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roCcBO2l1Bs&t=634s)** — being burned yet because you're right in the transition phase and your body is adapting
- **[10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roCcBO2l1Bs&t=639s)** — to this new machine to the point where you're going to be burning off these ketones more
- **[10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roCcBO2l1Bs&t=643s)** — efficiently very soon. But in the meantime, you can at least test for these ketones to see
- **[10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roCcBO2l1Bs&t=647s)** — that if you're in ketosis or if you're in this transition stage and when you kind of
- **[10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roCcBO2l1Bs&t=654s)** — graduate from this transition phase. This is why I recommend a urine ketone stick. So you
- **[10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roCcBO2l1Bs&t=659s)** — can measure your urine and you're going to initially see a lot of ketones come from the
- **[11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roCcBO2l1Bs&t=663s)** — urine and then you're going to see less and less and less. And that means that your body is
- **[11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roCcBO2l1Bs&t=668s)** — actually finally adapting to ketones and it's burning more of the ketones. A better test
- **[11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roCcBO2l1Bs&t=674s)** — at that time to switch over to is the blood ketone test. And you can get these kits. So
- **[11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roCcBO2l1Bs&t=680s)** — all you need right now is a simple explanation on how to do this switch. And for that,
- **[11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roCcBO2l1Bs&t=687s)** — I put the video up right here.

- **[00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YTd9JJw6sc8&t=11s)** — get hysterectomies. Fibroids are very, very common. I saw one reference that 20 to 50% of
- **[00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YTd9JJw6sc8&t=17s)** — all women before the age of 50 have some type of growth or fibroid or endometriosis. So first,
- **[00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YTd9JJw6sc8&t=25s)** — start with the uterus. What is the uterus? Well, it's part muscle and part gland. You can look at
- **[00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YTd9JJw6sc8&t=32s)** — the uterus like the soil where the seed or an egg implants and starts growing. And so it's really
- **[00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YTd9JJw6sc8&t=40s)** — nutrient dense. It's rich. It feeds the egg once it's fertilized. And the uterus has incredible
- **[00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YTd9JJw6sc8&t=48s)** — regenerative properties. I mean, researchers are now looking at how can they use that
- **[00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YTd9JJw6sc8&t=53s)** — in different places in the body to help regenerate the tissues. The other thing that's
- **[00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YTd9JJw6sc8&t=57s)** — fascinating about the uterus is that it has the ability to expand by 500x. And of course,
- **[01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YTd9JJw6sc8&t=64s)** — I shared that information with my wife, Karen, and her reply was, you think I don't know that
- **[01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YTd9JJw6sc8&t=70s)** — after three kids? So of course, I quickly dropped that conversation. Here's the information
- **[01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YTd9JJw6sc8&t=74s)** — I stumbled on relating to fibroids. There's been some studies that show that vitamin D
- **[01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YTd9JJw6sc8&t=80s)** — can help reduce the size of the fibroid. Now, why would vitamin D actually help you shrink a
- **[01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YTd9JJw6sc8&t=87s)** — fibroid? Vitamin D regulates the genes that control growth. And in one of the papers I found,
- **[01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YTd9JJw6sc8&t=95s)** — the vitamin D receptor in a fibroid are very different versus normal uterus tissue. That
- **[01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YTd9JJw6sc8&t=104s)** — means that the fibrous tissue is not going to receive as much vitamin D, which means it's
- **[01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YTd9JJw6sc8&t=109s)** — less controlled over the growth. I mean, if you think about it, vitamin D really isn't a vitamin,
- **[01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YTd9JJw6sc8&t=115s)** — it's a hormone. When someone's vitamin D deficient, they're a lot more at risk
- **[02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YTd9JJw6sc8&t=121s)** — of developing fibroids, and the uterus is very hormone sensitive. And so there's an
- **[02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YTd9JJw6sc8&t=126s)** — enzyme called aromatase that converts androgens to estrogen. And so there's all sorts of
- **[02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YTd9JJw6sc8&t=135s)** — and even medications that can act as an aromatase inhibitor. And guess what? Vitamin D is a natural
- **[02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YTd9JJw6sc8&t=141s)** — aromatase inhibitor. Also, vitamin D can create an effect on the fibroid itself. If you have
- **[02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YTd9JJw6sc8&t=148s)** — enough vitamin D, student tumors and even cancers will start committing suicide. Now,
- **[02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YTd9JJw6sc8&t=153s)** — that is a normal process when a cell is damaged. But the thing about cancer and tumors,
- **[02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YTd9JJw6sc8&t=159s)** — the problem with that is that somehow that controlled cell death, where the cell becomes
- **[02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YTd9JJw6sc8&t=165s)** — damaged and starts committing suicide, and now the cancer cell, the tumor cell just keeps
- **[02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YTd9JJw6sc8&t=170s)** — growing, growing, growing. But vitamin D can help increase that apoptosis in the fibroid.
- **[02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YTd9JJw6sc8&t=176s)** — Now, I'm going to explain how much vitamin D to take to create this effect. But I just
- **[03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YTd9JJw6sc8&t=181s)** — wanted to mention a Dr. Bruce Hollis, who basically did a lot of the original research
- **[03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YTd9JJw6sc8&t=188s)** — and he's a professor and he has over 500 papers, okay, mostly related to vitamin D.
- **[03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YTd9JJw6sc8&t=195s)** — And in some of his videos, it's very interesting because this is what he said. He said that
- **[03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YTd9JJw6sc8&t=200s)** — a lot of the positive result type studies in vitamin D are rejected by the top journals.
- **[03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YTd9JJw6sc8&t=208s)** — And he left me with an impression that it's almost as if they don't want people to know
- **[03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YTd9JJw6sc8&t=214s)** — about this positive vitamin D effect. Now, relating to that, I want to bring up another
- **[03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YTd9JJw6sc8&t=221s)** — study. It's a quite large study, which is called the Vital Study. So this was a study
- **[03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YTd9JJw6sc8&t=227s)** — involving 25,000 adults. It's a quite large study. And apparently was no benefit to vitamin
- **[03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YTd9JJw6sc8&t=235s)** — D or omega-3 in reducing major cardiovascular events or cancer. If we actually read this
- **[04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YTd9JJw6sc8&t=244s)** — study, there's a couple things about this study that's a little fishy. The analysis of the
- **[04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YTd9JJw6sc8&t=252s)** — study excluded the first two years of follow-up, which showed significant reduction of cancer.
- **[04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YTd9JJw6sc8&t=262s)** — Number two, if you separate out the people that actually weren't overweight versus the
- **[04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YTd9JJw6sc8&t=267s)** — overweight and obese people, there was a much lower risk of getting cancer for the people
- **[04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YTd9JJw6sc8&t=274s)** — that had normal weight. Now, the reason I'm bringing that up is because people that are obese
- **[04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YTd9JJw6sc8&t=278s)** — or overweight need more vitamin D because vitamin D gets stored in the fat cells. And
- **[04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YTd9JJw6sc8&t=284s)** — if someone is obese, that vitamin D is going to be diluted. They also admitted some
- **[04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YTd9JJw6sc8&t=289s)** — limitations. One is there was only one dose of vitamin D per day. You think 10,000? No.
- **[04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YTd9JJw6sc8&t=296s)** — 2,000 I use. They're calling 2,000 I use high dose vitamin D. Also, there's data to indicate
- **[05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YTd9JJw6sc8&t=304s)** — that they really did not follow the criteria for a true randomized placebo controlled trial.
- **[05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YTd9JJw6sc8&t=311s)** — They also omitted the information on exposure to sun, how much people were outside versus
- **[05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YTd9JJw6sc8&t=317s)** — inside. They didn't follow up and assess vitamin D in 94% of the participants. So what
- **[05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YTd9JJw6sc8&t=325s)** — I do if I had a fibroid, I would take about 50,000 I use of vitamin D. Now, I know what you're
- **[05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YTd9JJw6sc8&t=333s)** — thinking, boy, that's a lot. That's a toxic amount. What am I going to do about the side
- **[05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YTd9JJw6sc8&t=338s)** — effects of that, etc. But if you take vitamin K2, you take magnesium, zinc, boron,
- **[05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YTd9JJw6sc8&t=347s)** — vitamin B6. These are all the cofactors that protect you against hypercalcemia,
- **[05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YTd9JJw6sc8&t=354s)** — too much calcium in the blood. And if you're taking 50,000 I use of vitamin D3 every day,
- **[05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YTd9JJw6sc8&t=359s)** — the amount of K2 that you would need, I would take about 500 micrograms with that. I would also
- **[06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YTd9JJw6sc8&t=365s)** — take 800 milligrams of magnesium. Very important. Magnesium will help reduce the calcium
- **[06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YTd9JJw6sc8&t=371s)** — formation. I would also take 50 milligrams of zinc. And then I would also take vitamin B6
- **[06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YTd9JJw6sc8&t=378s)** — and boron. And as far as the amounts, whatever is recommended on the bottle. I would
- **[06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YTd9JJw6sc8&t=383s)** — also get on the ketogenic diet. Why? To reduce my insulin because insulin can actually increase
- **[06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YTd9JJw6sc8&t=390s)** — the growth of fibroids. And lastly, I would be consuming a good amount of cruciferous
- **[06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YTd9JJw6sc8&t=396s)** — vegetables to help any other things that can mimic estrogen. Also, I would limit to the
- **[06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YTd9JJw6sc8&t=403s)** — amount of milk you consume. Milk is used to grow a calf. So there's a lot of growth
- **[06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YTd9JJw6sc8&t=407s)** — but also the calcium in milk can be another situation that you want to reduce if you're
- **[06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YTd9JJw6sc8&t=414s)** — taking a lot of vitamin D. And the next video you really need to know about
- **[06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YTd9JJw6sc8&t=418s)** — is this vitamin D toxicity topic. I don't even believe vitamin D toxicity comes from
- **[07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YTd9JJw6sc8&t=424s)** — the vitamin D. I think it's the lack of cofactors. And for that information,

- **[00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2fR5nVsGlk0&t=0s)** — You know, a protein is not really a protein. Now, what am I talking about? A protein is not a protein.
- **[00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2fR5nVsGlk0&t=6s)** — There's a few confusions related to this topic that I want to clear up because I keep running into
- **[00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2fR5nVsGlk0&t=12s)** — them over and over and over. The first one relates to protein requirements, okay? So, typically,
- **[00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2fR5nVsGlk0&t=19s)** — the minimum requirement of protein that you need per day on average is like 50 grams. Now,
- **[00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2fR5nVsGlk0&t=25s)** — the formula for that, which can cause this number to vary, is like 0.821 grams of protein per
- **[00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2fR5nVsGlk0&t=33s)** — your kilogram weight, your body weight. Here's where the confusion lies. Let's take a beef steak,
- **[00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2fR5nVsGlk0&t=42s)** — okay? You get 100 grams of this beef steak, which is about 3.5 ounces. And so, here you are
- **[00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2fR5nVsGlk0&t=50s)** — going to eat the steak, 100 grams, and you're thinking, wow, I'm getting double the amount that
- **[00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2fR5nVsGlk0&t=56s)** — I really need, right? Now, because there's two things. We have the weight of the steak, okay?
- **[01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2fR5nVsGlk0&t=62s)** — And then you have the amount of protein in the steak. Two different things because the
- **[01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2fR5nVsGlk0&t=67s)** — actual protein in that beef is only 26 grams, not 100 grams. And now you're saying,
- **[01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2fR5nVsGlk0&t=72s)** — well, wait a second, I thought it's kind of just pure protein, isn't it? Like, no.
- **[01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2fR5nVsGlk0&t=77s)** — There's some fat in there and the rest of it is not carbs. The rest of it is mainly
- **[01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2fR5nVsGlk0&t=83s)** — water, okay? Water weight. That's what it is. It has a lot of water weight in it. This is why
- **[01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2fR5nVsGlk0&t=88s)** — when you freeze dry a steak, it's like paper. It's really light. But the point is, when
- **[01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2fR5nVsGlk0&t=92s)** — you're dealing with these protein requirements, we're not talking about the actual weight of the
- **[01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2fR5nVsGlk0&t=98s)** — food. We're talking about the protein in that food. So, that's clarification number one. The
- **[01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2fR5nVsGlk0&t=104s)** — next confusion and very important thing to know is that one protein varies with other proteins
- **[01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2fR5nVsGlk0&t=113s)** — in the amount of amino acids that they have as far as the quality and the ratios. So,
- **[02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2fR5nVsGlk0&t=120s)** — in other words, we really don't have a requirement for protein at all. We have a
- **[02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2fR5nVsGlk0&t=126s)** — requirement for the amino acids in those proteins. And that's important because when
- **[02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2fR5nVsGlk0&t=131s)** — you're looking at labels, it doesn't tell you the amino acids. It just says the total protein.
- **[02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2fR5nVsGlk0&t=136s)** — When we're talking about the ketogenic diet, it says you need 20% protein, okay? But again,
- **[02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2fR5nVsGlk0&t=143s)** — no one's talking about the amino acids. And the problem lies in the quality of protein
- **[02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2fR5nVsGlk0&t=149s)** — or the bioavailable amino acids in protein food that you eat. It is a huge difference
- **[02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2fR5nVsGlk0&t=155s)** — between animal protein and plant protein. The absolute best bioavailable protein is breast milk,
- **[02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2fR5nVsGlk0&t=165s)** — but that's usually not available. So, the second one is eggs and then meat and chicken
- **[02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2fR5nVsGlk0&t=170s)** — and then dairy. And then way down the list, you get all these plant proteins. So,
- **[02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2fR5nVsGlk0&t=178s)** — some of the problem with plant proteins is they have all eight essential amino acids,
- **[03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2fR5nVsGlk0&t=182s)** — but certain ones are very, very, very tiny. Okay, like leucine, for example. Leucine is
- **[03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2fR5nVsGlk0&t=188s)** — essential to grow muscles. And if you're living on plant-based proteins, you're not going to
- **[03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2fR5nVsGlk0&t=193s)** — get a lot of leucine and your muscles are going to suffer. Let's take wheat protein,
- **[03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2fR5nVsGlk0&t=198s)** — which by the way is like 80% of all the plant-based protein comes from wheat. Very
- **[03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2fR5nVsGlk0&t=204s)** — low in leucine, lysine, and methionine. But it's protein, right? Now, how can you
- **[03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2fR5nVsGlk0&t=209s)** — compensate with that? Well, just eat more of it, right? Well, the problem is if you eat more of
- **[03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2fR5nVsGlk0&t=214s)** — it, you're going to get more carbs, okay? Especially if you're doing like whole plant
- **[03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2fR5nVsGlk0&t=220s)** — foods. I mean, if you're going to ask me, like if you want to be a vegan and you want to
- **[03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2fR5nVsGlk0&t=224s)** — have foods that are high in protein, what foods would they be? I mean, that's really
- **[03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2fR5nVsGlk0&t=228s)** — hard because there is no vegan food that's just a very high concentrated protein. There's some
- **[03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2fR5nVsGlk0&t=235s)** — protein in nuts. There's some protein in soy. There's some protein in grains, but there's also
- **[04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2fR5nVsGlk0&t=242s)** — a good amount of carbs. So as you increase the protein, you increase the carbs and it bumps you
- **[04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2fR5nVsGlk0&t=247s)** — completely out of keto. Now, I had someone on my show bring up this really interesting question
- **[04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2fR5nVsGlk0&t=252s)** — about... she's a vegetarian and she has gut issues and she wants to solve this problem.
- **[04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2fR5nVsGlk0&t=260s)** — Now, I already know if you're doing keto, which she's trying to do, and you have problems with
- **[04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2fR5nVsGlk0&t=267s)** — your gut, you should probably go carnivore. Well, that's a little conflicting if you're
- **[04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2fR5nVsGlk0&t=271s)** — trying to be a vegetarian or a vegan. However, thank goodness she's a vegetarian, not a vegan,
- **[04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2fR5nVsGlk0&t=276s)** — because at least she can do eggs. And that's what I told her to do. It is not easy to do
- **[04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2fR5nVsGlk0&t=281s)** — keto on a vegan or a vegetarian diet simply because now you're going to have to start
- **[04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2fR5nVsGlk0&t=285s)** — foods that are refined, like even refined protein powders. It's so interesting to me to see these
- **[04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2fR5nVsGlk0&t=293s)** — vegan protein powders and they call them clean protein versus what? Dirty animal protein,
- **[05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2fR5nVsGlk0&t=300s)** — because it's dirty. What about the grass-fed grass-finished animal protein? That's pretty
- **[05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2fR5nVsGlk0&t=305s)** — darn clean and it's complete. The plant-based protein doesn't even come close to the quality
- **[05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2fR5nVsGlk0&t=311s)** — protein that your body needs, especially if you're younger and you're growing child.
- **[05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2fR5nVsGlk0&t=317s)** — If you feed a very small child certain foods without enough of the right amino acids,
- **[05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2fR5nVsGlk0&t=324s)** — it can stunt their growth. And so I asked this lady, I said, why did you become a
- **[05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2fR5nVsGlk0&t=329s)** — vegetarian? She goes, well, my whole life I was a vegetarian because I just can't eat me
- **[05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2fR5nVsGlk0&t=334s)** — because it hurts my stomach. I'm like, wow, that's interesting. Our bodies naturally have a
- **[05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2fR5nVsGlk0&t=340s)** — very acidic stomach. So acidic, like between one and three, that's close to battery acid.
- **[05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2fR5nVsGlk0&t=346s)** — We should be able to digest protein very easily unless the pH has gone up and has become
- **[05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2fR5nVsGlk0&t=351s)** — a weaker acid. And now we can't tolerate animal proteins, especially. So one big clue
- **[05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2fR5nVsGlk0&t=359s)** — of having not enough acid or maybe a weaker stomach acid is the intolerance of meat. You
- **[06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2fR5nVsGlk0&t=365s)** — just can't digest meat. You reject red meat, especially. So I told her, I said,
- **[06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2fR5nVsGlk0&t=372s)** — I think we can solve your problem. Are you adverse to consuming animal products
- **[06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2fR5nVsGlk0&t=377s)** — if your body can digest them? And she says, no. I said, good, start taking betaine hydrochloride.
- **[06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2fR5nVsGlk0&t=382s)** — Start taking maybe two with a meal, three, four, five, and keep adding them slowly.
- **[06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2fR5nVsGlk0&t=388s)** — And then see what happens in a few weeks. I bet you it's going to acidify your stomach.
- **[06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2fR5nVsGlk0&t=391s)** — You'll be able to digest the protein and problem solved. So all of our food never comes as one
- **[06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2fR5nVsGlk0&t=397s)** — macro, like just pure carbohydrates or pure fats or pure protein, unless you refine them.
- **[06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2fR5nVsGlk0&t=403s)** — All foods come in combinations. And when you're looking at protein requirements,
- **[06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2fR5nVsGlk0&t=408s)** — it's really the amino acid profile or protein inside that food. And if you're doing like a
- **[06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2fR5nVsGlk0&t=414s)** — plant-based protein and you're deficient in some of these amino acids, the two big
- **[06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2fR5nVsGlk0&t=418s)** — symptoms that you're going to experience are number one, fatigue or lethargy.
- **[07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2fR5nVsGlk0&t=423s)** — And number two, your mood is going to drop. But unfortunately, people are using more
- **[07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2fR5nVsGlk0&t=430s)** — plant-based proteins, a lot of soy protein, and it's messing up their digestion. It's
- **[07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2fR5nVsGlk0&t=436s)** — affecting their mood. It's affecting their ability to generate energy. I mean, if you look
- **[07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2fR5nVsGlk0&t=440s)** — at at least the U.S., you know, as far as plant-based, we're already at 60% plant-based
- **[07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2fR5nVsGlk0&t=449s)** — proteins. Of course, in the form of cereals, which have other carbs. But the point is that
- **[07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2fR5nVsGlk0&t=454s)** — we're doing a lot of grains, legumes, tubers, things like that. I think the percentage of
- **[07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2fR5nVsGlk0&t=461s)** — animal meat is like 35%. So I just want to clear up a few of these really important
- **[07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2fR5nVsGlk0&t=465s)** — points. If you have a small child or a grandchild, right, and you're shifting them
- **[07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2fR5nVsGlk0&t=471s)** — onto food from breastfeeding, unfortunately, a lot of these purees or these toddler foods or
- **[07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2fR5nVsGlk0&t=479s)** — these infant formula type foods are just loaded with soy and these so-called healthy,
- **[08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2fR5nVsGlk0&t=486s)** — clean plant proteins, which is going to create a lot of problems in their digestion.
- **[08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2fR5nVsGlk0&t=490s)** — I did find a company that I'm going to recommend to you if you need it for your toddler. It's
- **[08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2fR5nVsGlk0&t=497s)** — called Serenity Kids. I've never contacted this company. I have no affiliation, but I am just
- **[08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2fR5nVsGlk0&t=503s)** — blown away at the quality of these products that they use in these little pouches. They're
- **[08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2fR5nVsGlk0&t=508s)** — using like meats from wonderful farms where they have like transparency and they have,
- **[08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2fR5nVsGlk0&t=514s)** — they put squash in there and vegetables and bone broth. So it's an awesome product. And I'll
- **[08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2fR5nVsGlk0&t=519s)** — link down below if you have a grandchild or child that might need something better than
- **[08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2fR5nVsGlk0&t=524s)** — what they have out there, like in the baby food where they have just applesauce or cereals and
- **[08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2fR5nVsGlk0&t=530s)** — just terrible. The next time you read a label it says protein. Now you know that there's
- **[08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2fR5nVsGlk0&t=535s)** — more to that protein than meets the eye. Now I have another video that's a bit more detailed
- **[09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2fR5nVsGlk0&t=541s)** — into this protein requirements and giving you examples of other types of proteins.
- **[09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2fR5nVsGlk0&t=547s)** — And I put that up right here. You can check it out.

- **[00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcIT4NwEpAQ&t=0s)** — Now why is it that most people that start a diet cannot stick to it?
- **[00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcIT4NwEpAQ&t=4s)** — And why is it that those who lose the weight regain it back and then some?
- **[00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcIT4NwEpAQ&t=9s)** — Our bodies tend to resist when you start restricting food and calories and going on a low carb diet.
- **[00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcIT4NwEpAQ&t=15s)** — You know, most diets out there do involve lessening of the calories.
- **[00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcIT4NwEpAQ&t=19s)** — I don't know of any diet that increases your calories.
- **[00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcIT4NwEpAQ&t=22s)** — But when I was in practice, I would always ask a person who has difficulty losing weight,
- **[00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcIT4NwEpAQ&t=27s)** — What happened in your history? When did it start?
- **[00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcIT4NwEpAQ&t=29s)** — This is what they told me over and over and over again.
- **[00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcIT4NwEpAQ&t=32s)** — They would start a diet, lose the weight, gain it back, and one for one,
- **[00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcIT4NwEpAQ&t=37s)** — those people who did the most diets have the most difficult time losing weight.
- **[00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcIT4NwEpAQ&t=42s)** — In other words, the more diets that they do, the slower the metabolism.
- **[00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcIT4NwEpAQ&t=48s)** — Or they might have this appearance of a slow metabolism.
- **[00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcIT4NwEpAQ&t=50s)** — And I've never had an overweight person tell me that they can lose weight easily.
- **[00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcIT4NwEpAQ&t=55s)** — They just need to do the right things.
- **[00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcIT4NwEpAQ&t=57s)** — The great majority of the time that they don't attempt to lose weight is because it's very difficult.
- **[01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcIT4NwEpAQ&t=61s)** — They don't see results. That's where the problem is.
- **[01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcIT4NwEpAQ&t=65s)** — So, is it actually true that diets slow your metabolism?
- **[01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcIT4NwEpAQ&t=70s)** — Well, this is a very interesting topic because when you restrict energy from the body and calories,
- **[01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcIT4NwEpAQ&t=76s)** — and you lose fat, the body will compensate, and the metabolism becomes more efficient.
- **[01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcIT4NwEpAQ&t=85s)** — What does this word efficient mean? It can run on smaller amounts of fuel.
- **[01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcIT4NwEpAQ&t=90s)** — Just like a car. You have different cars that have a different efficiency.
- **[01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcIT4NwEpAQ&t=95s)** — Those cars that can take the same amount of fuel and go longer are more efficient.
- **[01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcIT4NwEpAQ&t=100s)** — They're not gas guzzlers. Well, in the body, it's the same thing.
- **[01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcIT4NwEpAQ&t=105s)** — If you have a difficult time losing weight because you've dieted for many, many years,
- **[01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcIT4NwEpAQ&t=108s)** — your body is probably compensated for survival purposes because dieting is similar to famine or a little bit like starvation.
- **[02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcIT4NwEpAQ&t=120s)** — And I'm mainly talking about the lowering of calories.
- **[02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcIT4NwEpAQ&t=123s)** — But what's really going on, if we want to isolate the real problem,
- **[02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcIT4NwEpAQ&t=126s)** — a person that is struggling with weight loss doesn't really have a slow metabolism.
- **[02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcIT4NwEpAQ&t=130s)** — They have an enhanced metabolic efficiency problem.
- **[02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcIT4NwEpAQ&t=135s)** — They don't waste energy very easily. They can run just on a little bit of energy.
- **[02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcIT4NwEpAQ&t=140s)** — So is this really a bad thing? Well, yeah, it's kind of a bad thing from the person's perspective.
- **[02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcIT4NwEpAQ&t=147s)** — But from a survival standpoint, it's really an enhanced survival capacity.
- **[02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcIT4NwEpAQ&t=152s)** — Those people that have a slower metabolism have more survival long term.
- **[02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcIT4NwEpAQ&t=158s)** — And it's interesting to me how so many people are pushing,
- **[02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcIT4NwEpAQ&t=163s)** — well, you have to lose weight. You have to lose weight.
- **[02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcIT4NwEpAQ&t=165s)** — This is just a side note, and I don't want to get into this, but it's really interesting.
- **[02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcIT4NwEpAQ&t=168s)** — Those people that are overweight actually, believe it or not, might not be as unhealthy as you might think.
- **[02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcIT4NwEpAQ&t=175s)** — Now, I'm not talking about the person eating a lot of junk food.
- **[02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcIT4NwEpAQ&t=179s)** — I'm talking about those people that eat healthily and they still overweight.
- **[03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcIT4NwEpAQ&t=182s)** — If we compare those to a skinny person who eats poorly, that skinny person has less of a survival capacity.
- **[03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcIT4NwEpAQ&t=189s)** — So many times people don't change their diet because they say, I don't have a weight problem.
- **[03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcIT4NwEpAQ&t=196s)** — So we always associate weight with being unhealthy.
- **[03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcIT4NwEpAQ&t=200s)** — We don't associate being overweight with a very efficient metabolism.
- **[03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcIT4NwEpAQ&t=205s)** — So that's the topic for today. I want to talk about it.
- **[03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcIT4NwEpAQ&t=207s)** — I want to do a deep dive into this because if you end up solving the wrong problem,
- **[03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcIT4NwEpAQ&t=212s)** — a slow metabolism, with things that maybe might stimulate your metabolism,
- **[03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcIT4NwEpAQ&t=216s)** — you might end up burning your metabolism out. But I think for the majority of the population,
- **[03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcIT4NwEpAQ&t=220s)** — it's not a slow metabolism. It's just a very efficient metabolism.
- **[03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcIT4NwEpAQ&t=224s)** — So I want to focus on calorie restriction. I want to talk about that.
- **[03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcIT4NwEpAQ&t=228s)** — There's a lot of data on calorie restriction, but I'm going to give you a little summary on what it talks about.
- **[03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcIT4NwEpAQ&t=234s)** — People that restrict the calories are more susceptible to being deficient in nutrients,
- **[04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcIT4NwEpAQ&t=240s)** — which can then affect the hormone system. I mean, just let's take one example.
- **[04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcIT4NwEpAQ&t=244s)** — The Biggest Loser. Years ago they had this show, The Biggest Loser,
- **[04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcIT4NwEpAQ&t=248s)** — and these people very, very dramatically lost a ton of weight.
- **[04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcIT4NwEpAQ&t=253s)** — And they had to do some serious calorie restriction and exercise.
- **[04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcIT4NwEpAQ&t=257s)** — Well, we know now the bad effects that that created.
- **[04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcIT4NwEpAQ&t=261s)** — Every single one of these people gained the weight back and more.
- **[04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcIT4NwEpAQ&t=265s)** — But those people who lost the most weight had the slowest metabolism.
- **[04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcIT4NwEpAQ&t=271s)** — So it kind of screws everything up. It's like it just makes it really hard to lose weight from then on out.
- **[04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcIT4NwEpAQ&t=276s)** — Another term for this is called adaptive thermogenesis,
- **[04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcIT4NwEpAQ&t=280s)** — where your body has adjusted or adapted to these lower amounts of calories,
- **[04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcIT4NwEpAQ&t=285s)** — and now it just burns fat less because it's more efficient.
- **[04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcIT4NwEpAQ&t=289s)** — Now there was another interesting experiment called the Minnesota Starvation Experiment.
- **[04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcIT4NwEpAQ&t=295s)** — I'm going to put the link down below for that as well.
- **[04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcIT4NwEpAQ&t=298s)** — But this experiment involved a group of men going on a very low calorie diet.
- **[05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcIT4NwEpAQ&t=306s)** — So they had 32 normal men, went 24 weeks on a semi-starvation diet,
- **[05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcIT4NwEpAQ&t=312s)** — and then 12 weeks on a restricted refeeding diet,
- **[05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcIT4NwEpAQ&t=315s)** — and then 8 weeks they can pretty much eat on anything they want.
- **[05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcIT4NwEpAQ&t=319s)** — And the results were similar to the experiments on mice,
- **[05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcIT4NwEpAQ&t=322s)** — where you're forcing the machine to conserve energy as it's trying to deal with the starvation.
- **[05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcIT4NwEpAQ&t=329s)** — And they found that the metabolism was suppressed by like 15.5%.
- **[05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcIT4NwEpAQ&t=334s)** — But they had rebound hunger, they regained the weight quickly,
- **[05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcIT4NwEpAQ&t=337s)** — and some had a higher level of weight gain than others, beyond the original starting weight.
- **[05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcIT4NwEpAQ&t=342s)** — So now what about intermittent fasting? How does that compare with calorie restriction?
- **[05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcIT4NwEpAQ&t=349s)** — Well, when you lower calories, the person usually is more hungry, they have more cravings.
- **[05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcIT4NwEpAQ&t=356s)** — When you do intermittent fasting correctly, you're less hungry and you don't have the cravings.
- **[06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcIT4NwEpAQ&t=361s)** — And when we're talking about intermittent fasting, I mean, the problem is there's so many different types of intermittent fasting.
- **[06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcIT4NwEpAQ&t=367s)** — But the bottom line is that if you do intermittent fasting without restricting the calories,
- **[06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcIT4NwEpAQ&t=371s)** — you're going on a period where you're eating nothing for a while,
- **[06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcIT4NwEpAQ&t=375s)** — versus just going on a period where you're eating lower amounts of calories.
- **[06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcIT4NwEpAQ&t=379s)** — And there's some very unique benefits to just doing intermittent fasting and not doing calorie restrictive type programs.
- **[06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcIT4NwEpAQ&t=387s)** — So out of the 27 trials that I looked at, 18 were randomized controlled trials.
- **[06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcIT4NwEpAQ&t=393s)** — And pretty much in all the studies, they all lose weight. There were no serious adverse events.
- **[06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcIT4NwEpAQ&t=398s)** — Most of the weight which was lost was actual fat loss.
- **[06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcIT4NwEpAQ&t=402s)** — Most of the people lost weight in the midsection by the studies which included not just obesity,
- **[06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcIT4NwEpAQ&t=408s)** — but also diabetes had improvements in blood sugars.
- **[06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcIT4NwEpAQ&t=411s)** — Now I will say that some of the studies involving calorie restriction did not show negative effects.
- **[06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcIT4NwEpAQ&t=418s)** — Okay, because again, there's variables with that as well.
- **[07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcIT4NwEpAQ&t=421s)** — And I think it has to do with what type of calories you're consuming and if you have enough nutrients with those calories.
- **[07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcIT4NwEpAQ&t=428s)** — Because when we talk about calorie restriction, it doesn't necessarily define the quality of those calories.
- **[07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcIT4NwEpAQ&t=435s)** — Which makes sense from pure logic is that if you're consuming less nutrients,
- **[07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcIT4NwEpAQ&t=441s)** — you're going to create more negative effects with health and body function.
- **[07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcIT4NwEpAQ&t=446s)** — But what if you did calorie restriction with all the nutrients?
- **[07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcIT4NwEpAQ&t=449s)** — I'd like to see that study. It probably shows a lot better results.
- **[07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcIT4NwEpAQ&t=453s)** — But regarding intermittent fasting, okay, periods of time where you're not eating and then you're eating,
- **[07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcIT4NwEpAQ&t=458s)** — I always recommend with that doing the healthy version of the ketogenic diet.
- **[07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcIT4NwEpAQ&t=464s)** — So we don't create imbalances in the body because one of the problems with calorie restrictive diets,
- **[07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcIT4NwEpAQ&t=469s)** — as well as intermittent fasting, is are you getting enough requirements in your fatty acids or your amino acids?
- **[07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcIT4NwEpAQ&t=476s)** — If you are, you're going to have a lot less problems.
- **[07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcIT4NwEpAQ&t=478s)** — But here's the big thing about intermittent fasting that's different than calorie restrictive diets.
- **[08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcIT4NwEpAQ&t=485s)** — And I'm speaking in a generality. When you do intermittent fasting,
- **[08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcIT4NwEpAQ&t=490s)** — you adapt your body to running on ketones, which is basically a situation where you're burning your own fat.
- **[08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcIT4NwEpAQ&t=498s)** — So even though you might be indirectly reducing the amount of calories by eating less meals
- **[08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcIT4NwEpAQ&t=504s)** — because you're going from three meals to two meals or even one meal, it's hard to eat all those calories in one meal.
- **[08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcIT4NwEpAQ&t=511s)** — What you have to realize is a portion of that fuel that you get in those dietary calories is not coming from the diet.
- **[08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcIT4NwEpAQ&t=520s)** — A portion of that fuel is coming from the person's own fat fuel.
- **[08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcIT4NwEpAQ&t=525s)** — Whereas if you do calorie restriction without going on low carb,
- **[08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcIT4NwEpAQ&t=529s)** — that could easily be a situation where you're not able to tap into your own fat.
- **[08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcIT4NwEpAQ&t=533s)** — You're tapping into your own muscle because your carbs are too high and your insulin is too high.
- **[09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcIT4NwEpAQ&t=540s)** — In the presence of insulin, you can't tap into the fat.
- **[09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcIT4NwEpAQ&t=542s)** — So if you were to do a low calorie diet, I would highly recommend you go low carb.
- **[09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcIT4NwEpAQ&t=547s)** — You have to also look at how much of your own fat is being mobilized.
- **[09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcIT4NwEpAQ&t=550s)** — And just so you know, there are nutrients in your own fat that are stored that then are released, like even vitamin D.
- **[09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcIT4NwEpAQ&t=558s)** — Anything fat soluble, like the fat soluble vitamins can be released into the system to provide for more nutrition as well as energy fuel.
- **[09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcIT4NwEpAQ&t=567s)** — But I don't even look at the combination of the healthy version of the ketogenic diet with intermittent fasting as a diet
- **[09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcIT4NwEpAQ&t=574s)** — because you can easily do this as a long term lifestyle change where it doesn't even feel like a diet.
- **[09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcIT4NwEpAQ&t=582s)** — There is a lot of flexibility with the types of food that you're eating.
- **[09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcIT4NwEpAQ&t=585s)** — But the main thing is you're not hungry going into it. You don't crave anything, which makes it very sustainable.
- **[09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcIT4NwEpAQ&t=591s)** — And it even helps your sympathetic nervous system so you have less stress.
- **[09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcIT4NwEpAQ&t=597s)** — Another big thing that it will help you with is there's something called a set point, which is kind of a very comfortable weight that your body tends to settle in that you can't seem to go below.
- **[10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcIT4NwEpAQ&t=606s)** — It likes to gravitate into that range. Let's say, for example, it's, I don't know, one, one seventy or one sixty five or one eighty, whatever, right?
- **[10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcIT4NwEpAQ&t=613s)** — That's where you're at and you just can't seem to get below it. You might lose weight, but you always kind of hit this plateau.
- **[10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcIT4NwEpAQ&t=619s)** — They call it. There's some interesting data that relates to the amount of insulin that you have in your bloodstream and that set point.
- **[10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcIT4NwEpAQ&t=628s)** — So this relates to something called insulin resistance. So if you have insulin resistance, chances are you have greater amounts of fasting insulin.
- **[10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcIT4NwEpAQ&t=636s)** — Insulin is a fat storing hormone. And if you have diabetes, for example, or some people that are overweight that aren't eating healthily,
- **[10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcIT4NwEpAQ&t=642s)** — they usually have a higher fasting insulin, right, which is rarely tested.
- **[10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcIT4NwEpAQ&t=648s)** — That could be the thing that is controlling your set point and not allowing you to go lower.
- **[10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcIT4NwEpAQ&t=653s)** — And I think the set point does relate to this very efficient metabolism adaptation problem.
- **[11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcIT4NwEpAQ&t=660s)** — And when you're in ketosis, by the way, initially, at least your body wastes a lot of fuel.
- **[11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcIT4NwEpAQ&t=666s)** — You're peeing out ketones, you're breathing out ketones. Those are chunks of fat.
- **[11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcIT4NwEpAQ&t=671s)** — Your body is wasting. It's less efficient with the fuel. And also in the little mitochondria, the factories that make energy,
- **[11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcIT4NwEpAQ&t=679s)** — you're producing more energy from those ketones. I also want to mention this other new diet out there.
- **[11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcIT4NwEpAQ&t=685s)** — It's called the metabolic confusion diet. What is that? It's not necessarily a calorie restrictive diet.
- **[11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcIT4NwEpAQ&t=694s)** — As much as you're going on a low calorie diet, you are lowering your calories to a certain degree, maybe 1700.
- **[11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcIT4NwEpAQ&t=700s)** — But usually it's not really, really low. Maybe it might go down to 1200. But you're doing that for a few days.
- **[11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcIT4NwEpAQ&t=707s)** — Okay. And then you're actually increasing the calories higher. So you might be in like four days of 1700 calories.
- **[11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcIT4NwEpAQ&t=715s)** — Right. And then you go on three days of 2700 calories. That's called the metabolic confusion diet.
- **[12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcIT4NwEpAQ&t=722s)** — Now, what's interesting about that diet, and just from the research that I saw, there's doesn't seem to be the same bad effects as a low calorie diet.
- **[12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcIT4NwEpAQ&t=730s)** — It doesn't seem to slow down your metabolism. And people like it because it's more flexible. It's not as restrictive.
- **[12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcIT4NwEpAQ&t=738s)** — So some people kind of do this for the whole week. They go on a lower calorie. But then on the weekends, they kind of do what they want.
- **[12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcIT4NwEpAQ&t=745s)** — Now, for some people, that may work. I mean, it's a step up. And if you're starting out and you look at the ketogenic diet
- **[12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcIT4NwEpAQ&t=750s)** — and this intermittent fasting is being very difficult and you can't do it, why don't you try the metabolic confusion diet?
- **[12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcIT4NwEpAQ&t=756s)** — And it's not intermittent fasting. But the problem is that there's not a lot of long term data to know if it does eventually cause your metabolism to be downgraded.
- **[12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcIT4NwEpAQ&t=769s)** — But at the very least, I think it's not restricting nutrients. You won't end up with a nutrient deficiency.
- **[12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcIT4NwEpAQ&t=774s)** — And it's probably enough calories where it doesn't send signals to your brain to slow down the metabolism.
- **[12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcIT4NwEpAQ&t=779s)** — And maybe you do that for a while until the point where you can graduate into the healthy version of the ketogenic diet with intermittent fasting or even one of those two.
- **[13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcIT4NwEpAQ&t=789s)** — And the big thing I want you to get out of this video is that it's not that you have a slow metabolism. You have an enhanced metabolic efficiency.
- **[13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcIT4NwEpAQ&t=799s)** — And once you get the right problem, then you can come up with the right solution.
- **[13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcIT4NwEpAQ&t=803s)** — So if you really want what I think is the best solution for this, I would recommend learning how to do the basic keto plan from this video right here. Check it out.

- **[00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aE1O5dG2MZE&t=0s)** — What would happen if you stopped eating for 72 hours, 3 days, out of all the things you can do for your health?
- **[00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aE1O5dG2MZE&t=6s)** — Prolonged fasting is at the very top of your list. The feeling you're going to get from it is almost euphoric.
- **[00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aE1O5dG2MZE&t=12s)** — A state of bliss. A lot of people do it to increase their spirituality and their mental state.
- **[00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aE1O5dG2MZE&t=17s)** — Prolonged fasting is the only way to achieve deep cleaning, turning junk in your body to new cells.
- **[00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aE1O5dG2MZE&t=24s)** — The other thing that I really like about prolonged fasting is that you're using fasting for exercising willpower.
- **[00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aE1O5dG2MZE&t=32s)** — Willpower is the ability to remain in control of your body. Think about an average person, their whole life.
- **[00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aE1O5dG2MZE&t=38s)** — They're not in the driver's seat with their food. When you actually say no to your body and you really start fasting,
- **[00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aE1O5dG2MZE&t=44s)** — despite the smell of food, despite all the visual foods, your ability to say no gives you incredible power.
- **[00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aE1O5dG2MZE&t=52s)** — This makes it easy to strengthen this willpower and stick with it a little bit longer than you normally would.
- **[00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aE1O5dG2MZE&t=59s)** — Let's shift gears to cancer for a second. Just think about the biggest risk factor for cancer.
- **[01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aE1O5dG2MZE&t=63s)** — It's age. As you get older, your risk for cancer goes up. Why? Because of the accumulated damage in your cells.
- **[01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aE1O5dG2MZE&t=71s)** — Plus, as you age, you get more inflammation. You get less oxygen. Cancer tends to grow into areas of inflammation and low oxygen.
- **[01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aE1O5dG2MZE&t=79s)** — Fasting is the most potent thing to reduce inflammation. There is some data to show that cancer cells can live on sugar,
- **[01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aE1O5dG2MZE&t=87s)** — certain amino acids, as well as ketones, but not the ketones that come from fasting.
- **[01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aE1O5dG2MZE&t=92s)** — Ketones are not just about an alternative fuel. They help your brain. Your brain prefers them.
- **[01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aE1O5dG2MZE&t=98s)** — Ketones activate genes that extend your life. If you do regular, prolonged fasting, I really believe that you can totally prevent getting cancer.
- **[01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aE1O5dG2MZE&t=107s)** — This is why I recommend doing a 72-hour fast every single month. Prolonged fasting will also take insulin and really bring that way down.
- **[01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aE1O5dG2MZE&t=115s)** — If we can keep that hormone low, your body can't grow a tumor. It's in a recycling, cleaning, cleansing mode.
- **[02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aE1O5dG2MZE&t=122s)** — If we increase more oxygen, we can also reduce the risk of cancer. And that would be exercise, right?
- **[02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aE1O5dG2MZE&t=129s)** — So this is why it's so important to also, while you're doing this prolonged fasting, go on long walks. Get a lot of oxygen.
- **[02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aE1O5dG2MZE&t=136s)** — Growth hormone also majorly goes up when you're doing fasting. Growth hormone helps you burn fat, but it also helps you preserve your muscles.
- **[02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aE1O5dG2MZE&t=144s)** — Now let's switch to some practical tips with fasting. One or two days before the fast, you want to increase your fat to make it really easy to transition from glucose to actual burning fat.
- **[02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aE1O5dG2MZE&t=156s)** — You also want to be doing intermittent fasting for a while before you try a prolonged fast.
- **[02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aE1O5dG2MZE&t=161s)** — The other thing that's really important is electrolytes. I'm talking about potassium, magnesium, and sodium chloride in the form of sea salts.
- **[02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aE1O5dG2MZE&t=169s)** — Supplements and especially electrolytes will not break your fast. One of the biggest problems with people that do prolonged fasting and don't feel very good is they're not having enough sea salt.
- **[03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aE1O5dG2MZE&t=180s)** — And so they get keto flu, cramps, weakness in the muscle. How do you get the sea salt when you're fasting if you're not eating anything?
- **[03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aE1O5dG2MZE&t=187s)** — You're going to have to take one to one and a half to even two teaspoons of sea salt. Take a little bit and dissolve it in water. I might add lemon to it. I might also add sea salt to my coffee.
- **[03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aE1O5dG2MZE&t=200s)** — The other really important thing is once you're done with this fast, when you transition into a meal, do not make this mistake. Don't start consuming anything sweet or carbohydrate.
- **[03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aE1O5dG2MZE&t=215s)** — What you want to consume is just a little bit of sauerkraut, fermented vegetables. An egg or some bone broth is really good because sometimes all it takes is a little bit of protein to get you back to where you need to be.
- **[03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aE1O5dG2MZE&t=227s)** — Wait for a few hours and eat a little bit more. Your digestive system has gone to sleep and you have to wake it up slowly. You don't want to wake it up with carbohydrates.
- **[03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aE1O5dG2MZE&t=235s)** — The reason why people don't feel good when they do prolonged fast is either they don't have enough sea salt or they haven't adapted to it gradually beforehand by doing regular intermittent fasting or they just need more protein.
- **[04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aE1O5dG2MZE&t=248s)** — You may have heard this story in another video but I had this gentleman who reached out to me and he said you might want to do a video on my story. He was very, very depressed. He was suicidal. He wanted to kill himself.
- **[04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aE1O5dG2MZE&t=260s)** — So he locked himself in his room for a few days and just wanted to starve himself to death. He laid in his bed and just said I'm not going to eat or drink anything. By day three he was feeling incredible. Happy.
- **[04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aE1O5dG2MZE&t=273s)** — His mind was working. He was like why do I feel so good? So he goes on his computer and he discovered the benefits of fasting from my video and he changed his whole life around.
- **[04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aE1O5dG2MZE&t=282s)** — Another thing that can happen is if you have a tendency to get gallstones you may generate a bit more bile sludge. The antidote is something called tutka which is a very special type of bile salt that keeps the bile thinned and flowing through the ducts.
- **[05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aE1O5dG2MZE&t=306s)** — I also did a video on a group of I think it was five to seven people. One or two of these people had diabetes type 1 and they wanted to do an experiment where they did exercise. They ran 20 miles every single day for five days in a row.
- **[05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aE1O5dG2MZE&t=324s)** — They wanted to prove that a diabetic type 1 could handle doing five marathons in a row. But that wasn't the interesting thing about this story. It's that they not only ran 20 miles a day for five days they also fasted. Yes, fasted for five days.
- **[05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aE1O5dG2MZE&t=343s)** — What's really interesting is that they didn't get a lot of soreness. Why? Because the anti-inflammatory effects from the fasting sky high. I just want to put this out there just to show you. You can actually exercise and also fast at the same time even if someone has a health problem.
- **[06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aE1O5dG2MZE&t=360s)** — I'm not recommending it unless you check with your doctor. You now know the power of fasting in this part two. But if you have not seen my part one yet you will be missing some really key points. In part one I talk about what to eat after fasting. What to expect. How to get through the barriers. How to get all the benefits from this three day fasting. And for that information watch this video right now. This one right here. Yeah, click it. That one. You got it.

- **[00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=69eAWgXDGrs&t=0s)** — Let's talk about the seven surprising signs that your blood sugar is way too high. The first
- **[00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=69eAWgXDGrs&t=7s)** — question is can you actually feel high blood sugar? Normally you can't feel too much unless
- **[00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=69eAWgXDGrs&t=12s)** — it's really really high. You might feel a little fatigued but where the symptoms come in is when
- **[00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=69eAWgXDGrs&t=17s)** — the blood sugars go down. Take a look at this little graph. Right here we have this little red
- **[00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=69eAWgXDGrs&t=22s)** — line that goes up and then it comes down past this level line where I wrote 80 on the left
- **[00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=69eAWgXDGrs&t=28s)** — side and that basically is normal blood sugar. You're not supposed to have a lot. When people
- **[00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=69eAWgXDGrs&t=33s)** — overeat carbohydrates the blood sugar goes up and insulin is going to do two things. It's going to
- **[00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=69eAWgXDGrs&t=37s)** — remove the sugar from the blood to help bring down the blood sugar but it's also going to
- **[00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=69eAWgXDGrs&t=42s)** — open the door in all of your cells to allow this sugar to go in the cell so you can use
- **[00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=69eAWgXDGrs&t=48s)** — it as fuel. A lot of the symptoms I'm going to talk about are related to a problem with
- **[00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=69eAWgXDGrs&t=53s)** — low blood sugar and low blood sugar in the actual cell because insulin is not working very well
- **[01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=69eAWgXDGrs&t=60s)** — anymore. You develop something called resistance and I'm talking about insulin resistance in the
- **[01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=69eAWgXDGrs&t=64s)** — cell and that's represented in this other image where you have this little key being
- **[01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=69eAWgXDGrs&t=69s)** — insulin and in the cell you have this little lock in there right? That's the receptor for
- **[01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=69eAWgXDGrs&t=73s)** — insulin. That key is not fitting into the lock anymore. Then you get all these symptoms
- **[01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=69eAWgXDGrs&t=78s)** — that I'm going to describe next now that you understand what insulin and insulin resistance
- **[01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=69eAWgXDGrs&t=82s)** — really is. The first one is super common and this is excessive urination. If you have to get
- **[01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=69eAWgXDGrs&t=88s)** — up through the night to urinate, suspect you have a blood sugar problem. Now I'm not talking
- **[01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=69eAWgXDGrs&t=93s)** — about diabetes. It could be a pre-diabetes. The problem is when you have too much sugar
- **[01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=69eAWgXDGrs&t=98s)** — in the blood it gets filtered by the kidneys into urine and wherever the sugar goes the
- **[01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=69eAWgXDGrs&t=105s)** — you're basically losing fluid when you eat sugar. The kidney is dumping sugar and water
- **[01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=69eAWgXDGrs&t=112s)** — because sugar is too toxic. If you're a guy you might automatically assume it's your prostate
- **[01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=69eAWgXDGrs&t=119s)** — when in fact it's probably just insulin resistance. And think about how many
- **[02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=69eAWgXDGrs&t=123s)** — medications that people are on just because their diet is not right. Number two, excessive
- **[02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=69eAWgXDGrs&t=129s)** — thirst. Why are you excessively thirsty? Could be because you're losing water. When you
- **[02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=69eAWgXDGrs&t=133s)** — retain too much sugar in your blood you retain sodium. And if you're retaining this more
- **[02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=69eAWgXDGrs&t=138s)** — concentrated sodium in the body you're going to need more water to dilute it. This is why when
- **[02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=69eAWgXDGrs&t=143s)** — you have high blood glucose you are going to be dehydrated. You'll probably be very
- **[02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=69eAWgXDGrs&t=147s)** — potassium deficient because you're locking up a lot of potassium in the liver if you're
- **[02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=69eAWgXDGrs&t=151s)** — consuming too many carbs. When you start losing too much potassium then you can't sleep,
- **[02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=69eAWgXDGrs&t=156s)** — your heart rate goes up, your blood pressure might go up, you might have a lot of issues
- **[02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=69eAWgXDGrs&t=160s)** — Number three, skin changes. Especially in the folds of the body like the folds of your neck
- **[02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=69eAWgXDGrs&t=167s)** — underneath your armpit. The skin becomes a little bit darker because you have too much
- **[02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=69eAWgXDGrs&t=172s)** — glucose. The darker folds around your body just basically mean you've got blood sugar issues.
- **[02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=69eAWgXDGrs&t=176s)** — Number four, brain fog and fatigue. Now I had this for years and I had no idea it was my
- **[03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=69eAWgXDGrs&t=186s)** — sugar. I was eating a lot of carbs, I was trying every single vitamin, it never worked. I had such
- **[03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=69eAWgXDGrs&t=190s)** — brain fog, it was terrible. You are getting literally starvation of glucose or fuel inside.
- **[03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=69eAWgXDGrs&t=196s)** — The neurons are just starving for fuel and they just can't work anymore. If I continued
- **[03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=69eAWgXDGrs&t=202s)** — on that path I probably would go right into dementia because that's what dementia is. Starvation
- **[03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=69eAWgXDGrs&t=208s)** — of the neurons. Number five, mood swings. If someone's cranky, they're highly irritable,
- **[03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=69eAWgXDGrs&t=214s)** — suspect they have a blood sugar that's too high that ends up going too low because of the
- **[03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=69eAWgXDGrs&t=220s)** — insulin situation. A lot of mood disorders involve blood sugar issues. I mean if a
- **[03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=69eAWgXDGrs&t=226s)** — psychiatrist would just get their patients on a ketogenic diet, they would probably wipe out
- **[03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=69eAWgXDGrs&t=231s)** — between 80 to 90 percent of these mental problems. Number six is cravings. Not
- **[03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=69eAWgXDGrs&t=238s)** — necessarily just for sugar but also for salty carbs like chips, things like that. You're not
- **[04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=69eAWgXDGrs&t=245s)** — thinking in the future of what's going to happen after you eat that carb. You just want
- **[04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=69eAWgXDGrs&t=249s)** — it now. You want instant relief. I was there. I would keep feeding the body what it's in the
- **[04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=69eAWgXDGrs&t=253s)** — mood for, not what I should be consuming. And that's really a bad question to ask your body
- **[04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=69eAWgXDGrs&t=259s)** — what it's in the mood for because it's not going to give you the right answer. Number seven
- **[04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=69eAWgXDGrs&t=263s)** — is blurry eyes. The lens of the eye that helps you focus is swollen. It's filled up with fluid.
- **[04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=69eAWgXDGrs&t=270s)** — Over time what happens is the inside of the eyelid becomes redden and also it feels like
- **[04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=69eAWgXDGrs&t=276s)** — sand is in there. I mean this sounds so obvious to me and probably you but the doctors
- **[04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=69eAWgXDGrs&t=281s)** — don't focus on the diet. Doctors are taught to treat the blood sugar with medication and
- **[04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=69eAWgXDGrs&t=286s)** — then carry some candy in your pocket if your blood sugar is too low. And I feel bad for
- **[04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=69eAWgXDGrs&t=291s)** — these medical doctors that go into medicine because they really want to help people. But
- **[04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=69eAWgXDGrs&t=295s)** — unfortunately some of the tools that they're taught are not the best tools to fix a problem
- **[04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=69eAWgXDGrs&t=299s)** — only to manage a problem. I run into people all the time that are diabetics and their
- **[05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=69eAWgXDGrs&t=305s)** — diabetes is being managed and they think that's a total solve problem but in fact it's not.
- **[05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=69eAWgXDGrs&t=311s)** — And sometimes I have to withhold my suggestion because honestly they can get rid of this in
- **[05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=69eAWgXDGrs&t=315s)** — a few weeks. Maybe up to a month. A couple things about how to solve this problem. You
- **[05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=69eAWgXDGrs&t=320s)** — want to run your body on a different fuel. We want to lower glucose and then the body is
- **[05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=69eAWgXDGrs&t=325s)** — automatically going to start switching to a different fuel source and that's called
- **[05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=69eAWgXDGrs&t=329s)** — ketones. Ketones come from your fat. This is why you're going to lose weight. The way to
- **[05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=69eAWgXDGrs&t=335s)** — get your body to burn ketones is to lower your carbohydrates below 50 grams per day.
- **[05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=69eAWgXDGrs&t=340s)** — I would recommend lowering it like 20 grams a day. And another thing I would do now that
- **[05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=69eAWgXDGrs&t=345s)** — insulin is. We want to do things opposite to insulin. We need to increase the opposite
- **[05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=69eAWgXDGrs&t=351s)** — hormone. That's called glucagon. How do we do that? We do that by consuming high quality
- **[05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=69eAWgXDGrs&t=359s)** — protein. Red meat or fish or even eggs. Super important and that protein will trigger the
- **[06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=69eAWgXDGrs&t=366s)** — opposite hormone and help bring you back to a good blood sugar situation very quickly.
- **[06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=69eAWgXDGrs&t=372s)** — A1C measures your blood sugars over a period of 120 days. You're measuring how much glycated
- **[06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=69eAWgXDGrs&t=381s)** — protein you have in your blood. When you combine sugar to your hemoglobin, that's protein,
- **[06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=69eAWgXDGrs&t=387s)** — then it's glycated. The more percentage of your blood protein hemoglobin that is glycated,
- **[06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=69eAWgXDGrs&t=394s)** — the more severe diabetes you have. There's one little thing I want to mention about this.
- **[06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=69eAWgXDGrs&t=399s)** — If you are starting on a ketogenic diet or even a carnivore, which you're not eating any carbs at
- **[06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=69eAWgXDGrs&t=404s)** — all. You're just doing meat and things like that. You may notice that your A1C might stay
- **[06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=69eAWgXDGrs&t=410s)** — higher or go back up a little bit. What you have to realize that a lot of people don't realize
- **[06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=69eAWgXDGrs&t=415s)** — is that when you do the ketogenic diet, this healthy version of the keto or carnivore,
- **[07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=69eAWgXDGrs&t=421s)** — you're extending the life of your red blood cells. Instead of that 120 days, it could be 130 days or
- **[07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=69eAWgXDGrs&t=429s)** — 140 days or 150 days. The A1C will actually go up because the red blood cell lives longer. This
- **[07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=69eAWgXDGrs&t=437s)** — is not your problem getting in a worse soft condition. This is just basically your red blood
- **[07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=69eAWgXDGrs&t=442s)** — cell living longer, which throws off the formula a little bit. Now that you know about
- **[07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=69eAWgXDGrs&t=446s)** — that, the next thing to know is the details of what to eat. And for that information,
- **[07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=69eAWgXDGrs&t=450s)** — you should watch this video right here. Check it out.

- **[00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nl34wXQ4-Ww&t=0s)** — You've probably seen this ad many many many times, right? You don't need keto, you don't need paleo,
- **[00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nl34wXQ4-Ww&t=5s)** — you don't need intense exercise, you don't even need to fast or even do a vegan diet. And you can
- **[00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nl34wXQ4-Ww&t=12s)** — burn fat and get shredded. So please comment down below if you've seen this ad before.
- **[00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nl34wXQ4-Ww&t=17s)** — The best way to burn fat and get shredded is not keto, not paleo, and it's definitely not
- **[00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nl34wXQ4-Ww&t=23s)** — intense exercises like this. I mean people must be buying this program because they're
- **[00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nl34wXQ4-Ww&t=29s)** — advertising a lot and they wouldn't spend all this money on advertising if they weren't selling this
- **[00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nl34wXQ4-Ww&t=33s)** — program. And it's your typical, let's shock people into clicking this ad so you can maybe just
- **[00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nl34wXQ4-Ww&t=39s)** — possibly not have to do anything and lose your weight. You can also eat pizza instead of salad.
- **[00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nl34wXQ4-Ww&t=45s)** — Which one do you think I'm having for dinner tonight? Well it's not this. As long as you align
- **[00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nl34wXQ4-Ww&t=50s)** — your actions with the body type. So what does V Shred recommend to eat? Well here's an example
- **[00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nl34wXQ4-Ww&t=56s)** — breakfast. You can have oatmeal and fruit. You can have a mid-morning snack with an apple and nuts.
- **[01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nl34wXQ4-Ww&t=64s)** — For lunch you can have a salad with chicken and then an afternoon snack, carrots and hummus.
- **[01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nl34wXQ4-Ww&t=70s)** — And then for dinner, teriyaki chicken with vegetables and some berries. You can even have
- **[01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nl34wXQ4-Ww&t=76s)** — popcorn and you can have bread on this diet. As long as you eliminate the added sugars and
- **[01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nl34wXQ4-Ww&t=80s)** — processed foods. So let me just do a little bit of a deep dive. Not a very long deep dive
- **[01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nl34wXQ4-Ww&t=85s)** — into something that's very very important. Just so you don't end up doing a program and
- **[01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nl34wXQ4-Ww&t=91s)** — wasting your money and then chalking it up to another thing that just didn't work. In the hopes
- **[01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nl34wXQ4-Ww&t=97s)** — that maybe this is the answer that I can finally lose weight. Maybe I'm eating too healthy or
- **[01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nl34wXQ4-Ww&t=101s)** — reducing too many carbs or maybe I'm exercising too much right? 80% of your results are going
- **[01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nl34wXQ4-Ww&t=106s)** — to be diet and 20% are related to exercise. What does that actually mean and is it actually
- **[01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nl34wXQ4-Ww&t=112s)** — true? And I'm going to tell you that it's not actually true. It really depends on another
- **[01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nl34wXQ4-Ww&t=117s)** — thing. Okay? Because there's two things about diet. It's of course what you eat. If you
- **[02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nl34wXQ4-Ww&t=123s)** — know anything about fat burning, it's really tied into the insulin component part right? If you
- **[02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nl34wXQ4-Ww&t=128s)** — lower your insulin and your body can now stop storing fat and you can start burning your fat.
- **[02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nl34wXQ4-Ww&t=133s)** — And that's basically really about lowering your carbohydrates. The lower that you bring your
- **[02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nl34wXQ4-Ww&t=138s)** — carbohydrates, the more fat you're going to burn. Well it doesn't always work. So there's
- **[02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nl34wXQ4-Ww&t=143s)** — this other variable of when you eat. Okay? Because there are a lot of people who I know
- **[02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nl34wXQ4-Ww&t=149s)** — who go on the ketogenic diet, low carb diet and they're healthy foods. They don't lose any
- **[02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nl34wXQ4-Ww&t=154s)** — weight. Of course when you look at the frequency of eating, they're eating three
- **[02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nl34wXQ4-Ww&t=158s)** — meals with three snacks. But that's all good food. So why can some people lose weight
- **[02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nl34wXQ4-Ww&t=164s)** — and yet other people can't? It has to do with this one thing and that is insulin resistance.
- **[02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nl34wXQ4-Ww&t=172s)** — If they have insulin resistance, which by the way is about 70% of the population, the people
- **[02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nl34wXQ4-Ww&t=177s)** — that are successful just by reducing carbohydrates, just like the simple sugars and some of the
- **[03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nl34wXQ4-Ww&t=182s)** — refined foods, that is a much smaller percent of the population. But they can actually lose
- **[03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nl34wXQ4-Ww&t=186s)** — weight because they don't have insulin resistance. Somehow they never got it. Maybe it's part
- **[03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nl34wXQ4-Ww&t=194s)** — of genetics. Maybe they haven't lived on so many carbs and sugar like the rest of us. But the
- **[03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nl34wXQ4-Ww&t=199s)** — point is the more insulin resistance you have, the more you have to not just lower your carbs,
- **[03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nl34wXQ4-Ww&t=204s)** — but the more you have to do infrequent eating. That's called intermittent fasting.
- **[03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nl34wXQ4-Ww&t=210s)** — Now if we just take a look at the two main things that increase insulin, carbohydrates
- **[03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nl34wXQ4-Ww&t=215s)** — and the frequency of eating. As in a lot of different meals, a lot of different snacks.
- **[03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nl34wXQ4-Ww&t=219s)** — If we just take a look at those two things and we compare them,
- **[03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nl34wXQ4-Ww&t=223s)** — I'm going to tell you right now the frequency of eating and the snacks is way, way, way,
- **[03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nl34wXQ4-Ww&t=229s)** — way more important and way more significant than just lowering your carbs. Because there are a
- **[03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nl34wXQ4-Ww&t=235s)** — lot of people that can pretty much eat whatever they want and they're still able to lose
- **[04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nl34wXQ4-Ww&t=241s)** — weight. But they only eat just one meal a day with absolutely no snacking versus a much
- **[04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nl34wXQ4-Ww&t=247s)** — smaller percent of the population which start reducing their carbs and they haven't
- **[04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nl34wXQ4-Ww&t=253s)** — introduced intermittent fasting yet. But some of those people will lose weight. Okay, but not a
- **[04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nl34wXQ4-Ww&t=258s)** — large percentage. And when we're talking about this B shred guy, he's pretty much focusing on
- **[04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nl34wXQ4-Ww&t=264s)** — a very small percent of the population that can lose weight just by reducing some of the junk
- **[04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nl34wXQ4-Ww&t=270s)** — foods and reducing the added sugars and the processed sugar because he allows fruit
- **[04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nl34wXQ4-Ww&t=276s)** — and things like that. I mean the reason I know this is because my initial diet was very similar
- **[04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nl34wXQ4-Ww&t=281s)** — to his. I didn't recommend intermittent fasting. I did recommend these snacks,
- **[04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nl34wXQ4-Ww&t=286s)** — apples and nuts, lowered fat and a very similar diet. And I was successful to some degree.
- **[04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nl34wXQ4-Ww&t=292s)** — I wouldn't say that it was a high level of success like it is now. So if you wanted to
- **[04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nl34wXQ4-Ww&t=297s)** — know can you lose weight and eat what you want? Yes, you can. For a certain small percent
- **[05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nl34wXQ4-Ww&t=303s)** — of the population who does not have insulin resistance, they just need to cut down a little
- **[05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nl34wXQ4-Ww&t=308s)** — bit on their carbs. But for everyone else that has insulin resistance, which is like 70% of the
- **[05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nl34wXQ4-Ww&t=312s)** — population, they're going to have to do fasting like one meal a day. And they will
- **[05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nl34wXQ4-Ww&t=317s)** — definitely experience results. But my whole point is why not combine intermittent fasting
- **[05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nl34wXQ4-Ww&t=323s)** — with the reduction of carbohydrates? Because it's not just about weight loss. It's about
- **[05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nl34wXQ4-Ww&t=329s)** — reducing your inflammation. It's about removing fat from the liver. It's about looking good
- **[05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nl34wXQ4-Ww&t=335s)** — as you lose weight because your skin is better and you're not putting all these other things
- **[05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nl34wXQ4-Ww&t=340s)** — in your body that don't contribute to healthy cells. It's also about reducing your risk for
- **[05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nl34wXQ4-Ww&t=345s)** — all the other chronic degenerative type problems. However, in this video, I really
- **[05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nl34wXQ4-Ww&t=350s)** — just wanted to differentiate the different variables in losing weight so you can kind of
- **[05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nl34wXQ4-Ww&t=356s)** — wits around it and understand why some people lose weight on a certain diet and others will not
- **[06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nl34wXQ4-Ww&t=363s)** — and what they have to do. And for a lot of people, especially with insulin resistance,
- **[06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nl34wXQ4-Ww&t=367s)** — it's not just lowering your carbohydrates. It will help. It will actually get rid of like
- **[06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nl34wXQ4-Ww&t=372s)** — two weeks of water weight. But unless you add that intermittent fasting, which is way, way,
- **[06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nl34wXQ4-Ww&t=378s)** — way more significant than just lowering your carbs, you probably are not going to see a
- **[06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nl34wXQ4-Ww&t=384s)** — change. So my suggestion is also not to just lower your carbs. It's to increase the quality
- **[06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nl34wXQ4-Ww&t=390s)** — of your food. That's called healthy keto and implement the intermittent fasting as well as
- **[06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nl34wXQ4-Ww&t=396s)** — the right exercise. And also as a side note, the reason why some top athletes can get away
- **[06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nl34wXQ4-Ww&t=402s)** — with eating a lot of sugar is because the exercise stimulates the mitochondria and kind of
- **[06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nl34wXQ4-Ww&t=409s)** — neutralizes to some degree some of this sugar effect on your mitochondria, which I don't
- **[06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nl34wXQ4-Ww&t=415s)** — recommend it. But just so you know, exercise I think is really important, not just for weight
- **[07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nl34wXQ4-Ww&t=420s)** — loss, but for stimulating your mitochondria, which is at the heart of so many health problems
- **[07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nl34wXQ4-Ww&t=429s)** — out there. Now, if you really wanted to know how to do healthy keto, just the basics,
- **[07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nl34wXQ4-Ww&t=434s)** — you should watch this video right here.

- **[00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5rKCJlsnAM8&t=30s)** — And nd the amount of people that came in with back pain, whether it was from a fall on their buttocks, which I've done many many times, or an injury, or you lift something, or you're just sitting all day.
- **[00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5rKCJlsnAM8&t=41s)** — Did you realize that there's more pressure on your disc when you're sitting than when you're standing? And I'm so guilty of that. I sit in this chair, I mean a tremendous amount of time through the day.
- **[00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5rKCJlsnAM8&t=51s)** — And then let's talk about posture, right? So every inch, your head goes forward, past the midline through here, you're adding about 10 pounds of weight in your upper shoulders. So you're sitting forward this way.
- **[01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5rKCJlsnAM8&t=63s)** — You know, and this is what people do, creates a lot of stress, not just on the upper back, on the lower back too. And then what about when you're driving, right? You're reversing the lower back curve and you're sitting there and you're driving long distances.
- **[01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5rKCJlsnAM8&t=73s)** — And then you get home and you sit on the couch, right? Terrible for your back. Add age to this, we actually get shorter. What's happening over time, all this decrease in space is eventually going to hit some of these nerves and you're going to end up with some back pain.
- **[01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5rKCJlsnAM8&t=87s)** — This therapy I'm going to talk about will quickly give you enough space in your back to give you so much relief. And I think this is the absolute hands down best treatment for the lower back because it has virtually no side effects.
- **[01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5rKCJlsnAM8&t=99s)** — What does this treatment involve? It's anti-gravity. Do we have to go to space to get it? Not necessarily. The therapy is using the inversion table to bring yourself gradually almost upside down. And this reverses the flow of gravity.
- **[01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5rKCJlsnAM8&t=115s)** — I'm also going to show you how to do this without an inversion table so you don't need anything at all. You just need a wall. But if you think about it, an inversion table only costs literally $100, maybe up to $400 at the very, very top, which is pretty close to like one treatment going to either the physical therapist, the doctor, the chiropractor.
- **[02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5rKCJlsnAM8&t=133s)** — You can literally buy an inversion table and use it for a very long period of time and do it yourself. Gravity has been putting pressure on us since we were born. So what happens when we reverse this? Reverse the flow. You're using your weight of your upper body to pull down on your lower back, creating this negative pressure allowing all this blood flow.
- **[02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5rKCJlsnAM8&t=154s)** — You're also breaking up adhesions and scar tissue. You want to do intermittent inversion traction where you do it for one to two minutes and then you bring yourself back up and you bring it back to one or two minutes. Bring yourself back up and you're going to do that repetitively. And I'm going to give you kind of a pattern to follow. And I'm going to type that also down in the description. It's one of the most dynamic and effective things you can do to your lower back. You're hitting these key areas. The nerve, the disc, the scar tissue, the lack of blood flow,
- **[03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5rKCJlsnAM8&t=184s)** — all in one treatment. Like I said before, all we have to do is increase the space by the width of two pieces of paper. There's very powerful research out there that shows that it actually even increases your flexibility, reduces the risk of getting surgery for sciatica, and just gets rid of your lower back pain pretty quick. In some studies it shows that it beats taking medication by 35%. Injections of cortisone shots into your back without the side effects. I do want to mention something really quick. If you have high blood pressure, if you have glaucoma, which
- **[03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5rKCJlsnAM8&t=214s)** — is higher pressure in your eye, or some other type of heart problems, check with your doctor before doing this. Overall it's relatively pretty safe. It's actually good for the entire body. Here's how you want to start it. You only want to start like one to two minutes. Not reversing yourself completely upside down. Only by an angle of like 15 to 30%. Nothing too crazy. Just a little bit for one to two minutes. Once or maybe twice a day. For about a week. Then slowly increase it to five minutes at about 60 degrees.
- **[04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5rKCJlsnAM8&t=244s)** — For another one to two weeks. We're talking about five minutes or longer. I'm talking about doing it intermittently. You might want to do it for like a minute. Come down, bring yourself up. So there's little pauses in between this. That will create the pumping blood flow in the lower back. But after about three to four weeks, you can do what I do, which I bring myself all the way almost completely upside down. And I'll do that for two minutes. Okay. And then another two minutes. Then I will go back and forth with that cycle for about a week.
- **[04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5rKCJlsnAM8&t=274s)** — For about 15 to 20 minutes. Three times a week. When you do this, you're going to feel taller. You're going to have a lot less pain. And it's going to feel like you just got an amazing stretch. Before I get into the other versions of the inversion technique, I want to explain other things you should be doing to decrease your pain in your lower back and your sciatica. Number one is go on a low carb ketogenic diet. Why? Because that is going to severely reduce your inflammation to the entire body. Number two, start taking a good amount of
- **[05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5rKCJlsnAM8&t=304s)** — vitamin D. I'm talking about at least 20 to 30,000 international units of vitamin D3 with K2. And with magnesium, it's 400 milligrams of magnesium glycinate. But the reason why you want the vitamin D as the primary thing is because the first place for vitamin D deficiencies to show up is your lower back. The next thing is to eliminate all the omega-6 seed oils out of your diet. The problem with omega-6 is it competes with omega-3,
- **[05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5rKCJlsnAM8&t=333s)** — which is anti-inflammatory. If you're doing all these seed oils, what's going to happen is you're going to start to have overall higher amounts of inflammation. The other thing that I would recommend, myofascial stretching. When you're doing low back stretches, for example, like side bending type stretches, you're not really stretching the fascia. What you want to do is do side bending stretches and lift your arm over your head and stretch down the opposite way. This is why myofascial stretching using the whole body is so
- **[06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5rKCJlsnAM8&t=363s)** — effective. It's kind of like if you took a rag and it was wet and you rotated it to wring the water out and then you bent it to the side. That's when you get all the water out. That's exactly what you want to do. Let's say you don't have an immersion table. Just get a couple blankets and your pillow and you can roll them up as you see in this video right here. This is called yoga's child pose. And you're literally creating a situation where there's very little pressure on your lower back and you're laying over it and you're
- **[06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5rKCJlsnAM8&t=393s)** — creating space in your lower back. It's going to give you a lot of relief. Why? Because you eliminated gravity. It's probably not going to create a major decompression, but it's going to give you a lot of relief. Next stretch is called the wall assisted leg up stretch. You can do one leg at a time. You're literally lifting up your pelvis. You can just hold it up there or you can go back and forth to strengthen it. You're basically using the wall to create a little bit of an inversion with your lower back. The
- **[07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5rKCJlsnAM8&t=423s)** — next one, you'll need a kind of an exercise ball. And this is called the lying spinal decompression with a stability ball. You're literally going to just lay over this ball and the ball is going to be pressing upward as you're laying over it, creating this distraction because you're allowing your gravity for your upper body and your lower body to go over your lower back. The last anti gravity technique is in the water because when you go in the water, there's less gravity and you can float around. It'll gradually decompress the lower back.
- **[07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5rKCJlsnAM8&t=453s)** — Not to the degree that these other things will or the inversion table, but it can greatly help you. If you have sciatica nerve pain or lower back pain, your next most important thing to do, it's a drink for joint pain and it's super effective. This is how you make it. Just click right here.

- **[00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cqk7MOeKAXg&t=0s)** — Warning, sugar is actually destroying your brain. Sugar creates very similar effects to cocaine and heroin on certain parts of the brain.
- **[00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cqk7MOeKAXg&t=8s)** — And one study, if given a choice, a lab rat will go after the sugar more than the cocaine.
- **[00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cqk7MOeKAXg&t=13s)** — Sugar has the ability to alter hormones that literally puts you into this anxiety state when there's nothing around you to be anxious about.
- **[00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cqk7MOeKAXg&t=21s)** — But what comes way before that is a mild version of dementia.
- **[00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cqk7MOeKAXg&t=26s)** — You start losing your memory, which you just start forgetting.
- **[00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cqk7MOeKAXg&t=29s)** — And you're like, okay, where do I put my keys? You might have difficulty with names. You're not thinking clearly.
- **[00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cqk7MOeKAXg&t=34s)** — The last place that the sugar goes to is the hippocampus.
- **[00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cqk7MOeKAXg&t=37s)** — This part of the brain allows you to remember things.
- **[00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cqk7MOeKAXg&t=40s)** — And so when you're eating all this sugar and then eventually get pre-diabetes or diabetes, that all stems from sugar.
- **[00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cqk7MOeKAXg&t=47s)** — People will tell you that the brain needs sugar to survive.
- **[00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cqk7MOeKAXg&t=50s)** — And it is true that the brain can run on glucose.
- **[00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cqk7MOeKAXg&t=53s)** — The problem is when you do too much glucose, you start developing a blockage of the absorption of glucose.
- **[01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cqk7MOeKAXg&t=60s)** — If we take a look at how much glucose that's supposed to be in your blood at any one time, that's one teaspoon.
- **[01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cqk7MOeKAXg&t=65s)** — Here's the thing. People eat a lot more than one teaspoon of sugar. So where does it go?
- **[01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cqk7MOeKAXg&t=70s)** — Insulin stores it, but then anything more is stored as fat.
- **[01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cqk7MOeKAXg&t=74s)** — A lot of the cholesterol that people have that's too high is coming from carbs or sugar.
- **[01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cqk7MOeKAXg&t=79s)** — What happens when you're eating excessive sugar, anything more than one teaspoon, is you start developing higher levels of insulin that has to do the heavy lifting.
- **[01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cqk7MOeKAXg&t=87s)** — But the doctors never test for this fasting insulin level because if they did, on an average person, they would find it to be very, very high.
- **[01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cqk7MOeKAXg&t=95s)** — What happens over time is that your pancreas keeps working harder and harder and you have more and more insulin.
- **[01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cqk7MOeKAXg&t=99s)** — And then the brain and other tissues of the body start to create this thing called insulin resistance.
- **[01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cqk7MOeKAXg&t=106s)** — When you have more than a teaspoon of sugar at any one time, the insulin is not working to pull that sugar out.
- **[01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cqk7MOeKAXg&t=113s)** — Then you start getting higher blood glucose and that's called diabetes.
- **[01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cqk7MOeKAXg&t=117s)** — You have so much insulin resistance, you can no longer pull in the glucose and feed the brain cells.
- **[02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cqk7MOeKAXg&t=123s)** — So the brain cells cannot get energy. And it wasn't even just the sugar. It was all the hidden sugar.
- **[02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cqk7MOeKAXg&t=128s)** — I'm talking about starch. Many times worse than actual sugar.
- **[02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cqk7MOeKAXg&t=131s)** — And then of course, you're drinking all this juice thinking, oh yeah, it's from oranges, right?
- **[02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cqk7MOeKAXg&t=136s)** — Pure sugar. The most important thing that you could do with your diet is keep your carbs lower.
- **[02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cqk7MOeKAXg&t=143s)** — The low carb diet creates the most benefit and reverses diabetes within 10 weeks.
- **[02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cqk7MOeKAXg&t=150s)** — That should be in every newspaper, but you probably don't hear about it.
- **[02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cqk7MOeKAXg&t=153s)** — Here you have this sugar and starch, highly addictive. They put all these chemicals in it.
- **[02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cqk7MOeKAXg&t=158s)** — Anytime you eat anything with low protein, it's really hard for you to be satisfied.
- **[02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cqk7MOeKAXg&t=162s)** — When you lower your carbohydrates, you no longer are feeding the brain cells glucose.
- **[02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cqk7MOeKAXg&t=168s)** — Because you're now forcing your body to mobilize ketones, which is a completely different fuel from your own fat.
- **[02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cqk7MOeKAXg&t=175s)** — And that's going to feed your brain. It's going to bring up your mood.
- **[02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cqk7MOeKAXg&t=179s)** — You're going to be able to concentrate. You're going to have more attention.
- **[03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cqk7MOeKAXg&t=182s)** — You're going to learn better. You're going to have more capacity to remember things.
- **[03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cqk7MOeKAXg&t=184s)** — And that fatigue in your brain is going to go away.
- **[03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cqk7MOeKAXg&t=188s)** — Now, another little side note to this. I had my genes tested.
- **[03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cqk7MOeKAXg&t=194s)** — Apparently, my genetics show kind of a weakness in the area of being satisfied.
- **[03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cqk7MOeKAXg&t=199s)** — If I don't consume enough fat or protein, I will literally never be satisfied.
- **[03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cqk7MOeKAXg&t=205s)** — So the combination of all the carbs and the frequent eating and the snacks, really bad.
- **[03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cqk7MOeKAXg&t=210s)** — Until one day I discovered that if I consume more protein,
- **[03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cqk7MOeKAXg&t=215s)** — I could be more satisfied and not have to snack.
- **[03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cqk7MOeKAXg&t=219s)** — Protein is the solution to this carb problem.
- **[03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cqk7MOeKAXg&t=223s)** — Having enough sufficient protein and fat will get rid of your cravings and decrease the need for snacking.
- **[03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cqk7MOeKAXg&t=229s)** — It's not necessarily just about cutting your carbs.
- **[03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cqk7MOeKAXg&t=232s)** — It's what you're going to replace it with.
- **[03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cqk7MOeKAXg&t=234s)** — And I'm talking about replacing with grass-fed meat.
- **[03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cqk7MOeKAXg&t=236s)** — You can do eggs. You can do fish.
- **[03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cqk7MOeKAXg&t=238s)** — But I'm telling you, this protein with the fat that normally comes with it will quickly reverse
- **[04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cqk7MOeKAXg&t=244s)** — and help correct this insulin problem.
- **[04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cqk7MOeKAXg&t=247s)** — And that brain fog will go away so fast.
- **[04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cqk7MOeKAXg&t=250s)** — This is one of the most simple, most amazing things you can recommend to someone
- **[04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cqk7MOeKAXg&t=256s)** — is to make sure they have enough high quality protein with the meal without the carbs.
- **[04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cqk7MOeKAXg&t=261s)** — You do have people that are so used to eating junk food,
- **[04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cqk7MOeKAXg&t=263s)** — it's really hard to have them make the transition.
- **[04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cqk7MOeKAXg&t=266s)** — But there's some really cool things that you can eat that will be very close or mimic what you have been eating.
- **[04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cqk7MOeKAXg&t=273s)** — Let's just take, for example, fat and sweet.
- **[04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cqk7MOeKAXg&t=276s)** — Okay, at the end of the meal, you can get some Greek yogurt, no sugar.
- **[04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cqk7MOeKAXg&t=280s)** — There's certain brands of chocolate that don't have any sugar.
- **[04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cqk7MOeKAXg&t=283s)** — There are a ton of recipes to do alternative breads, pasta, cereal.
- **[04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cqk7MOeKAXg&t=289s)** — All of the flour products can be replaced by a healthier version.
- **[04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cqk7MOeKAXg&t=293s)** — This is not about depriving yourself.
- **[04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cqk7MOeKAXg&t=296s)** — This is about just replacing it with an upgrade.
- **[04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cqk7MOeKAXg&t=299s)** — There are recipes that you can make like the butter chicken, the Indian dish.
- **[05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cqk7MOeKAXg&t=304s)** — That's so delicious that you go to this Indian restaurant and you have this butter chicken and it's so amazing.
- **[05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cqk7MOeKAXg&t=310s)** — Of course, they put tons of sugar in it.
- **[05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cqk7MOeKAXg&t=312s)** — There's recipes and I'll put one down below that virtually tastes identical to that.
- **[05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cqk7MOeKAXg&t=316s)** — But there's no sugar in it.
- **[05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cqk7MOeKAXg&t=317s)** — There's just spices and it's delicious.
- **[05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cqk7MOeKAXg&t=319s)** — So you can enjoy your food, but without the sugar and without the snacking.
- **[05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cqk7MOeKAXg&t=325s)** — Yes, the brain can live on sugar, but it doesn't need a lot.
- **[05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cqk7MOeKAXg&t=328s)** — Very similar to a plant.
- **[05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cqk7MOeKAXg&t=330s)** — It needs water, but what happens when you overwater it?
- **[05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cqk7MOeKAXg&t=332s)** — It dies.
- **[05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cqk7MOeKAXg&t=332s)** — And that teaspoon of sugar that's needed for your blood can be created from your liver, from things that are not sugar.
- **[05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cqk7MOeKAXg&t=340s)** — So you really don't need any sugar.
- **[05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cqk7MOeKAXg&t=342s)** — In summary, the most dramatic thing you could do to reverse cognitive problems, lowered emotional mood issues, brain fog,
- **[05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cqk7MOeKAXg&t=352s)** — is by cutting out the sugar, the hidden sugar, starches,
- **[05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cqk7MOeKAXg&t=356s)** — and replacing it with high quality protein with the fat.
- **[05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cqk7MOeKAXg&t=359s)** — Thanks for watching and I will see you in the next video.

- **[00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gjoSBllaONE&t=0s)** — You know, it's very strange to me that someone going through menopause would have to suffer with
- **[00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gjoSBllaONE&t=8s)** — hot flashes, night sweats, vaginal dryness, decreased libido, anxiety, depression. I mean,
- **[00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gjoSBllaONE&t=15s)** — that's just weird. And we're told that these symptoms are normal. It's part of life. We
- **[00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gjoSBllaONE&t=20s)** — just have to cope with it and accept it because your sex hormones naturally decrease with age
- **[00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gjoSBllaONE&t=26s)** — by a factor of at least 50% because you're no longer having functional ovaries anymore. Right?
- **[00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gjoSBllaONE&t=34s)** — So the question is, is this true? And the answer is no, it's absolutely false information. When
- **[00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gjoSBllaONE&t=41s)** — you go through menopause, you have two backup organs. They're called the adrenals. And the
- **[00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gjoSBllaONE&t=48s)** — adrenals make all of the hormones that the ovaries make. Okay? All these sex hormones,
- **[00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gjoSBllaONE&t=55s)** — estrogen, progesterone, testosterone, and they make a lot of other hormones too,
- **[01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gjoSBllaONE&t=61s)** — like cortisol, aldosterone, DHEA, things like that. So the way it's supposed to work is
- **[01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gjoSBllaONE&t=67s)** — during menopause, you have a decreased ovarian function and the adrenals are supposed to back
- **[01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gjoSBllaONE&t=73s)** — it up and start making these hormones. And no, it's not normal to have any symptoms when
- **[01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gjoSBllaONE&t=80s)** — you're going through menopause. So what is the problem? Okay. Well, take a look at this chart.
- **[01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gjoSBllaONE&t=85s)** — Right? Here we have a chart of the metabolic pathways through the adrenals, the different
- **[01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gjoSBllaONE&t=91s)** — layers of the adrenal, and the different hormones that are created by your adrenals.
- **[01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gjoSBllaONE&t=96s)** — You have mineral corticoids, glucocorticoids, androgen, estrogen, all of these hormones
- **[01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gjoSBllaONE&t=103s)** — stem from this one thing, this one raw material. Check it out right here. Cholesterol. That's right.
- **[01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gjoSBllaONE&t=111s)** — The very thing that people are telling you to avoid because it causes heart disease. Right?
- **[01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gjoSBllaONE&t=117s)** — So at the expense of lowering cholesterol through the diet, a diet recommendation,
- **[02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gjoSBllaONE&t=122s)** — or medication, boy, are your adrenals going to suffer because that cholesterol is a required
- **[02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gjoSBllaONE&t=129s)** — material to not only make all of your sex hormones and all of the adrenal hormones that are on the
- **[02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gjoSBllaONE&t=136s)** — outside called the cortex and also cholesterol is the absolute required material to make vitamin D.
- **[02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gjoSBllaONE&t=144s)** — And you know how important that is also to make bile salts to help you digest fat,
- **[02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gjoSBllaONE&t=149s)** — to make sure you have enough vitamin A, D, E, K, and also to supply your brain. Do you
- **[02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gjoSBllaONE&t=156s)** — realize that 25% of your brain is cholesterol? In fact, certain cells in the brain, these are
- **[02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gjoSBllaONE&t=163s)** — support cells, they're not neurons, they're called glial cells, make cholesterol. So 75%
- **[02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gjoSBllaONE&t=169s)** — of all the cholesterol in your body right now is made by your own cells, not just by the
- **[02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gjoSBllaONE&t=174s)** — brain cells, but other cells as well. Only 25% comes from the diet. And you might be saying,
- **[03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gjoSBllaONE&t=180s)** — well, I do eat a lot of fat in my diet. I have my olive oil, I have my soy oil, my
- **[03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gjoSBllaONE&t=185s)** — canola oil, I have my avocado oil, I'm consuming my coconut oil. Really? Well, guess what?
- **[03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gjoSBllaONE&t=193s)** — There is no cholesterol in plants or plant oils or seed oils. Cholesterol only comes from
- **[03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gjoSBllaONE&t=200s)** — animal products. And I want to emphasize that 80% of the cholesterol that feeds the adrenals
- **[03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gjoSBllaONE&t=207s)** — is in the form of LDL, that so-called bad cholesterol that we have to avoid. So by
- **[03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gjoSBllaONE&t=217s)** — cutting out cholesterol from the diet, or using medication that lowers the cholesterol,
- **[03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gjoSBllaONE&t=221s)** — there's all these cascade problems, all this collateral damage that can occur,
- **[03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gjoSBllaONE&t=227s)** — including the big ones of menopausal symptoms, depression, anxiety, loss of memory. I mean,
- **[03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gjoSBllaONE&t=234s)** — you think about even one of the side effects of statins, which is a medication to block your
- **[04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gjoSBllaONE&t=240s)** — production of cholesterol, one of the symptoms is called transient global amnesia. Okay. You
- **[04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gjoSBllaONE&t=246s)** — have certain times where you just lose your memory. When you're on statins, you actually
- **[04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gjoSBllaONE&t=250s)** — increase the risk of cancer. People with higher cholesterol have lower incidence of cancer. So
- **[04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gjoSBllaONE&t=258s)** — apparently there's this cholesterol immune system relationship. Now that could be because
- **[04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gjoSBllaONE&t=263s)** — of vitamin D or other factors. And we all know the common symptoms from being on a statin
- **[04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gjoSBllaONE&t=267s)** — is muscle pain and muscle problems because of what it does to something called coenzyme Q10.
- **[04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gjoSBllaONE&t=274s)** — Okay. That molecule is blocked when you take statins. And that's essential for allowing
- **[04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gjoSBllaONE&t=280s)** — your mitochondria to use fat as fuel. So it's intimately involved in the production of
- **[04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gjoSBllaONE&t=289s)** — especially in your muscles. And so if you starve off the muscle from getting energy,
- **[04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gjoSBllaONE&t=294s)** — you get all sorts of problems. And this is one of the biggest side effects and reasons why people
- **[05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gjoSBllaONE&t=300s)** — stop taking statins as the side effect of lowering cholesterol. And so if we take a broad
- **[05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gjoSBllaONE&t=304s)** — look at all the symptoms that women go through during menopause, they all relate to a
- **[05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gjoSBllaONE&t=310s)** — deficiency of sex hormones. And what many women don't realize is the vital importance
- **[05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gjoSBllaONE&t=314s)** — of just supporting this cholesterol to feed these hormones, to make sure they have the
- **[05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gjoSBllaONE&t=322s)** — raw material. And what you're going to find out if you make just a slight change in your
- **[05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gjoSBllaONE&t=326s)** — diet is the very dramatic and sudden disappearance of these menopausal symptoms
- **[05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gjoSBllaONE&t=332s)** — just by increasing more cholesterol in the diet. And now you know why, because all of
- **[05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gjoSBllaONE&t=338s)** — these hormones are built from cholesterol. So start adding more cholesterol to the diet.
- **[05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gjoSBllaONE&t=344s)** — And the number one food that can actually help you is high quality grass fed butter.
- **[05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gjoSBllaONE&t=351s)** — That's right. Start putting it in your coffee, start putting it in your food.
- **[05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gjoSBllaONE&t=356s)** — Don't be afraid to consume real butter. And again, realize that you can't get your cholesterol
- **[06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gjoSBllaONE&t=361s)** — from plants. So all these other oils, okay, which are fine, like olive oil is fine.
- **[06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gjoSBllaONE&t=367s)** — Some of these other oils like avocado is fine, but it's not going to help you
- **[06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gjoSBllaONE&t=370s)** — build up your adrenal hormones. And by the way, the more stress that your body goes through,
- **[06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gjoSBllaONE&t=376s)** — especially during menopause, the more cholesterol you need, especially more LDL. Now the key to
- **[06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gjoSBllaONE&t=382s)** — this to make sure that this LDL doesn't end up being the wrong type of LDL because there's
- **[06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gjoSBllaONE&t=388s)** — two different kinds is this. As you increase your dietary fat, you also at the same time
- **[06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gjoSBllaONE&t=395s)** — want to reduce your carbohydrates because you never want to consume a high sugar,
- **[06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gjoSBllaONE&t=399s)** — high carb diet with a high fat diet. As long as you keep your carbs low, as in the ketogenic
- **[06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gjoSBllaONE&t=404s)** — diet, you can consume higher amounts of this fat. So butter is number one. You might want to add
- **[06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gjoSBllaONE&t=410s)** — some fatty cheese like brie cheese. I would recommend grass fed. Don't be afraid to add
- **[06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gjoSBllaONE&t=416s)** — cream. Like I get my raw cream every week from a local farm. Egg yolks, another important
- **[07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gjoSBllaONE&t=422s)** — source of cholesterol, seafood, organ meats are all awesome to help support your adrenals.
- **[07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gjoSBllaONE&t=429s)** — And do not do lean proteins. Okay. Don't do low fat anything because more lean the protein is
- **[07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gjoSBllaONE&t=435s)** — like even protein powders, you're going to stimulate more insulin. The fat helps
- **[07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gjoSBllaONE&t=441s)** — buffer the protein on the insulin index because if you keep the insulin down,
- **[07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gjoSBllaONE&t=447s)** — you're going to be protected. Now during this process, it may be helpful to add vitamin D
- **[07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gjoSBllaONE&t=454s)** — as well as purified bile salts to help you digest this fat. I'm not saying go crazy with
- **[07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gjoSBllaONE&t=460s)** — unlimited amounts of fat. I'm just saying that if you are on a low fat diet, I'm talking about
- **[07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gjoSBllaONE&t=465s)** — low animal fats, you need to start increasing it. And if you have a hard time digesting it,
- **[07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gjoSBllaONE&t=471s)** — chances are you probably don't have enough bile salts. Add those to the mix so you can
- **[07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gjoSBllaONE&t=474s)** — digest it. And you might just be very pleasantly surprised that your menopausal symptoms
- **[08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gjoSBllaONE&t=480s)** — magically disappear. Now, if you have not seen my video on the difference between the two
- **[08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gjoSBllaONE&t=487s)** — different LDLs, this is a very important video to watch. And I put that video up right here.
- **[08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gjoSBllaONE&t=492s)** — Check it out.

- **[00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1nAO0s8xU2w&t=0s)** — The number one food to remove fat from your liver. In the past, a fatty liver was mostly
- **[00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1nAO0s8xU2w&t=6s)** — caused by alcohol. But nowadays, it's caused by something different. We're talking about
- **[00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1nAO0s8xU2w&t=11s)** — a problem that can extend beyond the liver. Issues would be like type 2 diabetes, obesity,
- **[00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1nAO0s8xU2w&t=16s)** — high blood pressure. And this leads me to the biggest confusion of this disorder.
- **[00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1nAO0s8xU2w&t=21s)** — The medical profession is very careful not to give you the cause-effect relationship.
- **[00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1nAO0s8xU2w&t=26s)** — Instead, they talk about the risk factors. They list all these things like obesity and diabetes
- **[00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1nAO0s8xU2w&t=31s)** — and high blood pressure. And if you have these, you're at risk for getting this fatty liver issue.
- **[00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1nAO0s8xU2w&t=36s)** — This is why they're even changing the name from non-alcoholic fatty liver disease to something
- **[00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1nAO0s8xU2w&t=41s)** — called MASH. Metabolic dysfunction-associated steatial hepatitis. Now, what does that mean?
- **[00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1nAO0s8xU2w&t=47s)** — That's basically a fatty liver with inflammation. They really kind of keep things disconnected.
- **[00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1nAO0s8xU2w&t=51s)** — I mean, it's obvious to me what's causing it. But for the average person, it's all kind of
- **[00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1nAO0s8xU2w&t=56s)** — general, kind of confusing. So basically, they're going to focus in on the smoke detector
- **[00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1nAO0s8xU2w&t=59s)** — without really looking at the fire behind it. And that way, we can treat each individual risk
- **[01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1nAO0s8xU2w&t=65s)** — factor with a different medication. Now, I want to show you a clip of another way that they
- **[01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1nAO0s8xU2w&t=69s)** — hide the real cause. Check this out. Most of the population has had excess nutrition day
- **[01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1nAO0s8xU2w&t=76s)** — after day after day. And that's what ends up causing damage to the liver and many other
- **[01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1nAO0s8xU2w&t=80s)** — organs. I mean, that just sounds funny as a cause for a fatty liver. You're chronically eating too
- **[01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1nAO0s8xU2w&t=86s)** — much nutrition. I mean, if I just told you right now, you know, you're suffering from chronic
- **[01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1nAO0s8xU2w&t=90s)** — overnutrition, you might kind of ask me, what the heck are you talking about? Overnutrition
- **[01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1nAO0s8xU2w&t=96s)** — is too much sugar, too much starch or refined carbohydrates, or too many seed oils. They're
- **[01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1nAO0s8xU2w&t=101s)** — not nutritious because they don't have any nutrients. You cannot live on those foods
- **[01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1nAO0s8xU2w&t=104s)** — forever without getting sick. I'm talking about the breads, pasta, cereal crackers,
- **[01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1nAO0s8xU2w&t=107s)** — biscuits, waffles, pancakes, especially the industrial sugars, like the high fructose corn
- **[01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1nAO0s8xU2w&t=112s)** — syrup really hammers the liver hardcore. Anytime you eat glucose, all of your cells can
- **[01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1nAO0s8xU2w&t=117s)** — metabolize it, but not fructose. If we look up this disease online, it'll tell you that
- **[02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1nAO0s8xU2w&t=122s)** — rarely are you going to really experience any symptom other than fatigue, sometimes
- **[02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1nAO0s8xU2w&t=127s)** — right upper quadrant discomfort, which by the way, I had for over a decade, cognitive problems,
- **[02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1nAO0s8xU2w&t=133s)** — you're going to notice like your skin is a bit yellow, your feet getting hot or itchy,
- **[02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1nAO0s8xU2w&t=136s)** — you're definitely going to notice a gut. You have just too much fat in your liver that's spilling
- **[02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1nAO0s8xU2w&t=140s)** — off into and around your organs. If you read a little bit lower on the page, when it talks
- **[02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1nAO0s8xU2w&t=145s)** — about the fatty liver, there's something really interesting. In the section of diet, it'll talk
- **[02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1nAO0s8xU2w&t=149s)** — about what potentially causes a fatty liver. And they mention red meat, organ meats, liver,
- **[02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1nAO0s8xU2w&t=156s)** — and eggs causing a fatty liver. If you look up those studies, they are all observational
- **[02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1nAO0s8xU2w&t=163s)** — studies. So in other words, they give you a food questionnaire and they say, remember what you
- **[02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1nAO0s8xU2w&t=167s)** — ate in the last year, and they don't pay attention to these other variables. Like if you're
- **[02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1nAO0s8xU2w&t=171s)** — eating red meat or eggs, did you eat french fries with that? Are you eating sugar with
- **[02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1nAO0s8xU2w&t=176s)** — that? Are you smoking? Are you drinking alcohol with that? They're not really looking at
- **[03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1nAO0s8xU2w&t=180s)** — these other factors. So these observational studies are worthless and you don't want
- **[03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1nAO0s8xU2w&t=185s)** — to use those. It's the worst type of science. And when you want to manipulate things and
- **[03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1nAO0s8xU2w&t=189s)** — have the media put out certain things, you're going to use these observational studies.
- **[03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1nAO0s8xU2w&t=194s)** — I mean, if red meat, liver, and eggs cause this fatty liver epidemic, then why did this
- **[03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1nAO0s8xU2w&t=200s)** — explosion, this epidemic of a fatty liver, occur after we reduced saturated fat? Could
- **[03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1nAO0s8xU2w&t=205s)** — it possibly be because we dramatically increased our refined carbohydrates? There is data to
- **[03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1nAO0s8xU2w&t=212s)** — show that if you go on a low-carb ketogenic diet, you can reduce 50% of the fat off your
- **[03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1nAO0s8xU2w&t=218s)** — liver within a few weeks. The question is, what should you eat? The last one is going to be
- **[03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1nAO0s8xU2w&t=223s)** — the most powerful. Number one, grass-fed red meat. It's not necessarily just beef. It
- **[03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1nAO0s8xU2w&t=229s)** — could be lamb as well. What's so special about that? It helps to restore your insulin
- **[03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1nAO0s8xU2w&t=233s)** — problems and your blood sugar. It has high quality protein. It has zinc. It has copper.
- **[03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1nAO0s8xU2w&t=238s)** — Po-enzyme Q10. All of these nutrients are super healing for the liver. Number two,
- **[04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1nAO0s8xU2w&t=243s)** — eggs. Because out of all the nutrients that help protect you against the fatty liver,
- **[04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1nAO0s8xU2w&t=247s)** — that nutrient is choline. And guess what? Egg yolks are very high in choline. Egg yolks are
- **[04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1nAO0s8xU2w&t=254s)** — zero carbohydrate. Anything that is zero carb is going to help reverse a fatty liver. Number
- **[04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1nAO0s8xU2w&t=260s)** — three, cruciferous vegetables. Especially if it's fermented in the form of sauerkraut. That
- **[04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1nAO0s8xU2w&t=266s)** — will help support the liver going through its detoxification. The fermentation part of the
- **[04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1nAO0s8xU2w&t=271s)** — cabbage really will help in removing the fat from the liver. The other cruciferous vegetable
- **[04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1nAO0s8xU2w&t=275s)** — I consume a lot of is arugula. It's slightly bitter. I put my extra virgin olive oil on there.
- **[04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1nAO0s8xU2w&t=280s)** — And I also sprinkle some nutritional yeast on there. Makes a great salad. Plus when your
- **[04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1nAO0s8xU2w&t=285s)** — microbiome eats some of this fiber, it gives you all sorts of additional cool things that will
- **[04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1nAO0s8xU2w&t=290s)** — help your blood sugar as well. Next food on the list is wild caught salmon or other wild
- **[04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1nAO0s8xU2w&t=295s)** — caught fatty fish that have not only a lot of nutrition and protein, but they're very high
- **[05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1nAO0s8xU2w&t=300s)** — omega-3 fatty acids. And what these omega-3 fatty acids do to the liver is help reduce inflammation.
- **[05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1nAO0s8xU2w&t=307s)** — Omega-3 fatty acid is really beneficial to help the liver in many different ways. And
- **[05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1nAO0s8xU2w&t=313s)** — cod liver and cod liver oil. You talk about taking your omega-3s to the next level. You
- **[05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1nAO0s8xU2w&t=318s)** — just get a lot more. Next one is broccoli sprouts. What's so special about broccoli sprouts?
- **[05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1nAO0s8xU2w&t=323s)** — Well, you're dealing with a cruciferous vegetable which has sulforaphane, which does a
- **[05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1nAO0s8xU2w&t=328s)** — lot. It's anti-cancer, but it's very good to detoxify the liver and decrease A1C, which will
- **[05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1nAO0s8xU2w&t=334s)** — help your blood sugar. I would take the broccoli sprouts and put them on your arugula salad.
- **[05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1nAO0s8xU2w&t=339s)** — Let's get to the best food that you can eat for your liver. And this is going to be very
- **[05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1nAO0s8xU2w&t=344s)** — surprising because it's the exact thing that they tell you not to eat for a fatty liver.
- **[05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1nAO0s8xU2w&t=350s)** — Grass-fed liver. Beef liver or lamb liver has the most choline. We get this low carb,
- **[05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1nAO0s8xU2w&t=356s)** — high choline, high nutrient dense with most of the trace minerals like zinc, selenium. These
- **[06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1nAO0s8xU2w&t=362s)** — are all really important in reducing fat and inflammation off the liver. Now, of course,
- **[06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1nAO0s8xU2w&t=367s)** — if we cook that liver with the onions, garlic, with our arugula salad, with broccoli sprouts,
- **[06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1nAO0s8xU2w&t=373s)** — maybe with a little sauerkraut, with egg on top of that, now you have the best meal
- **[06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1nAO0s8xU2w&t=377s)** — for your liver. Thanks so much for watching. I will see you in the next video.

- **[00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_D6lMQz8wTw&t=0s)** — So today I'm going to show you a remedy that can very quickly get rid of the cravings to not just alcohol but sugar as well.
- **[00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_D6lMQz8wTw&t=10s)** — So when someone craves alcohol, what is it that they're looking for?
- **[00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_D6lMQz8wTw&t=14s)** — Well, it has something to do with reducing stress, anxiety, pressure in the body, right?
- **[00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_D6lMQz8wTw&t=21s)** — It gives them this sense of relief. Same thing with sugar. Sugar makes people feel better, right?
- **[00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_D6lMQz8wTw&t=26s)** — But it comes with a little bit of a package, which I'm not going to get into in this video.
- **[00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_D6lMQz8wTw&t=30s)** — But I'm going to tell you one simple thing that you can take to very quickly get rid of the cravings,
- **[00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_D6lMQz8wTw&t=38s)** — especially if you're in the situation where you're basically addicted.
- **[00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_D6lMQz8wTw&t=40s)** — And that substance is something called L-glutamine, okay?
- **[00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_D6lMQz8wTw&t=45s)** — But it's very important to understand why L-glutamine will work for this problem.
- **[00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_D6lMQz8wTw&t=49s)** — Now, glutamine is the most abundant amino acid in your entire body, okay?
- **[00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_D6lMQz8wTw&t=57s)** — And glutamine turns into glutamate, which is the most abundant neurotransmitter in your brain.
- **[01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_D6lMQz8wTw&t=65s)** — When we think about neurotransmitters, you probably think about serotonin, dopamine,
- **[01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_D6lMQz8wTw&t=69s)** — things like that. People don't think of glutamate as a neurotransmitter, but it is.
- **[01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_D6lMQz8wTw&t=74s)** — It's the most abundant neurotransmitter in your brain. And without getting in too deep
- **[01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_D6lMQz8wTw&t=78s)** — into the woods, glutamate is an excitatory neurotransmitter, okay?
- **[01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_D6lMQz8wTw&t=83s)** — Others are inhibitory. And there is a problem when you have too much glutamate.
- **[01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_D6lMQz8wTw&t=88s)** — It can create kind of a toxic effect, actually giving you anxiety, depression,
- **[01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_D6lMQz8wTw&t=94s)** — insomnia, things like that. But the way that it really works in the brain,
- **[01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_D6lMQz8wTw&t=97s)** — there's a whole system going on. And so the glutamate actually helps support
- **[01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_D6lMQz8wTw&t=102s)** — an inhibitory neurotransmitter called GABA, which is like the brakes.
- **[01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_D6lMQz8wTw&t=106s)** — So when your body is in a healthy state, you have this nice balance of the accelerator
- **[01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_D6lMQz8wTw&t=111s)** — and the brakes. So you really don't have to worry about it. But the amino acid L-glutamine
- **[01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_D6lMQz8wTw&t=116s)** — actually increases gluconeogenesis. That's the production of new sugar.
- **[02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_D6lMQz8wTw&t=122s)** — So that amino acid actually can very easily and quickly turn into glucose and feed your
- **[02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_D6lMQz8wTw&t=130s)** — brain cells and make them happy without the side effects of like sugar. Your insulin will
- **[02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_D6lMQz8wTw&t=136s)** — not spike because it's coming through a different pathway. It's coming from an amino acid,
- **[02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_D6lMQz8wTw&t=141s)** — not a stray glucose. So it's a quick way to supply energy to the brain without all the
- **[02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_D6lMQz8wTw&t=148s)** — bad stuff, satisfying the lack of fuel, changing your mood very quickly, reducing stress,
- **[02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_D6lMQz8wTw&t=156s)** — pressure, anxiety, and decreasing the need for alcohol or sugar. But glutamate does a lot more
- **[02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_D6lMQz8wTw&t=163s)** — than just what I mentioned. It also is the precursor for glutathione, which is the main
- **[02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_D6lMQz8wTw&t=170s)** — antioxidant in your liver. It supports the cells of your intestines, helping prevent leaky gut.
- **[02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_D6lMQz8wTw&t=178s)** — It is a very essential precursor to help heal the body when you're going through an infection,
- **[03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_D6lMQz8wTw&t=185s)** — recovery, surgery, trauma, or stress. You need more glutamine in your body. Now what causes
- **[03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_D6lMQz8wTw&t=192s)** — deficiency is alcohol. So alcohol blocks this glutamine, okay, and all the good effects that
- **[03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_D6lMQz8wTw&t=199s)** — come with it. You can imagine if you're drinking on a regular basis over a period of time,
- **[03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_D6lMQz8wTw&t=203s)** — you're just depleting your glutamine and glutamate and setting yourself up for all sorts
- **[03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_D6lMQz8wTw&t=208s)** — of problems down the road. Now the other thing that causes a major deficiency of glutamine
- **[03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_D6lMQz8wTw&t=214s)** — is chronic stress. When you're under chronic stress, you actually get an increase
- **[03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_D6lMQz8wTw&t=221s)** — of glutamate in a part of your brain called the hippocampus, creating all sorts of problems with
- **[03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_D6lMQz8wTw&t=226s)** — memory and learning. But in the frontal cortex, we have a decrease of glutamate,
- **[03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_D6lMQz8wTw&t=234s)** — and that's going to affect your attention. You'll probably develop attention deficit
- **[03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_D6lMQz8wTw&t=238s)** — problems. In another part of your brain, it's called the amygdala, which is very similar to
- **[04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_D6lMQz8wTw&t=244s)** — your adrenal gland because it's everything to do with stress and stress responses, but it's
- **[04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_D6lMQz8wTw&t=250s)** — your brain. You have a decrease of glutamate from chronic stress in the amygdala, giving you the
- **[04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_D6lMQz8wTw&t=256s)** — sensation of anxiety. Another thing that can cause a deficiency of glutamine is over training,
- **[04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_D6lMQz8wTw&t=263s)** — like an exercising too much without letting yourself recover, having trauma, any trauma,
- **[04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_D6lMQz8wTw&t=267s)** — surgery, injury, things like that, a chronic infection. And let's say you're just not
- **[04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_D6lMQz8wTw&t=273s)** — consuming enough glutamine in your diet. Now what foods are high in glutamine? Well,
- **[04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_D6lMQz8wTw&t=278s)** — you have beef, chicken, fish, eggs, dairy. Okay. You also have cabbage, dark leafy green
- **[04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_D6lMQz8wTw&t=286s)** — vegetables, kale, spinach, parsley. If you want to get rid of the cravings for alcohol and
- **[04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_D6lMQz8wTw&t=292s)** — sugar, okay. Of course, I'm assuming you've already tried the ketogenic diet and intermittent
- **[04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_D6lMQz8wTw&t=297s)** — fasting, which will ultimately correct it, but you might need something to handle the cravings
- **[05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_D6lMQz8wTw&t=302s)** — quickly so you can actually do the ketogenic plan. And so I recommend taking between two
- **[05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_D6lMQz8wTw&t=308s)** — five grams per day. So by taking this in a supplement form, making sure you're eating
- **[05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_D6lMQz8wTw&t=314s)** — the foods high in glutamine, which basically is a ketogenic diet, you can really start to pull
- **[05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_D6lMQz8wTw&t=319s)** — yourself out of this situation. There are other things that can also help this whole glutamate
- **[05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_D6lMQz8wTw&t=324s)** — cycle. Regular exercise without over training, getting enough sleep and doing whatever you can
- **[05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_D6lMQz8wTw&t=330s)** — to reduce stress will greatly help. And the less alcohol you drink, the less deficiency
- **[05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_D6lMQz8wTw&t=337s)** — you'll have. Now to ultimately fully correct this problem, you need to be on the healthy version
- **[05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_D6lMQz8wTw&t=343s)** — of the ketogenic diet with intermittent fasting. And for that information, check this video out

- **[00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y2tAmoIp9d4&t=0s)** — Hello, Dr. Berg here again. Today we're going to talk about the biggest mistake that I made with my breakfast that nearly killed me.
- **[00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y2tAmoIp9d4&t=8s)** — There's a handful of mistakes to talk about. Then I'm going to get to the biggest one. Let's start with number one.
- **[00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y2tAmoIp9d4&t=13s)** — The type of coffee that you drink. Of course, in college, I drank way too much coffee.
- **[00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y2tAmoIp9d4&t=17s)** — But it's not necessarily the coffee that's the problem. It's the type of coffee that you're drinking.
- **[00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y2tAmoIp9d4&t=22s)** — I'm not sure if you're aware of this or not, but coffee beans are one of the most sprayed crops behind cotton and tobacco.
- **[00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y2tAmoIp9d4&t=29s)** — You're literally drinking a super concentrated soup of a lot of pesticides.
- **[00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y2tAmoIp9d4&t=34s)** — Out of all the things that you're exposed to, it's the single greatest source of concentrated toxins that you expose yourself on a daily basis.
- **[00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y2tAmoIp9d4&t=42s)** — Then on top of that, if you're adding sugar to your coffee, or if you add the non-dairy creamers with all the seed oils and chemicals,
- **[00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y2tAmoIp9d4&t=50s)** — or maybe even flavored coffees, that would be even worse.
- **[00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y2tAmoIp9d4&t=53s)** — The simple solution is just to use organic coffee beans.
- **[00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y2tAmoIp9d4&t=56s)** — Number two. Orange juice. If you think orange juice is healthy, what you don't know is that you're basically just drinking sugar water.
- **[01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y2tAmoIp9d4&t=64s)** — Because most, if not all, orange juice is pasteurized. And when they heat this orange juice, they kill off and destroy the vitamin C.
- **[01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y2tAmoIp9d4&t=72s)** — You're not really getting nutrition. You're getting a lot of concentrated sugar.
- **[01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y2tAmoIp9d4&t=75s)** — One small cup of orange juice is equivalent to a soda.
- **[01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y2tAmoIp9d4&t=79s)** — Also, your liver is going to be affected from the fructose.
- **[01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y2tAmoIp9d4&t=82s)** — What's going to happen is you're going to be spiking your blood sugar and it's going to come down in about an hour and a half.
- **[01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y2tAmoIp9d4&t=88s)** — And now you're going to be wanting something sweet.
- **[01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y2tAmoIp9d4&t=90s)** — Personally, I'm not thirsty in the morning, so I don't drink anything. But you can do tea, coffee, water with lemon.
- **[01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y2tAmoIp9d4&t=96s)** — But I wouldn't do the juice.
- **[01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y2tAmoIp9d4&t=98s)** — Number three. My breakfast used to be very carb heavy.
- **[01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y2tAmoIp9d4&t=103s)** — Cereals, granola bars, blueberry muffins, pancakes and waffles, and definitely toast.
- **[01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y2tAmoIp9d4&t=108s)** — Of course, the cereals are the worst because they have so many hidden sugars in their camouflage with the healthy whole grains, which is totally BS.
- **[01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y2tAmoIp9d4&t=118s)** — After the breakfast, spike in sugar, I end up with low sugar because insulin is coming in there and pushing it down.
- **[02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y2tAmoIp9d4&t=124s)** — And now my brain doesn't have any energy.
- **[02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y2tAmoIp9d4&t=127s)** — This is what happened for years and years and years.
- **[02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y2tAmoIp9d4&t=130s)** — I couldn't wake up in the morning.
- **[02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y2tAmoIp9d4&t=132s)** — This so-called fuel is not really fueling our brains.
- **[02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y2tAmoIp9d4&t=136s)** — It's literally starving our brains the more we consume it.
- **[02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y2tAmoIp9d4&t=138s)** — That time I really bought into the whole grain cereals.
- **[02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y2tAmoIp9d4&t=142s)** — And of course, you need to get rid of all that fat from the bacon.
- **[02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y2tAmoIp9d4&t=145s)** — I would literally take paper towels and I would push out or dampen the oil or the fat from the bacon.
- **[02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y2tAmoIp9d4&t=152s)** — That was my way of being healthy.
- **[02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y2tAmoIp9d4&t=155s)** — How many kids are just grouchy and irritable and they can't just be calm because their blood sugar is so up and down.
- **[02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y2tAmoIp9d4&t=162s)** — And instead of fixing the diet, they put them on psych drugs.
- **[02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y2tAmoIp9d4&t=166s)** — Crazy. What I'm going to tell you is a very simple fix.
- **[02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y2tAmoIp9d4&t=169s)** — It's so simple and so powerful.
- **[02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y2tAmoIp9d4&t=172s)** — All you have to do is switch to a protein breakfast.
- **[02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y2tAmoIp9d4&t=175s)** — That's it. And watch how fast your body improves.
- **[02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y2tAmoIp9d4&t=179s)** — Simply consume eggs and bacon.
- **[03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y2tAmoIp9d4&t=182s)** — I would do four eggs in the morning and some bacon.
- **[03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y2tAmoIp9d4&t=185s)** — You can also do cheese. That works.
- **[03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y2tAmoIp9d4&t=187s)** — You can also do yogurt, but I would do the whole fat yogurt without any added sugar.
- **[03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y2tAmoIp9d4&t=192s)** — It's not the best source of protein, but it's definitely better than the sweetened yogurt.
- **[03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y2tAmoIp9d4&t=195s)** — A steak would work really good.
- **[03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y2tAmoIp9d4&t=197s)** — I also have done the burger patties, buffalo burgers, beef patties.
- **[03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y2tAmoIp9d4&t=202s)** — Oh my gosh, that works really good too.
- **[03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y2tAmoIp9d4&t=203s)** — Another mistake that I made with breakfast food is consuming just fruit and maybe sometimes nuts.
- **[03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y2tAmoIp9d4&t=211s)** — Like I would take an apple and put peanut butter or a handful of nuts with fruit, maybe banana.
- **[03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y2tAmoIp9d4&t=217s)** — So mid-morning I would need to eat again because bananas and apples are very high in sugar.
- **[03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y2tAmoIp9d4&t=224s)** — On top of that, I would always need a snack mid-afternoon.
- **[03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y2tAmoIp9d4&t=228s)** — That was also a mistake because it raised the blood glucose and it kept the insulin spiking through the day.
- **[03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y2tAmoIp9d4&t=234s)** — A step up from that would be a protein snack if you had the choice.
- **[03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y2tAmoIp9d4&t=239s)** — You can do cheese. You can do a little bit of meat like charcuterie.
- **[04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y2tAmoIp9d4&t=243s)** — You'd never want a snack with carbohydrates.
- **[04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y2tAmoIp9d4&t=246s)** — Next mistake that I was making is I was using a lot of peanut butter and I never read the label
- **[04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y2tAmoIp9d4&t=252s)** — because on the label they added hydrogenated oils as well as added sugar and sometimes hyper-dose corn syrup.
- **[04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y2tAmoIp9d4&t=260s)** — This relates to the next mistake. When I would cook or fry potatoes in the pan for breakfast,
- **[04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y2tAmoIp9d4&t=266s)** — I would always use corn oil. It's highly processed, but it's healthy, right? Because it says it on the label.
- **[04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y2tAmoIp9d4&t=274s)** — You want to cook in butter or olive oil or coconut oil or lard. You don't want to cook in seed oils.
- **[04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y2tAmoIp9d4&t=282s)** — Next mistake I made was my meats had sugar and starches in them.
- **[04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y2tAmoIp9d4&t=287s)** — Breakfast sausage, right? If you ever read the ingredients of that, they put modified food starch in there.
- **[04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y2tAmoIp9d4&t=292s)** — There's sugar in there. There's wheat flour in there. There's very little meat in there.
- **[04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y2tAmoIp9d4&t=296s)** — Of course, my bacon always had sugar in it.
- **[04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y2tAmoIp9d4&t=299s)** — The next mistake and I have a lot of videos on this, which I probably should take down.
- **[05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y2tAmoIp9d4&t=305s)** — They're older videos. I was really pushing kale shakes with fruit.
- **[05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y2tAmoIp9d4&t=310s)** — I would sometimes recommend spinach instead of kale, which is just loaded with oxalates, right?
- **[05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y2tAmoIp9d4&t=316s)** — Then you're going to have fruit in there. You're going to blend this up.
- **[05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y2tAmoIp9d4&t=318s)** — The mistake that I made back then was not adding high quality protein, especially for breakfast.
- **[05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y2tAmoIp9d4&t=324s)** — But now let's get into my biggest mistake that caused more destruction than anything else combined.
- **[05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y2tAmoIp9d4&t=334s)** — Eating when I wasn't hungry.
- **[05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y2tAmoIp9d4&t=336s)** — It was thinking that breakfast was the most important meal of the day.
- **[05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y2tAmoIp9d4&t=341s)** — That actually is not true information.
- **[05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y2tAmoIp9d4&t=343s)** — Here you are. You go to bed all night long. You're not eating. You're fasting.
- **[05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y2tAmoIp9d4&t=347s)** — In the morning, then you screw it up by eating. You're not really hungry in the morning.
- **[05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y2tAmoIp9d4&t=352s)** — Most people are not hungry unless they've eaten something sweet the day before.
- **[05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y2tAmoIp9d4&t=356s)** — There's so many wonderful magical things that happen in your body when you fast for a longer period of time.
- **[06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y2tAmoIp9d4&t=362s)** — So let's say, for example, last night, the last meal was at six and you can push through and not have breakfast
- **[06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y2tAmoIp9d4&t=369s)** — and skip the breakfast and go all the way to lunch.
- **[06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y2tAmoIp9d4&t=371s)** — Now you have a good 18 hours of fasting.
- **[06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y2tAmoIp9d4&t=375s)** — You're able to burn your own fat to lose more weight.
- **[06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y2tAmoIp9d4&t=378s)** — You get to run on not just your own fat, but the ketones that are a by-product of fat and your brain loves them.
- **[06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y2tAmoIp9d4&t=385s)** — You get to reverse insulin resistance all the years of eating carbohydrates.
- **[06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y2tAmoIp9d4&t=390s)** — Your mood goes up. Appetite goes away.
- **[06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y2tAmoIp9d4&t=393s)** — Mostly from skipping breakfast. When I was 28, I was eating all the wrong things.
- **[06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y2tAmoIp9d4&t=397s)** — I had arthritis. I had brain fog. I was a pre-diabetic. I started gaining weight.
- **[06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y2tAmoIp9d4&t=403s)** — But other than that, I was doing pretty good overall. And I'm just being sarcastic.
- **[06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y2tAmoIp9d4&t=408s)** — To get more information on what that's called, it's called intermittent fasting.
- **[06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y2tAmoIp9d4&t=412s)** — I created a very detailed video for you, a guide that you can learn from all the details.
- **[06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y2tAmoIp9d4&t=418s)** — And I put it right here. Check it out right now.

*Click any timestamp to jump to that moment in the video*

- **[00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEiybCei-ls&t=0s)** — Now I have a very simple, inexpensive tip for you that I think can not only help you with your hair,
- **[00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEiybCei-ls&t=7s)** — your nails, and having useful skin, but a lot more. In fact, you may find that this natural remedy
- **[00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEiybCei-ls&t=14s)** — solves many of the problems that you have right now. And this all wraps around this one topic of
- **[00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEiybCei-ls&t=19s)** — collagen. What is collagen? It's your connective tissue, tendons, ligaments, cartilage. One third
- **[00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEiybCei-ls&t=26s)** — of all of your collagen is made by one amino acid, glycine. And glycine is not an essential
- **[00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEiybCei-ls&t=33s)** — amino acid, which means that our bodies can make it. But here's the thing, our bodies really
- **[00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEiybCei-ls&t=39s)** — don't make enough glycine. And if you're not getting it from the diet, chances are you're
- **[00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEiybCei-ls&t=45s)** — going to be deficient. Because normal proteins, red meat, or chicken, or fish, or even eggs,
- **[00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEiybCei-ls&t=52s)** — or even dairy, are not very high in glycine. You'd have to be eating the skin on the chicken
- **[00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEiybCei-ls&t=58s)** — and the cartilage, like on the chicken bones, or organ meats. And a lot of people do not do that.
- **[01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEiybCei-ls&t=64s)** — So we can be consuming a lot of protein, but not getting this one amino acid that could
- **[01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEiybCei-ls&t=68s)** — lead to all sorts of issues. Check this out. Glycine is needed to make the most important
- **[01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEiybCei-ls&t=76s)** — of all your cells. That's called glutathione. If you don't have glycine, you can't make
- **[01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEiybCei-ls&t=82s)** — glutathione, which means you can't detoxify. Which means that you're going to have a buildup
- **[01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEiybCei-ls&t=86s)** — of toxicity, which relates to inflammation. This is one of the reasons why glycine is
- **[01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEiybCei-ls&t=93s)** — very anti-inflammatory. So glycine is very, very important for your liver. Glycine is also
- **[01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEiybCei-ls&t=98s)** — used to help with a leaky gut because it helps prevent inflammation in your gut, which I've
- **[01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEiybCei-ls&t=105s)** — talked about this extensively in many different videos, as the gut inflammatory conditions
- **[01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEiybCei-ls&t=111s)** — are the start of autoimmune diseases. Glycine is also used in a lot of enzymes
- **[01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEiybCei-ls&t=117s)** — in different proteins. One being called catalase, which helps you get rid of hydrogen
- **[02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEiybCei-ls&t=123s)** — peroxide in the body, which also could explain why someone could have premature
- **[02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEiybCei-ls&t=127s)** — graying of the hair, because the hydrogen peroxide is just bleaching out the pigment
- **[02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEiybCei-ls&t=131s)** — in the hair. Glycine is essential to make the heme in your blood. So if you don't have
- **[02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEiybCei-ls&t=136s)** — glycine, you can't make blood. And even your gums around the teeth need glycine. Glycine
- **[02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEiybCei-ls&t=140s)** — is so foundational, you need it for your DNA as well. If you're deficient in glycine,
- **[02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEiybCei-ls&t=144s)** — you might not be able to achieve the deep delta wave sleep that you need to feel regenerated.
- **[02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEiybCei-ls&t=149s)** — Also, I found that glycine is very important in helping people detoxify uric acid. And so
- **[02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEiybCei-ls&t=157s)** — it's even used as a treatment for gout, because glycine competes with uric acid. And glycine is
- **[02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEiybCei-ls&t=164s)** — also good to make your insulin more sensitive. So it's really good for blood sugars and can
- **[02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEiybCei-ls&t=169s)** — help you with a lot of different things. Weight loss, fatty liver, visceral fat. In fact,
- **[02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEiybCei-ls&t=174s)** — the Greek word for glycine means sweet. It can actually even be turned into glucose as fuel.
- **[03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEiybCei-ls&t=180s)** — You see, certain parts of the body, especially the brain, need a certain level of glucose.
- **[03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEiybCei-ls&t=185s)** — But if you're not consuming sugar, your body will make it. Well, guess what? Glycine can be a
- **[03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEiybCei-ls&t=192s)** — precursor for that sugar. And I think some people might be concerned too, if that's going
- **[03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEiybCei-ls&t=195s)** — to bump me out of ketosis. If I take glycine, it's going to increase my sugar. But at the
- **[03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEiybCei-ls&t=200s)** — same time, look at the benefits. It actually helps stabilize your blood sugar, as well as
- **[03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEiybCei-ls&t=205s)** — maybe a little bit more insulin spike. But it's going to make insulin more sensitive. So it's
- **[03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEiybCei-ls&t=210s)** — more corrective on insulin versus regular sugar that doesn't improve your blood sugars.
- **[03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEiybCei-ls&t=217s)** — But there's something else that's interesting when you consume glycine. It stimulates the
- **[03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEiybCei-ls&t=221s)** — opposing hormone to insulin, which is called glucagon. Glucagon does the opposite of insulin.
- **[03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEiybCei-ls&t=228s)** — And this is why when you're consuming amino acids, protein, you don't really have to be
- **[03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEiybCei-ls&t=235s)** — concerned about the blood sugar spike. But it also at the same time, stimulates the opposing
- **[04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEiybCei-ls&t=242s)** — hormone to keep things in check. And if something could make insulin more sensitive, it's not
- **[04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEiybCei-ls&t=246s)** — going to worsen the insulin resistance situation. It's going to help it. And I also read a
- **[04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEiybCei-ls&t=250s)** — study, which I'm going to put all the stuff down below, on how glycine could even interfere
- **[04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEiybCei-ls&t=256s)** — with the binding of oxalates to calcium crystallization to prevent kidney stones. So
- **[04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEiybCei-ls&t=264s)** — here's how someone's deficient. First of all, the diet, if you're not consuming nose to tail,
- **[04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEiybCei-ls&t=270s)** — if you're not eating all the things with collagen, then chances are you could be
- **[04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEiybCei-ls&t=275s)** — deficient because our bodies don't make enough. There's a massive demand for glycine if you're
- **[04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEiybCei-ls&t=281s)** — under stress, if you're taking medications, if you're drinking alcohol, if you're exposed to
- **[04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEiybCei-ls&t=286s)** — toxins, if your liver is working overtime to get rid of poisons for some reason.
- **[04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEiybCei-ls&t=292s)** — Just so happens that one third of collagen is glycine. And a real simple way to get collagen is
- **[05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEiybCei-ls&t=300s)** — gelatin Knox blocks. You can buy it in these packets. You can get it on Amazon. You can look
- **[05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEiybCei-ls&t=304s)** — it up, pull a little stevia in it and consume that on a regular basis to get your glycine.
- **[05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEiybCei-ls&t=310s)** — I think that's a really easy way to get your glycine. Now you can also get a supplement
- **[05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEiybCei-ls&t=315s)** — with glycine. And if you do, the amounts that an average person need would range anywhere
- **[05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEiybCei-ls&t=320s)** — between four grams to 10 grams a day. Here's some other ways you can get collagen. You can do
- **[05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEiybCei-ls&t=329s)** — bone broth. The problem with bone broth, you'd have to have a lot of it to get enough glycine,
- **[05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEiybCei-ls&t=334s)** — but that's a possibility. Another way to do it is to have chicken soup and you take the whole
- **[05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEiybCei-ls&t=339s)** — chicken, put it in the crock pot and just cook it all day long and see if all this
- **[05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEiybCei-ls&t=344s)** — great collagen, which is very high in glycine, you can even do like pork rinds, right? Just
- **[05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEiybCei-ls&t=349s)** — make sure it doesn't have added MSG or other chemicals. You'd have to have a good amount of
- **[05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEiybCei-ls&t=354s)** — it, but it can contribute to your glycine. So in different countries, they do it differently.
- **[05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEiybCei-ls&t=358s)** — They might in certain countries use, just cook the entire fish with the head and everything
- **[06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEiybCei-ls&t=364s)** — to make their broth. Certain people have recipes for chicken feed or they cook their
- **[06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEiybCei-ls&t=370s)** — bone down in some broth. So there's many different ways to get collagen. You may have
- **[06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEiybCei-ls&t=375s)** — term hydrolyzed collagen, right? What does hydrolyze mean? It basically means you're breaking
- **[06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEiybCei-ls&t=381s)** — down the protein into smaller chains. Okay. They're called peptide chains. So it's just an
- **[06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEiybCei-ls&t=386s)** — easier way to get your collagen because it's already broken down. And also beyond Knox
- **[06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEiybCei-ls&t=390s)** — blocks, gelatin. There's another great product called Great Lakes beef gelatin. If you do
- **[06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEiybCei-ls&t=395s)** — take glycine, okay, do you have to be concerned about taking too much of it? Yes,
- **[06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEiybCei-ls&t=401s)** — but you would have to have something like 600 grams. Okay. 600 grams. We're only talking
- **[06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEiybCei-ls&t=407s)** — about between four and 10 grams a day. If possible, I would recommend taking the glycine
- **[06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEiybCei-ls&t=413s)** — with food, not an empty stomach. But here's the thing as we age, the need for glycine goes
- **[06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEiybCei-ls&t=418s)** — up. This could potentially help people with osteoarthritis, osteoporosis, thinning of the
- **[07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEiybCei-ls&t=428s)** — insomnia, gout, or even kidney stones. Now I did another video on this topic related to hair
- **[07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEiybCei-ls&t=434s)** — loss. If you haven't seen that one, you should check it out. A lot of people watched it. They
- **[07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEiybCei-ls&t=439s)** — loved it. I put it up right here.

- **[00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmzPV2x7Dcg&t=0s)** — You know, prolonged fasting is so beneficial for your immune system, for getting rid of cancer,
- **[00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmzPV2x7Dcg&t=7s)** — for brain health, for anti-aging. But there's one aspect of prolonged fasting that is
- **[00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmzPV2x7Dcg&t=15s)** — fairly dangerous. Okay, you could potentially die, and I need to make you aware of this.
- **[00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmzPV2x7Dcg&t=19s)** — So it's called re-feeding syndrome. What is that? That's a situation where at the end of
- **[00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmzPV2x7Dcg&t=25s)** — let's say you fasted for four days, you eat too much, too fast, and the wrong foods. Okay,
- **[00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmzPV2x7Dcg&t=31s)** — that could be the problem. But before I get into this, I do want to point out something.
- **[00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmzPV2x7Dcg&t=36s)** — This usually involves someone who has malnutrition, someone who maybe has an
- **[00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmzPV2x7Dcg&t=43s)** — eating disorder, someone who is an alcoholic, someone who maybe has been a diabetic type 1 for
- **[00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmzPV2x7Dcg&t=48s)** — a long period of time, or someone who has been starving, okay, which is different than a prolonged
- **[00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmzPV2x7Dcg&t=54s)** — fast. But if you are following my recommendations, the risks of you having this problem are very,
- **[00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmzPV2x7Dcg&t=59s)** — very low because you're not going into this having malnutrition. I always recommend when
- **[01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmzPV2x7Dcg&t=64s)** — you do fasting, any type of fasting, that you at least, as a bare minimum, take electrolytes,
- **[01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmzPV2x7Dcg&t=72s)** — and number two, B vitamins. Because a lot of studies indicate people who have this syndrome
- **[01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmzPV2x7Dcg&t=78s)** — usually have really poor nutritional reserves. But I don't know your situation. I don't know
- **[01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmzPV2x7Dcg&t=86s)** — how your diet has been in the past. I don't know what you're taking. So this video is
- **[01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmzPV2x7Dcg&t=91s)** — very, very important for everyone who is prolonged fasting. Other than dying, you could
- **[01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmzPV2x7Dcg&t=96s)** — potentially get a coma, seizures, convulsions. But again, these things are rare. So here's
- **[01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmzPV2x7Dcg&t=101s)** — what happens in this situation. You go into a long-term fast, let's say it's three, four,
- **[01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmzPV2x7Dcg&t=106s)** — five days or longer. Now, typically, if you check the blood, the person's going to be fine.
- **[01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmzPV2x7Dcg&t=112s)** — They're not going to have any deficiencies of minerals, electrolytes, or any of these things.
- **[01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmzPV2x7Dcg&t=117s)** — Right? But you have to realize that the great, great majority of certain minerals, like
- **[02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmzPV2x7Dcg&t=123s)** — potassium, magnesium, phosphorus, are inside the cell, not in the blood. So like 95 to
- **[02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmzPV2x7Dcg&t=132s)** — 98% of those minerals are inside the cell. So as you're doing fasting, okay, the body's
- **[02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmzPV2x7Dcg&t=140s)** — going to be releasing all these minerals or electrolytes from the cell into the blood to
- **[02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmzPV2x7Dcg&t=146s)** — keep them at a certain level. That's your body's stable kind of reference point. Always keep
- **[02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmzPV2x7Dcg&t=152s)** — the blood normal, despite pulling nutrients from the cells, from your bone, from your muscles.
- **[02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmzPV2x7Dcg&t=159s)** — So when you get a blood test for these electrolytes or nutrients, you're not actually
- **[02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmzPV2x7Dcg&t=165s)** — testing the inside of your cells, the intracellular. You're checking the
- **[02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmzPV2x7Dcg&t=170s)** — extracellular nutrients, right, in your blood. So you're not going to really know what's
- **[02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmzPV2x7Dcg&t=174s)** — happening inside the cell unless you do an intracellular test. But if you're fasting
- **[03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmzPV2x7Dcg&t=180s)** — for any period of time, a lot of these nutrients don't get stored for a long period
- **[03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmzPV2x7Dcg&t=184s)** — of time. A lot of them aren't fat soluble, okay, they're water soluble. So you may find
- **[03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmzPV2x7Dcg&t=189s)** — in a period of time they can go down pretty fast, especially if when you eat your diet has
- **[03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmzPV2x7Dcg&t=195s)** — been poor in the past or you don't focus on getting nutrient dense foods. Then you decide,
- **[03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmzPV2x7Dcg&t=201s)** — you know what, I hear all these great things about doing a prolonged fast. I'm going to do
- **[03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmzPV2x7Dcg&t=204s)** — a four or five day fast. You do the fast, you don't take your electrolytes, you don't
- **[03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmzPV2x7Dcg&t=208s)** — take your B vitamins. And then it's time to eat, okay. And you just pig out, you start eating
- **[03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmzPV2x7Dcg&t=215s)** — all sorts of things and lots of things like carbohydrates, sugar, whatever. At this point,
- **[03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmzPV2x7Dcg&t=221s)** — you can develop what's called the refeeding syndrome. And what is happening is you're
- **[03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmzPV2x7Dcg&t=227s)** — very quickly raising insulin, not to mention being on that four or five day fast,
- **[03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmzPV2x7Dcg&t=233s)** — your insulin sensitivity has become extremely sensitive. Those receptors are ready to pull in
- **[04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmzPV2x7Dcg&t=242s)** — these nutrients from your blood very quickly. And what happens is you have this rapid shift
- **[04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmzPV2x7Dcg&t=248s)** — of electrolytes, specifically phosphorus. That's the big one, potassium and magnesium,
- **[04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmzPV2x7Dcg&t=254s)** — sometimes calcium, okay. And all of this shifts from the blood to the inside of your
- **[04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmzPV2x7Dcg&t=260s)** — cell to replace what's missing. And you end up with extremely low electrolytes in the blood.
- **[04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmzPV2x7Dcg&t=267s)** — And this is what puts the stress on the heart, okay. And this is what also can increase
- **[04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmzPV2x7Dcg&t=272s)** — edema and swelling because you have this imbalance. You see, when you're fasting,
- **[04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmzPV2x7Dcg&t=277s)** — you have very low insulin, because when you have low insulin, you actually get rid of
- **[04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmzPV2x7Dcg&t=282s)** — a lot of fluid and sodium. And with some people, it could be 11, 20 pounds,
- **[04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmzPV2x7Dcg&t=289s)** — 30 pounds of fluid, okay. That's a lot. But when you start eating, okay, and your insulin starts
- **[04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmzPV2x7Dcg&t=295s)** — going up, you start retaining sodium as well. So this is where you can get some edema as well.
- **[05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmzPV2x7Dcg&t=301s)** — So all of a sudden, you start holding fluid and you're like, what is going on here?
- **[05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmzPV2x7Dcg&t=305s)** — And on top of that, if you're eating a lot of carbs, these carbs are going to be
- **[05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmzPV2x7Dcg&t=309s)** — converted into glycogen. And glycogen needs potassium to store this sugar. So you're going
- **[05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmzPV2x7Dcg&t=317s)** — to use up a lot of this potassium from the food you eat. And not to mention all this shift
- **[05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmzPV2x7Dcg&t=321s)** — from the blood into the cells, you end up with a very low level of potassium. You're also
- **[05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmzPV2x7Dcg&t=327s)** — going to be storing fat as well as protein. And both of those macronutrients need vitamins
- **[05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmzPV2x7Dcg&t=334s)** — and minerals as well. So you deplete those. And you also deplete vitamin B1 in a big way
- **[05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmzPV2x7Dcg&t=340s)** — when you do carbs. The metabolism of carbs requires B1 as the cofactor. And so anytime
- **[05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmzPV2x7Dcg&t=347s)** — you eat carbs, you just deplete your B1 big time. And one of the big symptoms from a B1
- **[05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmzPV2x7Dcg&t=353s)** — deficiency is memory loss. Okay. And that can create confusion. It could create anxiety
- **[05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmzPV2x7Dcg&t=358s)** — and a whole host of other issues that relate from all the way over here from neurological
- **[06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmzPV2x7Dcg&t=363s)** — problems to heart problems. And so that's the simplicity of what the refeeding syndrome is.
- **[06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmzPV2x7Dcg&t=369s)** — So how do we prevent this problem from happening? Well, make sure number one,
- **[06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmzPV2x7Dcg&t=373s)** — when you're eating, you're doing the healthy version of the ketogenic diet. You're doing
- **[06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmzPV2x7Dcg&t=378s)** — nutrient-dense foods. Number two, take electrolytes and the B vitamins as a bare minimum.
- **[06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmzPV2x7Dcg&t=384s)** — While you're fasting, it might also be good to take other things too, like olive oil to
- **[06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmzPV2x7Dcg&t=389s)** — get you fat soluble vitamins, as well as your omega-3 fatty acids. It might be also
- **[06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmzPV2x7Dcg&t=394s)** — good to take vitamin D and vitamin K2, as well as some trace minerals. And that way,
- **[06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmzPV2x7Dcg&t=400s)** — you're not going to have malnutrition. Okay. So it's going to help you. And when you introduce
- **[06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmzPV2x7Dcg&t=405s)** — food, you go slowly. I'm talking about maybe an egg. Okay. And you wait a couple hours
- **[06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmzPV2x7Dcg&t=412s)** — and you eat something else. Maybe you have a little bit of soup. Okay. Wait a couple more
- **[06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmzPV2x7Dcg&t=418s)** — hours and do, I don't know, some sauerkraut. Okay. And then wait a little bit and do a
- **[07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmzPV2x7Dcg&t=423s)** — little bit of nuts. So that first day, you don't want to do more than like half of your
- **[07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmzPV2x7Dcg&t=428s)** — calories. Okay. So let's say you're doing a thousand calories on the first day.
- **[07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmzPV2x7Dcg&t=434s)** — And then you slowly increase food the next several days. Now this all depends on how long
- **[07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmzPV2x7Dcg&t=440s)** — that you fast. If you fasted for a long period of time, let's say you fasted for
- **[07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmzPV2x7Dcg&t=444s)** — 21 days or 30 days. Well, you're going to go even slower than if you fasted for three
- **[07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmzPV2x7Dcg&t=449s)** — or four days. Now just realize that when you're doing intermittent fasting, like say
- **[07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmzPV2x7Dcg&t=454s)** — one meal a day, you don't have to worry about this. Okay. I'm talking about
- **[07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmzPV2x7Dcg&t=459s)** — when you fast for three, four, five days in a row. So now that you know the dangers
- **[07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmzPV2x7Dcg&t=464s)** — and how to prevent this refeeding syndrome, the next thing to really wrap your wits around
- **[07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmzPV2x7Dcg&t=470s)** — is the benefits of a long fasting. So I put that video up right here. Check it out.

- **[00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6F5ylBMx71Q&t=0s)** — Today I'm going to talk about a crazy epidemic of autoimmune diseases.
- **[00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6F5ylBMx71Q&t=6s)** — One out of every 12 people will develop an autoimmune disease.
- **[00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6F5ylBMx71Q&t=9s)** — One out of nine adult women will develop an autoimmune disease.
- **[00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6F5ylBMx71Q&t=13s)** — It is way more common. In heart disease, with cancer, it's one out of 14.
- **[00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6F5ylBMx71Q&t=18s)** — So since the 50s and 60s, we have a 3x spike in autoimmune diseases.
- **[00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6F5ylBMx71Q&t=24s)** — In this graph right here, you can see Crohn's disease going straight up.
- **[00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6F5ylBMx71Q&t=27s)** — You see MS and type 1 diabetes.
- **[00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6F5ylBMx71Q&t=31s)** — So normally, the immune system has a very complex and difficult job
- **[00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6F5ylBMx71Q&t=36s)** — creating tolerance for our own cells.
- **[00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6F5ylBMx71Q&t=39s)** — In other words, it has to differentiate our own cells and our own friendly microbes
- **[00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6F5ylBMx71Q&t=45s)** — and differentiate that from external pathogens, viruses, microbes, etc.
- **[00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6F5ylBMx71Q&t=52s)** — And the hallmark of an autoimmune disease is really inflammation.
- **[00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6F5ylBMx71Q&t=55s)** — So we have this inflammatory reaction because the immune system is attacking it.
- **[01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6F5ylBMx71Q&t=60s)** — But I want to explain the single common denominator with all autoimmune diseases
- **[01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6F5ylBMx71Q&t=66s)** — is this intestinal permeability, leaky gut.
- **[01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6F5ylBMx71Q&t=70s)** — The small intestine, where 90% of all the digestion occurs
- **[01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6F5ylBMx71Q&t=73s)** — and you have a little mucus layer, you have these little villi,
- **[01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6F5ylBMx71Q&t=77s)** — and you have this single cell layer between the internal part of the intestine.
- **[01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6F5ylBMx71Q&t=81s)** — Food particles are supposed to be absorbed through that in a certain way.
- **[01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6F5ylBMx71Q&t=84s)** — But when there's holes, because there's leaky gut, we lose that immigration, that stamp of approval.
- **[01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6F5ylBMx71Q&t=91s)** — We allow things through that area.
- **[01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6F5ylBMx71Q&t=94s)** — And now we have a massive confusion.
- **[01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6F5ylBMx71Q&t=96s)** — We have things that are incorrectly tagged as harmful.
- **[01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6F5ylBMx71Q&t=99s)** — And then we have a cascade of effect that can then lead to problems of any tissue in your body.
- **[01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6F5ylBMx71Q&t=106s)** — There are several companies that provide this online test.
- **[01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6F5ylBMx71Q&t=109s)** — It's not too expensive. You can get them.
- **[01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6F5ylBMx71Q&t=111s)** — I'll put a list of several down below and find out if you have leaky gut.
- **[01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6F5ylBMx71Q&t=116s)** — And then what you can do is make some changes and then redo the test,
- **[02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6F5ylBMx71Q&t=120s)** — you know, maybe every month or every couple months to see how it's improving.
- **[02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6F5ylBMx71Q&t=124s)** — What creates damage in your intestine?
- **[02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6F5ylBMx71Q&t=127s)** — There's been a paper, 2005.
- **[02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6F5ylBMx71Q&t=130s)** — They found 287 industrial chemicals in the fetal cord blood of 10 newborn infants.
- **[02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6F5ylBMx71Q&t=139s)** — We're talking about chemicals from plastics, pesticides, chemicals that are flame retardants.
- **[02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6F5ylBMx71Q&t=146s)** — I mean, this is bizarre.
- **[02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6F5ylBMx71Q&t=148s)** — But then we have gluten.
- **[02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6F5ylBMx71Q&t=150s)** — Okay, gluten can trigger Hashimoto's and Celiac.
- **[02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6F5ylBMx71Q&t=154s)** — It's the only proteins that we cannot, as humans, digest.
- **[02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6F5ylBMx71Q&t=158s)** — So as you know, most of the wheat in America, at least, is sprayed with glyphosate,
- **[02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6F5ylBMx71Q&t=163s)** — which Monsanto sold round up to Bayer,
- **[02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6F5ylBMx71Q&t=167s)** — who now has a big problem because they have over a hundred thousand lawsuits against them.
- **[02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6F5ylBMx71Q&t=172s)** — But unfortunately, our food system, corn, soy, cottonseed, canola,
- **[02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6F5ylBMx71Q&t=177s)** — have been heavily doused with this Roundup Ready, which has been patented as an antibiotic.
- **[03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6F5ylBMx71Q&t=184s)** — Glyphosate has been known to cause leaky gut as well.
- **[03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6F5ylBMx71Q&t=187s)** — Being an antibiotic, it destroys the microbiome,
- **[03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6F5ylBMx71Q&t=191s)** — which is going to create more inflammation in your gut.
- **[03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6F5ylBMx71Q&t=194s)** — On top of that, it interrupts certain enzymes, especially in your liver,
- **[03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6F5ylBMx71Q&t=199s)** — the phase one, phase two detoxification enzymes.
- **[03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6F5ylBMx71Q&t=202s)** — And so then you're getting these chemicals, but then you can't get rid of the chemicals.
- **[03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6F5ylBMx71Q&t=205s)** — Once you get the inflammation in the gut, you can't absorb vitamin D that well anymore, too.
- **[03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6F5ylBMx71Q&t=211s)** — So vitamin D is the most important vitamin for your immune system.
- **[03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6F5ylBMx71Q&t=217s)** — It helps prevent autoimmune diseases.
- **[03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6F5ylBMx71Q&t=220s)** — It's a powerful anti-inflammatory.
- **[03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6F5ylBMx71Q&t=223s)** — It's almost impossible to develop an autoimmune disease
- **[03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6F5ylBMx71Q&t=227s)** — unless you also have some degree of a vitamin D deficiency.
- **[03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6F5ylBMx71Q&t=233s)** — And then you have also the seed oils that are from grains as well, right?
- **[03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6F5ylBMx71Q&t=237s)** — Soy, oil, canola, cottonseed, corn, etc.
- **[04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6F5ylBMx71Q&t=242s)** — If you take a look at the graphs of seed oils,
- **[04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6F5ylBMx71Q&t=246s)** — I mean, it's like one of the common things that parallels,
- **[04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6F5ylBMx71Q&t=249s)** — it goes straight up since the late 50s, 60s, 70s.
- **[04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6F5ylBMx71Q&t=253s)** — I mean, people are just consuming so many seed oils.
- **[04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6F5ylBMx71Q&t=256s)** — And then we just have ultra-processed food ingredients.
- **[04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6F5ylBMx71Q&t=259s)** — That would be a combination of seed oils, refined sugars, refined starches.
- **[04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6F5ylBMx71Q&t=264s)** — I mean, 83% of all calories in the grocery store are ultra-processed foods.
- **[04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6F5ylBMx71Q&t=268s)** — Those ingredients create inflammatory states in your gut.
- **[04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6F5ylBMx71Q&t=272s)** — And the next one to list are certain medications.
- **[04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6F5ylBMx71Q&t=274s)** — PPIs, for example, which people take for GERD or heartburn, things like that.
- **[04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6F5ylBMx71Q&t=278s)** — Well, there's something called drug-induced lupus, okay, from PPIs.
- **[04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6F5ylBMx71Q&t=284s)** — This next thing I'm going to talk about is the icing on the cake.
- **[04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6F5ylBMx71Q&t=288s)** — And that is a stress-induced autoimmune disease.
- **[04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6F5ylBMx71Q&t=294s)** — In practice, I actually personally interacted with about 40,000 patients
- **[04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6F5ylBMx71Q&t=299s)** — over the course of 30 years.
- **[05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6F5ylBMx71Q&t=302s)** — And when someone would come in with an autoimmune disease,
- **[05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6F5ylBMx71Q&t=304s)** — and I would do a history,
- **[05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6F5ylBMx71Q&t=305s)** — there is always some stress event that occurred right before they developed the autoimmune disease.
- **[05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6F5ylBMx71Q&t=312s)** — Stress activates cortisol.
- **[05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6F5ylBMx71Q&t=314s)** — Cortisol paralyzes your immune system.
- **[05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6F5ylBMx71Q&t=317s)** — So, this is the solution.
- **[05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6F5ylBMx71Q&t=319s)** — Number one, you're going to have to avoid the seed oils.
- **[05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6F5ylBMx71Q&t=321s)** — And you're going to have to start eating really clean, grass-fed, things like that.
- **[05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6F5ylBMx71Q&t=325s)** — I'm going to highly recommend you get on the ketogenic diet
- **[05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6F5ylBMx71Q&t=327s)** — with high-quality animal proteins, as well as a good amount of fat.
- **[05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6F5ylBMx71Q&t=332s)** — When I switched my diet off these grains to more beef, red meat, things like that,
- **[05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6F5ylBMx71Q&t=338s)** — I remember my gut was feeling so good.
- **[05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6F5ylBMx71Q&t=342s)** — I had normal bowel movements.
- **[05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6F5ylBMx71Q&t=344s)** — I mean, it was bizarre because I thought you needed all this, like,
- **[05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6F5ylBMx71Q&t=348s)** — grain fiber brand to help you go to the bathroom.
- **[05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6F5ylBMx71Q&t=352s)** — Well, that constipated me.
- **[05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6F5ylBMx71Q&t=354s)** — And like I said, whatever they are telling you to do, go in the opposite direction.
- **[05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6F5ylBMx71Q&t=358s)** — With this healthy version of keto, should you consume vegetables or not,
- **[06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6F5ylBMx71Q&t=363s)** — I recommend that you don't consume raw vegetables.
- **[06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6F5ylBMx71Q&t=367s)** — I recommend you cook every vegetable that you consume
- **[06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6F5ylBMx71Q&t=370s)** — because the raw vegetables, the fibers, can also activate certain problems
- **[06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6F5ylBMx71Q&t=374s)** — because you have leaky gut.
- **[06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6F5ylBMx71Q&t=376s)** — As far as fermented vegetables like sauerkraut, kimchi, maybe some pickles,
- **[06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6F5ylBMx71Q&t=381s)** — have a moderate to a smaller amount of that.
- **[06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6F5ylBMx71Q&t=385s)** — If your gut inflammation is really bad,
- **[06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6F5ylBMx71Q&t=389s)** — then I would go complete carnivore for at least a couple of months.
- **[06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6F5ylBMx71Q&t=392s)** — But I think if you could tolerate at least some cooked vegetables
- **[06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6F5ylBMx71Q&t=397s)** — and the fermented vegetables, that can help with the increase in the microbiome.
- **[06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6F5ylBMx71Q&t=404s)** — As far as vitamin D goes, yes, you need vitamin D a lot.
- **[06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6F5ylBMx71Q&t=407s)** — I would recommend anywhere between 30 to 50,000 IUs per day for a period of time.
- **[06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6F5ylBMx71Q&t=412s)** — L-glutamine might be a beneficial supplement to help heal the gut.
- **[06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6F5ylBMx71Q&t=418s)** — You're going to be getting this glutamine from red meat
- **[07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6F5ylBMx71Q&t=421s)** — or any type of animal protein that you consume.
- **[07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6F5ylBMx71Q&t=425s)** — There's one more remedy that you may want to try, and that's called colostrum.
- **[07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6F5ylBMx71Q&t=428s)** — When you start taking colostrum, take very, very small amounts
- **[07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6F5ylBMx71Q&t=432s)** — because yes, it does have some milk proteins that you might be allergic to.
- **[07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6F5ylBMx71Q&t=438s)** — But the only reason I'm even bringing this up is because colostrum
- **[07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6F5ylBMx71Q&t=441s)** — has a really powerful immune function.
- **[07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6F5ylBMx71Q&t=443s)** — But those are the changes that I would recommend to help turn this thing around.
- **[07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6F5ylBMx71Q&t=448s)** — Since we're on the topic of inflammation, you should probably see this video
- **[07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6F5ylBMx71Q&t=452s)** — where I talk about the number one food that can help you heal and regenerate.
- **[07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6F5ylBMx71Q&t=458s)** — And it's right here. Check it out.

- **[00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpfAAeqggtA&t=50s)** — your arthritis, tendonitis, bursitis, anything related to itis, chronic
- **[00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpfAAeqggtA&t=55s)** — inflammation, whether it's inflammation in your gut.
- **[00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpfAAeqggtA&t=57s)** — Number two, it's a very powerful antioxidant that it can increase longevity.
- **[01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpfAAeqggtA&t=62s)** — I'm not going to get too tactical, but I just want to show you this book right here.
- **[01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpfAAeqggtA&t=66s)** — It's on this drug called Deprenol.
- **[01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpfAAeqggtA&t=68s)** — Okay, Deprenol, the anti-aging drug.
- **[01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpfAAeqggtA&t=72s)** — I want to share something with you that's actually very interesting.
- **[01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpfAAeqggtA&t=75s)** — There's something in her body called MAO-B.
- **[01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpfAAeqggtA&t=79s)** — This is a compound that eats up certain neurotransmitters in your brain
- **[01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpfAAeqggtA&t=85s)** — and can put you at risk for Alzheimer's.
- **[01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpfAAeqggtA&t=87s)** — Deprenol is an inhibitor of MAO-B.
- **[01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpfAAeqggtA&t=91s)** — What you should know is curcumin is also an inhibitor of that MAO-B.
- **[01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpfAAeqggtA&t=98s)** — This is why curcumin helps anything related to brain degeneration.
- **[01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpfAAeqggtA&t=103s)** — I want to just share something with you.
- **[01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpfAAeqggtA&t=104s)** — They injected these mice three times a week at an older age, which
- **[01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpfAAeqggtA&t=109s)** — would be equivalent to 65 years in humans.
- **[01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpfAAeqggtA&t=111s)** — And there was a restoration of sex activity in these animals and
- **[01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpfAAeqggtA&t=116s)** — labeled them to live far longer than the control animals.
- **[02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpfAAeqggtA&t=120s)** — The longest living rat in Dr.
- **[02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpfAAeqggtA&t=122s)** — Null's control group survived for 164 weeks with the longest living
- **[02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpfAAeqggtA&t=127s)** — rat in the Deprenol group surviving 226 weeks.
- **[02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpfAAeqggtA&t=132s)** — That's 56.5 months.
- **[02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpfAAeqggtA&t=134s)** — If we correlated that over to human years, it's 130 years old.
- **[02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpfAAeqggtA&t=138s)** — Curcumin can decrease neuroinflammation in your brain.
- **[02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpfAAeqggtA&t=142s)** — There are many chronic degenerative diseases that relate to degeneration
- **[02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpfAAeqggtA&t=146s)** — of your brain, which can affect your cognitive function, memory, and mood.
- **[02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpfAAeqggtA&t=151s)** — Curcumin also increases a compound called BDNF, Brain-derived
- **[02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpfAAeqggtA&t=156s)** — neurotrophic factor.
- **[02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpfAAeqggtA&t=157s)** — That is a compound that actually helps increase the growth and
- **[02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpfAAeqggtA&t=161s)** — survival of neurons, AKA brain cells.
- **[02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpfAAeqggtA&t=164s)** — Lower levels of BDNF were found in people that were depressed
- **[02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpfAAeqggtA&t=168s)** — and have cognitive decline.
- **[02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpfAAeqggtA&t=171s)** — There's also some data to show that curcumin can help inhibit
- **[02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpfAAeqggtA&t=174s)** — beta amyloid placking, which is seen in Alzheimer's.
- **[02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpfAAeqggtA&t=178s)** — Let's switch to the benefits of the heart.
- **[03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpfAAeqggtA&t=180s)** — Curcumin directly protects and helps the function of the inside
- **[03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpfAAeqggtA&t=185s)** — layer of your artery called the endothelial layer.
- **[03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpfAAeqggtA&t=188s)** — This is where a lot of things happen.
- **[03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpfAAeqggtA&t=190s)** — The start of clotting, the start of placking in the arteries,
- **[03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpfAAeqggtA&t=195s)** — the start of high blood pressure.
- **[03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpfAAeqggtA&t=196s)** — Curcumin protects that layer.
- **[03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpfAAeqggtA&t=199s)** — Being a powerful anti-inflammatory can decrease scar tissue that can
- **[03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpfAAeqggtA&t=203s)** — grow inside those arteries.
- **[03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpfAAeqggtA&t=205s)** — Curcumin also helps the LDL.
- **[03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpfAAeqggtA&t=208s)** — And I'm talking about the small dense particles that can invade
- **[03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpfAAeqggtA&t=211s)** — the layer of the inside of the artery.
- **[03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpfAAeqggtA&t=213s)** — Curcumin protects against that.
- **[03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpfAAeqggtA&t=215s)** — It also protects against something called oxidative LDL, which is
- **[03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpfAAeqggtA&t=218s)** — another thing that kind of rusts out the inside of your arteries.
- **[03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpfAAeqggtA&t=222s)** — Curcumin can decrease the risk of getting a fatty liver, as
- **[03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpfAAeqggtA&t=224s)** — well as an inflamed liver.
- **[03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpfAAeqggtA&t=226s)** — Curcumin also has the ability to help stabilize your blood sugar
- **[03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpfAAeqggtA&t=229s)** — because it increases the sensitivity to insulin.
- **[03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpfAAeqggtA&t=232s)** — Curcumin can help speed up wound healing, powerful anti-microbial
- **[03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpfAAeqggtA&t=237s)** — effects, what can help with our gut, but it doesn't affect the
- **[04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpfAAeqggtA&t=241s)** — good bacteria, just the bad.
- **[04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpfAAeqggtA&t=243s)** — Curcumin is also good for the eyes.
- **[04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpfAAeqggtA&t=245s)** — Why?
- **[04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpfAAeqggtA&t=246s)** — Because it's a good anti-inflammatory.
- **[04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpfAAeqggtA&t=247s)** — Curcumin is awesome for any type of inflammation in your gut,
- **[04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpfAAeqggtA&t=251s)** — bloating, and even for ulcers.
- **[04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpfAAeqggtA&t=253s)** — Curcumin is also good to help allergies, probably because of
- **[04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpfAAeqggtA&t=257s)** — its effect on your immune system, especially if you have eczema or
- **[04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpfAAeqggtA&t=261s)** — psoriasis or even acne.
- **[04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpfAAeqggtA&t=263s)** — Curcumin also can help bind with heavy metals and then allow
- **[04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpfAAeqggtA&t=267s)** — the liver to help remove it and get it out of the body.
- **[04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpfAAeqggtA&t=269s)** — One of the problems that people mention about curcumin is
- **[04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpfAAeqggtA&t=273s)** — its poor bioavailability.
- **[04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpfAAeqggtA&t=275s)** — If you take it with black pepper, you're going to get better
- **[04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpfAAeqggtA&t=277s)** — absorption, but taking major, major high doses is not probably
- **[04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpfAAeqggtA&t=282s)** — what you want to do.
- **[04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpfAAeqggtA&t=283s)** — Think about what this compound really is.
- **[04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpfAAeqggtA&t=285s)** — It's something that helps the plant survive.
- **[04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpfAAeqggtA&t=287s)** — It's a powerful thing that wards off insects, bacteria,
- **[04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpfAAeqggtA&t=294s)** — viruses, don't necessarily need to take large amounts.
- **[04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpfAAeqggtA&t=297s)** — In fact, you don't want to do what I did.
- **[04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpfAAeqggtA&t=298s)** — Right?
- **[04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpfAAeqggtA&t=298s)** — I grew turmeric in several pots, dried it out in a
- **[05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpfAAeqggtA&t=302s)** — dehydrator, and then I started to chew it thinking that,
- **[05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpfAAeqggtA&t=304s)** — wow, I'm just going to take a lot of this.
- **[05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpfAAeqggtA&t=306s)** — It's probably going to really help me.
- **[05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpfAAeqggtA&t=307s)** — Big mistake.
- **[05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpfAAeqggtA&t=308s)** — I got really nauseous after the second day of just
- **[05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpfAAeqggtA&t=311s)** — chewing on this stuff.
- **[05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpfAAeqggtA&t=312s)** — Not to mention my tongue and my lips were just stained yellow.
- **[05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpfAAeqggtA&t=315s)** — This is not about taking large amounts.
- **[05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpfAAeqggtA&t=317s)** — You just want to take regular amounts of it and you're only
- **[05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpfAAeqggtA&t=319s)** — going to absorb a small amount, but that's all you need.
- **[05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpfAAeqggtA&t=322s)** — Just make sure if you're taking with a supplement, take it with
- **[05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpfAAeqggtA&t=324s)** — black pepper, because you'll get a little bit better absorption.
- **[05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpfAAeqggtA&t=327s)** — Curcumin also helps you repair.
- **[05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpfAAeqggtA&t=329s)** — So all night long, you're repairing your body.
- **[05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpfAAeqggtA&t=332s)** — When you get into these deep sleep cycles, you're actually
- **[05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpfAAeqggtA&t=334s)** — cleaning the brain of all this toxicity.
- **[05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpfAAeqggtA&t=337s)** — Taking a turmeric supplement before bed is fine, but there's
- **[05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpfAAeqggtA&t=342s)** — other ways to get this curcumin as well.
- **[05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpfAAeqggtA&t=344s)** — You can take a teaspoon, put it in some boiling water, let it
- **[05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpfAAeqggtA&t=348s)** — cool off and make a tea out of it and sip that before you go to bed.
- **[05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpfAAeqggtA&t=352s)** — There's something from India called golden milk with turmeric.
- **[05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpfAAeqggtA&t=355s)** — You can put turmeric in a smoothie or put it on your food.
- **[05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpfAAeqggtA&t=359s)** — Or what I like to do is make a curry out of it, put it on
- **[06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpfAAeqggtA&t=362s)** — chicken with other spices and consume that as your last meal of the day.
- **[06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpfAAeqggtA&t=367s)** — And if you wanted to learn about an amazing recipe, you can make
- **[06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpfAAeqggtA&t=371s)** — butter chicken without sugar.
- **[06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpfAAeqggtA&t=373s)** — Let me show you this clip right now.
- **[06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpfAAeqggtA&t=375s)** — Now while making your butter chicken, you either got to start with the butter
- **[06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpfAAeqggtA&t=379s)** — or the chicken and we're going to start with the chicken.
- **[06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpfAAeqggtA&t=382s)** — So we're going to be taking boneless leg meat and cutting it up
- **[06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpfAAeqggtA&t=386s)** — into nice bite size pieces.
- **[06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpfAAeqggtA&t=388s)** — Don't use chicken breast because it will dry out.
- **[06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpfAAeqggtA&t=392s)** — Buy some leg meat, buy some thigh meat, buy any meat except the breast meat.
- **[06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpfAAeqggtA&t=397s)** — Anyway, once your chicken has been cut into nice small bite
- **[06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpfAAeqggtA&t=400s)** — size pieces, it's time to marinate it.
- **[06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpfAAeqggtA&t=402s)** — We're going to marinate the chicken with some salt, some turmeric,
- **[06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpfAAeqggtA&t=407s)** — some red chilli powder, some garam masala powder, some cumin powder
- **[06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpfAAeqggtA&t=414s)** — and some dried fenugreek leaves or as we say in India kasuri methi.
- **[07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpfAAeqggtA&t=420s)** — Then you just give this all a good mix and you want to let this
- **[07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpfAAeqggtA&t=424s)** — marinate for at least 15 minutes.
- **[07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpfAAeqggtA&t=427s)** — The next thing we're going to do is take some garlic, some ginger,
- **[07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpfAAeqggtA&t=434s)** — some onions, some tomatoes and we're going to put it in our
- **[07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpfAAeqggtA&t=439s)** — blender and make a fresh and delicious puree to use in the butter chicken.
- **[07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpfAAeqggtA&t=444s)** — Make sure you get that lid on and blitz this till it's a nice fine puree.
- **[07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpfAAeqggtA&t=449s)** — And that's ready. Keep it aside till we start cooking.
- **[07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpfAAeqggtA&t=452s)** — Now it's time to make that butter chicken and I'm going to get
- **[07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpfAAeqggtA&t=455s)** — my pan on the stove.
- **[07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpfAAeqggtA&t=457s)** — And of course, I'm going to heat up some olive oil, a good whole tablespoon.
- **[07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpfAAeqggtA&t=462s)** — And now you want to keep your pan on the highest setting and it's
- **[07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpfAAeqggtA&t=466s)** — time to fry the chicken.
- **[07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpfAAeqggtA&t=468s)** — So get the chicken in the pan and fry that chicken.
- **[07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpfAAeqggtA&t=472s)** — Don't touch it. Don't touch it.
- **[07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpfAAeqggtA&t=474s)** — Just put it down and let it cook and get some color on it.
- **[07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpfAAeqggtA&t=479s)** — After about two minutes of cooking it on the highest heat, you're
- **[08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpfAAeqggtA&t=482s)** — going to start flipping that chicken over.
- **[08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpfAAeqggtA&t=485s)** — And oh yeah, look at that beautiful crust on the chicken.
- **[08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpfAAeqggtA&t=489s)** — You want to get some nice color.
- **[08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpfAAeqggtA&t=490s)** — You want those spices to get cooked.
- **[08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpfAAeqggtA&t=493s)** — You want to create the Maillard reaction or the Maillard reaction.
- **[08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpfAAeqggtA&t=497s)** — Color is everything on the chicken.
- **[08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpfAAeqggtA&t=500s)** — And then I'm going to generously drop in butter all around the pan in
- **[08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpfAAeqggtA&t=506s)** — different places.
- **[08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpfAAeqggtA&t=507s)** — And we're using about 50 grams of butter.
- **[08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpfAAeqggtA&t=510s)** — That's almost like four tablespoons.
- **[08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpfAAeqggtA&t=513s)** — Well, three point something, but you get the idea.
- **[08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpfAAeqggtA&t=516s)** — 50 grams of delicious salted butter and just let that butter melt into
- **[08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpfAAeqggtA&t=520s)** — the chicken.
- **[08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpfAAeqggtA&t=522s)** — Oh yeah, that's food porn right there.
- **[08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpfAAeqggtA&t=525s)** — Anyway, give it all a good mix.
- **[08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpfAAeqggtA&t=527s)** — You'll see the chicken has got a lovely color on it.
- **[08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpfAAeqggtA&t=530s)** — And then we're going to add in that lovely puree that we made
- **[08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpfAAeqggtA&t=533s)** — with the onions, ginger, garlic and tomatoes.
- **[08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpfAAeqggtA&t=536s)** — And don't forget to rinse out the blender.
- **[08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpfAAeqggtA&t=539s)** — Waste none of it.
- **[09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpfAAeqggtA&t=540s)** — So take a little water, shake that blender and pour it into the
- **[09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpfAAeqggtA&t=543s)** — pan and give it all a good mix.
- **[09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpfAAeqggtA&t=547s)** — Once you've mixed everything together nicely, just cover it.
- **[09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpfAAeqggtA&t=550s)** — And let it cook for a good 10 minutes.
- **[09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpfAAeqggtA&t=554s)** — You want to cook out the rawness and the darkness of the tomato
- **[09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpfAAeqggtA&t=558s)** — and the onions and the ginger and the garlic.
- **[09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpfAAeqggtA&t=561s)** — So after about five minutes, take the lid off, give it all a good mix.
- **[09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpfAAeqggtA&t=565s)** — Taste your sauce for seasoning and let it cook some more.
- **[09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpfAAeqggtA&t=570s)** — Once it's cooked for a full 10 minutes, open it up, give it all a
- **[09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpfAAeqggtA&t=574s)** — good mix because that's what we do here on Headbanger's Kitchen.
- **[09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpfAAeqggtA&t=578s)** — Then what we're going to do is we're going to turn off the stove
- **[09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpfAAeqggtA&t=581s)** — and we're going to pour in 100 ml of cream.
- **[09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpfAAeqggtA&t=586s)** — This is just normal heavy whipping cream.
- **[09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpfAAeqggtA&t=589s)** — And if you live outside India, you don't need to turn the heat off.
- **[09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpfAAeqggtA&t=593s)** — This cream that I use, Curdill, so I don't keep the heat on.
- **[09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpfAAeqggtA&t=596s)** — But anyway, mix that cream in and your butter chicken is almost ready.
- **[10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpfAAeqggtA&t=601s)** — The only thing left to do is garnish it with some fresh coriander.
- **[10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpfAAeqggtA&t=605s)** — Because coriander is delicious.
- **[10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpfAAeqggtA&t=609s)** — Anyway, enough jibber jabber.
- **[10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpfAAeqggtA&t=610s)** — It looks like our butter chicken is ready and it looks absolutely mouthwatering.
- **[10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpfAAeqggtA&t=616s)** — Mmm, yum yum.

- **[00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPjZvNA74ds&t=0s)** — I'm going to show you the best remedy to get rid of
- **[00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPjZvNA74ds&t=4s)** — tartar as well as to prevent tartar from coming back. What is tartar? Well, tartar is this
- **[00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPjZvNA74ds&t=10s)** — calcified,
- **[00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPjZvNA74ds&t=11s)** — pale yellow,
- **[00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPjZvNA74ds&t=13s)** — hard growth on the inside of your teeth that tends to get into your gums. It can create
- **[00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPjZvNA74ds&t=18s)** — gingivitis. It can create bad breath. And if we take a look at what tartar really is, it's actually a collection, a colony of bacteria
- **[00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPjZvNA74ds&t=28s)** — that is in a slime that then has calcified. And that's just a way that microorganisms
- **[00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPjZvNA74ds&t=34s)** — survive in nature. Over 95% of all bacteria in nature
- **[00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPjZvNA74ds&t=39s)** — survive as biofilms. Now, if you ever walked through the woods and you saw a little stream
- **[00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPjZvNA74ds&t=44s)** — and you reached down and picked up one of the rocks in the stream, on the outer part of it
- **[00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPjZvNA74ds&t=49s)** — you're going to feel it's kind of slimy.
- **[00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPjZvNA74ds&t=52s)** — That's biofilms.
- **[00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPjZvNA74ds&t=53s)** — I mean, even in your pool, if people don't use enough chlorine or other things, natural things like
- **[00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPjZvNA74ds&t=59s)** — certain salts and things, then you'll get this slimy thing at the bottom of your pool. And these biofilms are not just bacteria.
- **[01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPjZvNA74ds&t=67s)** — There's a bit of fungus as well, yeast and candida. And they
- **[01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPjZvNA74ds&t=72s)** — are not on keto. In other words, they like carbs. They ferment carbohydrates in your mouth.
- **[01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPjZvNA74ds&t=79s)** — And then what happens is they release lactic acid.
- **[01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPjZvNA74ds&t=83s)** — And so they make your mouth really acid. And that acid has the potential to leach away your calcium and break down your
- **[01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPjZvNA74ds&t=91s)** — teeth, giving you cavities and all sorts of wear and tear in your teeth. Now, I'm going to show you one of the best
- **[01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPjZvNA74ds&t=97s)** — anti-tartar
- **[01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPjZvNA74ds&t=98s)** — toothpaste that you can make at home, very inexpensively. And it's very effective and very natural.
- **[01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPjZvNA74ds&t=104s)** — You know, when they looked at ancient Egyptian, like mummy tombs, the teeth were pretty messed up.
- **[01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPjZvNA74ds&t=109s)** — They had a lot of dental problems.
- **[01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPjZvNA74ds&t=112s)** — And it probably came from all the beer and the bread that they consumed,
- **[01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPjZvNA74ds&t=116s)** — which is the perfect food to feed these bacteria in the mouth.
- **[01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPjZvNA74ds&t=119s)** — But they used a type of toothpaste composed of ox hoof
- **[02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPjZvNA74ds&t=123s)** — ashes, burnt egg shells, and volcanic ash.
- **[02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPjZvNA74ds&t=127s)** — That's a great mixture. That probably creates some abrasiveness, right?
- **[02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPjZvNA74ds&t=131s)** — And then the ancient Greeks used a different type of toothpaste made out of burnt shells.
- **[02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPjZvNA74ds&t=136s)** — And they used powdered talc, which is kind of like a combination between magnesium and
- **[02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPjZvNA74ds&t=141s)** — silica. And then they mixed a little salt and honey in there. And then the Romans used crushed bones,
- **[02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPjZvNA74ds&t=147s)** — oyster shells, and charcoal with a little bark. So the problem I see with that formula,
- **[02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPjZvNA74ds&t=153s)** — it's a bit abrasive and it can wear down your teeth. So this formula is very non-abrasive.
- **[02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPjZvNA74ds&t=159s)** — You have clove oil, peppermint oil, or cinnamon oil,
- **[02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPjZvNA74ds&t=164s)** — or turmeric powder. So in a little container
- **[02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPjZvNA74ds&t=167s)** — you can just put like three drops of one of these or like a little pinch of turmeric if you want to use that.
- **[02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPjZvNA74ds&t=172s)** — Now the next thing you're going to put in this little container, okay, is hydrogen peroxide.
- **[02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPjZvNA74ds&t=177s)** — All you need is like a fourth of a teaspoon, which is about 1.25 milliliters.
- **[03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPjZvNA74ds&t=182s)** — Now the interesting thing about hydrogen peroxide is that your body makes it to
- **[03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPjZvNA74ds&t=187s)** — actually kill bacteria and microbes.
- **[03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPjZvNA74ds&t=190s)** — So you're not giving something to the body doesn't know what it is. And hydrogen peroxide is a very potent antimicrobial
- **[03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPjZvNA74ds&t=196s)** — that inhibits biofilms. The next thing you're going to use is baking soda.
- **[03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPjZvNA74ds&t=202s)** — Now, I know what you're thinking. You're thinking, wow, that's pretty gritty. It's going to be invasive.
- **[03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPjZvNA74ds&t=207s)** — But in actuality, it has a very low abrasivity, which is basically the ability to be abrasive.
- **[03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPjZvNA74ds&t=213s)** — There's this metric or this scale called the relative dentin.
- **[03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPjZvNA74ds&t=218s)** — It's kind of like a layer right underneath the outside of the tooth. So it's relative dentin
- **[03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPjZvNA74ds&t=224s)** — abrasivity. Basically, it gives you kind of a rating system to know how much something could, you know,
- **[03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPjZvNA74ds&t=231s)** — break down part of your teeth. And baking soda is a seven, okay? A seven.
- **[03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPjZvNA74ds&t=236s)** — Compare that to regular toothpaste, which is between 70 and 250.
- **[04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPjZvNA74ds&t=242s)** — So baking soda is actually not going to grind down your teeth. And baking soda is sodium
- **[04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPjZvNA74ds&t=249s)** — bicarbonate. So it adds alkalinity. It takes these acids and actually helps neutralize them.
- **[04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPjZvNA74ds&t=255s)** — And our body makes sodium bicarbonate. It's a way that the body can buffer some of these acids.
- **[04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPjZvNA74ds&t=263s)** — So both hydrogen peroxide and sodium bicarbonate are
- **[04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPjZvNA74ds&t=267s)** — something that our body makes. So with baking soda, you're going to use a fourth of a teaspoon.
- **[04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPjZvNA74ds&t=272s)** — Then you're going to add either raw honey or
- **[04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPjZvNA74ds&t=276s)** — manuka honey. But just add a fourth of a teaspoon. Not very much.
- **[04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPjZvNA74ds&t=280s)** — But the key is it has to be raw or else you're just basically killing off
- **[04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPjZvNA74ds&t=284s)** — the things that are anti-biofilm. Now raw honey also has hydrogen peroxide in it.
- **[04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPjZvNA74ds&t=291s)** — Now manuka honey doesn't have the hydrogen peroxide, but it has some other things
- **[04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPjZvNA74ds&t=295s)** — that regular raw honey doesn't have a large amount of to address this problem.
- **[05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPjZvNA74ds&t=300s)** — Then you can add a half a cup of water, which is 118 milliliters
- **[05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPjZvNA74ds&t=305s)** — of water. And then you're going to mix everything out real nice.
- **[05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPjZvNA74ds&t=308s)** — So then you're going to brush your teeth with it with a soft bristle toothbrush. This way we can preserve the teeth,
- **[05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPjZvNA74ds&t=315s)** — kill off this film that is developing into
- **[05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPjZvNA74ds&t=318s)** — tartar. And you want to do that twice a day. As a side note, vitamin K2 has some interesting research that may
- **[05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPjZvNA74ds&t=325s)** — also inhibit the formation of tartar.
- **[05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPjZvNA74ds&t=329s)** — It's kind of a mixed review, but I have heard reports from quite a few people that swear by it.
- **[05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPjZvNA74ds&t=335s)** — They notice that the inside of their teeth are nice and smooth when they take
- **[05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPjZvNA74ds&t=340s)** — this K2, which has a purpose of directing calcium
- **[05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPjZvNA74ds&t=343s)** — into the bone and out of the soft tissues. Now since vitamin K2 is so new and so important,
- **[05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPjZvNA74ds&t=350s)** — you should probably learn more about it. I put a video up right here. Check it out.

- **[00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u0TpL4HwcMA&t=0s)** — Let's talk about inflammation. Most of the inflammation that a person has actually is being
- **[00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u0TpL4HwcMA&t=5s)** — caused by their own immune system. And we really have just two basic phases of inflammation. You
- **[00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u0TpL4HwcMA&t=11s)** — have the acute phase and then you have the chronic phase where you have this incomplete healing.
- **[00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u0TpL4HwcMA&t=17s)** — Inflammation is there to try to heal something but if there's a constant stimulus, which I'm
- **[00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u0TpL4HwcMA&t=22s)** — going to cover all of them today, you're not going to get to a point where you can actually
- **[00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u0TpL4HwcMA&t=25s)** — resolve it. So I want to cover all of the different things that can occur and then I'm going
- **[00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u0TpL4HwcMA&t=29s)** — to cover all the things that you should do to resolve it. The number one selling drug in the
- **[00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u0TpL4HwcMA&t=34s)** — world is an anti-inflammatory drug. So a lot of people have inflammation but most autoimmune
- **[00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u0TpL4HwcMA&t=40s)** — cases actually originate in the gut. I did a separate video on that. If you didn't see that,
- **[00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u0TpL4HwcMA&t=45s)** — I will put that down below. But let's start with number one. Gluten. Okay, that's in
- **[00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u0TpL4HwcMA&t=49s)** — grains. Gluten really tears your stomach up. There's a morphine-like substance when you have
- **[00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u0TpL4HwcMA&t=55s)** — this immune reaction. So in reality it can numb the area so you don't feel it while the damage
- **[01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u0TpL4HwcMA&t=61s)** — goes on. And I'm talking about damage in the gut lining to the point where you start getting
- **[01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u0TpL4HwcMA&t=65s)** — leaky gut and then we have particles of protein from your food that can invade
- **[01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u0TpL4HwcMA&t=71s)** — through this immigration and bypass this immigration wall, go right into the lymphatic
- **[01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u0TpL4HwcMA&t=77s)** — system and boom, now we get this immune reaction. So gluten is behind so many
- **[01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u0TpL4HwcMA&t=82s)** — issues. Okay, and then we also have food allergies like intolerance to milk sugar,
- **[01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u0TpL4HwcMA&t=87s)** — but that's not necessarily a true allergy. A true allergy involves a protein like an allergy
- **[01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u0TpL4HwcMA&t=92s)** — to casein which is a protein in milk. So just by taking a person off milk, boy, all sorts
- **[01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u0TpL4HwcMA&t=98s)** — of things can clear up. Number two. Ultra-processed food ingredients. Now yes,
- **[01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u0TpL4HwcMA&t=104s)** — you have the artificial colorings and artificial flavorings and the preservatives and all that
- **[01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u0TpL4HwcMA&t=108s)** — and other chemicals which may create a lot of irritation and problems, but not to the
- **[01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u0TpL4HwcMA&t=114s)** — degree that these three ingredients do that are made from industrial processed corn. Okay,
- **[01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u0TpL4HwcMA&t=119s)** — they go through a huge series of chemical reactions to the point where they no longer
- **[02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u0TpL4HwcMA&t=125s)** — resemble the original corn and then you put that in your body and you're going to get a
- **[02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u0TpL4HwcMA&t=129s)** — lot of what's called free radical damage. In vision just spinning it like a plate right now
- **[02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u0TpL4HwcMA&t=134s)** — on my finger. It's spinning around and we have these little weights on it, right? And if
- **[02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u0TpL4HwcMA&t=138s)** — I took a couple weights off it would be lopsided. It's not going to spin correctly. It's going to
- **[02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u0TpL4HwcMA&t=144s)** — fall off and might just create some damage wherever that is. So that's what a free radical
- **[02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u0TpL4HwcMA&t=147s)** — is. I don't want to get distracted. Synthetic sugar is bad. You've heard of corn starch and
- **[02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u0TpL4HwcMA&t=152s)** — maybe modified food starch. This maltodextrin. Highly reactive in the body and so it behaves
- **[02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u0TpL4HwcMA&t=157s)** — like a sugar, but it's classified as a starch. And then we have the deadly seed oils which
- **[02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u0TpL4HwcMA&t=163s)** — are again highly refined. Here you take this omega-6 unsaturated fat which is very unstable.
- **[02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u0TpL4HwcMA&t=172s)** — And then you're going to put it under heat. What keeps it stable in that food? I mean it's
- **[02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u0TpL4HwcMA&t=179s)** — literally dead. People think of, you know, alter processed foods or junk foods are like the
- **[03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u0TpL4HwcMA&t=184s)** — saturated fat in a burger, for example. Well, a lot of people do dirty keto and they go to a
- **[03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u0TpL4HwcMA&t=193s)** — seem to do okay, you know. It's the bun with the burger and the ketchup and the soda and the
- **[03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u0TpL4HwcMA&t=201s)** — fries all together that creates the problem. And this is why if you're trying to heal the
- **[03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u0TpL4HwcMA&t=206s)** — body and get rid of inflammation, you don't want to keep consuming these seed oils.
- **[03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u0TpL4HwcMA&t=210s)** — You want to get on the saturated fats. Those are the ones that are stable. You want to cook
- **[03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u0TpL4HwcMA&t=214s)** — with tail-o. You want to use coconut oil, extra virgin olive oil. You don't want to use
- **[03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u0TpL4HwcMA&t=220s)** — especially when you use heat. All right, number three, viruses. A lot of people have
- **[03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u0TpL4HwcMA&t=228s)** — certain inflammatory conditions that come and go. That's because a virus kind of can go in
- **[03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u0TpL4HwcMA&t=234s)** — remission and out of remission. It could be triggered by your menstrual cycle. It could be
- **[03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u0TpL4HwcMA&t=237s)** — triggered by stress. And so stress is a huge factor in this topic. So we're really dealing
- **[04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u0TpL4HwcMA&t=244s)** — with this hormone called cortisol because if you were to raise your stress, the cortisol
- **[04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u0TpL4HwcMA&t=249s)** — comes up. Cortisol actually suppresses your immune system. So it kind of shuts it down
- **[04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u0TpL4HwcMA&t=255s)** — and it allows this pathogen, this virus, to come out and wreak havoc to create problems.
- **[04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u0TpL4HwcMA&t=264s)** — So stress puts your immune system to sleep. There's people that have major losses and that
- **[04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u0TpL4HwcMA&t=270s)** — can really create a huge problem with viruses come out of remission. And here they're
- **[04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u0TpL4HwcMA&t=274s)** — taking all these vitamins and they're taking, eating really good foods. It's not working
- **[04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u0TpL4HwcMA&t=278s)** — because of this darn stress situation that they're in. One thing that can help with this
- **[04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u0TpL4HwcMA&t=284s)** — is vitamin D because viruses also have a very sneaky strategy of blocking vitamin D in your
- **[04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u0TpL4HwcMA&t=293s)** — body. But vitamin D is very important for viruses. Zinc is also important as well.
- **[04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u0TpL4HwcMA&t=298s)** — All right, number four, insulin resistance. Okay, if you're doing a lot of snacks,
- **[05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u0TpL4HwcMA&t=303s)** — frequent eating, and you're doing carbs, you can get insulin resistance. Most of the
- **[05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u0TpL4HwcMA&t=306s)** — population has insulin resistance. When I used to have insulin resistance, boy, I had arthritis
- **[05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u0TpL4HwcMA&t=312s)** — all up and down my spine. So much worse than it is now. I mean, I could barely feel it now,
- **[05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u0TpL4HwcMA&t=316s)** — but so many people have told me once they get on keto and they do intermittent fasting,
- **[05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u0TpL4HwcMA&t=321s)** — their inflammation goes away. I mean, you should just know about that. The next one is
- **[05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u0TpL4HwcMA&t=324s)** — just not enough cortisol. Let's say, for example, you went through chronic stress for
- **[05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u0TpL4HwcMA&t=328s)** — many years or you had prednisone for a period of time. What happens, you develop what's
- **[05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u0TpL4HwcMA&t=334s)** — called a cortisol resistance to the point where you don't have enough cortisol,
- **[05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u0TpL4HwcMA&t=338s)** — and then the body becomes inflamed. And the remedy is vitamin D. Number six, old injuries.
- **[05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u0TpL4HwcMA&t=345s)** — And that is me. Okay, I had a lot of old injuries and it really has to do with a
- **[05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u0TpL4HwcMA&t=350s)** — lack of motion. If a joint doesn't move, or if you don't move your sedentary, you will
- **[05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u0TpL4HwcMA&t=356s)** — develop inflammation. Arthritics need to keep moving. I do a tremendous amount of exercise
- **[06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u0TpL4HwcMA&t=362s)** — for that reason. That's what really forces me to get out there. I do massive exercise and when
- **[06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u0TpL4HwcMA&t=367s)** — I do that, I feel so good, especially if I run up hills and things because I can
- **[06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u0TpL4HwcMA&t=371s)** — expand my chest, which opens up the back part of the thoracic spine, the neck,
- **[06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u0TpL4HwcMA&t=377s)** — it just feels great. All right, next one. Sludge in your bile ducts. A super concentrated
- **[06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u0TpL4HwcMA&t=384s)** — cholesterol material. Okay, what keeps it from becoming a stone is bile salts. And when it
- **[06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u0TpL4HwcMA&t=393s)** — starts to get stuck in your bile ducts, it backs up into the liver and causes pain in
- **[06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u0TpL4HwcMA&t=398s)** — the right shoulder or in your rhomboid back here or in your neck. That can be corrected
- **[06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u0TpL4HwcMA&t=404s)** — by a healthy diet. The next one is iron. Too much iron. Some people feel so much better
- **[06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u0TpL4HwcMA&t=411s)** — when they get blood because they have a genetic problem that they retain too much iron, especially
- **[06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u0TpL4HwcMA&t=418s)** — men. One thing about iron, it doesn't get out of the body very easily. So if you're consuming
- **[07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u0TpL4HwcMA&t=423s)** — like supplements, you might not even connect the dots, but that can be the reason why you
- **[07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u0TpL4HwcMA&t=430s)** — feel worse. One way to know too is if you maybe consume a lot of red meat and you just
- **[07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u0TpL4HwcMA&t=434s)** — feel worse from that because there's a lot of iron. That's just one thing or you eat liver
- **[07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u0TpL4HwcMA&t=437s)** — and you feel worse. It's not very common. Most people feel better when they do red meat.
- **[07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u0TpL4HwcMA&t=442s)** — All right, next one. I want to expand on this hypoxia situation. This is the lack of oxygen.
- **[07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u0TpL4HwcMA&t=447s)** — If you have a chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, COPD, in your lungs, you can have
- **[07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u0TpL4HwcMA&t=453s)** — hypoxia. You're not getting the oxygen. Hypoxia causes inflammation because here you
- **[07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u0TpL4HwcMA&t=458s)** — have this hemoglobin that carries oxygen, right? If you don't have enough iron or B12 to
- **[07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u0TpL4HwcMA&t=465s)** — hold that oxygen, you become anemic and that is a form of hypoxia. And then of course injuries
- **[07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u0TpL4HwcMA&t=472s)** — create hypoxia. It's the roses of the liver that would create a hypoxia situation
- **[07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u0TpL4HwcMA&t=476s)** — or even a clogged artery. Okay, there's a really good remedy and I might as well just
- **[08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u0TpL4HwcMA&t=482s)** — tell you right now it's called toketrinols. It's a type of vitamin E to help donate
- **[08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u0TpL4HwcMA&t=486s)** — electrons to all the oxidation and it's a good remedy for getting rid of the inflammation
- **[08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u0TpL4HwcMA&t=492s)** — in the inside of the arteries. But toketrinols are better than the tocopherols.
- **[08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u0TpL4HwcMA&t=496s)** — So don't get the one that's mixed. Another thing, sleep apnea can cause hypoxia because
- **[08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u0TpL4HwcMA&t=504s)** — you're not breathing as much, right? It can affect the kidney, it can affect the brain,
- **[08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u0TpL4HwcMA&t=507s)** — it can affect a lot of things. All right, then the next one is uric acid. It's one of the
- **[08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u0TpL4HwcMA&t=512s)** — main causes of high blood pressure and it comes from consuming a lot of fructose as in
- **[08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u0TpL4HwcMA&t=517s)** — corn syrup. What can you do about this, right? You need to fix the microbes in the gut. The
- **[08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u0TpL4HwcMA&t=524s)** — lactobacillus and the bifidobacteria. And you can find those too in kefir, sauerkraut,
- **[08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u0TpL4HwcMA&t=532s)** — kimchi, and just getting a probiotic. All right, the next thing, and this is really
- **[08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u0TpL4HwcMA&t=537s)** — important, is to build up your endogenous antioxidants. The word endogenous means from
- **[09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u0TpL4HwcMA&t=543s)** — So let's go through a couple things to do that. Fasting. Next one,
- **[09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u0TpL4HwcMA&t=550s)** — exercise. Another thing is cold therapy. Next one on the list is vitamin D3, the most potent
- **[09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u0TpL4HwcMA&t=557s)** — anti-inflammatory. Vitamin D can just put some order into your immune system. It can help
- **[09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u0TpL4HwcMA&t=564s)** — regulate that immune system a lot better. And at least 10 to 20,000 IUs. All right,
- **[09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u0TpL4HwcMA&t=571s)** — number four, I already mentioned this, fasting. You should be doing regular intermittent fasting
- **[09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u0TpL4HwcMA&t=575s)** — and periodic prolonged fasting if you have any inflammation. Number five, low carb. This is
- **[09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u0TpL4HwcMA&t=581s)** — called keto. Number six, carnivore if you have got inflammation. Really, red meat is probably
- **[09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u0TpL4HwcMA&t=587s)** — the most healing thing that you can possibly eat. And I'm talking about grass-fed grass
- **[09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u0TpL4HwcMA&t=593s)** — finished. Now the next one on the list, I talked about that bile sludge. The antidote to
- **[09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u0TpL4HwcMA&t=598s)** — that is something called Tudkuff. Take two in the morning, two in the afternoon, empty stomach.
- **[10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u0TpL4HwcMA&t=603s)** — It will open up those ducts and allow the sludge to get through and give you a tremendous
- **[10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u0TpL4HwcMA&t=609s)** — amount of relief, especially if you have bloating or this right shoulder pain. Next one
- **[10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u0TpL4HwcMA&t=614s)** — is tocatrinols. I already talked about that. Great for anything related to the heart. I
- **[10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u0TpL4HwcMA&t=619s)** — already mentioned cold therapy as well. That's number nine. And I also mentioned number 10,
- **[10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u0TpL4HwcMA&t=623s)** — stretching and exercise. And 11, omega-3 fatty acids, fish oils. I recommend the
- **[10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u0TpL4HwcMA&t=629s)** — cod liver oil because it has the vitamin A and the vitamin D. If you compare the seed oils,
- **[10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u0TpL4HwcMA&t=633s)** — the omega-6 to the omega-3, the cod liver oil, the fish oil, the salmon, or sardines,
- **[10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u0TpL4HwcMA&t=640s)** — they both compete for the same enzyme. To get the omega-3, you need to stop the omega-6.
- **[10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u0TpL4HwcMA&t=647s)** — You need omega-6, but you don't need as much. Now since we talked a lot about cortisol,
- **[10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u0TpL4HwcMA&t=652s)** — I have a list of every single possible thing, natural thing that you can do to help
- **[10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u0TpL4HwcMA&t=659s)** — normalize cortisol. If you want that download,

**Watch on YouTube:** [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86Yd1EEWMBA](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86Yd1EEWMBA)

## Full Transcript with Timestamps

*Click any timestamp to jump to that moment in the video*

- **[00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86Yd1EEWMBA&t=0s)** — So this is an updated video that I did about a year ago.
- **[00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86Yd1EEWMBA&t=3s)** — And I'm going to give you 10 signs of dementia that are really, really important.
- **[00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86Yd1EEWMBA&t=8s)** — With the first sign or symptom, that can occur 10 years before you have any cognitive changes whatsoever.
- **[00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86Yd1EEWMBA&t=16s)** — But I have to mention something. Just because you have the following symptoms that I'm going to mention does not mean you have dementia.
- **[00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86Yd1EEWMBA&t=23s)** — It could be your sleep. It could be your stress. It could be what you just ate. It could be some wine you had just yesterday. It could be anything.
- **[00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86Yd1EEWMBA&t=31s)** — And I have to say this, which I said in my other video. The worst thing you could do is start to diagnose people with dementia.
- **[00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86Yd1EEWMBA&t=42s)** — Especially friends, family, and your spouse. I've seen it a lot in practice.
- **[00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86Yd1EEWMBA&t=48s)** — Where a spouse is correcting another spouse.
- **[00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86Yd1EEWMBA&t=52s)** — Honey, you made a mistake. Honey, you're forgetting things. Don't do that. You can actually mess someone up. You can actually create more of that.
- **[01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86Yd1EEWMBA&t=60s)** — So if your spouse makes a mistake, just move on. Don't try to correct them. I've seen it so much before. It's just not a healthy thing to do.
- **[01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86Yd1EEWMBA&t=67s)** — What is dementia? Well, we have a normal brain right here. And over time, people can develop a pathological brain condition, which is where it atrophies.
- **[01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86Yd1EEWMBA&t=80s)** — And that can create dementia as a symptom. So in dementia, you have a shrinkage of certain parts of the brain. You also have inflammation.
- **[01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86Yd1EEWMBA&t=89s)** — What's really interesting about this is it takes many years for this process to develop.
- **[01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86Yd1EEWMBA&t=96s)** — And there's one symptom or sign that occurs 10 years before any cognitive changes can occur.
- **[01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86Yd1EEWMBA&t=105s)** — And I want to mention what that is. Actually, there's two symptoms or two signs.
- **[01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86Yd1EEWMBA&t=110s)** — Before you even get any type of cognitive changes. So the first change is a sensory change.
- **[01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86Yd1EEWMBA&t=117s)** — And it mainly has to do with the sensation of smell, because the nerve endings in your sinuses directly go right to the back of the brain, the central nervous system.
- **[02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86Yd1EEWMBA&t=129s)** — And there's no blood brain barrier. It's kind of like a vulnerable place to be exposed to create damage. So it's going to show up first.
- **[02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86Yd1EEWMBA&t=139s)** — Now, there is another part of the brain that extends out beyond the blood brain barrier called the retina.
- **[02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86Yd1EEWMBA&t=147s)** — Extends outside the skull in the inner eye, and it's exposed to different things too. But out of all the sensory problems, it's the smell.
- **[02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86Yd1EEWMBA&t=156s)** — Now, what's interesting about the smell is sometimes if you're lacking smell, it's an omission. You don't really notice it.
- **[02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86Yd1EEWMBA&t=163s)** — So sometimes people get used to it because it's like an absence of something. It's not like a pain that you notice.
- **[02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86Yd1EEWMBA&t=169s)** — It's just you're lacking something, right? And you just go along and you might not even be aware of it.
- **[02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86Yd1EEWMBA&t=176s)** — But there's some very interesting research on the association of lack of smell as being the first sign well before the other cognitive problems.
- **[03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86Yd1EEWMBA&t=184s)** — Now, I mentioned there's two of these signs before the cognitive changes. There's actually three. So I already mentioned the vision.
- **[03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86Yd1EEWMBA&t=190s)** — But the third one is sleep. Yeah, sleeping problems. Now, of course, if you have a sleeping problem, it could be a hundred different reasons.
- **[03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86Yd1EEWMBA&t=198s)** — But there's a high association between sleeping problems, insomnia, and dementia.
- **[03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86Yd1EEWMBA&t=204s)** — All right. Number four is agitation. What is that? That is a low tolerance distress. It's someone who gets agitated easily.
- **[03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86Yd1EEWMBA&t=214s)** — They have a short fuse. They're not in a calm state. But again, I mean, a lot of people have this and there's nothing to do with dementia.
- **[03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86Yd1EEWMBA&t=222s)** — But it definitely fits in that category as one of the early signs of dementia. And then restlessness.
- **[03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86Yd1EEWMBA&t=229s)** — When the brain starts to break down, the person gets really restless. They cannot just sit still.
- **[03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86Yd1EEWMBA&t=237s)** — All right. The next one is aggression. They might be a bit angry. They might snap at you.
- **[04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86Yd1EEWMBA&t=244s)** — This also relates to the low stress tolerance. But aggression is just agitation with volume turned up.
- **[04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86Yd1EEWMBA&t=251s)** — Then we get into the memory problems. And this could be, you know, forgetting words. It could be forgetting names.
- **[04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86Yd1EEWMBA&t=257s)** — It could be something related to difficulty learning something. Also, there's something called the clock test.
- **[04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86Yd1EEWMBA&t=264s)** — The inability to recognize the time from a clock.
- **[04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86Yd1EEWMBA&t=269s)** — And the way that some researchers describe this is like if you have someone draw a clock and just have them write out what nine o'clock is, for example, or three o'clock and see if they can do it.
- **[04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86Yd1EEWMBA&t=280s)** — So a person also might be mixing up words. They will also have a longer lag time between answering you.
- **[04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86Yd1EEWMBA&t=289s)** — And also there's many other aspects to this. It could be spatial recognition like the inability to locate where your car is or where your keys are or find your way home without GPS.
- **[05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86Yd1EEWMBA&t=304s)** — It can also involve a lack of focus, for example, too, or concentration.
- **[05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86Yd1EEWMBA&t=309s)** — Okay, so the next one is a lower emotion. Now it can be all the way down into depression or it could be a little higher in anxiety.
- **[05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86Yd1EEWMBA&t=317s)** — But they no longer have this higher level of emotion. It drops down. So it can even be like an apathy. It's just kind of like they're staring off into the distance.
- **[05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86Yd1EEWMBA&t=326s)** — Alright, the next one is interesting. Incontinence. Okay, so the loss of control of the bladder or the bowels.
- **[05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86Yd1EEWMBA&t=335s)** — Now this is interesting, but it does make sense when you understand that the brain is controlling both of those actions.
- **[05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86Yd1EEWMBA&t=344s)** — And so obviously there's breakdown in the brain tissue. And then the last one is constipation, which also relates to the nervous system.
- **[05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86Yd1EEWMBA&t=351s)** — But it also relates to the gut. What you have to realize is the gut directly affects the brain and the brain affects the gut. There's a whole axis there.
- **[06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86Yd1EEWMBA&t=363s)** — Now the next part of this, I'm going to talk about the causation of this before I get into what to do about it.
- **[06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86Yd1EEWMBA&t=368s)** — But what you need to know is there's chronic inflammation. Okay, now what does that mean? It could come from things that you're eating.
- **[06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86Yd1EEWMBA&t=376s)** — It could come from head trauma and even destroys the blood brain barrier where you start getting this leakage.
- **[06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86Yd1EEWMBA&t=384s)** — I mean, think about it. The same thing happens in your arteries. The same thing happens in your gut. You get leaky gut. You get leaky brain.
- **[06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86Yd1EEWMBA&t=393s)** — And then you start having problems. What creates that? Inflammation. Things that destroy that barrier.
- **[06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86Yd1EEWMBA&t=400s)** — I think if we take a look at your foods, to the extreme on the left, it's going to be refined sugars, refined starches, and refined oils.
- **[06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86Yd1EEWMBA&t=411s)** — There's a lot of data now that shows these seed oils that are heated like five or six times and then they might be used at the fast food restaurants five or six, ten, twenty times reheated.
- **[07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86Yd1EEWMBA&t=425s)** — And then you're going to actually eat food that's been bathed in that. It's going to go into the body. It's highly inflammatory.
- **[07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86Yd1EEWMBA&t=431s)** — It's in your salad dressings. It's in your condiments. It's in literally about 80 percent of all the foods in the grocery store.
- **[07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86Yd1EEWMBA&t=441s)** — But the point is that out of all the things that can create inflammation, it's obviously the junk foods or ultra processed foods.
- **[07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86Yd1EEWMBA&t=447s)** — Yes, you have alcohol, you have smoking, but the worst is the ultra processed foods.
- **[07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86Yd1EEWMBA&t=453s)** — That's all going to cause insulin resistance. And that is one common factor with Alzheimer's, dementia, is they nearly always have insulin resistance,
- **[07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86Yd1EEWMBA&t=464s)** — which really causes the neuron, the nerve cell, to literally starve of fuel because when you have that resistance, this brain cell can't get fuel anymore.
- **[07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86Yd1EEWMBA&t=473s)** — And that's why when you go on a low carb diet and you have these ketones, ketones can bypass that damage and feed the neuron directly.
- **[08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86Yd1EEWMBA&t=482s)** — And this is probably why they call Alzheimer's type 3 diabetes.
- **[08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86Yd1EEWMBA&t=486s)** — Now, there's other things too that can influence this inflammation. It could be heavy metals. It can be an infection.
- **[08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86Yd1EEWMBA&t=491s)** — Or it can even be high blood pressure that is causing this massive pressure situation all up into the brain.
- **[08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86Yd1EEWMBA&t=499s)** — There's a certain genetic weakness that I want to just bring up because you won't know about this unless you get your genetics tested.
- **[08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86Yd1EEWMBA&t=508s)** — And the type of genetics I'm talking about, and I'm going to give you this new word, is called polymorphism.
- **[08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86Yd1EEWMBA&t=514s)** — And this is where you have a very specific gene that's altered in some way. It's modified.
- **[08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86Yd1EEWMBA&t=519s)** — It's called APOE4. The great majority of the public has APOE3.
- **[08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86Yd1EEWMBA&t=526s)** — But there's two copies, okay? And if you have just one copy, the APOE4, it brings up your risk at 30% of developing dementia.
- **[08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86Yd1EEWMBA&t=537s)** — But if you have both copies, that risk factor goes up between 50 and 90%.
- **[09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86Yd1EEWMBA&t=543s)** — Now, why is this significant? Because this is something that is in your genes that can set up a weakness or a vulnerability only if your environment and your lifestyle is not that great.
- **[09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86Yd1EEWMBA&t=556s)** — But just because you have these genetic weaknesses does not mean anything because what really controls the activation of these genes is your lifestyle and the environment.
- **[09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86Yd1EEWMBA&t=568s)** — So you can control these genes, but I think it's helpful getting this genetic test to find out if you have this weakness because it might motivate you to avoid drinking and smoking and start eating healthier and exercising.
- **[09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86Yd1EEWMBA&t=581s)** — Because if you don't make those changes, the odds are that you are going to develop a big problem down the road with dementia.
- **[09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86Yd1EEWMBA&t=587s)** — The question is, what can you do about it? Okay? There's obviously, you know, removing the bad, adding the good.
- **[09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86Yd1EEWMBA&t=593s)** — There's some very impactful things you can do that make a huge difference. And the big one is exercise.
- **[09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86Yd1EEWMBA&t=598s)** — Yes, and that's because it will drive a lot of blood flow to your brain and it will also help build up and regenerate your mitochondria in your brain.
- **[10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86Yd1EEWMBA&t=609s)** — Regular exercise can significantly drop your risk for Alzheimer's. In fact, it's probably the most important thing despite anything else.
- **[10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86Yd1EEWMBA&t=618s)** — Even if you're having a sleep problem and you're stressed out, but if you exercise on a regular basis, it's extremely protective to your brain.
- **[10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86Yd1EEWMBA&t=630s)** — So then sleeping, that's really important too. Not as important as exercise, but it's still important because that's going to reduce your stress.
- **[10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86Yd1EEWMBA&t=636s)** — The brain is going to do much better on ketones than sugar. So this is why you do need to go on a low carb diet.
- **[10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86Yd1EEWMBA&t=644s)** — But do the healthy version of it with a lot of great ingredients, which I will put a link down below if you want to know what that looks like.
- **[10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86Yd1EEWMBA&t=650s)** — But ketones will be the preferred fuel for the brain. Intermittent fasting, very important, and periodic prolonged fasting for the brain.
- **[10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86Yd1EEWMBA&t=658s)** — When you fast, it's like miracle grow to your brain. You help increase this thing called brain derived neurotrophic factor and it will actually help you grow new brain cells.
- **[11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86Yd1EEWMBA&t=669s)** — The next thing on the list that's really important is a lot of omega-3 fatty acids. So we want to get rid of the omega-6, get rid of it completely.
- **[11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86Yd1EEWMBA&t=678s)** — It's inflammatory. Realize it also competes with the omega-3. And we want to omega-3. This is fish oils.
- **[11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86Yd1EEWMBA&t=685s)** — I personally like cod liver oil because it has the vitamin D and the vitamin A with it, whereas fish oils don't.
- **[11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86Yd1EEWMBA&t=690s)** — But omega-3 in higher doses is very, very important for the brain.
- **[11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86Yd1EEWMBA&t=693s)** — Now, the B vitamins are also important. B1, extremely important to help prevent this atrophy and also for many other things.
- **[11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86Yd1EEWMBA&t=702s)** — Also the entire B complex, including the natural forms of B9, which is folate, and the natural form of B12, which is methyl cobulamine, versus the synthetic versions.
- **[11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86Yd1EEWMBA&t=714s)** — Vitamin D is very important for the brain. There's a lot of receptors in the brain for vitamin D.
- **[12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86Yd1EEWMBA&t=721s)** — And vitamin D is one of the most potent anti-inflammatories. So there's several other things that you can do, like sauna treatments.
- **[12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86Yd1EEWMBA&t=728s)** — There's one study that showed that if you do between four to seven sauna treatments a week, you can drop your risk of dementia by 60%.
- **[12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86Yd1EEWMBA&t=737s)** — Resveratrol and another supplement called NAD are really good for your brain. Also, probiotics are also essential to help your brain.
- **[12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86Yd1EEWMBA&t=747s)** — And cold therapy, believe it or not, is really good for regenerating the brain. Now, you would think that the cold would be something that would harm the brain.
- **[12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86Yd1EEWMBA&t=757s)** — But just think about on the history of things, how many times humans have starved in very cold temperatures.
- **[12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86Yd1EEWMBA&t=765s)** — We have all sorts of genes that kick in when our bodies get colder that help us survive, especially in your brain.
- **[12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86Yd1EEWMBA&t=772s)** — But if you think about it, your body does a lot to preserve the brain and protect the brain because it's the key thing to help you survive.
- **[12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86Yd1EEWMBA&t=779s)** — So cold therapy has some serious benefits. And as much as I dislike the feeling of it initially, it gives me the most rejuvenation of my brain.
- **[13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86Yd1EEWMBA&t=791s)** — It just brings me right up and it's quick. It's wild. I didn't think it could do that. But it's winter right now and I am doing the cold immersion.
- **[13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86Yd1EEWMBA&t=801s)** — I know it's crazy. I never thought I would do it. But because it makes me feel so good, I still do it.
- **[13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86Yd1EEWMBA&t=806s)** — Now, if you have not seen my other video that got millions of views, you should check that one out too. I put it right here. It's very important.

- **[00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e46xrn8c-eA&t=0s)** — So why would anyone want to do a 30-day sugar detox? I mean, sugar is natural. It's what feeds our brain.
- **[00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e46xrn8c-eA&t=6s)** — I mean, what's going to happen to our brain if we detox sugar for 30 days? Can it survive?
- **[00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e46xrn8c-eA&t=11s)** — So let's dive into this topic. I have some new information I think you'll like,
- **[00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e46xrn8c-eA&t=14s)** — but it revolves around this one term called metabolic flexibility. That is your cell's
- **[00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e46xrn8c-eA&t=20s)** — ability to make this smooth transition between carbs and fat during a fasting state and then
- **[00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e46xrn8c-eA&t=28s)** — until you eat and then when you're eating and then going into a fasting state, how well can you
- **[00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e46xrn8c-eA&t=33s)** — switch fuels? Because when you're eating, sometimes you're living off the glucose, right? The sugar.
- **[00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e46xrn8c-eA&t=39s)** — But then when you fast, okay, that's no longer available. Can your body adapt to burning fat
- **[00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e46xrn8c-eA&t=45s)** — and ketones, which are kind of like little packaged pieces of fat? How smooth and efficient
- **[00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e46xrn8c-eA&t=50s)** — can this transition take place? As well as your cell's ability to utilize fat and carbs
- **[00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e46xrn8c-eA&t=57s)** — when you're metabolically inflexible, this transition is very, very dysfunctional.
- **[01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e46xrn8c-eA&t=63s)** — Your ability to burn fat when you go into a fasting state is very difficult. So this does
- **[01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e46xrn8c-eA&t=68s)** — explain what's really behind why people can't seem to lose any weight when they do this
- **[01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e46xrn8c-eA&t=73s)** — fasting. And then also when you exercise, let's say you're going to do some type of
- **[01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e46xrn8c-eA&t=77s)** — endurance type of exercise where you actually need glucose every so often, right? Your body just
- **[01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e46xrn8c-eA&t=83s)** — not seem to tap into this fat fuel when you're exercising. That means you're metabolically
- **[01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e46xrn8c-eA&t=90s)** — inflexible. So this metabolic inflexibility leads to diabetes, obesity, loss of muscle
- **[01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e46xrn8c-eA&t=98s)** — protein. That's called sarcopenia because instead of burning fat, the body sometimes will start
- **[01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e46xrn8c-eA&t=103s)** — using muscle protein as its fuel. So the whole determination of what fuel your body is
- **[01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e46xrn8c-eA&t=109s)** — is all dysfunctional. The fuel comes into the energy mitochondria and it doesn't get burned.
- **[01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e46xrn8c-eA&t=114s)** — And sometimes it doesn't get stored and it clogs things up. If you were to look at the
- **[01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e46xrn8c-eA&t=118s)** — mitochondria, as far as this little assembly line of turning food into energy, you'd find
- **[02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e46xrn8c-eA&t=123s)** — all sorts of bottlenecks and traffic jams. And this is what's really behind so many
- **[02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e46xrn8c-eA&t=129s)** — chronic illnesses, including cancer. So this really described what happened to me in my
- **[02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e46xrn8c-eA&t=135s)** — 20s. Boy, I could not go for any period of time without needing a snack or else I'd get
- **[02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e46xrn8c-eA&t=140s)** — highly irritable. Ask my wife. I remember one time we were doing all these things to try to
- **[02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e46xrn8c-eA&t=145s)** — get healthy and I decided to do a Colema. Okay, Colema. What's a Colema? It's a combination
- **[02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e46xrn8c-eA&t=152s)** — between a colonic and an enema. And it was developed by Bernard Jensen. And in this colon
- **[02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e46xrn8c-eA&t=156s)** — cleansing program, you don't eat any food. You're drinking this mixture of psyllium seed
- **[02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e46xrn8c-eA&t=163s)** — with certain vitamins, with apple juice. And I've never felt worse during that period of time.
- **[02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e46xrn8c-eA&t=170s)** — And when I was fasting for that week, I couldn't tap into my own fat. I was living off a
- **[02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e46xrn8c-eA&t=175s)** — little bit of sugar. I wasn't transitioning to the fat fuel because if I was, my appetite
- **[03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e46xrn8c-eA&t=180s)** — would go away. I would feel so much better mentally, but I felt so terribly and I was
- **[03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e46xrn8c-eA&t=186s)** — so irritable. It was just miserable. And so when you have metabolic inflexibility, you're
- **[03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e46xrn8c-eA&t=191s)** — going to be grouchy. You're going to have anxiety. You're going to be tired. You're
- **[03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e46xrn8c-eA&t=195s)** — not going to be able to go for a long period of time without eating. And when you try to go
- **[03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e46xrn8c-eA&t=198s)** — on a fast, you're not going to feel good. You're going to feel tired. You're not going
- **[03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e46xrn8c-eA&t=202s)** — to be able to lose much weight. You're not going to have all the benefits that you could
- **[03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e46xrn8c-eA&t=206s)** — if you adapted and you were actually metabolically flexible. What's at the core of
- **[03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e46xrn8c-eA&t=212s)** — this problem is insulin resistance. And insulin is what controls whether you burn fat or not.
- **[03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e46xrn8c-eA&t=218s)** — And so if someone is metabolically inflexible, what's really going on is insulin resistance.
- **[03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e46xrn8c-eA&t=223s)** — And so the insulin is pretty high. Even in a fasting state, you see this a lot with a
- **[03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e46xrn8c-eA&t=228s)** — diabetic as well as obesity. With certain obese people, they can have like three times as much
- **[03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e46xrn8c-eA&t=233s)** — insulin as someone who doesn't have that problem. And so the consequence of all this
- **[03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e46xrn8c-eA&t=237s)** — extra insulin is that it's the message of don't burn fat, store fat. So the person tries
- **[04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e46xrn8c-eA&t=243s)** — and tries and tries and just can't lose the weight. But there is a way to transition over to
- **[04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e46xrn8c-eA&t=249s)** — create this metabolic flexibility, which really is insulin sensitivity. And there's many benefits
- **[04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e46xrn8c-eA&t=255s)** — for this. You'll be able to go long periods of time without hunger, without cravings.
- **[04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e46xrn8c-eA&t=260s)** — You'll be able to actually burn fat, which would be a great thing. And also your efficiency
- **[04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e46xrn8c-eA&t=264s)** — of burning sugar will be better too. The sugar that comes in the mitochondria can finally
- **[04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e46xrn8c-eA&t=269s)** — be burned as well. And so occasionally if you go off your keto plan and you go on some carbs,
- **[04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e46xrn8c-eA&t=274s)** — your body can burn those fuels. So the ideal situation would be able to build up your body
- **[04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e46xrn8c-eA&t=279s)** — into a state of insulin sensitivity and metabolic flexibility. So I'm going to show
- **[04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e46xrn8c-eA&t=284s)** — you four ways to do that. And just so you know, if you did this for 30 days, chances are
- **[04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e46xrn8c-eA&t=288s)** — you would create a huge impact into this problem. Number one, you eat less frequently.
- **[04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e46xrn8c-eA&t=294s)** — This goes against what people tend to tell you to do, right? Eat often to prevent hunger. Like
- **[05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e46xrn8c-eA&t=300s)** — this hunger is a bad thing. Like you're starving. No, it's actually being hungry sometimes is a
- **[05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e46xrn8c-eA&t=305s)** — very healthy thing. It's in our genetics. We've been hungry for a very long time. And if we
- **[05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e46xrn8c-eA&t=311s)** — never let our body get hungry because we're constantly feeding it, we develop metabolic
- **[05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e46xrn8c-eA&t=316s)** — inflexibility. Number two, eat fewer carbs. All right, number three, and this may be a
- **[05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e46xrn8c-eA&t=322s)** — sufficient amount of fat, but don't eat excessive amounts of fat. If you are metabolically
- **[05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e46xrn8c-eA&t=329s)** — inflexible, why? Because not only can you not efficiently burn glucose, you also can't burn
- **[05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e46xrn8c-eA&t=336s)** — fat too well either. That's why you can't lose weight. So why would you want to add so
- **[05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e46xrn8c-eA&t=340s)** — much extra fat to the diet? That would be a mistake. I'm not telling you to go low fat,
- **[05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e46xrn8c-eA&t=345s)** — but just don't add all these additional fats that so many people add into a ketogenic diet.
- **[05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e46xrn8c-eA&t=350s)** — I'll never forget the story of a friend of mine that went on the ketogenic diet. First of all,
- **[05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e46xrn8c-eA&t=355s)** — his definition of keto was just a high fat diet, right? And he didn't want to do intermittent
- **[05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e46xrn8c-eA&t=359s)** — fasting. So he made these fat bombs. They're like pure fat, coconut oil, and butter and MCT
- **[06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e46xrn8c-eA&t=367s)** — oil, and maybe a little almond oil. And he was just down in these all day long. I think
- **[06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e46xrn8c-eA&t=372s)** — the first week he gained five pounds. The second week, I think he gained seven pounds.
- **[06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e46xrn8c-eA&t=377s)** — That is not what you want to do. So get your fat that normally comes with the meat,
- **[06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e46xrn8c-eA&t=381s)** — okay, or other things. But don't go low fat if you're doing cheese or something like that.
- **[06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e46xrn8c-eA&t=386s)** — But don't add additional fat. And that way we can get your body to tap into your own fat.
- **[06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e46xrn8c-eA&t=392s)** — That is the purpose of the fat. To provide for extra fuel during times when you're not
- **[06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e46xrn8c-eA&t=396s)** — eating. And so when you go on a fast and you eliminate glucose, now the body has no
- **[06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e46xrn8c-eA&t=403s)** — choice but to burn its own fat. And we can really screw this up if our meal is very high in fat.
- **[06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e46xrn8c-eA&t=408s)** — Because now we don't give the system a chance to tap into our own fat. So let's say you're
- **[06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e46xrn8c-eA&t=415s)** — doing two meals a day and you're adding this extra MCT oil and these extra fats. And even
- **[07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e46xrn8c-eA&t=420s)** — if you're going 18 hours, okay, all that fat that you ate in the last meal is still not
- **[07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e46xrn8c-eA&t=427s)** — used up. How do you expect to ever lose weight? So I just want to emphasize that one
- **[07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e46xrn8c-eA&t=431s)** — point. Okay, number four, exercise snacking. And this is probably a new word for you. It was
- **[07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e46xrn8c-eA&t=439s)** — coined by someone back, I think in 1970. And it's not eating while you're exercising. Okay,
- **[07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e46xrn8c-eA&t=447s)** — exercise snacking is basically short bouts of exercise through the day. Like doing this high
- **[07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e46xrn8c-eA&t=455s)** — intense interval training bout for five minutes before you eat. And then walking after you eat
- **[07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e46xrn8c-eA&t=461s)** — what they found was very interesting when they compare doing that to like a regular pattern
- **[07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e46xrn8c-eA&t=466s)** — of eating and doing this workout, maybe at a standard time during the day, is that when you
- **[07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e46xrn8c-eA&t=471s)** — have these short bursts of exercise throughout the day, that produces way more benefits to
- **[07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e46xrn8c-eA&t=476s)** — your blood sugars, to making insulin more sensitive, as well as to improving your
- **[08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e46xrn8c-eA&t=481s)** — metabolic flexibility better than the old pattern. So I recently mentioned this in a video,
- **[08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e46xrn8c-eA&t=487s)** — instead of sitting in front of the desk all day, break it up with maybe every hour or every two
- **[08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e46xrn8c-eA&t=492s)** — hours, you do a little short exercise, that's going to break up the pattern of sitting all
- **[08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e46xrn8c-eA&t=497s)** — day being sedentary. And it's also very doable because you're only spending like five minutes
- **[08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e46xrn8c-eA&t=502s)** — doing a workout. And if you want to take it to the next level, you can instead of doing
- **[08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e46xrn8c-eA&t=506s)** — high intensity interval training, you can do a version of that called SIT, which stands for
- **[08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e46xrn8c-eA&t=511s)** — sprinting interval training. So this is like the flat out full high intensity,
- **[08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e46xrn8c-eA&t=517s)** — using the maximum intensity type exercise you can do, which is sprinting. And you're only
- **[08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e46xrn8c-eA&t=522s)** — going to be doing it for 10 seconds, right? And you rest for a period of time, do it for
- **[08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e46xrn8c-eA&t=526s)** — another 10 seconds, rest for a period of time. And that produces some serious results. In fact,
- **[08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e46xrn8c-eA&t=531s)** — that's what I'm experimenting right now with. Actually, I'm doing it up a hill. I'm running
- **[08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e46xrn8c-eA&t=535s)** — or sprinting up a hill to add more resistance. And I can only go like 15 seconds and I'm done.
- **[09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e46xrn8c-eA&t=543s)** — And if you can combine this with intermittent fasting, not overdoing with your fat
- **[09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e46xrn8c-eA&t=547s)** — within 30 days, you're going to produce some serious results, not just with your weight
- **[09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e46xrn8c-eA&t=551s)** — for your overall health. Now, because of the censoring and the suppressing of the algorithms
- **[09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e46xrn8c-eA&t=556s)** — on YouTube, it's becoming more difficult to find my content. And there's a lot of content

- **[00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CJ8XnQW4SIk&t=0s)** — There are seven mistakes that most people make when they start doing intermittent fasting.
- **[00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CJ8XnQW4SIk&t=4s)** — The first thing is they eat too much of a certain food when they come off their fasting routine.
- **[00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CJ8XnQW4SIk&t=10s)** — For example, they might start eating way too much peanut butter. They never ate that much before,
- **[00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CJ8XnQW4SIk&t=15s)** — but when they get on keto they tend to eat a lot of peanut butter. And one of the challenges
- **[00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CJ8XnQW4SIk&t=19s)** — with peanut butter is that high level of aflatoxins. What is an aflatoxin? Well,
- **[00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CJ8XnQW4SIk&t=24s)** — that's a mold. And there are higher levels of aflatoxins in peanut butter, but it's also in
- **[00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CJ8XnQW4SIk&t=29s)** — saba as well because also sometimes people do the keto alternative chips or potato chips,
- **[00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CJ8XnQW4SIk&t=37s)** — which is cassava chips, and that also has higher levels of aflatoxins. They say it's well
- **[00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CJ8XnQW4SIk&t=42s)** — tolerated in adults more than children, which is a whole different topic. But with adults,
- **[00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CJ8XnQW4SIk&t=48s)** — if you're eating a lot of it over a long period of time, it can accumulate. It can irritate
- **[00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CJ8XnQW4SIk&t=55s)** — the liver and the gallbladder. Those are the two areas that this aflatoxin seems to irritate most.
- **[01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CJ8XnQW4SIk&t=61s)** — And if aflatoxins are very, very high, I mean it can even create super oxidation of the liver
- **[01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CJ8XnQW4SIk&t=66s)** — and even necrosis, inflammation, cancer of the liver and the gallbladder. So it's just
- **[01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CJ8XnQW4SIk&t=72s)** — something to think about. If you're on the ketogenic diet and all of a sudden you feel
- **[01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CJ8XnQW4SIk&t=75s)** — like your liver is swollen or you have right shoulder pain or you feel more arthritic
- **[01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CJ8XnQW4SIk&t=79s)** — or there's something going on with your gallbladder, it could be all that peanut
- **[01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CJ8XnQW4SIk&t=83s)** — There's a couple things that you can do to minimize that effect, other than just avoiding
- **[01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CJ8XnQW4SIk&t=87s)** — peanut butter. One is consuming organic Valencia peanut butter. That type has lower levels of this
- **[01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CJ8XnQW4SIk&t=93s)** — mold. As well as consuming celery with the peanut butter. Because celery has a certain
- **[01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CJ8XnQW4SIk&t=100s)** — chemical that counters some of this aflatoxin. Peanut butter is not very high in nutrients.
- **[01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CJ8XnQW4SIk&t=107s)** — All right, the next thing is almond flour. This is a big one because with keto, I mean
- **[01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CJ8XnQW4SIk&t=112s)** — almost every recipe includes almond flour. Like the breads, the muffins, the cookies,
- **[01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CJ8XnQW4SIk&t=117s)** — they all have almond flour. Almonds are very high in oxalates and so that can also irritate
- **[02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CJ8XnQW4SIk&t=124s)** — certain joints. It can irritate your digestive system. So it's another one to watch out for
- **[02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CJ8XnQW4SIk&t=129s)** — that can potentially influence your results when you start this fasting program. And I'm
- **[02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CJ8XnQW4SIk&t=134s)** — not telling you to avoid all nuts. You could do walnuts, pecans, pistachios and also a
- **[02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CJ8XnQW4SIk&t=142s)** — fine. And then the last thing that people eat a lot of on the keto, especially when they get
- **[02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CJ8XnQW4SIk&t=146s)** — started, are all these keto bars or keto desserts. Which has certain ingredients that
- **[02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CJ8XnQW4SIk&t=154s)** — I think is a problem. All the functional fibers like the soluble corn fiber and tapioca
- **[02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CJ8XnQW4SIk&t=160s)** — fiber. And you might think, oh, it's a fiber. So it's not a sugar, but it can actually be
- **[02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CJ8XnQW4SIk&t=164s)** — a problem because there's no long-term studies on that. There's also a lot of sugar alcohols
- **[02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CJ8XnQW4SIk&t=168s)** — can disrupt your digestive system and give you a lot of gas and it can affect your mood.
- **[02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CJ8XnQW4SIk&t=174s)** — So again, I would just eat focus on like real food, like high quality meats and
- **[03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CJ8XnQW4SIk&t=180s)** — eggs and fish and vegetables, things like that. Number two is not combining keto with
- **[03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CJ8XnQW4SIk&t=187s)** — your intermittent fasting. You're doing intermittent fasting, but you're not then
- **[03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CJ8XnQW4SIk&t=191s)** — getting on the ketogenic diet. Your carbs are just too high. Now that being said,
- **[03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CJ8XnQW4SIk&t=195s)** — something is better than nothing. And I think it's totally reasonable to go ahead and start with
- **[03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CJ8XnQW4SIk&t=199s)** — one of these, but eventually you'd want to actually add both of these powerful tools to
- **[03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CJ8XnQW4SIk&t=204s)** — get you in a place where you're getting all the benefits. In fact, going on low carb,
- **[03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CJ8XnQW4SIk&t=209s)** — okay, the keto plan can greatly get you into ketosis and make your fasting easier because
- **[03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CJ8XnQW4SIk&t=216s)** — your appetite and cravings are going to completely go away. So in other words, I think
- **[03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CJ8XnQW4SIk&t=219s)** — you're going to really more than even double your benefits if you can do both of these.
- **[03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CJ8XnQW4SIk&t=222s)** — All right, the next thing I want to talk about is the pattern of your intermittent fasting.
- **[03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CJ8XnQW4SIk&t=226s)** — Probably the most common pattern is what's called 18 in 6. When you're fasting for 18 hours,
- **[03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CJ8XnQW4SIk&t=232s)** — and then you have a six hour eating window. So let's say for example, you your first meal
- **[03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CJ8XnQW4SIk&t=238s)** — was at 12 and your second meal was at 6. That would be an 18 to 6 ratio. When we talk
- **[04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CJ8XnQW4SIk&t=245s)** — about the eating window, it is true that you can pretty much eat during that window,
- **[04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CJ8XnQW4SIk&t=250s)** — but I would recommend not snacking between that window. Having two meals, one at your 12 o'clock
- **[04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CJ8XnQW4SIk&t=257s)** — noon, right? And then fast all the way until 6 and have your second meal. So I wouldn't
- **[04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CJ8XnQW4SIk&t=263s)** — eat all the way in graze to that entire fasting window if I were you, because you
- **[04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CJ8XnQW4SIk&t=268s)** — would have more benefits if you just didn't eat anything. And there are a lot of different
- **[04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CJ8XnQW4SIk&t=272s)** — patterns and you can test the different patterns and see what works for you. But just by
- **[04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CJ8XnQW4SIk&t=277s)** — tens of thousands of people doing this over the years, I would say if you're over the age of
- **[04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CJ8XnQW4SIk&t=284s)** — 50, you should really consider doing one meal a day. It's called OMAD. If you can do that
- **[04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CJ8XnQW4SIk&t=290s)** — and just make sure it includes all the nutrients you need. And I have a lot of videos
- **[04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CJ8XnQW4SIk&t=293s)** — on that. But I think for everyone else, they should do two meals. Okay. And I'm going to
- **[05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CJ8XnQW4SIk&t=300s)** — tell you what really is successful, at least for me and a lot of others, is to try to go
- **[05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CJ8XnQW4SIk&t=304s)** — as long as you can with that first meal. Right around lunchtime, if you're not hungry, just
- **[05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CJ8XnQW4SIk&t=309s)** — ride the wave and go a little longer. And if you can go like one o'clock or two o'clock
- **[05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CJ8XnQW4SIk&t=314s)** — or even three o'clock, that would be awesome. So just really pay attention to your hunger
- **[05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CJ8XnQW4SIk&t=319s)** — and your appetite. Because if you're not hungry, ride the wave and go a little bit longer.
- **[05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CJ8XnQW4SIk&t=324s)** — And then that second meal, try to do an early dinner. So a late lunch and early dinner.
- **[05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CJ8XnQW4SIk&t=331s)** — And where I'm going with this is just to really shorten that eating window down to maybe two or
- **[05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CJ8XnQW4SIk&t=336s)** — three to four hours. Okay. That would be incredible because then you would have
- **[05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CJ8XnQW4SIk&t=341s)** — more than 20 hours of fasting. Okay. That's huge. That is going to create some serious
- **[05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CJ8XnQW4SIk&t=347s)** — change with your brain, growing new brain cells, growing a new immune system,
- **[05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CJ8XnQW4SIk&t=353s)** — really helping your gut reset because you're not eating and you're going to give your
- **[05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CJ8XnQW4SIk&t=358s)** — digestive system a chance to reset. You're going to stimulate more of what's called the
- **[06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CJ8XnQW4SIk&t=362s)** — parasympathetic, which is the recovery. You're going to definitely sleep better. You're going
- **[06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CJ8XnQW4SIk&t=367s)** — to have more energy. You're going to have more support with your mitochondria. You're
- **[06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CJ8XnQW4SIk&t=371s)** — going to develop more antioxidants in your body. Your insulin is going to be less resistant.
- **[06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CJ8XnQW4SIk&t=377s)** — Okay. So that's going to heal. Your blood sugars are going to do much better. And your
- **[06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CJ8XnQW4SIk&t=380s)** — inflammatory conditions will go way down. If you can do that 20 hours. For me, a lot
- **[06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CJ8XnQW4SIk&t=386s)** — times I like to eat at like one o'clock, sometimes two, and then maybe I'll eat a
- **[06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CJ8XnQW4SIk&t=392s)** — dinner at four and five. Now, am I hungry at four or five? Usually not. But personally,
- **[06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CJ8XnQW4SIk&t=397s)** — if I do one meal a day, which I would like to do, I just lose too much weight. So I tend
- **[06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CJ8XnQW4SIk&t=402s)** — to spread those calories out in two meals because if you're trying to maintain your
- **[06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CJ8XnQW4SIk&t=405s)** — weight or even gain weight with one meal a day, it's so hard. You'd have to eat so much
- **[06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CJ8XnQW4SIk&t=411s)** — And you're going to feel really stuffed. But the point is, just think about this principle.
- **[06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CJ8XnQW4SIk&t=417s)** — Go as long as you can, have a late lunch, and then try to do an earlier dinner. Okay.
- **[07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CJ8XnQW4SIk&t=421s)** — As early as you can. You're going to find if you do that, okay, you're going to sleep
- **[07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CJ8XnQW4SIk&t=426s)** — better because the later you eat in the evening, towards where you go to bed, the
- **[07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CJ8XnQW4SIk&t=432s)** — more it's going to affect your digestion. And that can affect your sleeping. All right. So
- **[07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CJ8XnQW4SIk&t=440s)** — Sometimes people think that when they're fasting, they're starving. No, no, you're
- **[07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CJ8XnQW4SIk&t=446s)** — not starving. Your body is eating when it's not eating. It's eating your fat when you're not
- **[07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CJ8XnQW4SIk&t=451s)** — eating. So you're actually getting fuel. And in that stored fat, you have fat soluble vitamins
- **[07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CJ8XnQW4SIk&t=457s)** — too that are being released as well. So you're getting some nutrients as well. So it's not
- **[07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CJ8XnQW4SIk&t=462s)** — that you're not eating. You are eating. You're just eating your own fat. I just have found
- **[07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CJ8XnQW4SIk&t=468s)** — through a lot of trial and error. If you, especially in the beginning, like you, because
- **[07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CJ8XnQW4SIk&t=472s)** — you're fasting and you have this restriction on eating, a person tends to, it's kind of a
- **[07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CJ8XnQW4SIk&t=477s)** — scarcity. So they'll tend to eat as much as they can in that meal because, oh my gosh,
- **[08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CJ8XnQW4SIk&t=481s)** — am I going to make it to the next meal? You don't need to do that. Okay. Experiment with it.
- **[08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CJ8XnQW4SIk&t=486s)** — You're going to feel a lot better if you don't stuff yourself. So this relates to the
- **[08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CJ8XnQW4SIk&t=489s)** — question, how many calories do I need? I wouldn't go by that. I would just go by,
- **[08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CJ8XnQW4SIk&t=493s)** — what do you feel comfortable with eating with that meal without overdoing it? And you know
- **[08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CJ8XnQW4SIk&t=499s)** — what I mean overdoing it. I'm talking about, you feel so bloated. You're just stuffed. You
- **[08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CJ8XnQW4SIk&t=504s)** — just don't want to do that. All right. Number five. Okay. Make sure that when you're doing
- **[08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CJ8XnQW4SIk&t=508s)** — intermittent fasting, you also take B vitamins and electrolytes. Why? Both of those categories
- **[08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CJ8XnQW4SIk&t=514s)** — of nutrients are of an increased demand. Okay. When you do keto, when you get your body into
- **[08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CJ8XnQW4SIk&t=519s)** — burning and you're generating ketones, you do need certain minerals and certain B vitamins.
- **[08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CJ8XnQW4SIk&t=525s)** — I would make sure your B vitamins are more natural and even you can get it from
- **[08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CJ8XnQW4SIk&t=529s)** — nutritional yeast. And also make sure when you do the electrolytes that you have something
- **[08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CJ8XnQW4SIk&t=533s)** — that's high quality with high enough amounts of potassium. And of course, when you're doing
- **[08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CJ8XnQW4SIk&t=538s)** — with electrolytes, make sure it has no hidden maltodextrin and it has a good amount of
- **[09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CJ8XnQW4SIk&t=544s)** — potassium and the other electrolytes as well. Number six mistake is not doing the healthy
- **[09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CJ8XnQW4SIk&t=549s)** — version of the ketogenic diet. There's something called dirty keto, which you're pretty much,
- **[09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CJ8XnQW4SIk&t=554s)** — you know, just going to any restaurant, you know, fast food restaurant and you're just like
- **[09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CJ8XnQW4SIk&t=557s)** — having the burger without the bun, but you're not focusing on quality. That's totally fine.
- **[09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CJ8XnQW4SIk&t=562s)** — If you need to do that. Okay. And especially if you're a college student and you can't
- **[09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CJ8XnQW4SIk&t=566s)** — afford the higher quality, but if you can afford it, it's worth it because think about
- **[09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CJ8XnQW4SIk&t=571s)** — when you're eating less meals, when you're doing intermittent fasting, you're going to be
- **[09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CJ8XnQW4SIk&t=575s)** — spending a little less money on food. Okay. You probably save several hundred dollars per month.
- **[09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CJ8XnQW4SIk&t=582s)** — Reinvest that in higher quality of food that has more nutrient dense foods. And I'm talking
- **[09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CJ8XnQW4SIk&t=587s)** — about like the organic pasture raised eggs. I'm talking about wild caught fish and seafood.
- **[09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CJ8XnQW4SIk&t=593s)** — I'm talking about grass fed meats, things like that. And I'm talking about soil-based
- **[09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CJ8XnQW4SIk&t=598s)** — vegetables too. Okay. Vegetables from the farmer's market, things like that. As compared
- **[10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CJ8XnQW4SIk&t=603s)** — like the vegetables you'd get at the grocery store, like the lettuces that are grown
- **[10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CJ8XnQW4SIk&t=607s)** — in either hydroponic or not real soil, but it's something you can grow in and they just add the
- **[10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CJ8XnQW4SIk&t=613s)** — nutrients in there. That's not as good as what the soil can deliver to that plant. And the
- **[10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CJ8XnQW4SIk&t=618s)** — last mistake I think people make is stopping when they plateau thinking that it's not
- **[10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CJ8XnQW4SIk&t=623s)** — working when it actually is. I can't tell you how many people that I've consulted that
- **[10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CJ8XnQW4SIk&t=629s)** — come to find out they think it's not working because they're only losing one pound a week
- **[10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CJ8XnQW4SIk&t=635s)** — or they're not losing anything. But let's say you are just losing one pound a week. That's
- **[10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CJ8XnQW4SIk&t=638s)** — pretty good for the average person that is older. You have to realize that the most you
- **[10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CJ8XnQW4SIk&t=644s)** — can lose per week is two pounds. Initially when you lose like five pounds, that's just
- **[10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CJ8XnQW4SIk&t=648s)** — water weight. And then you're going to have less and less until the point where you're
- **[10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CJ8XnQW4SIk&t=651s)** — just burning fat. There's always something you do to speed up the process. You can fast longer.
- **[10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CJ8XnQW4SIk&t=656s)** — You can do periodic prolonged fasting. You can cut your carbs lower. You can add exercise.
- **[11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CJ8XnQW4SIk&t=662s)** — You can sleep longer. You can reduce your stress. You can take certain additional remedies
- **[11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CJ8XnQW4SIk&t=668s)** — like berberine or cinnamon or things like that to improve insulin resistance. Because what
- **[11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CJ8XnQW4SIk&t=674s)** — can happen as you're losing weight? You're going through the healing process. And when
- **[11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CJ8XnQW4SIk&t=678s)** — you're going through the healing process, your muscles tend to grow more. And the way that you
- **[11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CJ8XnQW4SIk&t=686s)** — go away. Okay. Do you no longer have cravings? That means it's working more than anything. And
- **[11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CJ8XnQW4SIk&t=691s)** — how is your energy? How's your mood? Focus on those things because the whole principle is that
- **[11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CJ8XnQW4SIk&t=695s)** — you have to get healthy first, then lose the weight versus the other way around. Now, because
- **[11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CJ8XnQW4SIk&t=701s)** — of the censoring and the suppressing of the algorithms on YouTube, it's becoming more
- **[11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CJ8XnQW4SIk&t=706s)** — difficult to find my content. And there's a lot of content that I cannot put on YouTube,
- **[11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CJ8XnQW4SIk&t=711s)** — so to make sure you have full access of all my information, go to DrBurg.com and subscribe
- **[11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CJ8XnQW4SIk&t=716s)** — to my newsletter by clicking the link down below in the description. I will see you on

- **[00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxY43mBVOOc&t=0s)** — I recently did a video on Ozembic, but now I want to do a video on Mongero.
- **[00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxY43mBVOOc&t=5s)** — Now, Mongero is a very similar medication.
- **[00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxY43mBVOOc&t=7s)** — Apparently, in several studies, it works a little bit better than Ozembic.
- **[00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxY43mBVOOc&t=12s)** — More weight loss, less time.
- **[00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxY43mBVOOc&t=14s)** — Both these medications were primarily used for regulating blood sugars with diabetes,
- **[00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxY43mBVOOc&t=19s)** — but they also found that it helps you lose weight, which makes sense
- **[00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxY43mBVOOc&t=23s)** — because anything that improves blood sugars will obviously help you lose weight.
- **[00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxY43mBVOOc&t=26s)** — So the first thing I want to say is Mongero does create some really interesting effects
- **[00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxY43mBVOOc&t=31s)** — with weight loss and blood sugars.
- **[00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxY43mBVOOc&t=34s)** — There's no doubt. Actually, it can even improve insulin resistance
- **[00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxY43mBVOOc&t=36s)** — and decrease your A1C, which is an average blood sugar for three months.
- **[00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxY43mBVOOc&t=41s)** — So I'm not going to say that it doesn't work, but it's expensive.
- **[00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxY43mBVOOc&t=45s)** — It's like $1,000 to $1,300 a month.
- **[00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxY43mBVOOc&t=48s)** — And it does come with other side effects other than just being expensive.
- **[00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxY43mBVOOc&t=52s)** — But the big question is what happens when you come off the medication?
- **[00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxY43mBVOOc&t=54s)** — Does it actually correct the problem?
- **[00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxY43mBVOOc&t=56s)** — The answer is no. You have to keep taking it for it to work.
- **[01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxY43mBVOOc&t=61s)** — Do you end up taking it the rest of your life? Is it healthy?
- **[01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxY43mBVOOc&t=65s)** — What are the long-term effects? Well, we don't know.
- **[01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxY43mBVOOc&t=68s)** — But the short-term effects are the following nausea, vomiting,
- **[01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxY43mBVOOc&t=72s)** — diarrhea, constipation, gastroparesis, which is a situation
- **[01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxY43mBVOOc&t=77s)** — where your stomach is a bit paralyzed. Food goes through very, very slowly.
- **[01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxY43mBVOOc&t=81s)** — Another side effect would be abdominal pain, dizziness, lethargy,
- **[01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxY43mBVOOc&t=86s)** — low blood sugar, as in hypoglycemia, various kidney problems.
- **[01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxY43mBVOOc&t=89s)** — Like kidney disease could happen as well.
- **[01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxY43mBVOOc&t=91s)** — And even retinopathy, which is a problem with your retina.
- **[01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxY43mBVOOc&t=95s)** — Let me just kind of touch on that for a second. The slow metabolism.
- **[01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxY43mBVOOc&t=98s)** — People that have a slow metabolism actually have a very efficient metabolism.
- **[01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxY43mBVOOc&t=104s)** — Probably from dieting in the past. You go on some diet
- **[01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxY43mBVOOc&t=107s)** — and then your body adapts and compensates, especially if you go on a lower
- **[01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxY43mBVOOc&t=113s)** — calorie diet and then becomes more efficient.
- **[01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxY43mBVOOc&t=116s)** — So now it can run on a smaller amount of fuel.
- **[02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxY43mBVOOc&t=120s)** — It doesn't want to waste this energy. So it's very conservative.
- **[02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxY43mBVOOc&t=124s)** — So it's like a car that gets a lot of miles per gallon, right?
- **[02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxY43mBVOOc&t=127s)** — Versus a very inefficient motor, which is a gas guzzler.
- **[02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxY43mBVOOc&t=131s)** — So this is really a survival thing that we have in our genetics.
- **[02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxY43mBVOOc&t=135s)** — So anything like fat storage is survival to the body.
- **[02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxY43mBVOOc&t=140s)** — And so anytime you try to lose weight, the body will resist it
- **[02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxY43mBVOOc&t=143s)** — because you're getting rid of this potential survival.
- **[02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxY43mBVOOc&t=147s)** — So when we use a drug to bypass this whole mechanism to try to help you lose weight,
- **[02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxY43mBVOOc&t=152s)** — you really have to understand what's happening to the body internally.
- **[02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxY43mBVOOc&t=156s)** — You're artificially mimicking these two hormones
- **[02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxY43mBVOOc&t=160s)** — because these drugs act to mimic two different hormones
- **[02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxY43mBVOOc&t=165s)** — that are in your small intestine. One is called GLP-1
- **[02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxY43mBVOOc&t=168s)** — and the other one is called GIP. They're drugs that mimic these hormones.
- **[02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxY43mBVOOc&t=174s)** — So my question is, is it possible to create this similar effect
- **[02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxY43mBVOOc&t=179s)** — but without the side effects? Can you use something more natural?
- **[03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxY43mBVOOc&t=183s)** — Is there such a thing as some type of maybe herbal or plant-based
- **[03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxY43mBVOOc&t=189s)** — agonist for these two hormones? And the answer is yes, there is.
- **[03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxY43mBVOOc&t=192s)** — And I put a link down below of the research on that.
- **[03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxY43mBVOOc&t=196s)** — And it's called phytomedicine. You're using plants as medicine.
- **[03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxY43mBVOOc&t=200s)** — But the cool thing about it is there's very minimal toxicity
- **[03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxY43mBVOOc&t=203s)** — and there's all sorts of properties, especially things that relate to
- **[03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxY43mBVOOc&t=208s)** — blood sugar control and many other effects in plants.
- **[03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxY43mBVOOc&t=212s)** — I mean, there's probably about at least 400 different chemicals
- **[03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxY43mBVOOc&t=216s)** — that can help blood sugar from different angles.
- **[03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxY43mBVOOc&t=220s)** — These two hormones that these drugs are mimicking raise insulin
- **[03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxY43mBVOOc&t=224s)** — to lower the blood sugar and also reduce the production of glucose
- **[03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxY43mBVOOc&t=229s)** — from the liver. That's called gluconeogenesis.
- **[03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxY43mBVOOc&t=231s)** — And they also affect the digestive system.
- **[03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxY43mBVOOc&t=233s)** — They actually make you feel full. They help reduce the appetite.
- **[03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxY43mBVOOc&t=237s)** — So it's going to curb your hunger and help you eat less.
- **[04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxY43mBVOOc&t=241s)** — So my question is, number one, is there something non-toxic
- **[04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxY43mBVOOc&t=244s)** — without the side effects? And is there something you can do long-term
- **[04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxY43mBVOOc&t=248s)** — to create this same effect to add it as a part of your long-term healthy lifestyle
- **[04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxY43mBVOOc&t=255s)** — instead of a short-term, very expensive drug approach?
- **[04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxY43mBVOOc&t=259s)** — And I forgot to mention lowered stomach acids.
- **[04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxY43mBVOOc&t=263s)** — So when you start lowering your stomach acids,
- **[04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxY43mBVOOc&t=266s)** — that's going to create all sorts of issues with ability to digest protein,
- **[04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxY43mBVOOc&t=270s)** — absorb minerals, kill pathogens.
- **[04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxY43mBVOOc&t=273s)** — So there's a whole series of consequences that can happen just from that.
- **[04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxY43mBVOOc&t=278s)** — So I always like to think long-term.
- **[04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxY43mBVOOc&t=280s)** — Is that the best long-term solution for a person?
- **[04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxY43mBVOOc&t=282s)** — I understand that your metabolism might be very efficient and it's more difficult.
- **[04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxY43mBVOOc&t=287s)** — And this is part of the phytomedicine data.
- **[04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxY43mBVOOc&t=290s)** — So there's four herbs that can create this effect.
- **[04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxY43mBVOOc&t=294s)** — Number one, berberine. Number two, curcumin.
- **[04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxY43mBVOOc&t=297s)** — Number three, cinnamon. Number four, Panax ginseng.
- **[05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxY43mBVOOc&t=301s)** — Now, I'm not recommending taking all of these.
- **[05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxY43mBVOOc&t=304s)** — I would just pick one and try it out.
- **[05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxY43mBVOOc&t=306s)** — In addition to two other things I would highly recommend,
- **[05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxY43mBVOOc&t=309s)** — especially if you want to lower your appetite
- **[05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxY43mBVOOc&t=311s)** — and be able to do something that fits within your lifestyle.
- **[05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxY43mBVOOc&t=315s)** — And that is this, the healthy version of the ketogenic diet,
- **[05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxY43mBVOOc&t=318s)** — which is a low carb diet with intermittent fasting.

- **[00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHgDOwdZtfQ&t=0s)** — Today I want to show you a very unique way to get rid of that really stubborn belly fat.
- **[00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHgDOwdZtfQ&t=6s)** — If you're female or male, we're going to talk about the differences. I'm going to talk about
- **[00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHgDOwdZtfQ&t=10s)** — if it's better to use exercise or diet or other techniques. But for most of you watching, this is
- **[00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHgDOwdZtfQ&t=15s)** — probably new information that you've never heard before. So definitely take notes. One of the
- **[00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHgDOwdZtfQ&t=20s)** — things that I think is very important before you jump into solving any problem is to really
- **[00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHgDOwdZtfQ&t=26s)** — understand the problem a little bit more. So when we're dealing with belly fat, we're dealing
- **[00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHgDOwdZtfQ&t=29s)** — with... there's different names for it. Central obesity, visceral fat, abdominal obesity. There's
- **[00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHgDOwdZtfQ&t=37s)** — a lot of different names for this belly fat. And so this type of fat is very different than your
- **[00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHgDOwdZtfQ&t=44s)** — superficial fat. It's called subcutaneous. That's just underneath the skin. Belly fat or visceral
- **[00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHgDOwdZtfQ&t=49s)** — fat is fat that is ectopic, which means it's outside the fat cell. The fat is in the organs
- **[00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHgDOwdZtfQ&t=57s)** — and it's especially in your liver. So in other words, if you have belly fat, you have liver fat.
- **[01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHgDOwdZtfQ&t=64s)** — And it is essential to get rid of the fat off the liver to get rid of this midsection weight.
- **[01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHgDOwdZtfQ&t=69s)** — Now there's quite a few mistakes people make when they're trying to deal with this. They're
- **[01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHgDOwdZtfQ&t=72s)** — at the gym trying to do spot exercises where they're doing sit-ups and crunches for weeks,
- **[01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHgDOwdZtfQ&t=78s)** — months, and they're not seeing any change. They go on a diet and many times that won't
- **[01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHgDOwdZtfQ&t=83s)** — work either unless it targets the liver. So I'll just give you a little picture of what's happening
- **[01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHgDOwdZtfQ&t=89s)** — here. So we have liver that is filling up with fat. It's spilling off into the midsection
- **[01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHgDOwdZtfQ&t=95s)** — around the organs in your visceral. That's all the organs in the mid part of your belly.
- **[01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHgDOwdZtfQ&t=101s)** — And this is called ectopic fat. And what's really going on behind the scenes is there's
- **[01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHgDOwdZtfQ&t=108s)** — this hormone called insulin. And insulin is a fat storing hormone. It also prevents you from
- **[01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHgDOwdZtfQ&t=113s)** — losing your fat. So there's a lot of insulin being pumped out by the pancreas and then that's
- **[02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHgDOwdZtfQ&t=120s)** — turning into insulin resistance, which makes it really hard to lose weight because the body is
- **[02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHgDOwdZtfQ&t=127s)** — pumping out so much insulin and that insulin communication is store fat, store fat, store fat.
- **[02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHgDOwdZtfQ&t=133s)** — And then this ectopic fat basically creates insulin resistance. So it's a never-ending
- **[02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHgDOwdZtfQ&t=140s)** — cycle. And of course, you may already know that carbohydrates and sugars and things like that
- **[02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHgDOwdZtfQ&t=146s)** — increase insulin. But also there's something called gluconeogenesis. That's where your liver
- **[02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHgDOwdZtfQ&t=151s)** — is making new sugar. And if you have insulin resistance, your liver will make sugar,
- **[02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHgDOwdZtfQ&t=156s)** — not even from the sugar that you eat in the diet. It can actually be converting other things
- **[02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHgDOwdZtfQ&t=160s)** — to sugar. And it's kind of a double-edged sword because you have your own liver making sugar,
- **[02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHgDOwdZtfQ&t=166s)** — which is then converting into more fat and making more fat. So I need to kind of explain how to
- **[02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHgDOwdZtfQ&t=172s)** — correct this. There are six things we're going to talk about. And one of the solutions is not
- **[02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHgDOwdZtfQ&t=177s)** — to detoxify the liver. That is not going to work. And yes, exercise can help, but not as a
- **[03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHgDOwdZtfQ&t=183s)** — direct way to burn off the fat. It's more to use up the energy, also to help your stress,
- **[03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHgDOwdZtfQ&t=188s)** — and also to help you sleep better. Because not only is it the carbs that raise insulin,
- **[03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHgDOwdZtfQ&t=196s)** — but also the stress activates a hormone called cortisol. And cortisol is a sugar hormone,
- **[03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHgDOwdZtfQ&t=202s)** — and it will release sugar. In fact, it's called glucocorticoid. If you take a look at
- **[03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHgDOwdZtfQ&t=207s)** — some of the synthetic versions of cortisol that they use as medications, like prednisone for
- **[03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHgDOwdZtfQ&t=212s)** — all sorts of inflammatory conditions, if you look at the side effect, it's major weight gain,
- **[03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHgDOwdZtfQ&t=218s)** — especially in your midsection. If you look up excessive production of cortisol, you will see
- **[03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHgDOwdZtfQ&t=223s)** — a picture of someone's belly. Why? Because cortisol mobilizes different tissues and turns
- **[03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHgDOwdZtfQ&t=230s)** — your muscles into fat. So let me just talk about this right now. Reducing stress, but
- **[03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHgDOwdZtfQ&t=239s)** — with more sleep through the type of exercise that I did a whole video on this,
- **[04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHgDOwdZtfQ&t=245s)** — aerobic exercise. You can see that? No, you can't see that. So I'm going to write down right
- **[04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHgDOwdZtfQ&t=255s)** — here aerobic. What is this? That's walks, long walks. Best way to reduce stress or physical work
- **[04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHgDOwdZtfQ&t=266s)** — around the house. Very, very important for reducing stress because it takes the mind off
- **[04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHgDOwdZtfQ&t=270s)** — things. But you want low intensity, long duration walks. It's going to help not necessarily
- **[04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHgDOwdZtfQ&t=277s)** — burn off the fat, but it's going to help burn off the adrenaline and the cortisol that's flowing
- **[04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHgDOwdZtfQ&t=283s)** — through the body from the stress. Reducing stress is going to help you sleep and it will
- **[04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHgDOwdZtfQ&t=287s)** — burn off some calories as well. But let me just kind of talk about burning calories off.
- **[04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHgDOwdZtfQ&t=293s)** — And what I mean by that? Well, the energy factory of the body is called the mitochondria
- **[05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHgDOwdZtfQ&t=300s)** — right here. Okay. And the purpose of the mitochondria is to take your calories and then
- **[05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHgDOwdZtfQ&t=308s)** — turn it into chemical fuel called ATP. ATP is like the battery of the body. And so the
- **[05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHgDOwdZtfQ&t=315s)** — mitochondria is the battery maker. Okay. And what it's doing is it's extracting energy
- **[05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHgDOwdZtfQ&t=321s)** — from food and it's turning it into this right here. So then it can be used. What's
- **[05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHgDOwdZtfQ&t=329s)** — stored? Okay. So you don't really have a lot of stored ATP at any one time, very small amount.
- **[05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHgDOwdZtfQ&t=337s)** — So here's the thing you need to know. What can we do to increase more ATP production and
- **[05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHgDOwdZtfQ&t=342s)** — burning? That's the question. Well, that relates to exercise. So exercise does have
- **[05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHgDOwdZtfQ&t=348s)** — an important factor. Especially if you understand that when you compare someone at rest versus
- **[05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHgDOwdZtfQ&t=354s)** — when they're exercising, you can increase the production of ATP by a thousand times by intense
- **[06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHgDOwdZtfQ&t=362s)** — exercise. So I do recommend doing periodic intense exercise. It's called high intensity
- **[06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHgDOwdZtfQ&t=371s)** — interval training with the walking for various reasons. One is to start using up some of this
- **[06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHgDOwdZtfQ&t=377s)** — energy right here. We want to use up the fat right here. Right. And we want to add the right
- **[06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHgDOwdZtfQ&t=383s)** — exercise. And we want to do high intensity, full body type exercise. You can do sprinting
- **[06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHgDOwdZtfQ&t=389s)** — up a hill. You can do a spin bike. You can do weights, any type of exercise that will
- **[06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHgDOwdZtfQ&t=396s)** — increase a great amount of demand for energy. And then that's going to tap into your reserve,
- **[06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHgDOwdZtfQ&t=402s)** — which is the midsection fat over here. A couple of things you need to know about exercise.
- **[06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHgDOwdZtfQ&t=407s)** — You want to make sure you don't over train because if you over train, it's going to
- **[06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHgDOwdZtfQ&t=410s)** — stress. So it's very, very important exercise, like high intensity, maybe
- **[06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHgDOwdZtfQ&t=417s)** — three times a week, maybe two times a week. Recently I am running up hills for exercise,
- **[07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHgDOwdZtfQ&t=423s)** — like really major intense hill running. I think I'll end up doing it maybe twice a week,
- **[07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHgDOwdZtfQ&t=430s)** — not three times a week because my body doesn't recover. And I do have a machine or a test
- **[07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHgDOwdZtfQ&t=435s)** — to determine that. That's going to be another video. But the point is that it's very easy
- **[07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHgDOwdZtfQ&t=439s)** — to over train. I will get much better results if I let my body rest in between this high
- **[07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHgDOwdZtfQ&t=445s)** — intensity exercise. And plus the high intensity exercise will stimulate growth hormone, which
- **[07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHgDOwdZtfQ&t=450s)** — is the main fat burning hormone, but only if you are sleeping. Okay. So I should put down
- **[07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHgDOwdZtfQ&t=457s)** — right here. Well, you can't see that sleep. Okay. Sleep to get more. Well,
- **[07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHgDOwdZtfQ&t=466s)** — you can't even see that, right? Let's put it right here. Okay. Sleep. So that's really
- **[07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHgDOwdZtfQ&t=472s)** — important to help with the stress. Stress and sleep are in the same category. It's going to
- **[07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHgDOwdZtfQ&t=477s)** — really help you because it's kind of like a foundational thing. If you're not sleeping
- **[08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHgDOwdZtfQ&t=482s)** — because you're stressed out, good luck with losing weight. Why? Because the cortisol prevents
- **[08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHgDOwdZtfQ&t=488s)** — you from tapping into this fat. And especially if you're trying to get rid of the midsection.
- **[08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHgDOwdZtfQ&t=493s)** — Very important. And this is why I'm spending a bit more time on it. All right. Number two,
- **[08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHgDOwdZtfQ&t=499s)** — what's happening in your liver is the liver is fatty. And so it's spilling off. So we must
- **[08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHgDOwdZtfQ&t=508s)** — use up the fat on your liver. Okay. Now there's two things that you can do to get
- **[08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHgDOwdZtfQ&t=514s)** — yourself into what's called ketosis, which is a type of fat burning, right? Because when your
- **[08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHgDOwdZtfQ&t=520s)** — burns fat or when you eat fat, that's mobilized into a more easily packaged type of energy
- **[08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHgDOwdZtfQ&t=529s)** — called ketones. That's why your body makes ketones. It can also run on fat fuel as well,
- **[08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHgDOwdZtfQ&t=535s)** — but ketones are like a better packaged fat fuel. So there's two sources of ketones. One
- **[09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHgDOwdZtfQ&t=542s)** — is your own fat. And number two is the dietary fat. And here's the thing to be able
- **[09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHgDOwdZtfQ&t=548s)** — to tap into either one of these fats. You must reduce your carbs, right? So the reduction of
- **[09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHgDOwdZtfQ&t=554s)** — carbs is important. And you probably already know that we must reduce the carbs, but reducing
- **[09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHgDOwdZtfQ&t=562s)** — the carbs will force your body to either burn fat from the calories that you eat or your own
- **[09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHgDOwdZtfQ&t=568s)** — fat. Now let's talk about, do we want to burn calories from the fat that you eat,
- **[09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHgDOwdZtfQ&t=575s)** — or do we want to burn your own stored fat? Well, that's a easy question. We want to burn
- **[09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHgDOwdZtfQ&t=582s)** — our own stored fat. So yes, it is true that the amount of calories of fat on the ketogenic
- **[09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHgDOwdZtfQ&t=590s)** — diet are much higher than other diets. But if you are trying to lose weight in your midsection,
- **[09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHgDOwdZtfQ&t=599s)** — adding a lot more dietary fat is not going to help you. So I'm going to recommend,
- **[10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHgDOwdZtfQ&t=605s)** — especially for this situation, is not to start adding additional fat. Don't go low fat,
- **[10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHgDOwdZtfQ&t=611s)** — but don't add a lot of fat. Don't add the MCT oil. Don't add the keto bombs and desserts.
- **[10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHgDOwdZtfQ&t=617s)** — Just don't do that because your body is going to tap into that as fuel and not your own fat.
- **[10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHgDOwdZtfQ&t=624s)** — Now I do recommend for some people to eat more fat to help them be more satisfied so they
- **[10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHgDOwdZtfQ&t=630s)** — can actually go longer within a minute fasting in the beginning of a program.
- **[10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHgDOwdZtfQ&t=634s)** — But if we're trying to quickly and rapidly get rid of this midsection fat, you don't want to
- **[10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHgDOwdZtfQ&t=641s)** — add a lot of fat to your diet unless you want to maintain your weight. So we want to right
- **[10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHgDOwdZtfQ&t=647s)** — here reduce dietary fat, but not to the point of going low fat. So don't go below 75 grams
- **[10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHgDOwdZtfQ&t=657s)** — of fat per day. I would just consume your fat from the normal proteins in nature that just come
- **[11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHgDOwdZtfQ&t=665s)** — with the fat, whether it's meat, eggs, and things like that. Don't go low fat. Don't eat
- **[11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHgDOwdZtfQ&t=669s)** — the egg whites alone. But what we're trying to do is we're trying to force your body to tap
- **[11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHgDOwdZtfQ&t=673s)** — into mainly your own fat. So that's number three. Number four. The real problem that
- **[11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHgDOwdZtfQ&t=683s)** — is in the liver. Because the liver is the organ that is overfilled with fat and it's spilling
- **[11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHgDOwdZtfQ&t=691s)** — off into the abdominal area. So in other words, you're going to have to do things to
- **[11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHgDOwdZtfQ&t=697s)** — get this fat off the liver and heal it and make it really healthy. If it was healthy,
- **[11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHgDOwdZtfQ&t=703s)** — chances are it can deal with all this extra fat and not have so much insulin resistance.
- **[11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHgDOwdZtfQ&t=709s)** — Because insulin resistance is a condition that is like a pre-diabetic condition,
- **[11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHgDOwdZtfQ&t=714s)** — metabolic syndrome. You have a lot of issues with that and you're definitely going to have a lot
- **[11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHgDOwdZtfQ&t=717s)** — more insulin and a lot more fat in the midsection. So anything we can do for the
- **[12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHgDOwdZtfQ&t=721s)** — liver is going to be very, very important. So what can we do for the liver? Well,
- **[12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHgDOwdZtfQ&t=727s)** — we already lower the carbs and some people can actually lose 50% of their fat off their
- **[12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHgDOwdZtfQ&t=733s)** — within two weeks getting on the low carb diet. But there are three important things
- **[12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHgDOwdZtfQ&t=741s)** — that you can take to supplement and help heal the liver. The one is apple cider vinegar.
- **[12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHgDOwdZtfQ&t=749s)** — That greatly improves insulin. It greatly helps a fatty liver. It greatly makes insulin more
- **[12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHgDOwdZtfQ&t=756s)** — sensitive to allow the insulin to work better in the body. So what you do is you take a
- **[12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHgDOwdZtfQ&t=763s)** — put it in 12 ounces of water. I like to put lemon in there too and maybe some electrolytes
- **[12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHgDOwdZtfQ&t=767s)** — and I'll drink that once, twice, or even three times a day. Very significant changes can occur
- **[12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHgDOwdZtfQ&t=775s)** — if you do that. The type of apple cider vinegar I use is from Fairchild's, not Bragg's,
- **[13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHgDOwdZtfQ&t=780s)** — because they don't dilute it. It's nice and strong and it's a really good company.
- **[13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHgDOwdZtfQ&t=784s)** — The second very important supplement is called milk thistle. Milk thistle is amazing. It's that
- **[13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHgDOwdZtfQ&t=793s)** — prickly plant that has those purple flowers that then turn into these white little
- **[13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHgDOwdZtfQ&t=799s)** — things at the end of a seed that look like parachutes. And so the wind blows, you can see
- **[13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHgDOwdZtfQ&t=803s)** — them all around in the fields where I live anyway. And they're all over the place. Milk
- **[13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHgDOwdZtfQ&t=809s)** — thistle is a very unique plant and you can get milk thistle seeds in tablet form. What's
- **[13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHgDOwdZtfQ&t=822s)** — high in liver protecting properties? Basically, it's like the antidote to a snake poisoning or a
- **[13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHgDOwdZtfQ&t=830s)** — mushroom poison. The most deadly mushroom is called the death cap mushroom. The antidote is
- **[13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHgDOwdZtfQ&t=836s)** — milk thistle. It's quite amazing. Tylenol poisoning, people that drink alcohol, this
- **[14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHgDOwdZtfQ&t=843s)** — can help protect the liver. But it's also really important for a fatty liver, in correcting
- **[14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHgDOwdZtfQ&t=849s)** — as well as reducing inflammation on a liver and also protecting the liver from getting cirrhosis
- **[14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHgDOwdZtfQ&t=857s)** — and helping with this gluconeogenesis issue where your liver is producing a lot more sugar
- **[14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHgDOwdZtfQ&t=864s)** — because it has insulin resistance. So it helps with a lot of different aspects of that liver,
- **[14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHgDOwdZtfQ&t=869s)** — as well as helping with midsection weight. And I put some research down below. You can check
- **[14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHgDOwdZtfQ&t=873s)** — it out. Milk thistle is a given. The third thing is Berberine. There's several studies that show
- **[14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHgDOwdZtfQ&t=882s)** — combining Berberine with milk thistle is a good idea. Berberine is kind of... I look at it like a
- **[14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHgDOwdZtfQ&t=889s)** — natural metformin without the side effects. But of course, I'm not making that claim.
- **[14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHgDOwdZtfQ&t=895s)** — And also I don't want to make any claims on milk thistle. All I can say is you can
- **[14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHgDOwdZtfQ&t=899s)** — read the research and it's pretty amazing with the research that's done on mice. So you can apply
- **[15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHgDOwdZtfQ&t=906s)** — it to humans if you want. But the point is that if it works on mice, maybe it can work on you.
- **[15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHgDOwdZtfQ&t=912s)** — But Berberine is a really good one with the milk thistle. It's good for diabetics and
- **[15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHgDOwdZtfQ&t=918s)** — pre-diabetics. And it helps the liver with this extra gluconeogenesis. One thing I want
- **[15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHgDOwdZtfQ&t=926s)** — to mention about people trying to lose weight... I watch people through the year go through this
- **[15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHgDOwdZtfQ&t=930s)** — cycle. And it's like this pattern. They just go crazy between Thanksgiving and Christmas and
- **[15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHgDOwdZtfQ&t=937s)** — New Year's and then they start all over again and they go through this New Year's resolution.
- **[15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHgDOwdZtfQ&t=942s)** — I think emotions and intelligence are inverted. People get wrapped up in emotions
- **[15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHgDOwdZtfQ&t=951s)** — at social activities, birthday parties, events, holidays, going out to dinner with friends. And I
- **[15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHgDOwdZtfQ&t=958s)** — watch this. And the intelligence or the IQ with foods goes out the window. People don't really
- **[16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHgDOwdZtfQ&t=964s)** — learn from their mistakes. They keep going in these same patterns over and over and over
- **[16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHgDOwdZtfQ&t=969s)** — again because they're eating things that they know are bad for the liver and they're drinking
- **[16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHgDOwdZtfQ&t=973s)** — alcohol that they know is bad for the liver. But they still do it because they're wrapped
- **[16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHgDOwdZtfQ&t=977s)** — up in the emotions. So I'm going to recommend that you step back for a second and really
- **[16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHgDOwdZtfQ&t=983s)** — re-evaluate your environment and the people around you. And just don't get in those situations.
- **[16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHgDOwdZtfQ&t=991s)** — Change the habits. In a person with belly fat, you have to realize that's not just
- **[16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHgDOwdZtfQ&t=997s)** — a minor thing. It's pathological. It's disease-creating. It's creating inflammation.
- **[16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHgDOwdZtfQ&t=1002s)** — It's creating problems in your liver. You might not see it inside, but it's not a healthy
- **[16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHgDOwdZtfQ&t=1007s)** — state. And so usually a person with belly fat doesn't have the luxury of continuing these bad
- **[16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHgDOwdZtfQ&t=1014s)** — habits over again because they're just doing the wrong things. They must focus on changing
- **[16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHgDOwdZtfQ&t=1019s)** — their habits. That's the most important thing they need to focus on because they're in this
- **[17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHgDOwdZtfQ&t=1024s)** — habit and they're going through the cycle. But the point is for me, I had to hit bottom
- **[17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHgDOwdZtfQ&t=1031s)** — before I made changes. I was the worst. I ate the worst food all the way up until my late 20s.
- **[17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHgDOwdZtfQ&t=1039s)** — I mean, I just wouldn't eat a little junk food. I would eat a tremendous amount of junk food,
- **[17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHgDOwdZtfQ&t=1044s)** — pots of coffee, pots of chocolate. I would never eat anything like vegetables or celery,
- **[17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHgDOwdZtfQ&t=1049s)** — any of that stuff. I only ate pure junk food for so many years. I had to hit bottom.
- **[17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHgDOwdZtfQ&t=1055s)** — Even when I hit bottom, it took me many years to feel terrible before I said,
- **[17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHgDOwdZtfQ&t=1062s)** — it's not worth it anymore. So now my liver is like a barometer. If I go off the program,
- **[17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHgDOwdZtfQ&t=1068s)** — my body does not react well. If I were to drink alcohol, I just would want to go to
- **[17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHgDOwdZtfQ&t=1073s)** — sleep. I think that's a good thing because I never in a million years would have gotten
- **[17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHgDOwdZtfQ&t=1077s)** — into health if I didn't have these health problems. So I have a lot of personal
- **[18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHgDOwdZtfQ&t=1082s)** — experience doing this. And I do know I used to get wrapped up in the emotion of it and I've
- **[18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHgDOwdZtfQ&t=1087s)** — corrected that. But for some people, it takes them a bit longer before they learn from their
- **[18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHgDOwdZtfQ&t=1093s)** — mistakes. And then number five is omet. One meal a day in a minute fasting. If this doesn't
- **[18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHgDOwdZtfQ&t=1102s)** — happen right here, if a person still eats frequently and snacks, I don't think these
- **[18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHgDOwdZtfQ&t=1108s)** — other things are going to work. This is probably one of the most important things
- **[18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHgDOwdZtfQ&t=1111s)** — right here. Actually, the most important thing because when you don't eat, you force your body
- **[18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHgDOwdZtfQ&t=1119s)** — to live off its fat reserves. So it's like a pure fat burning experience. You can get into
- **[18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHgDOwdZtfQ&t=1126s)** — deep ketosis if you combine low carb, OMAD with exercise. And when I say OMAD, you don't
- **[18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHgDOwdZtfQ&t=1133s)** — have to start off with one meal a day. You can start off with two meals a day,
- **[18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHgDOwdZtfQ&t=1136s)** — but try to keep the time close. Like maybe have a late lunch, early dinner. And if you
- **[19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHgDOwdZtfQ&t=1142s)** — really want to take it to the next level, just don't eat if you're not hungry.
- **[19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHgDOwdZtfQ&t=1146s)** — Which means you might go one meal every other day and you're going to tap into
- **[19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHgDOwdZtfQ&t=1154s)** — like a vacuum, all this fat off your liver and pull it off. You'll see some very quick
- **[19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHgDOwdZtfQ&t=1159s)** — changes. Very, very important. And that is the way to really speed everything up. So this is
- **[19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHgDOwdZtfQ&t=1163s)** — a foundational thing. And what's cool about it is when you don't eat, your body is eating,
- **[19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHgDOwdZtfQ&t=1171s)** — so you're not starving it. You're actually creating a tremendous amount of health by not
- **[19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHgDOwdZtfQ&t=1176s)** — eating from many different angles, especially just stripping off all this fat off of your
- **[19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHgDOwdZtfQ&t=1182s)** — liver. And just to go back to this low carb thing, the ketogenic diet, I didn't talk
- **[19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHgDOwdZtfQ&t=1189s)** — what to eat. You can find that in my video. I'll put it down below. But also,
- **[19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHgDOwdZtfQ&t=1194s)** — OMAD, when you eat certain foods, what type of foods would be good for correcting this
- **[20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHgDOwdZtfQ&t=1200s)** — situation? And there's a couple interesting nutrients that I want to share with you.
- **[20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHgDOwdZtfQ&t=1204s)** — One is creatine and the other is carnasine. And both of those can help you with a fatty
- **[20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHgDOwdZtfQ&t=1211s)** — liver. Both of those can help you with increasing more energy to exercise. Both of those can help
- **[20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHgDOwdZtfQ&t=1219s)** — you mobilize the fat through the mitochondria down here and produce more ATP efficiently.
- **[20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHgDOwdZtfQ&t=1228s)** — And those two compounds, creatine and carnasine, are the highest in red meat. So I would
- **[20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHgDOwdZtfQ&t=1237s)** — highly recommend doing red meat several times a week or hamburger or things like that from a
- **[20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHgDOwdZtfQ&t=1243s)** — quality source, grass-fed, grass-finished red meat or a steak because you have a lot of
- **[20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHgDOwdZtfQ&t=1249s)** — factors in there. You have a lot of nutrients, there's virtually no carbs, and you have that
- **[20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHgDOwdZtfQ&t=1254s)** — carnasine and creatine that can help you. And I'll put the studies down below. I don't
- **[21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHgDOwdZtfQ&t=1260s)** — even think you need to take them as a supplement. Just get it from red meat.
- **[21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHgDOwdZtfQ&t=1263s)** — All right, number six, it's staying very aware.
- **[21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHgDOwdZtfQ&t=1273s)** — Okay, and not slipping into this emotional thing that people go through these different holidays.
- **[21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHgDOwdZtfQ&t=1281s)** — Staying very aware of what works, what doesn't work, of your past mistakes, and just
- **[21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHgDOwdZtfQ&t=1290s)** — don't keep making them. So keep your awareness up and kind of like just
- **[21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHgDOwdZtfQ&t=1295s)** — be in the present, right? And so you don't kind of slide into this thing. I think this is very
- **[21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHgDOwdZtfQ&t=1299s)** — important too because this will help you be consistent, right? Because you're going to
- **[21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHgDOwdZtfQ&t=1304s)** — do all these things, it's going to work, and then you want to just keep building on your
- **[21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHgDOwdZtfQ&t=1309s)** — successes. So what I like to do is just each day get better and better and better. Okay,
- **[21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHgDOwdZtfQ&t=1315s)** — screw up, good. Then correct it, do better, and keep implementing the things that worked,
- **[21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHgDOwdZtfQ&t=1319s)** — and then get rid of the things that don't work. Okay, so I think this is going to be
- **[22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHgDOwdZtfQ&t=1323s)** — important too because how many people just either forget what they did or just ignore it. They
- **[22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHgDOwdZtfQ&t=1329s)** — just slide into this whole thing, which the logic goes out the window, and so does their
- **[22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHgDOwdZtfQ&t=1335s)** — health. So anyway, I think these actions can really take you to the next level if you want to
- **[22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHgDOwdZtfQ&t=1340s)** — get rid of your belly fat or whatever you want to call it. Central obesity, visceral fat,
- **[22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHgDOwdZtfQ&t=1344s)** — or whatever. Now if you want special content that is not on YouTube, you should go to my site,

- **[00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwG_vxtCy_8&t=0s)** — You know, I get this question very often. What type of diet should someone with a genetic cholesterol problem have? And I'm talking about familial hypercholesterolemia.
- **[00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwG_vxtCy_8&t=11s)** — Now, you would logically think that if someone has a problem with cholesterol, okay, and with this condition, you have like 50% of the LDL receptors than a normal person.
- **[00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwG_vxtCy_8&t=23s)** — So that means you're going to have a buildup of LDL. So logically, it makes sense to just start reducing your cholesterol and your saturated fats, especially, right? Makes total sense.
- **[00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwG_vxtCy_8&t=34s)** — And this is something that has been recommended for probably, I don't know, 80 years. It's your standard recommendations from most medical professionals.
- **[00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwG_vxtCy_8&t=43s)** — But there's a fascinating research paper that I want to summarize right here that actually blew my mind. And I'm going to kind of give you the simple version and then you can click down below and read it for yourself.
- **[00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwG_vxtCy_8&t=58s)** — Of course, check with your doctor and don't come off any medications because of me.
- **[01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwG_vxtCy_8&t=61s)** — There is extremely poor evidence of recommending lowering your cholesterol and your saturated fats for the better outcomes.
- **[01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwG_vxtCy_8&t=72s)** — If you have this genetic cholesterol problem, despite these recommendations, lowering saturated fats and cholesterol to people with genetic cholesterol problems, they still have a significant increased risk of dying from a heart attack.
- **[01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwG_vxtCy_8&t=87s)** — And the name of this research paper is called Dietary Recommendations for Familial Hypercholesterolemia. And when they mention evidence-free zone, they're talking about a severe lack of evidence.
- **[01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwG_vxtCy_8&t=98s)** — 85% of the population who has genetic problems with their cholesterol don't even know they have it. And I'm definitely not telling you that having high LDL or high cholesterol is not going to affect your heart in a negative way.
- **[01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwG_vxtCy_8&t=112s)** — I'm just sharing a new viewpoint that you really seriously need to look at if you have high cholesterol.
- **[01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwG_vxtCy_8&t=118s)** — And I really just want you to start questioning if lowering your cholesterol and the saturated fat in your diet is the best strategy you should be focusing on.
- **[02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwG_vxtCy_8&t=129s)** — They also quoted an additional study that compared one group consuming low fat, the other group consuming low carb, and both groups had this genetic cholesterol problem.
- **[02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwG_vxtCy_8&t=143s)** — And the group that lowered their carbohydrate had a significantly lowered risk of dying from a heart attack. And this is despite, okay, despite consuming three times the amount of saturated fat.
- **[02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwG_vxtCy_8&t=160s)** — So in other words, the low carb group consumed three times more fat than the dietary low fat group, which is just fascinating.
- **[02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwG_vxtCy_8&t=170s)** — But if someone's going to start lowering their dietary fat, okay, and their cholesterol, usually they're going to replace it with more carbs.
- **[02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwG_vxtCy_8&t=177s)** — So let me just summarize a couple things about this study.
- **[02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwG_vxtCy_8&t=179s)** — The current dietary guidelines for management of coronary heart disease in familial hypercholesterolemia is based on outdated and unsupported information.
- **[03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwG_vxtCy_8&t=192s)** — Number two, there's no evidence to support the recommendations which are given to these individuals with this cholesterol genetic problem of consuming a low saturated fat diet or a low cholesterol diet.
- **[03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwG_vxtCy_8&t=204s)** — Number three, a low carbohydrate diet was found to significantly improve cardiovascular disease biomarkers.
- **[03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwG_vxtCy_8&t=212s)** — And we're talking about these indicators like obesity, high blood pressure, coronary artery calcification test, which is a really good indicator to tell what's going on inside.
- **[03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwG_vxtCy_8&t=223s)** — Also high insulin or insulin resistance, inflammation or inflammatory biomarkers.
- **[03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwG_vxtCy_8&t=229s)** — And then we have high triglycerides and high glucose as in diabetes.
- **[03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwG_vxtCy_8&t=234s)** — You see those factors are so much more important than just trying to lower your cholesterol.
- **[04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwG_vxtCy_8&t=241s)** — Another factor that you should really look at through an advanced lipid profile test to look at your LDL, okay, to see what type of particle size that you have.
- **[04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwG_vxtCy_8&t=251s)** — There's two different types of LDL.
- **[04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwG_vxtCy_8&t=254s)** — One type is the small dense particle size, and the other is the large buoyant particle size.
- **[04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwG_vxtCy_8&t=262s)** — And you want the large buoyant particle size because the small dense particles can lodge into the inside of the artery and create a problem.
- **[04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwG_vxtCy_8&t=271s)** — And it just so happens that a high carbohydrate diet is associated with these small dense LDLs.
- **[04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwG_vxtCy_8&t=278s)** — Those are the pathogenic ones that you have to be aware of.
- **[04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwG_vxtCy_8&t=281s)** — The other thing to focus more on would be the clotting factors to see if you clot more.
- **[04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwG_vxtCy_8&t=286s)** — So unfortunately, that's kind of downplayed sometimes when it actually is a way more significant risk factor than just having high LDL.
- **[04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwG_vxtCy_8&t=293s)** — And another point they mentioned in the summary section of this study is that there is sufficient rationale for conducting clinical trials to assess the effects of a low carb diet on familial hyper cholesterol alemia individuals with insulin resistance.
- **[05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwG_vxtCy_8&t=308s)** — Okay, which I think is a really, really important point.
- **[05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwG_vxtCy_8&t=312s)** — If you have a genetic problem with cholesterol and you manage the risk factors, obesity, insulin resistance, the high blood pressure and all these other things, by being on a low carb diet, your outcomes are going to be so much better.
- **[05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwG_vxtCy_8&t=326s)** — But to get the entire medical profession on board, we need these clinical trials.
- **[05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwG_vxtCy_8&t=330s)** — So, and this is just my opinion. Instead of focusing on lowering the saturated fat, lowering your cholesterol, you should be focusing on lowering your carbohydrates.
- **[05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwG_vxtCy_8&t=342s)** — Now this flies right into the face of the medical profession. This is definitely not the consensus.
- **[05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwG_vxtCy_8&t=348s)** — It's definitely an alternative view. And all I'm asking you to do is to take a look at it, look at the research for yourself, and then test things out.
- **[05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwG_vxtCy_8&t=356s)** — Go on a ketogenic diet and then go get your values tested and then go on the other diet that everyone's recommending.
- **[06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwG_vxtCy_8&t=362s)** — And then you compare the results to see what's best for you. But the point is that we assume that this research is already done and the science is settled, but it's not settled.
- **[06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwG_vxtCy_8&t=374s)** — So if you have this genetic problem, there's a couple of things that you really need to focus on, right?
- **[06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwG_vxtCy_8&t=378s)** — Number one, going on the healthy version of the ketogenic diet, because the biggest risk factor for this condition is heart problems, right?
- **[06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwG_vxtCy_8&t=389s)** — So the healthy version of the ketogenic diet has the ingredients that support the inside lining of the heart.
- **[06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwG_vxtCy_8&t=396s)** — I would also recommend doing intermittent fasting, which will lower insulin, because going in the high carb diet creates more inflammation in the arteries.
- **[06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwG_vxtCy_8&t=403s)** — And we're trying to prevent a heart attack, okay? Not create it. A couple key nutrients that I would recommend would be...
- **[06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwG_vxtCy_8&t=411s)** — and this is based on some pretty powerful research, extracts of red yeast, and then another one called polycosinol.
- **[06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwG_vxtCy_8&t=418s)** — Now that's, believe it or not, from sugar cane, but there's no sugar in it, okay?
- **[07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwG_vxtCy_8&t=422s)** — But apparently it's a good combination with the red yeast to help keep the cholesterol in check.
- **[07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwG_vxtCy_8&t=430s)** — Niacin, not niacinamide, is another good thing to take to help regulate cholesterol.
- **[07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwG_vxtCy_8&t=435s)** — And of course, exercise is important. Garlic can help thin the blood and prevent the stickiness to the platelets.
- **[07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwG_vxtCy_8&t=443s)** — And then the last thing that I would recommend is tocatrinols.
- **[07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwG_vxtCy_8&t=445s)** — That's a type of vitamin E that really supports the inside layer of your arteries to prevent against oxidation, prevent against scarring and plaquing.
- **[07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwG_vxtCy_8&t=455s)** — And it's probably one of the best antioxidants for the heart.
- **[07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwG_vxtCy_8&t=460s)** — Tocatrinols. Don't buy it with the tocopherols. Get it as a standalone.
- **[07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwG_vxtCy_8&t=465s)** — Other points in addition to that would be to realize that steroids and stress can increase cholesterol.
- **[07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwG_vxtCy_8&t=471s)** — And I'm talking about the bad type, okay?
- **[07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwG_vxtCy_8&t=473s)** — Also, birth control pills or estrogen therapy can increase your cholesterol.
- **[07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwG_vxtCy_8&t=478s)** — And of course, any type of sugar will do it.
- **[08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwG_vxtCy_8&t=480s)** — Smoking will greatly worsen the situation.
- **[08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwG_vxtCy_8&t=482s)** — And of course, alcohol.
- **[08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwG_vxtCy_8&t=484s)** — And diuretics can also worsen the situation, as well as beta blockers.
- **[08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwG_vxtCy_8&t=488s)** — Now, like I said before, like 85% of the population doesn't even know they have this condition.
- **[08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwG_vxtCy_8&t=493s)** — But there are a few indicators that can give it away other than getting a test.
- **[08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwG_vxtCy_8&t=499s)** — One is these little fat deposits on your Achilles tendons.
- **[08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwG_vxtCy_8&t=505s)** — And they also can form on your wrists, as well as on your eyelids.
- **[08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwG_vxtCy_8&t=510s)** — They're called xanthomas. It's basically cholesterol building up in the tissues.
- **[08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwG_vxtCy_8&t=515s)** — You can also have a condition called Arcus senilis, which is a little whitening around the iris of your eye.
- **[08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwG_vxtCy_8&t=521s)** — So again, check with your doctor before taking any of these recommendations.
- **[08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwG_vxtCy_8&t=524s)** — I just wanted to create this video food for thought, something to look at, something to question.
- **[08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwG_vxtCy_8&t=531s)** — And if you have not seen my video on niacin, that's a really good one to get the full picture.
- **[08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwG_vxtCy_8&t=537s)** — And I put that up right here.

- **[00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gA0p8WkGSCw&t=0s)** — Today I want to talk about the best remedy for dry, wrinkled hands, as well as skin in general.
- **[00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gA0p8WkGSCw&t=6s)** — Well, I recently found some updated information on this that I want to share with you that I think
- **[00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gA0p8WkGSCw&t=10s)** — you'll be quite excited about. People use these moisturizers and they keep putting them on their
- **[00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gA0p8WkGSCw&t=15s)** — hands and their face. And of course, the next day the effect is gone. They have to keep doing
- **[00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gA0p8WkGSCw&t=20s)** — it over and over and over. If you look at the labels and read the ingredients in most of
- **[00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gA0p8WkGSCw&t=26s)** — moisturizers, they nearly all have alcohol. Alcohol dries and dehydrates your skin. And I don't think
- **[00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gA0p8WkGSCw&t=33s)** — people realize that when they put lotion to the hands or on their face, it gets absorbed. It goes
- **[00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gA0p8WkGSCw&t=39s)** — into the bloodstream and then it ends up in your liver. There are a lot of different things
- **[00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gA0p8WkGSCw&t=43s)** — you can use that are natural. Vitamin E, you can use various like coconut oil, you can use
- **[00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gA0p8WkGSCw&t=50s)** — but what I want to talk about today is something a little different. It's called
- **[00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gA0p8WkGSCw&t=55s)** — hyaluronic acid. A lot of your cells, if not all of your cells, make this very specific
- **[01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gA0p8WkGSCw&t=60s)** — compound. And hyaluronic acid is not just in your skin, it's in your joints. It helps hold
- **[01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gA0p8WkGSCw&t=68s)** — a thousand times its weight in water. Now, as far as it relating to your skin, if you kind
- **[01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gA0p8WkGSCw&t=74s)** — of envision having this body size wetsuit, that's what it would look like. It's a very thin layer
- **[01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gA0p8WkGSCw&t=79s)** — and it's in the deep layer of your skin. It keeps your skin looking youthful. It's also
- **[01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gA0p8WkGSCw&t=86s)** — involved in wound repair and also repair after sunburn. It actually increases if you have
- **[01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gA0p8WkGSCw&t=92s)** — enough vitamin A. And this could be why when someone's deficient in vitamin A, they get
- **[01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gA0p8WkGSCw&t=98s)** — dry eyes, for example, or even dry skin. But even the fluid inside your eye has a lot of
- **[01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gA0p8WkGSCw&t=105s)** — hyaluronic acid. So what people don't realize is as they age, especially when they start to get
- **[01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gA0p8WkGSCw&t=111s)** — 40, 45, 50 years old, it starts to go down and down and down and down to the point
- **[01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gA0p8WkGSCw&t=116s)** — where you're 80 years old, you've lost 80% of your hyaluronic acid. I don't know if you've
- **[02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gA0p8WkGSCw&t=122s)** — heard of the disease called progeria. Kids with progeria lose 20 times as much hyaluronic acid
- **[02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gA0p8WkGSCw&t=130s)** — as someone who doesn't have that disease. So you can see in this image of someone with
- **[02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gA0p8WkGSCw&t=135s)** — young youthful skin, then if you compare that to someone that has older skin, you can see it
- **[02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gA0p8WkGSCw&t=140s)** — kind of is wrinkled and it's missing something. Hyaluronic acid. Now there's certain
- **[02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gA0p8WkGSCw&t=145s)** — clinics that you can go to to get this substance injected into the skin. People apply
- **[02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gA0p8WkGSCw&t=149s)** — it topically. Some people take it orally. That's what I'm going to talk about today.
- **[02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gA0p8WkGSCw&t=155s)** — Some people will tell you that it cannot be absorbed if you consume it. That's absolutely
- **[02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gA0p8WkGSCw&t=160s)** — not true. You don't absorb a lot of it, but you do absorb some of it, like 2.5% of it.
- **[02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gA0p8WkGSCw&t=166s)** — And that can be just enough to replace what you're losing as you age. Now, Connie Chung
- **[02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gA0p8WkGSCw&t=172s)** — did this whole show on hyaluronic acid and she interviewed people in Japan because in a
- **[02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gA0p8WkGSCw&t=178s)** — village you had 100 year old people that were still working. And apparently it was attributed
- **[03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gA0p8WkGSCw&t=184s)** — to a certain root that they were consuming that was very high in hyaluronic acid.
- **[03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gA0p8WkGSCw&t=191s)** — Let's say you're 45 years old. You might have between like 14 to 15 grams of this
- **[03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gA0p8WkGSCw&t=197s)** — hyaluronic acid in your body. By the time you reach 80 years old, you might only have
- **[03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gA0p8WkGSCw&t=203s)** — like 3.6 grams. So based on that data, it might be a good idea to start taking it as a
- **[03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gA0p8WkGSCw&t=209s)** — supplement. Now, one thing I would caution you on, you don't want to do what a friend of mine
- **[03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gA0p8WkGSCw&t=215s)** — did. He had this idea that he was going to take high doses. Okay, so he took, I think it
- **[03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gA0p8WkGSCw&t=221s)** — was like three or four thousand milligrams of this stuff per day. You don't want to do that
- **[03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gA0p8WkGSCw&t=228s)** — because it swells up in your body. Remember it holds water, right? So he took way too much
- **[03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gA0p8WkGSCw&t=235s)** — and he started having some serious problems and he basically found he had to drink actually
- **[04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gA0p8WkGSCw&t=241s)** — straight brandy to help dissolve some of this gel that was plugging everything up. And so he
- **[04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gA0p8WkGSCw&t=248s)** — did survive and there's more to that story which I'll leave in another video. But you
- **[04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gA0p8WkGSCw&t=257s)** — want to take 200 milligrams per day. But also what I'm going to recommend is to get it topically
- **[04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gA0p8WkGSCw&t=265s)** — but make sure you get the one that does not have alcohol. And what you do is you wet your
- **[04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gA0p8WkGSCw&t=271s)** — hands, okay, and then you put a couple drops in your hands, rub it together and just rub it
- **[04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gA0p8WkGSCw&t=278s)** — throughout your hands and do that like once or twice a day. I'd also recommend that you
- **[04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gA0p8WkGSCw&t=283s)** — put a little tiny water in your hand, put a couple more drops, rub it into your hands,
- **[04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gA0p8WkGSCw&t=288s)** — and rub it through your face as well to help with hydration. The other important thing that
- **[04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gA0p8WkGSCw&t=293s)** — I always emphasize is that you really need to work on creating internal health. Starting with
- **[05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gA0p8WkGSCw&t=300s)** — the basic eating, right? It has to be good foods, nutrient dense. And so in other words,
- **[05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gA0p8WkGSCw&t=306s)** — I'm recommending the healthy version of the ketogenic diet to make sure that you're covering
- **[05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gA0p8WkGSCw&t=311s)** — all bases. So for that information, you should watch this video right here. Check it out.

## Full Transcript with Timestamps

*Click any timestamp to jump to that moment in the video*

- **[00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NbFQ2al6Jn4&t=0s)** — Today we are going to talk about the best foods for arthritis.
- **[00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NbFQ2al6Jn4&t=4s)** — We are talking about osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, in fact any idesis.
- **[00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NbFQ2al6Jn4&t=10s)** — So the first thing you want to do is you want to go and search out the official recommendation for foods for arthritis.
- **[00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NbFQ2al6Jn4&t=19s)** — So there are many different official sites but the one we are going to go to today is probably one of the most credible sites according to Google.
- **[00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NbFQ2al6Jn4&t=26s)** — And that is the Arthritis Foundation. And then what you are going to do is take a look at all the foods that they recommend.
- **[00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NbFQ2al6Jn4&t=35s)** — Now we are not going to use this list of what to eat. We are going to use this list on what to avoid.
- **[00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NbFQ2al6Jn4&t=43s)** — Because usually whatever the consensus is of what you should do medically, you should go in the opposite direction.
- **[00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NbFQ2al6Jn4&t=50s)** — So let's see what they say to do. Well for starters, our diet rich in whole foods, fruits, vegetables, fish, nuts, beans, whole grains, and of course avoiding the saturated fats.
- **[01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NbFQ2al6Jn4&t=67s)** — Now there is a few things on this that I do agree with. Number one, fish. And of course vegetables except there are some caveats to that which I will explain.
- **[01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NbFQ2al6Jn4&t=76s)** — So when you have arthritis, you have inflammation, right? So we are trying to get rid of inflammation. So when you consume a lot of fruits, you are going to generate a lot of sugar.
- **[01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NbFQ2al6Jn4&t=85s)** — And this is going to bump you out of ketosis and this is going to create more inflammation. And of course their explanation is that fruits are high in antioxidants.
- **[01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NbFQ2al6Jn4&t=94s)** — Well that is true but they are also high in sugar as well. Now they also recommend nuts because nuts have antioxidants.
- **[01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NbFQ2al6Jn4&t=102s)** — Well there is really only one nut that I would recommend if you have arthritis and that would be walnuts because it gives you the precursor. It is called ALA that turns into EPA in DHA which is the omega 3 fatty acids.
- **[01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NbFQ2al6Jn4&t=116s)** — Now you are not going to get a lot of conversion but you will get some. But unfortunately the rest of the nuts are high in omega 6 fatty acids and they can be inflammatory especially if you are doing like the nut butters.
- **[02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NbFQ2al6Jn4&t=128s)** — Now what about beans? Ok aren't beans good for arthritis? Because they are also high in antioxidants. Well the problem with beans is they are also high in lectins and oxalates which are anti-nutrients that can aggravate arthritis.
- **[02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NbFQ2al6Jn4&t=142s)** — Not to mention they are a bit high in carbs and they can really interrupt your digestive process. And I would venture to say that a lot of arthritis has to do with inflammation in the gut.
- **[02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NbFQ2al6Jn4&t=154s)** — Now of course the next big one that the Arthritis Foundation recommends is these whole grains. Whole grains because they are loaded with antioxidants. But they are also loaded with carbohydrates. They are loaded with gluten. They are loaded with oxalates.
- **[02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NbFQ2al6Jn4&t=169s)** — So all of these are going to aggravate arthritis. But the big problem with grains is that they are very high in the omega 6 fatty acids. So this leads to the next topic. What they say to avoid. They say red meats, eggs and dairy.
- **[03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NbFQ2al6Jn4&t=186s)** — Ok. Well let's talk about these three things right here. What you need to know about this to make it really simple is that when you eat animals that are fed with grains you are going to get a much different profile as far as the omega 6 to the omega 3 ratios.
- **[03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NbFQ2al6Jn4&t=201s)** — So the question is, is red meat bad? It depends on what the animal ate. Now what about chickens? Well chickens are probably one of the most highest sources of omega 6 fatty acids.
- **[03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NbFQ2al6Jn4&t=211s)** — So if you get chickens from the farmers market you are going to get a much better profile. You are going to get less omega 6 because they are free ranged hopefully. And so they consume more bugs, maybe less grains.
- **[03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NbFQ2al6Jn4&t=226s)** — And so when you have pasture raised organic eggs you are getting a much better profile with these ratios. Now what about dairy? Where does dairy come from? Cow milk.
- **[03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NbFQ2al6Jn4&t=236s)** — Conventional cow milk can turn into a good product if you ferment it. I am talking about like grass fed plain kefir, whole milk kefir. I think that can help your gut and help arthritis.
- **[04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NbFQ2al6Jn4&t=251s)** — If you can find cheese from grass fed cows that is made from raw milk cheese like they do in Europe that is much better than American cheese. So again you just have to differentiate the source of what that animal ate.
- **[04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NbFQ2al6Jn4&t=264s)** — Same thing with fish. We have farm raised fish versus wild caught. Big difference in the omega 6 to omega 3 ratios. So to keep this really simple you want to have wild caught fatty fish like salmon, sardines, cod liver.
- **[04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NbFQ2al6Jn4&t=282s)** — You can get it in a can, wild caught. The cool thing about cod liver or cod liver oil is it is very high in omega 3 but it is also high in vitamin D and vitamin A. Whereas fish oil doesn't have that.
- **[04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NbFQ2al6Jn4&t=295s)** — But fatty fish is really important. Farm raised fish is not a good deal. Seafood actually is a good source of omega 3. Omega 3 is anti-inflammatory. Pasture raised organic eggs is a good source of not only omega 3 but vitamin D.
- **[05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NbFQ2al6Jn4&t=312s)** — The problem with getting vitamin D from our foods is it is just very difficult to find foods high in vitamin D. Vitamin D is a very powerful anti-inflammatory for arthritis so you would want to consume the foods that align with that.
- **[05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NbFQ2al6Jn4&t=327s)** — Like even with pork for example. Pigs that free range, that go outside the barn, that get sun have a much higher level of vitamin D than the pigs that are confined to a physical structure and they can never leave.
- **[05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NbFQ2al6Jn4&t=341s)** — Now fermented vegetables are good for arthritis especially cabbage as in sauerkraut or even cabbage juice is really good for the gut and it is also good for arthritis. But vegetables in general is a crap shoot. Sometimes it can help your arthritis, sometimes it can make it worse.
- **[05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NbFQ2al6Jn4&t=357s)** — It is all dependent on how much inflammation you have in your gut because a lot of people with arthritis have itis in the colon too and if they do more fiber even vegetables that can make things worse.
- **[06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NbFQ2al6Jn4&t=371s)** — So some people that have arthritis will do very good if they completely eliminate any fiber and do the carnivore diet which is a lot of saturated fat and protein which is interesting.
- **[06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NbFQ2al6Jn4&t=381s)** — And of course on the avoid list, avoid sugar, refine grains, avoid whole grains which have gluten in it that turn into sugar really quickly, avoid trans fats, anything with the word hydrogenated whether it is partially hydrogenated or just hydrogenated you want to avoid that.
- **[06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NbFQ2al6Jn4&t=401s)** — Seed oils are really bad for arthritis and so that would include the soy, the corn, the canola, the cottonseed, even the peanut oils, safflower oils. These are all seed oils and our bodies are not designed to consume this refined concentrated oil.
- **[07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NbFQ2al6Jn4&t=420s)** — They are very susceptible to oxidation and they can create a lot of problems especially for arthritis. So a much better source would be coconut oil, grass-fed butter, using actual lard or tallow to cook your food in.
- **[07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NbFQ2al6Jn4&t=435s)** — And of course avoid things like canned foods. Unless those canned foods are sardines or cod liver, I would avoid them. Another interesting thing to avoid would be the powdered protein.
- **[07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NbFQ2al6Jn4&t=448s)** — Both plant-based protein and other types of lean protein powders. Your liver just does not do well on them and you may find that it stirs up your arthritis especially whey protein and soy protein isolates and even pea protein can do it.
- **[07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NbFQ2al6Jn4&t=466s)** — You want to consume protein that normally comes with the fat. So a natural whole food source of protein. Now a couple additional things if you are on the ketogenic diet.
- **[07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NbFQ2al6Jn4&t=479s)** — You may find that the oxalates in the food are stirring up your arthritis. And the foods that are high in oxalates are in spinach, rhubarb, chocolate, kiwi, almonds.
- **[08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NbFQ2al6Jn4&t=490s)** — But I think if you follow the information in this video, if you have arthritis you will see a dramatic decrease in inflammation within a couple days.
- **[08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NbFQ2al6Jn4&t=502s)** — The last very important point is doing intermittent fasting because the more times you eat you are going to create this interaction with food in your gut and create more problems.
- **[08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NbFQ2al6Jn4&t=512s)** — It is a natural anti-inflammatory. So it is not just what you eat, it is also the frequency of eating that is very important in getting rid of inflammation.
- **[08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NbFQ2al6Jn4&t=521s)** — Now if you want more details on what to eat and you have not seen this video, I put it up right here. Check it out.

- **[00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjmtrhJSAqc&t=0s)** — So I had some requests to do a video on this drug called Osmpick. And this is a drug that's very
- **[00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjmtrhJSAqc&t=5s)** — popular which is used for weight loss. It's an injectable drug. I'm not going to deny it does
- **[00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjmtrhJSAqc&t=10s)** — work, but it comes with a package. Some slight minor problems which I'll discuss. But first
- **[00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjmtrhJSAqc&t=16s)** — let's talk about why it actually works. What Osmpick does to the body is it increases a
- **[00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjmtrhJSAqc&t=23s)** — certain receptor called GLP1 which helps slow down digestion, thereby decreasing your appetite,
- **[00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjmtrhJSAqc&t=32s)** — cravings, so you're no longer hungry and you can eat less and lose more weight. It even improves
- **[00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjmtrhJSAqc&t=39s)** — the beta cells of the pancreas to help restore insulin levels. In fact, it's been known to
- **[00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjmtrhJSAqc&t=45s)** — improve insulin resistance. And anything that improves insulin resistance will help you lose
- **[00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjmtrhJSAqc&t=50s)** — It has some interesting effects on the liver too. It actually helps a person stop making
- **[00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjmtrhJSAqc&t=55s)** — so much sugar. That's called gluconeogenesis. And also it helps slow the breakdown of sugar
- **[01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjmtrhJSAqc&t=61s)** — in the liver. So this is why it's used with diabetics. It can help blood sugars.
- **[01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjmtrhJSAqc&t=66s)** — It sounds pretty cool, right? Well, it has some slight problems. Number one, it's a bit
- **[01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjmtrhJSAqc&t=70s)** — expensive. It's between I think $1,300 to $1,500 a month. And it has some slight minor
- **[01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjmtrhJSAqc&t=77s)** — side effects like nausea, vomiting, bloating, abdominal pain, headaches, gas, constipation,
- **[01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjmtrhJSAqc&t=85s)** — diarrhea, heartburn, and dizziness. Some of those don't seem minor. They seem kind of major. But
- **[01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjmtrhJSAqc&t=90s)** — let's talk about the major side effects. Thyroid cancer. There's also been another
- **[01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjmtrhJSAqc&t=95s)** — side effect of suicidal thoughts. Pancreatitis, kidney disease, retinopathy, which is
- **[01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjmtrhJSAqc&t=102s)** — damage to the retina, muscle loss, and gastroparesis, where there's a situation where
- **[01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjmtrhJSAqc&t=107s)** — food is not emptying from your stomach too well. And some of these side effects don't occur
- **[01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjmtrhJSAqc&t=112s)** — for about three days. So you have three days without any side effects and all of a sudden
- **[01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjmtrhJSAqc&t=116s)** — they kick in. And when people get off the medications, many times they still have side
- **[02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjmtrhJSAqc&t=121s)** — effects for a period of five weeks because it takes five weeks to get it out of your system.
- **[02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjmtrhJSAqc&t=126s)** — And my question is, do you plan on taking this the rest of your life? What are the long
- **[02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjmtrhJSAqc&t=131s)** — term effects of this drug? Is it really going to solve your weight loss problem without giving
- **[02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjmtrhJSAqc&t=136s)** — another problem? But I'm going to recommend an alternative. Now this relates to certain
- **[02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjmtrhJSAqc&t=144s)** — herbs. Do you realize there are over 200,000 secondary metabolites? These are chemicals
- **[02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjmtrhJSAqc&t=150s)** — in plants that have therapeutic benefit to our bodies. In fact, 50% of all drugs are derived
- **[02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjmtrhJSAqc&t=160s)** — from these chemical compounds in plants. This is where Big Pharma gets their ideas. But of
- **[02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjmtrhJSAqc&t=166s)** — course, you can't patent them so you can't make a lot of money. So they're probably not going to
- **[02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjmtrhJSAqc&t=171s)** — be validated as much. But Chinese medicine, Indian medicine, all these ancient cultures have
- **[02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjmtrhJSAqc&t=178s)** — used plants for centuries. Even if we take a look at anti-diabetic effects, there's over
- **[03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjmtrhJSAqc&t=186s)** — 400 different phytonutrients in plants that have this interesting anti-diabetic effect. And
- **[03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjmtrhJSAqc&t=194s)** — they don't give you all these side effects. In fact, rarely any side effects. So if you just
- **[03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjmtrhJSAqc&t=201s)** — do a search on the internet, or maybe Google Scholar on GLP-1 agonist, you'll find all
- **[03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjmtrhJSAqc&t=209s)** — sorts of herbs that come up for this. Two very popular ones are called Panex ginseng,
- **[03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjmtrhJSAqc&t=215s)** — and the second one is Berberine. In fact, Berberine is very, very potent. In fact,
- **[03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjmtrhJSAqc&t=221s)** — it kind of mimics the effects of metformin. So those are two things that I would definitely
- **[03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjmtrhJSAqc&t=225s)** — include on the list in addition to something else, which I want to recommend as well.
- **[03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjmtrhJSAqc&t=231s)** — And that is the healthy version of the ketogenic diet with, at the same time, doing
- **[03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjmtrhJSAqc&t=238s)** — intermittent fasting. Because if you combine low carb and healthy ingredients with not eating so
- **[04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjmtrhJSAqc&t=246s)** — frequently, I will guarantee within three days, your appetite is going to disappear.
- **[04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjmtrhJSAqc&t=252s)** — Without an appetite, without these cravings, it will make it very, very easy to do this.
- **[04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjmtrhJSAqc&t=257s)** — And include it as a part of your lifestyle so you can do it long term and at a fraction of
- **[04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjmtrhJSAqc&t=261s)** — the cost. You're basically going to be eating less frequently, so it's not going to cost you
- **[04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjmtrhJSAqc&t=266s)** — any money. You're just changing what you eat. And not only will your appetite disappear and
- **[04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjmtrhJSAqc&t=272s)** — but your cognitive function will improve. You'll have a much greater mood. You'll have improved
- **[04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjmtrhJSAqc&t=278s)** — liver function. You'll have less of a fatty liver. You'll be able to preserve your muscles.
- **[04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjmtrhJSAqc&t=283s)** — Your digestion will be better. I mean, just that alone is going to be huge. But let's just
- **[04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjmtrhJSAqc&t=288s)** — say you go the medical route and you do this and you lose weight, but you're tired and you
- **[04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjmtrhJSAqc&t=294s)** — have digestive bloating and you notice your muscles are shrinking and you have acid reflux.
- **[04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjmtrhJSAqc&t=298s)** — What are you going to do about all those symptoms? Is this going to be just taking more
- **[05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjmtrhJSAqc&t=301s)** — medication to handle or cover up those medications? I mean, you're going to feel miserable. So this
- **[05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjmtrhJSAqc&t=307s)** — is what I would recommend. I would get some Penex ginseng and Berberine. Do the healthy
- **[05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjmtrhJSAqc&t=313s)** — version of the ketogenic diet with intermittent fasting and just get started. Now, for
- **[05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjmtrhJSAqc&t=318s)** — information on how to do this in a healthy way, I put up this video right here. Check it out.

- **[00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aSZ-T2V--Rg&t=0s)** — Let's talk about the dark side of taking testosterone.
- **[00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aSZ-T2V--Rg&t=4s)** — Disclaimer, I'm not telling you to stop taking your testosterone.
- **[00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aSZ-T2V--Rg&t=7s)** — I'm not telling you that you shouldn't take testosterone.
- **[00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aSZ-T2V--Rg&t=10s)** — There are definitely positive benefits from testosterone.
- **[00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aSZ-T2V--Rg&t=13s)** — Increasing your libido, increasing your energy, your state of well-being, muscle strength.
- **[00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aSZ-T2V--Rg&t=19s)** — What about the negatives? What things should you be aware of?
- **[00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aSZ-T2V--Rg&t=23s)** — We have the hypothalamus in our brain that communicates with the pituitary
- **[00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aSZ-T2V--Rg&t=26s)** — that then sends signals down to the testicle that makes testosterone.
- **[00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aSZ-T2V--Rg&t=30s)** — Once you have enough testosterone, the testosterone kind of signals back
- **[00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aSZ-T2V--Rg&t=36s)** — to turn off that pituitary and hypothalamus so we don't keep having more and more of these hormones.
- **[00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aSZ-T2V--Rg&t=42s)** — When you start taking testosterone, you're basically sending signals to these other glands in your brain
- **[00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aSZ-T2V--Rg&t=50s)** — to tell it to turn off. And so your testicles don't have to make any more testosterone.
- **[00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aSZ-T2V--Rg&t=54s)** — So they go into a retirement. Now, is that permanent?
- **[00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aSZ-T2V--Rg&t=58s)** — It really depends on a lot of factors. How long you've taken it. Your genetics.
- **[01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aSZ-T2V--Rg&t=62s)** — Why would some men have these symptoms, yet not other men?
- **[01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aSZ-T2V--Rg&t=67s)** — Alright, number one, it can worsen your sleep apnea.
- **[01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aSZ-T2V--Rg&t=71s)** — Number two, it can affect your mood. You can get moody, cause acne, create dizziness.
- **[01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aSZ-T2V--Rg&t=76s)** — It can also potentially cause a heart attack.
- **[01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aSZ-T2V--Rg&t=79s)** — It can decrease fertility, not that most older men want another child.
- **[01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aSZ-T2V--Rg&t=85s)** — And also thicker blood. And I think the biggest side effect is testicular atrophy.
- **[01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aSZ-T2V--Rg&t=90s)** — It means that the testicles now get smaller and smaller and smaller.
- **[01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aSZ-T2V--Rg&t=93s)** — It can cause a loss of erections. So when you take testosterone for a long period of time,
- **[01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aSZ-T2V--Rg&t=100s)** — you can develop a problem in the receptors for testosterone where it doesn't work as well anymore.
- **[01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aSZ-T2V--Rg&t=106s)** — Number four, if we take a look at specifically age-related hypogonadism,
- **[01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aSZ-T2V--Rg&t=113s)** — that means your testicles are not functioning as well as they should.
- **[01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aSZ-T2V--Rg&t=116s)** — And you may say, well, it's just old age. Not with everyone.
- **[02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aSZ-T2V--Rg&t=120s)** — There's younger men that are getting this more and more and more.
- **[02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aSZ-T2V--Rg&t=124s)** — At the top of the list, if you have insulin resistance, that can definitely be a problem.
- **[02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aSZ-T2V--Rg&t=129s)** — Number two, lower amount of zinc.
- **[02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aSZ-T2V--Rg&t=131s)** — Zinc is involved with hundreds of different enzymes.
- **[02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aSZ-T2V--Rg&t=136s)** — In fact, sperm has a very high concentration of zinc to help the survival of the sperm connect with the egg.
- **[02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aSZ-T2V--Rg&t=144s)** — Another cause would be the person is protein deficient. They are not consuming enough protein.
- **[02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aSZ-T2V--Rg&t=151s)** — This next one is interesting. Low-fat diets. Why?
- **[02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aSZ-T2V--Rg&t=155s)** — Because cholesterol is the precursor to make testosterone.
- **[02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aSZ-T2V--Rg&t=162s)** — Statins also can cause lowered amount of testosterone. Why?
- **[02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aSZ-T2V--Rg&t=166s)** — Because statin blocks your production of cholesterol.
- **[02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aSZ-T2V--Rg&t=171s)** — Another one would be high soy diet. Another one is low vitamin A or low vitamin D.
- **[02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aSZ-T2V--Rg&t=179s)** — Overtraining. Probably because it increases cortisol.
- **[03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aSZ-T2V--Rg&t=183s)** — Insomnia and then also liver issues and inability to get rid of iron.
- **[03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aSZ-T2V--Rg&t=188s)** — Obesity. Because your fat cells release aromatase to convert testosterone to estrogen.
- **[03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aSZ-T2V--Rg&t=198s)** — Now that you know that, what do you do now to increase your testosterone?
- **[03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aSZ-T2V--Rg&t=202s)** — Weight training. It will really help you increase your testosterone.
- **[03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aSZ-T2V--Rg&t=206s)** — Number two, zinc. I would recommend both taking zinc and also consuming foods high in zinc.
- **[03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aSZ-T2V--Rg&t=211s)** — Shellfish, red meat, liver. Very important.
- **[03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aSZ-T2V--Rg&t=216s)** — Number three, vitamin D.
- **[03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aSZ-T2V--Rg&t=217s)** — Number four, having sufficient amount of fat in your diet.
- **[03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aSZ-T2V--Rg&t=222s)** — The butter, the meats. As long as you keep your carbs low.
- **[03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aSZ-T2V--Rg&t=227s)** — Some of you out there listening are like, wow, I can't have saturated fats.
- **[03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aSZ-T2V--Rg&t=232s)** — I cannot consume that much cholesterol because either my cholesterol is high or my doctor said not to do it.
- **[03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aSZ-T2V--Rg&t=238s)** — And you might be in doubt about that. You might be concerned because of all the confusion out there.
- **[04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aSZ-T2V--Rg&t=244s)** — And so if it was so bad, why does our bodies make it?
- **[04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aSZ-T2V--Rg&t=248s)** — DHEA might be a good supplement for you to help substantiate or fortify your adrenals.
- **[04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aSZ-T2V--Rg&t=254s)** — So that your adrenals can get some relief and make some more hormones.
- **[04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aSZ-T2V--Rg&t=258s)** — So you have some extra material for making testosterone.
- **[04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aSZ-T2V--Rg&t=264s)** — The other really important thing is getting enough REM sleep.
- **[04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aSZ-T2V--Rg&t=268s)** — So the non-REM sleep is like the deep delta wave sleep.
- **[04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aSZ-T2V--Rg&t=271s)** — And then the higher waves are the REM sleep. It's the rapid eye movement.
- **[04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aSZ-T2V--Rg&t=276s)** — And if you're losing more REM sleep, you won't have the level of testosterone.
- **[04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aSZ-T2V--Rg&t=281s)** — So this is why sleep is really important for your testosterone as well.
- **[04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aSZ-T2V--Rg&t=285s)** — We have videos on all sorts of things to help you sleep.
- **[04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aSZ-T2V--Rg&t=288s)** — And I will put a very specific recent video I did down below in the description.
- **[04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aSZ-T2V--Rg&t=293s)** — Next one is just losing weight in general. Why?
- **[04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aSZ-T2V--Rg&t=296s)** — Because when you have less fat cells, you have less aromatase, an enzyme,
- **[05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aSZ-T2V--Rg&t=302s)** — that is converting your testosterone to estrogen.
- **[05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aSZ-T2V--Rg&t=305s)** — If you're just starting out kind of a big person, over time when you lose weight,
- **[05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aSZ-T2V--Rg&t=311s)** — you will have more and more testosterone.
- **[05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aSZ-T2V--Rg&t=314s)** — And so if you want to know how to lose weight, I'll put that link down below as well.
- **[05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aSZ-T2V--Rg&t=317s)** — And the next one is kind of just optimizing your blood sugars,
- **[05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aSZ-T2V--Rg&t=320s)** — getting rid of this insulin resistance.
- **[05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aSZ-T2V--Rg&t=322s)** — And that's done with the ketogenic diet, as well as doing intermittent fasting.
- **[05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aSZ-T2V--Rg&t=327s)** — And the last one I kind of already mentioned, having sufficient amount of protein
- **[05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aSZ-T2V--Rg&t=332s)** — to optimize your level of testosterone. That's what we really want to do.
- **[05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aSZ-T2V--Rg&t=336s)** — We want to just bring it to a level where everything works fine.
- **[05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aSZ-T2V--Rg&t=340s)** — And if you do that, maybe you actually don't need to add testosterone
- **[05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aSZ-T2V--Rg&t=346s)** — because it comes with a package.
- **[05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aSZ-T2V--Rg&t=347s)** — Thanks for watching. And I think the best video to watch next is this one on cholesterol.
- **[05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aSZ-T2V--Rg&t=354s)** — Very important. It's about LDL. And you should know this data.
- **[05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aSZ-T2V--Rg&t=358s)** — I put it up right here. Check it out.

- **[00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYjQHkhzNB4&t=0s)** — So today I'm going to share some really interesting information on kidney stones. I think it's actually groundbreaking. I've done a lot of videos on kidney stones, but I've never talked about this one thing. The thing or the trigger that originates this kidney stone in the first place. I mean, when you think about it, it's just so weird that people develop stones in their kidney. Like, what's up with that? And the pain from kidney stones can be devastating. I mean, just unbearable. But this calcification thing is happening in other parts of the body too. Calcification
- **[00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYjQHkhzNB4&t=29s)** — of your joints as an arthritis. We get calcification or plucking in our arteries. Teeth as tartar. We even can get calcification in our eyes as in cataracts. It can even happen in the inner ear and create symptoms of ringing in the ear.
- **[00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYjQHkhzNB4&t=48s)** — When someone has Alzheimer's or even dementia, they found calcium deposits within the synapses of the brain. Then you get hardening of the arteries, which causes high blood pressure and even strokes. So there's a relationship with that. And even when you have gallstones, there's cholesterol there, but there's also calcium.
- **[01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYjQHkhzNB4&t=66s)** — Calcium deposits can also accumulate in the breast tissue. It can also occur with MS and even develop in your lymph nodes as in tonsil stones. So what the heck is going on with this calcium? Well, to figure this problem out, I always like to go to nature to see if there's a similar thing going on.
- **[01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYjQHkhzNB4&t=83s)** — And if we look at nature, okay, especially coral reefs, for example, that's a calcium deposit formation. Also, if you ever look at like hot springs, there's calcium formations going on with that. I mean, even if you look deep in the soil, you'll find limestone, right? Where does that come from? Well, we'll get into that. And even in the bottom of ships, you have these huge barnacles. Those are calcium formations. And what do all these calcium formations have in common? Microbes.
- **[01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYjQHkhzNB4&t=113s)** — Make these calcium formations. And when I did this deep dive into this topic, I finally found the key article that I've been looking for. There's a study on kidney stones that evaluated, I think it was 78 or 79 people. And out of the 78 or 79 people with kidney stones, they found 97.2% of them had tiny bacteria in the kidney stone. And these tiny bacteria, okay, they were very, very small.
- **[02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYjQHkhzNB4&t=144s)** — They're like 100 times smaller than bacteria are called nanobacteria. Nano meaning very, very small. And by the way, this is a very recent discovery or finding because of our ability to view things with certain types of microscopes.
- **[02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYjQHkhzNB4&t=161s)** — In the past, we could never find these things. But deep inside these kidney stones, there are microbes and they're nanobacteria. And it just so happens that these nanobacteria eat calcium and then form bone-like crystal structures.
- **[02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYjQHkhzNB4&t=177s)** — And that is called appetite, but it's a completely different definition of when you have an appetite for food. Okay. Appetite is a type of calcium phosphorus that is in bone. Okay. And these nanobacteria actually make this type of calcium as an igloo type structure to help them survive against various stresses like antibiotics.
- **[03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYjQHkhzNB4&t=203s)** — Antibiotics are a drug that kills bacteria. And one of the big side effects of antibiotics is enhanced microbial biofilms. And biofilms are these colonies of microbes with these little calcium igloo type protective shells.
- **[03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYjQHkhzNB4&t=220s)** — So every time someone takes an antibiotic, they actually make the microbes survive stronger because they adapt and they actually enhance the formation of these organisms.
- **[03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYjQHkhzNB4&t=231s)** — And this is why the solution is not to just take another antibiotic to kill off these microbes and make the environment very sterile because it just makes things worse.
- **[04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYjQHkhzNB4&t=240s)** — Now some other information, if you didn't already know this, that actually will make sense is that they've also found these small microorganisms in the plaque in your teeth, in the plaque in your arteries, in the calcium deposits in your joints.
- **[04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYjQHkhzNB4&t=255s)** — So where you may have thought this problem was just an excess amount of calcium, it's actually not. This is not being created because you have too much calcium in the diet.
- **[04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYjQHkhzNB4&t=265s)** — It's not being created because you are taking too many calcium supplements. It has a lot more to do with this microbe and what this microbe is doing within its environment.
- **[04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYjQHkhzNB4&t=275s)** — So if we take a deeper look at these nanobacteria, there's a couple things that you need to know about them.
- **[04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYjQHkhzNB4&t=279s)** — They form biofilms, which are colonies that bind together with calcium shells to survive. They're very resistant against antibiotics. In fact, they get stronger when you take an antibiotic.
- **[04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYjQHkhzNB4&t=292s)** — They can grow in different pHs, in different environments, in different temperatures, and in different stresses. In fact, the more you stress them, the more they grow.
- **[05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYjQHkhzNB4&t=302s)** — The big complication of these microbes in their shells is our own immune system has a difficult time detecting them, but they do detect there's a problem.
- **[05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYjQHkhzNB4&t=314s)** — And there's usually going to be some type of immune response that goes on for a long period of time, which means that your body, your own body's immune system, creates more inflammation.
- **[05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYjQHkhzNB4&t=326s)** — And that's where you get a lot of the complications from the plucking in your teeth, you know, in your gums, or plucking in the arteries, or plucking in your joints.
- **[05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYjQHkhzNB4&t=334s)** — A lot of the symptoms that you experience are coming actually from your own immune system, trying to get rid of this deeper infection.
- **[05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYjQHkhzNB4&t=343s)** — Now, as a really interesting side note, one really good remedy to help decrease these nanobacteria and decrease biofilms is citrate.
- **[05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYjQHkhzNB4&t=353s)** — Where does citrate come from? Lemons. It's the citric acid or the citrate in lemons, which is kind of a common remedy for kidney stones.
- **[06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYjQHkhzNB4&t=362s)** — Well, now we might know why. Because citrates help to inhibit the formation of biofilms.
- **[06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYjQHkhzNB4&t=368s)** — Now, the mechanism of how this thing develops is very similar to how H. pylori creates ulcers.
- **[06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYjQHkhzNB4&t=375s)** — If you don't know about that connection, a lot of the ulcers that people develop come from this bacteria, and it's sitting in your stomach.
- **[06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYjQHkhzNB4&t=383s)** — Now, a lot of people have H. pylori, but it's asymptomatic. There's no symptoms until your environment changes in your stomach, where your pH becomes altered and maybe your diet becomes off.
- **[06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYjQHkhzNB4&t=395s)** — And then this somewhat neutral or somewhat friendly H. pylori shifts its relationship to become a bit unfriendly and it starts to develop problems in your stomach.
- **[06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYjQHkhzNB4&t=408s)** — And of course, the treatment that they use for this is antibiotics, which have side effects.
- **[06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYjQHkhzNB4&t=411s)** — But the point is that the great majority of the public has this microbe in their body and it's not doing anything. It's not creating problems.
- **[07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYjQHkhzNB4&t=420s)** — It's kind of like a neutral type response. I mean, the same thing you could say for any microorganism.
- **[07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYjQHkhzNB4&t=426s)** — When you start to take antibiotics, for example, and you create stress, now we get an overgrowth of fungus, right?
- **[07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYjQHkhzNB4&t=432s)** — Because the bacteria was there in the first place to keep the fungus or candida in check.
- **[07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYjQHkhzNB4&t=438s)** — Antibiotics only kill bacteria. They don't kill fungus or candida or yeast.
- **[07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYjQHkhzNB4&t=444s)** — So now you get rid of this one thing, which is the protective thing. Now you get this overgrowth on the other side. Candida overgrowth or thrush.
- **[07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYjQHkhzNB4&t=451s)** — There's much higher risk of people getting these problems, like I'm talking about kidney stones, but some of these other problems too,
- **[07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYjQHkhzNB4&t=458s)** — when someone is obese, when someone is a diabetic, when they have high blood pressure, when they have kidney problems or kidney disease,
- **[07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYjQHkhzNB4&t=465s)** — and when they're immune compromised like an HIV or when they take a lot of prednisone.
- **[07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYjQHkhzNB4&t=470s)** — So the way that I can make sense out of this is that someone might manifest kidney stones if there's maybe a weakness within the kidney from some past injury
- **[08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYjQHkhzNB4&t=480s)** — versus another problem with these nanobacteria in your arteries, or maybe you had damage in the eye, and that's where this problem develops, or the joints.
- **[08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYjQHkhzNB4&t=489s)** — Kind of similar to cancer, where cancer tends to spread in areas of inflammation or weakness or old injury.
- **[08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYjQHkhzNB4&t=497s)** — Now you might be thinking, well, how do we kill off this microbe? Well, first you have to deal with the shell, right?
- **[08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYjQHkhzNB4&t=503s)** — The problem with that is if you start to destroy the shell, you're going to release a lot of these microbes into the blood, into the urine,
- **[08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYjQHkhzNB4&t=511s)** — which can create more problems. And then these microbes can then become like what's called endotoxins.
- **[08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYjQHkhzNB4&t=518s)** — And the problem with that is they can create more infection in other places in the body.
- **[08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYjQHkhzNB4&t=524s)** — And this is why with like lipo-tripsy, where they blast the kidney stone, right? With this sound wave,
- **[08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYjQHkhzNB4&t=530s)** — a person will have a greatly increased risk of getting infection afterwards, and this is probably why they give you an antibiotic to kill everything that has been released into the body.
- **[09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYjQHkhzNB4&t=541s)** — So when you start to use various, even natural remedies to break up these calcium shells, you have to realize what you're doing.
- **[09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYjQHkhzNB4&t=548s)** — I'll give you an example with Karen, my wife. She wanted to take a remedy for biofilms, right? For her sinus problems.
- **[09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYjQHkhzNB4&t=556s)** — And so she took this very powerful remedy and it definitely worked. It broke up all sorts of things.
- **[09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYjQHkhzNB4&t=562s)** — But then as a complication, she didn't look to... there was something seriously going on with her digestive system
- **[09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYjQHkhzNB4&t=570s)** — where she could not go to the bathroom. She had this huge knot. She couldn't eat. She felt sick.
- **[09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYjQHkhzNB4&t=576s)** — And this went on for several days, until as I was researching this, I found one of the side effects when you start breaking up biofilms
- **[09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYjQHkhzNB4&t=585s)** — is this problem called cold stasis, where you have this stagnant bile that is just kind of jammed up in the bile ducts.
- **[09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYjQHkhzNB4&t=593s)** — So apparently when you release the microbes, they can do some damage and they can even inhibit the formation of bile,
- **[09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYjQHkhzNB4&t=598s)** — which now we get this thickened stuff that gets stuck in the bile ducts and it can back up in the liver and create all sorts of problems,
- **[10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYjQHkhzNB4&t=607s)** — including constipation. So what we quickly did is a remedy, and I'm going to recommend this if you decide to use some type of biofilm,
- **[10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYjQHkhzNB4&t=616s)** — even a natural remedy, or some chelation type remedy, which is called EDTA. You're going to break up these things.
- **[10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYjQHkhzNB4&t=622s)** — I recommend before you do that, from personal experience, you want to take something called TUTCA. TUTCA is a type of bile soap that will get the bile flowing first.
- **[10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYjQHkhzNB4&t=633s)** — So when you destroy these biofilms and calcium shells, it can be released through the body.
- **[10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYjQHkhzNB4&t=641s)** — So just make mental note if you decide to do that. And you want to go really, really slow with any type of thing that you're going to use to destroy the biofilms.
- **[10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYjQHkhzNB4&t=650s)** — I would have some activated charcoal on the side, and I would take that as needed because activated charcoal can help absorb a lot of the toxic material that you are breaking up as it's coming out through the body.
- **[11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYjQHkhzNB4&t=665s)** — However, doing that requires a little more information and a lot more preparation. So I'm going to give you a different approach to this.
- **[11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYjQHkhzNB4&t=671s)** — This is a little more streamlined, less complications. So the first thing I would highly recommend you do, which is going to help you prevent any more kidney stones.
- **[11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYjQHkhzNB4&t=681s)** — It's probably the best thing you can do is to start drinking more fluid, like 2.5 liters every single day.
- **[11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYjQHkhzNB4&t=687s)** — That way, these stones cannot form because the stones always form in a super concentrated urine. So if you're drinking enough fluid, they can't form.
- **[11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYjQHkhzNB4&t=697s)** — So right there, it'll probably prevent you from having any kidney stones.
- **[11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYjQHkhzNB4&t=701s)** — Alright, number two, I would start taking calcium citrate, plus lemons.
- **[11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYjQHkhzNB4&t=707s)** — I would probably do two or three or four ounces of lemon a day, or two or three or four lemons a day in your water.
- **[11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYjQHkhzNB4&t=713s)** — I would use that. And I would also on top of that use potassium citrate.
- **[11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYjQHkhzNB4&t=717s)** — You can find that in a lot of electrolyte powders, but the potassium citrate is a really good anti-biofilm and it can help reduce the risk of kidney stones.
- **[12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYjQHkhzNB4&t=726s)** — The next thing I would do is I would take probably one of the most powerful natural antibiotics.
- **[12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYjQHkhzNB4&t=734s)** — That would be garlic. And I would take the garlic in a freeze-dried form, if I can get it.
- **[12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYjQHkhzNB4&t=740s)** — However, other forms are going to be fine. But freeze-dried garlic would be a nice natural antibiotic that is selected to those bacteria, but won't create any damage to your cells.
- **[12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYjQHkhzNB4&t=754s)** — Now, what you're doing is you're taking something like an antibiotic, and without any risk factor of developing antibiotic resistance, because it's natural,
- **[12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYjQHkhzNB4&t=764s)** — and you're creating an environment where these microbes can't continue to exist.
- **[12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYjQHkhzNB4&t=768s)** — Optimize the environment around these microbes.
- **[12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYjQHkhzNB4&t=771s)** — So over time, these biofilms and nanobacteria can go away, not just in your kidneys, but in the heart, in the eyes, in the joints, all over.
- **[13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYjQHkhzNB4&t=783s)** — Kidney stones are just the tip of the iceberg. That is the symptom of an unhealthy environment, probably because of bad eating habits or whatever.
- **[13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYjQHkhzNB4&t=793s)** — So what I mean by cleaning up the environment is getting on a healthy ketogenic diet with intermittent fasting.
- **[13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYjQHkhzNB4&t=800s)** — I would recommend to build up your microbiome. There are certain microbes that can greatly help prevent these biofilms.
- **[13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYjQHkhzNB4&t=808s)** — And of course, doing whatever you can to decrease stress. And that means stress for the microbes too.
- **[13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYjQHkhzNB4&t=814s)** — So really limit the times you take antibiotics or take drugs or expose yourself to chemicals that can cause these microbes to then adapt and then become stronger.
- **[13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYjQHkhzNB4&t=827s)** — Now I think it's appropriate to watch this next video, probably one of my most important videos on kidney stones, right here. Check it out.

- **[00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHNOAvhkr5Q&t=0s)** — The number one early sign of dementia. You've never heard about this before. In fact, I just
- **[00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHNOAvhkr5Q&t=5s)** — recently found out about it. And this involves everyone, especially if you want to prevent
- **[00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHNOAvhkr5Q&t=10s)** — the different types of dementia, Alzheimer's, etc. I think most people know that the first
- **[00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHNOAvhkr5Q&t=15s)** — symptom of a heart attack over 50% of the time is death because there is no symptom. And same
- **[00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHNOAvhkr5Q&t=21s)** — thing with the liver. There really is no symptoms until the later stages when sometimes
- **[00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHNOAvhkr5Q&t=26s)** — Well, guess what? The brain is the same thing. It takes decades to develop dementia. And in the
- **[00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHNOAvhkr5Q&t=31s)** — meantime, there's virtually no symptoms except one, which I'm going to discuss. And this is
- **[00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHNOAvhkr5Q&t=36s)** — because the different organs, especially the brain, just keep compensating over a period of
- **[00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHNOAvhkr5Q&t=40s)** — time until they can't compensate anymore. And so the earliest sign of dementia involves the
- **[00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHNOAvhkr5Q&t=46s)** — retina. It's nerve tissue that is literally sticking out of your skull in your eye socket.
- **[00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHNOAvhkr5Q&t=52s)** — The retina has certain cells that pick up information from the environment and allows you
- **[00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHNOAvhkr5Q&t=56s)** — to see. And so they found a very large correlation between problems in the retina
- **[01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHNOAvhkr5Q&t=61s)** — and problems in the brain, specifically with the outer layer of the retina. And then you
- **[01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHNOAvhkr5Q&t=65s)** — have all sorts of issues with the eye itself. Problems with night vision, problems with
- **[01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHNOAvhkr5Q&t=70s)** — central vision, floaters, light sensitivity issues. And a lot of times people will just
- **[01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHNOAvhkr5Q&t=76s)** — get a new set of glasses. And they may even develop something called amyloid beta placking
- **[01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHNOAvhkr5Q&t=83s)** — on the retina itself. At the end of the video and also in the description, I'll tell you
- **[01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHNOAvhkr5Q&t=87s)** — what tests would pick this information up. You also might notice problems with detecting
- **[01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHNOAvhkr5Q&t=93s)** — different shades of gray or even differentiate different colors as well. They also evaluated
- **[01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHNOAvhkr5Q&t=98s)** — cadavers brains. And so they evaluated the retina with people with cognitive deficit,
- **[01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHNOAvhkr5Q&t=104s)** — like a mild version of dementia. And you start having more inflammation in the nervous system.
- **[01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHNOAvhkr5Q&t=108s)** — And then things start to go downhill after that. And another really interesting thing
- **[01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHNOAvhkr5Q&t=113s)** — about the brains of Alzheimer's patients is they found high levels of a certain
- **[01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHNOAvhkr5Q&t=118s)** — microbe that happens to be living in your teeth. It's actually a pathogen. And they're
- **[02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHNOAvhkr5Q&t=122s)** — finding that in the placking of the brain. If someone has a dental infection or some type of
- **[02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHNOAvhkr5Q&t=128s)** — periodontal disease, you could be leaking out bacteria that goes into the bloodstream that
- **[02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHNOAvhkr5Q&t=132s)** — ends up in the brain. I mean, we also found dental bacteria in the placking of our heart as
- **[02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHNOAvhkr5Q&t=137s)** — well. I have a very important new solution for all of this, but I just want to take a moment
- **[02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHNOAvhkr5Q&t=142s)** — to just explain why people actually die from dementia. It's usually from some type of an
- **[02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHNOAvhkr5Q&t=147s)** — infection, a UTI or maybe a lung infection. Or in the case of my mother-in-law who had
- **[02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHNOAvhkr5Q&t=155s)** — Alzheimer's, it was a surgery. It created so much stress in the body. And after that,
- **[02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHNOAvhkr5Q&t=159s)** — just started going down and down a lot faster. On the other hand, sometimes you have a slow
- **[02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHNOAvhkr5Q&t=164s)** — progressive degeneration of the brain to the point where a person is in hospice and they're
- **[02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHNOAvhkr5Q&t=170s)** — bedridden. And then they just stop eating and stop drinking. And then that's what kills them.
- **[02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHNOAvhkr5Q&t=175s)** — Let's talk about what we can do about this. One of the most important things
- **[02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHNOAvhkr5Q&t=179s)** — that you should focus on is cleaning your brain. If you have a lot of inflammation
- **[03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHNOAvhkr5Q&t=183s)** — and placking in the brain, it's dirty. You can really look at this as like a dishwasher
- **[03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHNOAvhkr5Q&t=187s)** — and they call it the glymphatic system that cleans the brain mainly at night.
- **[03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHNOAvhkr5Q&t=192s)** — That's one of the big purposes of sleeping is to be able to detoxify and clean the brain.
- **[03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHNOAvhkr5Q&t=197s)** — So you wake up and things are cleaned out. And what I mean by clean the brain is pull out
- **[03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHNOAvhkr5Q&t=201s)** — some of these malformed proteins and the placking and rejuvenate the brain. Anything that
- **[03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHNOAvhkr5Q&t=207s)** — inhibits sleeping increases your risk for Alzheimer's. In fact, anything that inhibits
- **[03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHNOAvhkr5Q&t=211s)** — your sleeping less than six hours increases your risk for heart attacks, strokes, cancer,
- **[03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHNOAvhkr5Q&t=217s)** — blood sugar issues, type 2 diabetes. And so if you have sleep apnea, that is a problem.
- **[03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHNOAvhkr5Q&t=223s)** — And if you have sleep apnea, I'm going to put a link down below of what to do about it.
- **[03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHNOAvhkr5Q&t=226s)** — And you need to get eight or nine hours. And this is based on a book, Why We Sleep,
- **[03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHNOAvhkr5Q&t=232s)** — by Dr. Matthew Walker. Fascinating book. Even one night of less than seven hours of sleep,
- **[03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHNOAvhkr5Q&t=239s)** — you're going to have 50% more buildup of amyloid beta placking. How do we get more
- **[04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHNOAvhkr5Q&t=244s)** — sleep? And another factor in getting quality sleep is the avoidance of alcohol. One cup of alcohol
- **[04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHNOAvhkr5Q&t=249s)** — prevents a significant part of your REM sleep. You might feel like you're sleeping because it's
- **[04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHNOAvhkr5Q&t=256s)** — a sedative, but you're not getting the quality of sleep. If you're drinking several times a
- **[04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHNOAvhkr5Q&t=260s)** — week, this could be a huge problem with the quality of sleep. And also in the prevention of
- **[04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHNOAvhkr5Q&t=265s)** — Alzheimer's, it could shut down growth hormone by 50%. It's an anti-aging hormone. It helps
- **[04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHNOAvhkr5Q&t=269s)** — you lose weight. Alcohol is really bad for your brain. And we want to flood the brain with a lot
- **[04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHNOAvhkr5Q&t=276s)** — of oxygen. How do we get oxygen in the brain? Exercise. Regular, consistent exercise hands down
- **[04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHNOAvhkr5Q&t=282s)** — is one of the most important things to do to prevent Alzheimer's and other types of dementia.
- **[04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHNOAvhkr5Q&t=287s)** — People who are sedentary do not get the oxygen in the brain. Getting oxygen to the brain
- **[04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHNOAvhkr5Q&t=291s)** — lessens something called hypoxia. That's a word that describes lack of oxygen. And with
- **[04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHNOAvhkr5Q&t=296s)** — hypoxia, you get inflammation. When you exercise, you make the brain healthier. You grow brain cells
- **[05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHNOAvhkr5Q&t=302s)** — and you stimulate something called BDNF, brain derived neurotrophic factor. That's like miracle
- **[05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHNOAvhkr5Q&t=308s)** — growth for your brain. And there's also a tiny little mechanism deep in the brain that regulates
- **[05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHNOAvhkr5Q&t=314s)** — the rhythm of your sleep. It's called the suprachiasmatic nucleus. Not that you need to
- **[05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHNOAvhkr5Q&t=320s)** — know that name, but that's what it is. And that thing is so important to regulate the
- **[05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHNOAvhkr5Q&t=324s)** — A couple ways to get that working is during the daylight, get a lot of sun and then start to go
- **[05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHNOAvhkr5Q&t=330s)** — to bed when it gets dark. Vitamin D in higher amounts can reset that mechanism. I would
- **[05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHNOAvhkr5Q&t=335s)** — recommend taking about 20,000 international units of vitamin D. And then there's also
- **[05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHNOAvhkr5Q&t=340s)** — the fuel that you feed the brain. If you're living on carbohydrates and sugar, you're
- **[05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHNOAvhkr5Q&t=344s)** — going to create a starvation on the nerve cells. You really want to put your brain in
- **[05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHNOAvhkr5Q&t=349s)** — state of ketosis. The brain cells love ketones. How do you get into ketosis? You lower your
- **[05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHNOAvhkr5Q&t=357s)** — carbohydrate. If you have signs of dementia, I would highly recommend that you take ketones
- **[06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHNOAvhkr5Q&t=364s)** — as a supplement. And you also take on a regular basis, MCT oil, because MCT oil
- **[06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHNOAvhkr5Q&t=370s)** — can turn into ketones and feed the brain directly. We want to flood that brain with
- **[06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHNOAvhkr5Q&t=375s)** — ketones. As far as nutrition goes, I think out of all the nutrients, niacin is going to be very
- **[06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHNOAvhkr5Q&t=381s)** — important for the brain. I would start out maybe with 50 milligrams for a period of time, then go
- **[06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHNOAvhkr5Q&t=387s)** — to a hundred milligrams per day, and then eventually up to 500 milligrams per day. You
- **[06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHNOAvhkr5Q&t=392s)** — got to do it slowly because some people can't tolerate the flushing response. I kind of like
- **[06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHNOAvhkr5Q&t=397s)** — the flushing response. It's not dangerous. It just will create a vasodilation effect.
- **[06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHNOAvhkr5Q&t=401s)** — Since we're on the topic of sleep, if you want to take your sleep to the next level,
- **[06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHNOAvhkr5Q&t=405s)** — you should watch this video right here. Check it out.

- **[00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3vnCKivCjs&t=0s)** — Today I'm going to share with you the absolute fastest way to lose your belly.
- **[00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3vnCKivCjs&t=6s)** — Now you could have the best willpower, the best discipline, really want it, really bad,
- **[00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3vnCKivCjs&t=12s)** — and never really see any results because you're missing the technique, you're missing the strategy.
- **[00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3vnCKivCjs&t=17s)** — I'm the perfect example. I took guitar lessons for six years, right? As a teenager.
- **[00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3vnCKivCjs&t=23s)** — And I never really progressed or never really went anywhere because the techniques that were taught to me
- **[00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3vnCKivCjs&t=28s)** — were just not that great. The same thing happened with tennis in college. I was never taught the
- **[00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3vnCKivCjs&t=33s)** — right technique and so I would use force and I would keep practicing but practice incorrectly.
- **[00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3vnCKivCjs&t=40s)** — Never went anywhere. And this really applies with weight loss too because if you have the
- **[00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3vnCKivCjs&t=44s)** — right way of doing something you don't have to put so much effort into it. So what I'm
- **[00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3vnCKivCjs&t=49s)** — going to show you is the fastest way to achieve your goal. Number one, when you do
- **[00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3vnCKivCjs&t=54s)** — a ketogenic diet it's not differentiated what type of fats you should be eating.
- **[01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3vnCKivCjs&t=60s)** — In other words, keto is really about low carb. You assume it's high fat but there's certain
- **[01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3vnCKivCjs&t=66s)** — ketogenic diets that are actually low fat like ideal protein for example and others are very
- **[01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3vnCKivCjs&t=73s)** — high in fat. But in this first tip we're going to talk about the type of fats. This is so, so
- **[01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3vnCKivCjs&t=80s)** — important because I've done a deep dive into chronic disease and chronic obesity and as you
- **[01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3vnCKivCjs&t=85s)** — know obesity keeps going higher and higher and higher and higher. There's really only one thing
- **[01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3vnCKivCjs&t=90s)** — that I know that perfectly parallels this rise in obesity. It's actually seed oils, omega-6
- **[01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3vnCKivCjs&t=98s)** — fatty acids. I'm talking about the rise of corn oil, the soy oil, the cotton seed, the
- **[01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3vnCKivCjs&t=110s)** — ultra-processed highly inflammatory oils. And by the way, as a side note, it's very, very
- **[01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3vnCKivCjs&t=116s)** — unnatural to consume this concentrated refined oil from seeds. And it's hidden in your dressing
- **[02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3vnCKivCjs&t=123s)** — that you use on your salad. You're going to get it in fast food restaurants. In fact,
- **[02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3vnCKivCjs&t=126s)** — you're probably going to get it with any restaurant that you go to. Also, it's in
- **[02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3vnCKivCjs&t=131s)** — animal feeds. And if they feed the chicken this grain, omega-6 fatty acids, you're going
- **[02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3vnCKivCjs&t=136s)** — to get a profile that's pretty high in omega-6. This also includes eggs. Okay,
- **[02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3vnCKivCjs&t=141s)** — eggs might be high in the omega-6. This also includes pork. This also includes grain fed beef.
- **[02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3vnCKivCjs&t=149s)** — Now, why is this so important? Because I have data, which I'm going to do a separate video
- **[02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3vnCKivCjs&t=153s)** — on this, that shows that consuming these oils will produce more weight gain than sugar. If we
- **[02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3vnCKivCjs&t=161s)** — look at this massive trend of obesity, the only thing that parallels it is seed oils. So it would
- **[02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3vnCKivCjs&t=168s)** — just make sense to avoid those if you want to lose weight. And so this also relates to the
- **[02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3vnCKivCjs&t=173s)** — type of protein that you should be eating. Grass fed grass finished beef and wild caught
- **[02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3vnCKivCjs&t=179s)** — fish. That's tip number one. Very important. All right, so number two. Consume a very large
- **[03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3vnCKivCjs&t=186s)** — salad, one a day, unless you have gut inflammation, in which case you would either do
- **[03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3vnCKivCjs&t=193s)** — fermented vegetables in the form of sauerkraut or kimchi or eliminate the vegetables all
- **[03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3vnCKivCjs&t=199s)** — together. Now, why would I even recommend a salad? I mean, what's that going to do?
- **[03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3vnCKivCjs&t=203s)** — Yes, it does have some nutrients. Potassium, magnesium, folate, vitamin C,
- **[03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3vnCKivCjs&t=210s)** — a lot of different phytonutrients. But if you get salad that's grown on living soil,
- **[03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3vnCKivCjs&t=216s)** — you're going to get a really good probiotic. That's right, there's microbes in this raw salad
- **[03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3vnCKivCjs&t=221s)** — that can help fortify your gut. Plus the fiber can actually feed your microbiome. So one
- **[03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3vnCKivCjs&t=229s)** — huge benefit of consuming salads is to help your microbiome as far as the diversity and
- **[03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3vnCKivCjs&t=236s)** — quantity of microbes in your gut, which directly help you lose weight. The microbiome in an obese
- **[04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3vnCKivCjs&t=243s)** — person versus someone who's thin is completely different. And of course, what you're going to
- **[04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3vnCKivCjs&t=247s)** — put on the salad is not going to be seed oils. You're going to put extra virgin olive oil.
- **[04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3vnCKivCjs&t=252s)** — And you can also use balsamic vinegar rad and other things as well. And the cool thing
- **[04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3vnCKivCjs&t=257s)** — about salads is that you don't have to count the carbs because they're so tiny. All right,
- **[04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3vnCKivCjs&t=265s)** — test yourself for ketones on a blood test. There's a certain reading that can tell you
- **[04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3vnCKivCjs&t=270s)** — how deep or how much ketosis you're in. Just by getting on a ketogenic diet is not going to
- **[04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3vnCKivCjs&t=275s)** — do it alone. There's two other things you have to do. One is called intermittent fasting.
- **[04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3vnCKivCjs&t=280s)** — Okay, now I have a lot of videos on this, but very simply I'm going to recommend you do
- **[04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3vnCKivCjs&t=284s)** — one meal per day. And this will give you 23 hours of fasting. So not only is this going
- **[04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3vnCKivCjs&t=290s)** — to be very powerful into causing your body to adapt to running on fat all day long,
- **[04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3vnCKivCjs&t=296s)** — but you'll have so many other benefits. Cognitive improvements, mood changes,
- **[05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3vnCKivCjs&t=303s)** — reduction of inflammation. And by the way, when you get off the seed oils,
- **[05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3vnCKivCjs&t=307s)** — you're reducing inflammation way, way down. You have to realize that inflammation from seed
- **[05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3vnCKivCjs&t=314s)** — oils triggers insulin resistance. It destroys your metabolism. It makes things slower.
- **[05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3vnCKivCjs&t=322s)** — So doing the intermittent fasting, okay, you're actually correcting insulin resistance
- **[05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3vnCKivCjs&t=328s)** — with the help of the lowering of carbs, with the change in the type of fat that you're
- **[05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3vnCKivCjs&t=334s)** — consuming. So all of these things compounded together are going to get you to your goal
- **[05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3vnCKivCjs&t=338s)** — extremely fast. And we need exercise. Now the type of exercise I'm going to recommend is to do
- **[05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3vnCKivCjs&t=346s)** — a combination of walking and high intensity interval training. I'm going to recommend you
- **[05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3vnCKivCjs&t=353s)** — do walking every single day for a couple different reasons. Number one, it's going to
- **[05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3vnCKivCjs&t=356s)** — help with weight loss. But number two, it's going to actually help with stress reduction.
- **[06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3vnCKivCjs&t=360s)** — And it's going to help you sleep. And sleep is going to be very important to not just
- **[06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3vnCKivCjs&t=365s)** — reduce cortisol, but to help enhance growth hormone, which is highest when you're sleeping.
- **[06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3vnCKivCjs&t=371s)** — That's the main fat burning hormone. And people that don't sleep, I mean, that's like a big
- **[06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3vnCKivCjs&t=375s)** — barrier to losing weight. You're not going to lose weight if you can't sleep and you can't
- **[06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3vnCKivCjs&t=378s)** — recover. I had a patient who came in that was trying to lose weight, right? They did
- **[06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3vnCKivCjs&t=382s)** — exercise. I'm talking like, I think it was two hours of exercise. It might have been three
- **[06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3vnCKivCjs&t=387s)** — times a week for an entire year. And she lost like one or two pounds the entire year.
- **[06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3vnCKivCjs&t=392s)** — It was because she wasn't sleeping, because all I did is correct her sleep. And bam, she lost
- **[06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3vnCKivCjs&t=397s)** — weight. Another person came in. They were exercising six hours a day. I'm not kidding.
- **[06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3vnCKivCjs&t=402s)** — Obsessed with exercising. Wasn't sleeping. Didn't lose any weight. We helped her sleep. She
- **[06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3vnCKivCjs&t=408s)** — started losing weight. So we want the walking to help with the stress reduction to help you
- **[06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3vnCKivCjs&t=413s)** — sleep. But we also want the high intensity exercise, because the intensity is what really
- **[07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3vnCKivCjs&t=420s)** — activates certain hormones that are related to fat burning. And so the more intense the better.
- **[07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3vnCKivCjs&t=426s)** — Of course, work up to it. Make sure you don't hurt yourself. But I just wanted to give you
- **[07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3vnCKivCjs&t=430s)** — the technique and the concept. It must be intense. You want to use as many muscles as you
- **[07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3vnCKivCjs&t=435s)** — can. But we want to do short, high-intense workouts that involve multiple muscles. And
- **[07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3vnCKivCjs&t=442s)** — make sure you don't overdo it. In other words, the frequency of this high-intensity
- **[07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3vnCKivCjs&t=447s)** — interval training should be between one to three times a week, depending on how old you are
- **[07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3vnCKivCjs&t=455s)** — and how good your recovery is. I've worked with people in the past that I've just reduced the
- **[07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3vnCKivCjs&t=461s)** — frequency of exercising per week. And that was the thing that helped them. Working out less.
- **[07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3vnCKivCjs&t=466s)** — Go figure. They were over training. The keto diet that you want to do is a moderate
- **[07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3vnCKivCjs&t=470s)** — amount of protein. But the key is the quality of proteins. And also you can mix in
- **[07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3vnCKivCjs&t=474s)** — some organ meats too for the nutrition, the nutrient-dense aspect of this. We want to make
- **[08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3vnCKivCjs&t=480s)** — sure that you also do electrolytes, B vitamins, maybe from nutritional yeast, and don't forget
- **[08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3vnCKivCjs&t=486s)** — sea salt. Because a lot of people don't have enough sea salt and they end up feeling tired.
- **[08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3vnCKivCjs&t=491s)** — And they haven't made the connection that that is what's causing the fatigue. You need
- **[08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3vnCKivCjs&t=495s)** — enough sea salt, especially on this program, because you're going to be losing a lot of
- **[08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3vnCKivCjs&t=498s)** — water weight and we want to be able to hold the water with more salt. And the other point
- **[08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3vnCKivCjs&t=503s)** — that is if you're having problems sleeping because your adrenals are kind of overactive,
- **[08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3vnCKivCjs&t=509s)** — what that means is you need more salt. More salt can help you sleep at night. But the way
- **[08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3vnCKivCjs&t=514s)** — that you'll know that you're adapting is your hunger goes away. If you're doing this right,
- **[08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3vnCKivCjs&t=519s)** — you're burning your fat and you're rarely hungry. So this means that you may even go
- **[08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3vnCKivCjs&t=524s)** — longer than one meal a day with your fasting if you have a lot of weight to lose.
- **[08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3vnCKivCjs&t=530s)** — And also I mentioned this keto adaptation, but you also have fat adaptation. This is a little
- **[08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3vnCKivCjs&t=536s)** — bit different. This is the point where your metabolism is becoming very, very flexible in
- **[09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3vnCKivCjs&t=543s)** — that you can adapt to burning fat very quickly because your mitochondria is becoming healthier.
- **[09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3vnCKivCjs&t=550s)** — And that usually takes a minimum of three months. But for a lot of people that have had
- **[09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3vnCKivCjs&t=556s)** — for many years, it could take a lot longer. The goal is to get you to the point where you're
- **[09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3vnCKivCjs&t=561s)** — so healthy and you have so much flexibility within your metabolism that you could afford
- **[09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3vnCKivCjs&t=566s)** — to go off the program. You could afford to eat more carbs and they're not going to affect
- **[09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3vnCKivCjs&t=570s)** — you. But remember, a principle I've talked about before, if you haven't seen my videos,
- **[09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3vnCKivCjs&t=573s)** — this might be a new concept, but it's not about losing weight to get healthy.
- **[09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3vnCKivCjs&t=577s)** — It's about getting healthy to lose weight. So now that you have this plan of action,
- **[09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3vnCKivCjs&t=583s)** — you have better technique. But I think we need to fill in the blank with some details.
- **[09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3vnCKivCjs&t=588s)** — And for that information, you must watch this video right here.

- **[00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CrLaoAngJsw&t=0s)** — Now we all know for a fact that if you have constipation,
- **[00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CrLaoAngJsw&t=4s)** — you just need to add more fiber.
- **[00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CrLaoAngJsw&t=6s)** — Okay? I mean it's the general consensus of the medical community that
- **[00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CrLaoAngJsw&t=10s)** — a lack of fiber is really what's behind constipation.
- **[00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CrLaoAngJsw&t=14s)** — Well, today let's just talk about
- **[00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CrLaoAngJsw&t=15s)** — what the number one mistake is with constipation
- **[00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CrLaoAngJsw&t=19s)** — and then some additional things that you need to know
- **[00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CrLaoAngJsw&t=21s)** — if you have constipation.
- **[00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CrLaoAngJsw&t=23s)** — Let's just take a look at constipation for a second.
- **[00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CrLaoAngJsw&t=25s)** — It's a traffic jam in your gut, right?
- **[00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CrLaoAngJsw&t=27s)** — It's congestion.
- **[00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CrLaoAngJsw&t=30s)** — You have too much stool.
- **[00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CrLaoAngJsw&t=32s)** — Now, fiber increases bulk.
- **[00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CrLaoAngJsw&t=36s)** — Okay? It increases stool.
- **[00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CrLaoAngJsw&t=40s)** — It increases volume.
- **[00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CrLaoAngJsw&t=42s)** — So just by looking at that, why would you ever want to
- **[00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CrLaoAngJsw&t=45s)** — increase more volume or mass or bulk
- **[00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CrLaoAngJsw&t=50s)** — into a tube or plumbing that's already congested?
- **[00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CrLaoAngJsw&t=55s)** — That does not make sense to me.
- **[00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CrLaoAngJsw&t=57s)** — Also, think about what fiber does.
- **[01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CrLaoAngJsw&t=60s)** — It causes your microbes to create fermentation.
- **[01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CrLaoAngJsw&t=64s)** — With fermentation comes gas and bloating.
- **[01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CrLaoAngJsw&t=68s)** — Usually people that have constipation
- **[01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CrLaoAngJsw&t=70s)** — don't need any more gas or bloating.
- **[01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CrLaoAngJsw&t=72s)** — The other point about people that are chronically constipated
- **[01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CrLaoAngJsw&t=75s)** — is that they're already doing a lot of fiber,
- **[01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CrLaoAngJsw&t=78s)** — but it's not working.
- **[01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CrLaoAngJsw&t=80s)** — So to add more fiber is not a good idea.
- **[01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CrLaoAngJsw&t=83s)** — There's some fascinating studies
- **[01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CrLaoAngJsw&t=86s)** — with people who have both chronic constipation
- **[01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CrLaoAngJsw&t=89s)** — and people who have constipation with
- **[01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CrLaoAngJsw&t=93s)** — irritable bowel syndrome or some other type of
- **[01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CrLaoAngJsw&t=95s)** — inflammatory condition that adding more fiber
- **[01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CrLaoAngJsw&t=97s)** — will make it worse.
- **[01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CrLaoAngJsw&t=99s)** — That's right.
- **[01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CrLaoAngJsw&t=99s)** — If you have SIBO, small intestinal bacterial overgrowth,
- **[01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CrLaoAngJsw&t=106s)** — which is... your microbes are in the wrong place.
- **[01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CrLaoAngJsw&t=108s)** — They're in the small intestine. Okay?
- **[01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CrLaoAngJsw&t=110s)** — They should be in the large intestine.
- **[01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CrLaoAngJsw&t=112s)** — So they're higher up.
- **[01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CrLaoAngJsw&t=114s)** — And you consume more fiber.
- **[01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CrLaoAngJsw&t=116s)** — Oh my goodness.
- **[01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CrLaoAngJsw&t=117s)** — You're going to get bloating.
- **[01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CrLaoAngJsw&t=118s)** — It's going to make things really, really bad.
- **[02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CrLaoAngJsw&t=120s)** — So the biggest mistake that people make
- **[02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CrLaoAngJsw&t=123s)** — for constipation is adding more fiber.
- **[02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CrLaoAngJsw&t=126s)** — In fact, I used to have very, very bad constipation.
- **[02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CrLaoAngJsw&t=129s)** — And by accident, I got rid of it.
- **[02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CrLaoAngJsw&t=131s)** — It was at the time when I kind of stumbled on
- **[02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CrLaoAngJsw&t=135s)** — cutting out carbs.
- **[02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CrLaoAngJsw&t=137s)** — And so I was doing a lot of grain carbs
- **[02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CrLaoAngJsw&t=140s)** — as my fiber for cereal and things like that.
- **[02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CrLaoAngJsw&t=142s)** — When I switched to eating more like meats,
- **[02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CrLaoAngJsw&t=146s)** — like a buffalo burger, even fish for breakfast,
- **[02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CrLaoAngJsw&t=150s)** — all my constipation completely went away.
- **[02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CrLaoAngJsw&t=152s)** — And it was like I was dumbfounded because I'm like,
- **[02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CrLaoAngJsw&t=155s)** — I just thought I had to add more menomucil
- **[02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CrLaoAngJsw&t=157s)** — or other types of fiber.
- **[02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CrLaoAngJsw&t=159s)** — But every time I did that, it got worse.
- **[02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CrLaoAngJsw&t=162s)** — But it was really bizarre just to eat more meat
- **[02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CrLaoAngJsw&t=165s)** — and find that my constipation completely cleared up.
- **[02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CrLaoAngJsw&t=168s)** — But at the time, I didn't really know why.
- **[02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CrLaoAngJsw&t=170s)** — So instead of adding more fiber,
- **[02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CrLaoAngJsw&t=172s)** — just omit the fiber.
- **[02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CrLaoAngJsw&t=174s)** — So no more want to reduce your fiber.
- **[02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CrLaoAngJsw&t=175s)** — Now, of course, I just want to differentiate
- **[02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CrLaoAngJsw&t=178s)** — two different types of fiber.
- **[03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CrLaoAngJsw&t=180s)** — Vegetable fiber is usually okay,
- **[03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CrLaoAngJsw&t=182s)** — but even that sometimes can bind you up.
- **[03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CrLaoAngJsw&t=185s)** — But the most likely reason for people
- **[03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CrLaoAngJsw&t=188s)** — having a worsening with more fiber is the grain fiber.
- **[03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CrLaoAngJsw&t=191s)** — And that includes the fiber from beans,
- **[03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CrLaoAngJsw&t=195s)** — lentils and bran.
- **[03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CrLaoAngJsw&t=197s)** — And unfortunately now, even the keto community,
- **[03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CrLaoAngJsw&t=199s)** — there's all sorts of new synthetic fibers
- **[03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CrLaoAngJsw&t=203s)** — like corn fiber and tapioca fiber
- **[03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CrLaoAngJsw&t=206s)** — and all sorts of things that are, I think, very unhealthy.
- **[03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CrLaoAngJsw&t=210s)** — But we won't go there on this video.
- **[03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CrLaoAngJsw&t=212s)** — All right, number two is the side effect
- **[03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CrLaoAngJsw&t=214s)** — from their medication and acids and a depressants
- **[03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CrLaoAngJsw&t=218s)** — are common medications that have side effects
- **[03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CrLaoAngJsw&t=221s)** — of constipation, but there are others as well.
- **[03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CrLaoAngJsw&t=223s)** — So I always like to kind of look at the obvious.
- **[03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CrLaoAngJsw&t=226s)** — What's the elephant in the room?
- **[03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CrLaoAngJsw&t=227s)** — And if someone's doing medication
- **[03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CrLaoAngJsw&t=229s)** — just look that up and see if it has
- **[03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CrLaoAngJsw&t=231s)** — a side effect of constipation.
- **[03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CrLaoAngJsw&t=233s)** — Now, the next thing is a lack of thiamine, vitamin B1.
- **[03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CrLaoAngJsw&t=237s)** — B1 is intimately involved in what's called
- **[04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CrLaoAngJsw&t=242s)** — the peristalsis, so the pumping action of the colon,
- **[04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CrLaoAngJsw&t=245s)** — because it helps build up what's called
- **[04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CrLaoAngJsw&t=248s)** — a neurotransmitter called acetylcholine.
- **[04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CrLaoAngJsw&t=251s)** — And so the reason why people are deficient in B1
- **[04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CrLaoAngJsw&t=253s)** — is that they consume too many carbs and sugars.
- **[04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CrLaoAngJsw&t=255s)** — But B1 can sometimes easily correct constipation.
- **[04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CrLaoAngJsw&t=259s)** — Plus it supports the vagus nerve,
- **[04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CrLaoAngJsw&t=262s)** — which is part of the autonomic nervous system,
- **[04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CrLaoAngJsw&t=264s)** — which actually can really help if someone has
- **[04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CrLaoAngJsw&t=267s)** — like too much stress too and everything is locked up
- **[04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CrLaoAngJsw&t=270s)** — because they're more in this flight or fight mode.
- **[04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CrLaoAngJsw&t=273s)** — So that would be another reason, stress.
- **[04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CrLaoAngJsw&t=275s)** — Okay, stress is a part of that as well.
- **[04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CrLaoAngJsw&t=278s)** — Now, the next one is a lack of bile.
- **[04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CrLaoAngJsw&t=280s)** — If you're lacking bile,
- **[04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CrLaoAngJsw&t=282s)** — typically you will have constipation.
- **[04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CrLaoAngJsw&t=284s)** — Bile tends to lubricate the colon.
- **[04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CrLaoAngJsw&t=288s)** — And sometimes people have like this bile sludge
- **[04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CrLaoAngJsw&t=291s)** — that's bound up into the bile ducts
- **[04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CrLaoAngJsw&t=294s)** — and that can cause pain in the right shoulder
- **[04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CrLaoAngJsw&t=295s)** — or discomfort or tightness underneath the right rib cage,
- **[04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CrLaoAngJsw&t=299s)** — which is indication that they don't have enough bile.
- **[05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CrLaoAngJsw&t=302s)** — By adding more bile salts as a supplement,
- **[05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CrLaoAngJsw&t=305s)** — you can sometimes relieve constipation
- **[05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CrLaoAngJsw&t=308s)** — and even get rid of constipation
- **[05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CrLaoAngJsw&t=310s)** — because it helps to lubricate the colon
- **[05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CrLaoAngJsw&t=312s)** — and also helps you digest.
- **[05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CrLaoAngJsw&t=314s)** — But I want to bring that up
- **[05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CrLaoAngJsw&t=315s)** — as a definite cause to constipation.
- **[05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CrLaoAngJsw&t=319s)** — If you take too much bile, you'll get diarrhea.
- **[05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CrLaoAngJsw&t=323s)** — So that's a good way to know
- **[05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CrLaoAngJsw&t=324s)** — if you're taking too much bile.
- **[05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CrLaoAngJsw&t=326s)** — The other thing is that dysbiosis.
- **[05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CrLaoAngJsw&t=329s)** — This is the involving imbalance
- **[05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CrLaoAngJsw&t=332s)** — in your microflora and your gut.
- **[05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CrLaoAngJsw&t=335s)** — So instead of adding more fiber,
- **[05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CrLaoAngJsw&t=337s)** — why don't you just add more of a probiotic, right?
- **[05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CrLaoAngJsw&t=340s)** — That would be a better thing to do
- **[05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CrLaoAngJsw&t=342s)** — because the microbes in constipation
- **[05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CrLaoAngJsw&t=344s)** — a lot of times are missing.
- **[05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CrLaoAngJsw&t=346s)** — But if you have SIBO,
- **[05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CrLaoAngJsw&t=347s)** — which is small intestinal bacterial overgrowth,
- **[05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CrLaoAngJsw&t=350s)** — if you take these microbes,
- **[05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CrLaoAngJsw&t=353s)** — they end up in the small intestine
- **[05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CrLaoAngJsw&t=354s)** — and that can actually give you more bloating.
- **[05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CrLaoAngJsw&t=356s)** — So if you get more bloating with probiotics,
- **[05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CrLaoAngJsw&t=359s)** — then we know you might have SIBO.
- **[06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CrLaoAngJsw&t=360s)** — Another common cause of constipation
- **[06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CrLaoAngJsw&t=362s)** — is the person's eating too many frequent meals.
- **[06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CrLaoAngJsw&t=365s)** — They're having three meals, three snacks,
- **[06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CrLaoAngJsw&t=368s)** — and you never let your digestive system
- **[06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CrLaoAngJsw&t=370s)** — have a chance to breathe or rest in between eating.
- **[06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CrLaoAngJsw&t=374s)** — So going on an intermittent fasting schedule is huge.
- **[06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CrLaoAngJsw&t=378s)** — It's a game changer for someone
- **[06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CrLaoAngJsw&t=379s)** — that has chronic constipation
- **[06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CrLaoAngJsw&t=381s)** — because you finally have a chance
- **[06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CrLaoAngJsw&t=382s)** — to let your digestive system rest in between eating.
- **[06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CrLaoAngJsw&t=387s)** — It's not natural to eat of that frequency.
- **[06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CrLaoAngJsw&t=391s)** — Another thing is sometimes when people eat
- **[06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CrLaoAngJsw&t=392s)** — way too much protein,
- **[06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CrLaoAngJsw&t=394s)** — sometimes they go on carnivore and they get constipated,
- **[06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CrLaoAngJsw&t=397s)** — they need to increase more fat to their protein ratios
- **[06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CrLaoAngJsw&t=399s)** — because if they have too much protein,
- **[06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CrLaoAngJsw&t=401s)** — you can only digest or assimilate so much protein
- **[06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CrLaoAngJsw&t=405s)** — and the rest can be a problem
- **[06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CrLaoAngJsw&t=408s)** — and sometimes it can be constipating.
- **[06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CrLaoAngJsw&t=410s)** — That's why like on the Atkins diet,
- **[06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CrLaoAngJsw&t=412s)** — which is a high protein diet,
- **[06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CrLaoAngJsw&t=413s)** — one of the side effects is constipation
- **[06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CrLaoAngJsw&t=415s)** — versus the healthy version of keto that I recommend,
- **[06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CrLaoAngJsw&t=418s)** — it's a moderate amount of protein.
- **[07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CrLaoAngJsw&t=420s)** — And then the other thing that's connected to that
- **[07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CrLaoAngJsw&t=422s)** — is low hydrochloric acid.
- **[07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CrLaoAngJsw&t=424s)** — If you don't have enough HCl in your stomach,
- **[07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CrLaoAngJsw&t=427s)** — you're not gonna be able to digest protein
- **[07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CrLaoAngJsw&t=429s)** — and that is going to cause constipation
- **[07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CrLaoAngJsw&t=431s)** — because you're gonna have incomplete digestion
- **[07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CrLaoAngJsw&t=433s)** — at a higher level.
- **[07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CrLaoAngJsw&t=434s)** — So you have this huge tube that's like 25 feet long.
- **[07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CrLaoAngJsw&t=439s)** — If you can't digest way up at the top of the tube,
- **[07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CrLaoAngJsw&t=442s)** — think about what happens lower in the chain of events.
- **[07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CrLaoAngJsw&t=445s)** — You get a lot of undigested food material
- **[07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CrLaoAngJsw&t=447s)** — that just backs up as a traffic jam.
- **[07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CrLaoAngJsw&t=451s)** — So adding butane-hydrochloride,
- **[07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CrLaoAngJsw&t=453s)** — apple cider vinegar when you eat is a very smart thing.
- **[07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CrLaoAngJsw&t=456s)** — The other thing is like you're very low
- **[07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CrLaoAngJsw&t=458s)** — in magnesium and potassium.
- **[07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CrLaoAngJsw&t=461s)** — You have two electrolytes that are needed
- **[07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CrLaoAngJsw&t=464s)** — to power these little batteries
- **[07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CrLaoAngJsw&t=467s)** — that power the nerves and the muscle.
- **[07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CrLaoAngJsw&t=471s)** — And your colon is muscle.
- **[07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CrLaoAngJsw&t=473s)** — So it needs potassium and magnesium as the electrolytes
- **[07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CrLaoAngJsw&t=476s)** — and also magnesium creates a nice relaxation
- **[07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CrLaoAngJsw&t=479s)** — of the muscle.
- **[08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CrLaoAngJsw&t=480s)** — So of course, if you have too much,
- **[08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CrLaoAngJsw&t=482s)** — you can create diarrhea.
- **[08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CrLaoAngJsw&t=483s)** — But anyway, I wanted to touch on this topic
- **[08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CrLaoAngJsw&t=485s)** — of constipation to give you some additional things
- **[08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CrLaoAngJsw&t=488s)** — to think about and do.
- **[08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CrLaoAngJsw&t=489s)** — And if you have not seen my video
- **[08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CrLaoAngJsw&t=491s)** — on intermittent fasting,
- **[08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CrLaoAngJsw&t=493s)** — that would be probably one of the most important things
- **[08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CrLaoAngJsw&t=494s)** — to do if you have not started yet.
- **[08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CrLaoAngJsw&t=496s)** — And I put that video up right here.

- **[00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7xtsTM4ysw&t=0s)** — So there are a lot of different symptoms that can occur with a potassium deficiency.
- **[00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7xtsTM4ysw&t=4s)** — Today we're going to talk about the most serious symptom that you need to know about. What's unique
- **[00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7xtsTM4ysw&t=9s)** — about potassium compared to other minerals is that potassium is needed in very large amounts.
- **[00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7xtsTM4ysw&t=17s)** — We need 4,700 milligrams every single day. But if we compound that with high amounts of sodium
- **[00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7xtsTM4ysw&t=24s)** — from salt, we can create a really bad situation because sodium and potassium work as kind of a
- **[00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7xtsTM4ysw&t=31s)** — teeter-totter. And a lot of people are eating a lot of junk food high in salt, but they're not
- **[00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7xtsTM4ysw&t=36s)** — eating enough potassium foods. And so this ratio is way off. It's backwards. Normally you should
- **[00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7xtsTM4ysw&t=42s)** — have at least a two to one ratio. Two times as much potassium as sodium. So even if you are low
- **[00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7xtsTM4ysw&t=49s)** — and you have the right ratios with sodium, it's more protective to your heart. 98 to 99% of all
- **[00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7xtsTM4ysw&t=58s)** — the potassium is located inside your cell, not in the blood. And this also relates to magnesium.
- **[01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7xtsTM4ysw&t=65s)** — Most of our magnesium is inside our cells, not in the blood. So you could check the blood
- **[01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7xtsTM4ysw&t=69s)** — all you want. It just doesn't give you a lot of good information about nutrient deficiencies.
- **[01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7xtsTM4ysw&t=73s)** — Now why do we need so much potassium? Well, there's a pump that is in every cell in the
- **[01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7xtsTM4ysw&t=80s)** — body. And this pump is called a sodium potassium pump. And what it does is it helps to generate
- **[01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7xtsTM4ysw&t=89s)** — electrical current around the cell to power the nervous system and the muscular system.
- **[01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7xtsTM4ysw&t=96s)** — Kind of like if you go to a dam and you see the water being let out. And so this is why
- **[01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7xtsTM4ysw&t=101s)** — it's so important to have the right amounts and concentrations and ratios of potassium and
- **[01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7xtsTM4ysw&t=108s)** — sodium to be able to generate this charge. And so many of the things we're going to talk
- **[01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7xtsTM4ysw&t=112s)** — about today are related to a lack of that electrical charge to power both the nervous system
- **[01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7xtsTM4ysw&t=119s)** — and the muscular system. So we have nerves, muscles, and the control over your blood vessels
- **[02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7xtsTM4ysw&t=127s)** — as well. I'm talking about vasoconstriction and vasodilation. Basically the vascular tone
- **[02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7xtsTM4ysw&t=133s)** — of your arteries are highly influenced by potassium. And this is one of the main causes
- **[02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7xtsTM4ysw&t=138s)** — of high blood pressure is low potassium. But you're probably not going to see that promoted
- **[02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7xtsTM4ysw&t=143s)** — because of the money involved in high blood pressure medications. But what you will see
- **[02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7xtsTM4ysw&t=147s)** — is that 90% of all hypertension is what's called essential. It means they don't know what causes
- **[02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7xtsTM4ysw&t=157s)** — it. Well, but you anything that it's part of that is a potassium deficiency. All right,
- **[02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7xtsTM4ysw&t=161s)** — let me first go through the symptoms that are maybe not as serious, but they can be.
- **[02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7xtsTM4ysw&t=166s)** — And then we'll get to the number one most serious symptom. All right, so we have fatigue.
- **[02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7xtsTM4ysw&t=171s)** — You're going to have problems with your muscles, constipation, tremors, which is a muscle nerve
- **[02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7xtsTM4ysw&t=178s)** — problem. The other common problem with a potassium deficiency is abnormal heart rhythm problems.
- **[03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7xtsTM4ysw&t=186s)** — Now, how many people have a problem with their rhythm of the heart? A lot of people. How do
- **[03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7xtsTM4ysw&t=191s)** — we know that? Because a lot of people are on medication for that. You can have various
- **[03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7xtsTM4ysw&t=195s)** — mental issues when you have a potassium deficiency from being delirious, hallucinations,
- **[03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7xtsTM4ysw&t=204s)** — psychosis, and depression. Potassium is also needed to store glucose as glycogen in your
- **[03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7xtsTM4ysw&t=212s)** — liver and in your muscles. When you store glucose as glycogen in your liver and your
- **[03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7xtsTM4ysw&t=217s)** — muscles, you have also a lot of water that comes with it. So for every one glucose
- **[03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7xtsTM4ysw&t=223s)** — molecule that's stored, about three molecules of water are stored. When someone does a
- **[03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7xtsTM4ysw&t=229s)** — ketogenic diet or they go on a certain fast, what's going to happen? They're going to use
- **[03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7xtsTM4ysw&t=234s)** — up that glycogen and they're going to release a lot of that water. And with the loss of
- **[04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7xtsTM4ysw&t=240s)** — that water comes the electrolyte potassium. And this is one of the reasons why I recommend
- **[04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7xtsTM4ysw&t=244s)** — taking a good electrolyte powder with potassium when you do the ketogenic diet.
- **[04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7xtsTM4ysw&t=249s)** — Now without enough potassium, the blood pressure goes up. We've talked about that,
- **[04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7xtsTM4ysw&t=256s)** — but I didn't tell you this interesting fact about this. Potassium actually keeps the arteries
- **[04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7xtsTM4ysw&t=262s)** — soft, elastic, and it also increases something called nitric oxide. Whereas sodium tends to
- **[04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7xtsTM4ysw&t=269s)** — stiffen the arteries and lowers this nitric oxide. So potassium is really important for the
- **[04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7xtsTM4ysw&t=275s)** — of your arteries and especially if you have anything connected with high blood pressure.
- **[04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7xtsTM4ysw&t=280s)** — If you're potassium deficient, you can get headaches, you can get low back pain,
- **[04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7xtsTM4ysw&t=285s)** — bright back of your kidneys, you can become dizzy, and also you can have nocturia. What's
- **[04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7xtsTM4ysw&t=291s)** — that? That is a situation where you have to get up at night and urinate. With a potassium
- **[04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7xtsTM4ysw&t=296s)** — deficiency, you'll have a tendency to hold more fluid. You have more edema in your lower
- **[05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7xtsTM4ysw&t=301s)** — extremity or it could be anywhere actually. With a potassium deficiency, your pulse rate will
- **[05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7xtsTM4ysw&t=306s)** — tend to go a little higher as well and your risk for stroke goes up. But now let's talk about
- **[05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7xtsTM4ysw&t=312s)** — the number one most serious side effect from a potassium deficiency and that is sudden cardiac
- **[05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7xtsTM4ysw&t=320s)** — death. Heart failure. If someone has low potassium, their risk for sudden cardiac death
- **[05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7xtsTM4ysw&t=326s)** — increases by 10x. And even if we take a look at people with heart problems,
- **[05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7xtsTM4ysw&t=332s)** — what are they usually on? There are medications that manipulate sodium and some of the diuretics
- **[05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7xtsTM4ysw&t=337s)** — out there also get rid of potassium at the same time. But I'm telling you, there's just not a
- **[05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7xtsTM4ysw&t=342s)** — lot of focus on this potassium, this other side of the coin that I think is completely neglected
- **[05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7xtsTM4ysw&t=347s)** — in the area of cardiovascular health. Now that you know the number one serious symptom, let's
- **[05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7xtsTM4ysw&t=353s)** — talk about what foods or what things can create a deficiency. Well, number one, your diet. You
- **[05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7xtsTM4ysw&t=359s)** — just don't consume enough of leafy greens, squash, nuts, shellfish, bone broth, avocados,
- **[06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7xtsTM4ysw&t=368s)** — pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, mushrooms, all have potassium but also an excess of certain
- **[06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7xtsTM4ysw&t=377s)** — I'm talking about refined sugar and refined starches and refined grains, aka junk foods,
- **[06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7xtsTM4ysw&t=387s)** — will all deplete you of potassium. Then you get stress, steroids, gut inflammation or mal
- **[06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7xtsTM4ysw&t=394s)** — absorption, and then we get alcohol. Alcohol will also deplete potassium. So as you can see,
- **[06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7xtsTM4ysw&t=400s)** — potassium is super important for your health but also this other mineral is equally important
- **[06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7xtsTM4ysw&t=407s)** — for your health and that is called magnesium. And if you haven't seen my video magnesium,
- **[06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7xtsTM4ysw&t=411s)** — check it out. I put it right here.

- **[00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4jfBoOXNs8&t=0s)** — Today we are going to discuss the most powerful group behind what you eat.
- **[00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4jfBoOXNs8&t=5s)** — And you might even think that they are like the top brands that you see in the grocery store.
- **[00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4jfBoOXNs8&t=8s)** — But they are not the real big players. They are actually four companies that control
- **[00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4jfBoOXNs8&t=16s)** — 90% of the grain trade. And I am talking about products made from corn, soy, wheat, sugar,
- **[00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4jfBoOXNs8&t=24s)** — rice. You have to realize that these commodities make up like 68% of the average person's calories,
- **[00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4jfBoOXNs8&t=33s)** — at least in the United States. And this group is composed of four companies. They are kind of
- **[00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4jfBoOXNs8&t=38s)** — silent giants because a lot of people do not even know that they exist. They are the
- **[00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4jfBoOXNs8&t=43s)** — extremely powerful and influential middlemen between the farmers who they heavily control,
- **[00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4jfBoOXNs8&t=50s)** — as well as the other brands that you know about like Nestle and Kellogg's, etc. And they have
- **[00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4jfBoOXNs8&t=55s)** — huge influence over commodities. Well, commodities are like a stock market for crops. I mean,
- **[01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4jfBoOXNs8&t=61s)** — I have a tiny bit of experience with commodities. I had no business going into the commodity
- **[01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4jfBoOXNs8&t=66s)** — market. There are still skid marks on the turnpike going right into Philadelphia. When my
- **[01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4jfBoOXNs8&t=73s)** — wife was driving with all these kids in the backseat, I thought that was the best time to
- **[01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4jfBoOXNs8&t=77s)** — tell her that, honey, I lost all of our savings in the commodities market. Well, she slammed on
- **[01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4jfBoOXNs8&t=83s)** — the brakes and there was a little island of land right next to this major freeway that she
- **[01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4jfBoOXNs8&t=90s)** — pulled off of. She gets out of the car, she walks up and down this little piece of land.
- **[01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4jfBoOXNs8&t=94s)** — Let's just say she was extremely upset and she had to let out some steam, and rightfully so.
- **[01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4jfBoOXNs8&t=98s)** — And the whole thing is very confusing. But these four companies have a huge influence on
- **[01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4jfBoOXNs8&t=104s)** — what those prices are set at. And they get themselves into a really good situation because
- **[01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4jfBoOXNs8&t=111s)** — $700 billion a year are spent on subsidies for commodities like corn, wheat,
- **[01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4jfBoOXNs8&t=119s)** — soybean. Now, there's a really interesting study in the American Journal of Agricultural
- **[02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4jfBoOXNs8&t=123s)** — Economics. If we're giving them $700 billion a year, that should allow us to buy this food
- **[02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4jfBoOXNs8&t=130s)** — for a lot cheaper. For every dollar of corn subsidy, the resulting decrease in corn prices
- **[02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4jfBoOXNs8&t=137s)** — only led to a two cents reduction. Wait a second. That's not fair. I just gave you a dollar
- **[02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4jfBoOXNs8&t=143s)** — and I'm getting two cents back. Let's say you want to go buy a donut at the store and
- **[02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4jfBoOXNs8&t=147s)** — these donuts are a dollar. Okay, so you go to the store and what you might not realize is
- **[02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4jfBoOXNs8&t=153s)** — that you already spent $1.95 for that donut. And you didn't know it because it indirectly
- **[02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4jfBoOXNs8&t=158s)** — came through your paying for your taxes and you bought the raw materials to make it. And
- **[02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4jfBoOXNs8&t=163s)** — then you spend your dollar. So the total amount of money that you spent for that donut is $2.95.
- **[02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4jfBoOXNs8&t=168s)** — Then of course, when you eat the donut, you eventually have health problems. You have to go
- **[02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4jfBoOXNs8&t=172s)** — to the doctor and pay the doctor to fix your blood sugars, your high blood pressure, your
- **[02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4jfBoOXNs8&t=176s)** — high cholesterol, dementia, your heartburn. But thank goodness you have insurance, right? But
- **[03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4jfBoOXNs8&t=182s)** — the point is that these companies got themselves in a really good situation because a lot of
- **[03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4jfBoOXNs8&t=186s)** — raw materials are paid for by you in advance. So the four companies, ABCD, the first one is
- **[03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4jfBoOXNs8&t=194s)** — called Archer Daniels Midland, and then Bungee, and then Cargill, and then Louis Dreyfus.
- **[03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4jfBoOXNs8&t=202s)** — Those are the four companies that pretty much own the grain trade. They're the companies
- **[03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4jfBoOXNs8&t=208s)** — that supply 68% of your calories. And what's really wild is the junk food brands also own
- **[03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4jfBoOXNs8&t=215s)** — a lot of the organic and natural brands as well, as well as pet food and the vitamin and
- **[03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4jfBoOXNs8&t=222s)** — supplement companies as well. Now what's even more bizarre is if we kind of just lump together
- **[03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4jfBoOXNs8&t=227s)** — the three main ingredients in 99% of all junk food, we have starches, we have sugars,
- **[03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4jfBoOXNs8&t=234s)** — we have seed oils, right? And we know the sugars are there to sweeten something
- **[03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4jfBoOXNs8&t=238s)** — and they're highly addictive. And it will keep you craving for more sweets the more you eat
- **[04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4jfBoOXNs8&t=243s)** — them, right? The seed oils originated long ago in the 1800s with cotton seed oil. They were
- **[04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4jfBoOXNs8&t=250s)** — trying to figure out what to do with this waste. And so they decided to use it as a fuel.
- **[04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4jfBoOXNs8&t=257s)** — And then they decided, well, let's just put it in the food supply. And that was the start
- **[04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4jfBoOXNs8&t=261s)** — of repurposing a waste product from something else. And then we have starches, right? What's
- **[04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4jfBoOXNs8&t=268s)** — the purpose of a starch? The purpose of a starch is to add bulk to the product. It's not even
- **[04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4jfBoOXNs8&t=273s)** — sweet, even though a starch is a chain of sugar. I mean, it's one thing to add a filler
- **[04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4jfBoOXNs8&t=279s)** — for a product to kind of bulk up so you can sell it at a cheaper amount. But it's another
- **[04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4jfBoOXNs8&t=284s)** — thing to sell a filler that can create more of a spike on the glycemic index than actual
- **[04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4jfBoOXNs8&t=292s)** — by a factor of 185. So if we're comparing certain sugars to starches like cane sugar
- **[04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4jfBoOXNs8&t=297s)** — on the glycemic index, it's 65 for sugar. But then for maltodextrin, for example, that can
- **[05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4jfBoOXNs8&t=304s)** — go all the way up to 185. So think about what that's doing to your health. This so-called
- **[05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4jfBoOXNs8&t=311s)** — benign filler is creating major problems and it's in so many foods. I started looking
- **[05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4jfBoOXNs8&t=318s)** — through ultra-processed foods to see how much of the starch was present. And I got numbers from
- **[05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4jfBoOXNs8&t=324s)** — anywhere between 35 to 60 percent of the calories were these starches. This video is really
- **[05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4jfBoOXNs8&t=332s)** — about increasing the awareness of who's really controlling the food supply. And so this entire
- **[05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4jfBoOXNs8&t=338s)** — system of subsidizing certain crops started during the depression. They should have stopped
- **[05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4jfBoOXNs8&t=344s)** — right there, but they kept going. And now we have a system that really does not benefit you
- **[05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4jfBoOXNs8&t=349s)** — because you're buying certain ingredients at the expense of your own health with other companies
- **[05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4jfBoOXNs8&t=356s)** — majorly benefiting from your tax dollars. So it might sound like there's nothing you can do,
- **[06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4jfBoOXNs8&t=361s)** — but there is something you can do. The market follows the demand. That means the market
- **[06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4jfBoOXNs8&t=368s)** — follows what you buy. If you keep buying these products, this system will stay in existence forever.
- **[06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4jfBoOXNs8&t=374s)** — If you stop buying these products, you basically decrease the demand and the market will go in
- **[06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4jfBoOXNs8&t=379s)** — another direction. And so what I'm really trying to communicate is that you need to go
- **[06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4jfBoOXNs8&t=383s)** — on a low-carb ketogenic diet not just for your own health, but to influence this system,
- **[06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4jfBoOXNs8&t=391s)** — which I think is extremely corrupted. If you want to know exactly where to start, you can
- **[06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4jfBoOXNs8&t=396s)** — find the link in the description below. And if you want to learn more about this system,

## Video 95: The Nutrient Deficiency That Makes You Short

**Watch on YouTube:** [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhJa6F3fEy8](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhJa6F3fEy8)

## Full Transcript with Timestamps

*Click any timestamp to jump to that moment in the video*

- **[00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhJa6F3fEy8&t=0s)** — Today I'd like to discuss the most common micronutrient deficiency that can keep you on the short side.
- **[00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhJa6F3fEy8&t=9s)** — Personally, growing up, I think my growth was stunted through wrestling.
- **[00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhJa6F3fEy8&t=14s)** — I wrestled junior high school, high school, and I started college until I fractured my neck.
- **[00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhJa6F3fEy8&t=19s)** — But for about three years, I actually went through cycles of literally starving myself to make weight.
- **[00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhJa6F3fEy8&t=26s)** — I think that's the end of my growth. And I'm only 6'2".
- **[00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhJa6F3fEy8&t=28s)** — Now you might say, well, you're only 6'2", but yeah, but my dad's 6'5", my younger brother is 6'7", my mom is 6'4".
- **[00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhJa6F3fEy8&t=36s)** — No, I'm just kidding. She's 5'8".
- **[00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhJa6F3fEy8&t=38s)** — So if you're a teenager and you starve yourself, you know, especially three years in a row, that can have an influence on your nutrition.
- **[00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhJa6F3fEy8&t=45s)** — Most stunted growth is related to malnutrition.
- **[00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhJa6F3fEy8&t=48s)** — It is so important in the beginning years of life that you have all the essential nutrients.
- **[00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhJa6F3fEy8&t=53s)** — I'm talking about protein. I'm talking about vitamins, minerals, healthy fats,
- **[00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhJa6F3fEy8&t=59s)** — because as this relates to growth and development, not just your height, but organs and tissues.
- **[01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhJa6F3fEy8&t=64s)** — If you're deficient in iodine, for example, it can affect your cognitive function.
- **[01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhJa6F3fEy8&t=69s)** — If you're deficient in zinc, you can definitely be shorter as well.
- **[01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhJa6F3fEy8&t=72s)** — If you have some problem with your pituitary, that's going to affect your height,
- **[01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhJa6F3fEy8&t=76s)** — because the pituitary controls something called growth hormone.
- **[01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhJa6F3fEy8&t=79s)** — But generally speaking, girls generally have a growth spurt between 10 years old and 14,
- **[01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhJa6F3fEy8&t=86s)** — and boys between 12 and 15.
- **[01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhJa6F3fEy8&t=89s)** — But if we take a look at growth, we're going to talk about all of the things.
- **[01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhJa6F3fEy8&t=92s)** — We're going to talk about the protein, talk about vitamins and minerals, and we're going to talk about hormones.
- **[01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhJa6F3fEy8&t=97s)** — Let's start with hormones, OK?
- **[01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhJa6F3fEy8&t=99s)** — In a child, growth hormone primarily helps you grow.
- **[01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhJa6F3fEy8&t=102s)** — It helps your bones grow, helps your muscles grow, helps your height.
- **[01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhJa6F3fEy8&t=105s)** — Then when you become an adult, growth hormone has other functions.
- **[01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhJa6F3fEy8&t=108s)** — It keeps and preserves protein on your body.
- **[01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhJa6F3fEy8&t=111s)** — It's anti-aging. It helps you with weight loss.
- **[01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhJa6F3fEy8&t=115s)** — And there's several things about growth hormone I want to talk about.
- **[01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhJa6F3fEy8&t=117s)** — Number one, it's stimulated by amino acids protein.
- **[02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhJa6F3fEy8&t=122s)** — If you're not consuming enough quality protein, your growth hormone can be diminished.
- **[02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhJa6F3fEy8&t=127s)** — If you have a high sugary diet, if you have high blood glucose, or you have insulin resistance,
- **[02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhJa6F3fEy8&t=133s)** — If you don't sleep enough, growth hormone is made by your pituitary, goes to your liver,
- **[02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhJa6F3fEy8&t=139s)** — and then your liver makes insulin-like growth factor number one.
- **[02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhJa6F3fEy8&t=143s)** — Now this hormone, if deficient, can definitely make you shorter.
- **[02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhJa6F3fEy8&t=146s)** — And this hormone is also triggered by a good amount of amino acids and zinc.
- **[02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhJa6F3fEy8&t=152s)** — You know, how could you become deficient in zinc?
- **[02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhJa6F3fEy8&t=154s)** — Number one, not consuming enough foods high in zinc.
- **[02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhJa6F3fEy8&t=157s)** — And of all the foods that are high in zinc, we have red meat, other animal meats,
- **[02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhJa6F3fEy8&t=161s)** — we have fish, shellfish, and there's not a lot of zinc in plant foods,
- **[02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhJa6F3fEy8&t=168s)** — especially grains, especially corn, especially cassava, especially rice.
- **[02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhJa6F3fEy8&t=175s)** — And if we just take a look at the country that has the highest zinc deficiency,
- **[02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhJa6F3fEy8&t=179s)** — that would be in Africa, the Republic of Congo.
- **[03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhJa6F3fEy8&t=182s)** — And I'm primarily talking about children and mothers.
- **[03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhJa6F3fEy8&t=185s)** — Now, why would that be?
- **[03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhJa6F3fEy8&t=186s)** — Because if you look at their diet, it's mostly composed of rice, corn, grains, and cereals.
- **[03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhJa6F3fEy8&t=195s)** — Now what's the common denominator of all of those?
- **[03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhJa6F3fEy8&t=198s)** — It's phytic acid.
- **[03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhJa6F3fEy8&t=199s)** — It's a certain chemical that blocks zinc,
- **[03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhJa6F3fEy8&t=203s)** — creating a massive zinc deficiency which can affect the immune system.
- **[03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhJa6F3fEy8&t=207s)** — Okay, what are some other things that can create a deficiency of zinc?
- **[03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhJa6F3fEy8&t=210s)** — Stress, sugar, eating junk food. That was me.
- **[03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhJa6F3fEy8&t=214s)** — Now I also mentioned something related to sugar, insulin resistance.
- **[03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhJa6F3fEy8&t=218s)** — Most of the population has insulin resistance,
- **[03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhJa6F3fEy8&t=220s)** — and that can create an effect on your growth as well,
- **[03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhJa6F3fEy8&t=223s)** — because the insulin receptor has another function
- **[03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhJa6F3fEy8&t=226s)** — that goes beyond just the regulation of blood sugars.
- **[03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhJa6F3fEy8&t=229s)** — It helps you absorb nutrients.
- **[03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhJa6F3fEy8&t=231s)** — This is why when someone goes on the ketogenic diet
- **[03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhJa6F3fEy8&t=234s)** — and starts to repair this insulin resistance,
- **[03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhJa6F3fEy8&t=238s)** — and now insulin becomes more sensitive,
- **[04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhJa6F3fEy8&t=240s)** — they start having a healing effect with their muscles.
- **[04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhJa6F3fEy8&t=243s)** — Another important nutrient is vitamin D.
- **[04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhJa6F3fEy8&t=247s)** — Vitamin D is another really common deficiency
- **[04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhJa6F3fEy8&t=251s)** — simply because, first of all, kids don't go outside much anymore.
- **[04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhJa6F3fEy8&t=254s)** — It's almost impossible to get from your diet.
- **[04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhJa6F3fEy8&t=256s)** — All the junk food inhibits it,
- **[04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhJa6F3fEy8&t=257s)** — and the inflammation in our guts block the absorption of vitamin D.
- **[04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhJa6F3fEy8&t=261s)** — All of these things influence your growth hormone
- **[04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhJa6F3fEy8&t=264s)** — and your IGF number one, which is the insulin-like growth factor.
- **[04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhJa6F3fEy8&t=267s)** — So if you have a child that has stunted growth,
- **[04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhJa6F3fEy8&t=269s)** — I would definitely implement some of these strategies.
- **[04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhJa6F3fEy8&t=273s)** — And there's one more thing that I used in practice
- **[04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhJa6F3fEy8&t=276s)** — that seemed to work very well,
- **[04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhJa6F3fEy8&t=279s)** — because your pituitary is at the heart.
- **[04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhJa6F3fEy8&t=281s)** — And anything you can do to support the pituitary
- **[04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhJa6F3fEy8&t=283s)** — would be a good thing.
- **[04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhJa6F3fEy8&t=284s)** — There is one product that Standard Process
- **[04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhJa6F3fEy8&t=287s)** — sold when I was in practice that seemed to really work.
- **[04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhJa6F3fEy8&t=291s)** — It seemed to help children grow a lot more in a short period of time.
- **[04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhJa6F3fEy8&t=295s)** — It's called pituitrophin PMG.
- **[04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhJa6F3fEy8&t=297s)** — I would definitely recommend that.
- **[04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhJa6F3fEy8&t=299s)** — Maybe one before bed for maybe three months,
- **[05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhJa6F3fEy8&t=302s)** — just to optimize the potential for a child's growth.
- **[05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhJa6F3fEy8&t=306s)** — Now since we're on the topic of zinc,
- **[05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhJa6F3fEy8&t=308s)** — there's a lot more to learn.
- **[05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhJa6F3fEy8&t=309s)** — If you have not seen this very interesting video on zinc,
- **[05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhJa6F3fEy8&t=312s)** — I put it up right here.
- **[05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhJa6F3fEy8&t=313s)** — Check it out.

- **[00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XzJqVCJYqys&t=0s)** — I don't know if you realize this but there's this one protein that can raise insulin way more than
- **[00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XzJqVCJYqys&t=8s)** — white bread, way more than actual glucose. That protein is whey protein. So today let's discuss
- **[00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XzJqVCJYqys&t=16s)** — whey protein and is it good? Is it bad? What's my thoughts on it? What about... can it knock you
- **[00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XzJqVCJYqys&t=22s)** — out of ketosis? So white bread can increase the insulin by 87 percent and if we compare that to
- **[00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XzJqVCJYqys&t=29s)** — whey protein powder that can increase insulin by a factor of 139 percent. Now normally when we eat
- **[00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XzJqVCJYqys&t=37s)** — sugar, the blood sugar goes up and then insulin comes in there and pushes it down. But whey
- **[00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XzJqVCJYqys&t=44s)** — protein is not sugar. It is amino acids. Then those amino acids get absorbed very, very quickly
- **[00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XzJqVCJYqys&t=52s)** — and so they have an interesting fact because they raise insulin but apparently they don't spike
- **[00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XzJqVCJYqys&t=57s)** — your blood sugars. In fact there's been studies that show that if you're eating
- **[01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XzJqVCJYqys&t=63s)** — whey protein after a meal it can actually help lower your blood sugars so potentially help a
- **[01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XzJqVCJYqys&t=68s)** — diabetic. Now I don't know if that's true or not but the point is if... just think about it...
- **[01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XzJqVCJYqys&t=73s)** — if you're consuming something that raises insulin it's going to then push blood sugars down. The
- **[01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XzJqVCJYqys&t=79s)** — other thing about whey protein powder is that it also at the same time when it increases
- **[01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XzJqVCJYqys&t=84s)** — insulin it increases another opposing hormone called glucagon which tends to kind of neutralize
- **[01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XzJqVCJYqys&t=92s)** — some of the maybe bad effects of insulin. I think a question that people want to know
- **[01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XzJqVCJYqys&t=96s)** — is this... would whey protein knock me out of ketosis? And the answer is well yes because
- **[01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XzJqVCJYqys&t=104s)** — anything that increases insulin will knock you out of ketosis. And then of course the next
- **[01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XzJqVCJYqys&t=109s)** — question is will whey protein powder increase weight gain? Well I don't think it does because
- **[01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XzJqVCJYqys&t=115s)** — we're not necessarily converting glucose into fat. What we are doing is we're increasing
- **[02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XzJqVCJYqys&t=121s)** — insulin which has whether or not a lot of positive benefits especially if someone has
- **[02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XzJqVCJYqys&t=127s)** — insulin resistance. In fact if you take a look at all of the symptoms that relate to insulin
- **[02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XzJqVCJYqys&t=131s)** — resistance they're really a deficiency of insulin. Why? Because with insulin resistance
- **[02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XzJqVCJYqys&t=137s)** — you have the resistance and it takes greater and greater amounts of insulin to create the same
- **[02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XzJqVCJYqys&t=144s)** — effect. So the question is will whey protein powder create insulin resistance? Well it's a
- **[02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XzJqVCJYqys&t=151s)** — little bit of a mixed review because you know a lot of times when people take whey protein
- **[02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XzJqVCJYqys&t=155s)** — powder they also exercise at the same time. Exercise improves insulin resistance. So the
- **[02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XzJqVCJYqys&t=165s)** — whey protein powder does stimulate muscle growth but it also at the same time stimulates a lot of
- **[02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XzJqVCJYqys&t=171s)** — other things because it actually creates a hormonal effect on your body. So it may stimulate other
- **[02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XzJqVCJYqys&t=176s)** — organs not just your muscles like the prostate for example. There's also been some data
- **[03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XzJqVCJYqys&t=182s)** — that it can protect the liver. Other data that says that it worsens the liver. It can
- **[03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XzJqVCJYqys&t=188s)** — create inflammation in the liver. Increasing liver enzymes especially if you take it without
- **[03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XzJqVCJYqys&t=194s)** — exercising. So there is a bit of mixed reviews on exactly what it does and what it doesn't do.
- **[03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XzJqVCJYqys&t=200s)** — So would I recommend taking whey protein powder? Personally for me I don't take it because I
- **[03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XzJqVCJYqys&t=205s)** — don't feel good on it. I also know that whey protein powder is out of the natural
- **[03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XzJqVCJYqys&t=211s)** — milk complex. So it doesn't have the casein in it. It doesn't have any other nutrients in
- **[03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XzJqVCJYqys&t=217s)** — versus like if you had a fermented dairy like cheese right? It has everything in it plus
- **[03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XzJqVCJYqys&t=224s)** — additional microbes. So whey protein powder is kind of considered like a refined product but
- **[03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XzJqVCJYqys&t=229s)** — for some people it can create some positive effects on their muscles allowing amino acids to
- **[03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XzJqVCJYqys&t=235s)** — go into the cells a little bit better maybe after a workout. But on the flip side
- **[03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XzJqVCJYqys&t=239s)** — you have the whole egg and you also have meat and you have fish which are a better quality of
- **[04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XzJqVCJYqys&t=247s)** — amino acids. Plus you get a lot of additional nutrients with that. Plus you have less of an
- **[04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XzJqVCJYqys&t=252s)** — insulin spike but for certain people maybe in competition with bodybuilding, well they
- **[04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XzJqVCJYqys&t=258s)** — swear by it and it apparently does help them. So you might just want to experiment for yourself
- **[04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XzJqVCJYqys&t=263s)** — and see if it does help you and how you feel after taking it. But I wanted to give you
- **[04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XzJqVCJYqys&t=267s)** — some additional data on whey protein that you may have not heard before. Now since we're
- **[04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XzJqVCJYqys&t=273s)** — on the topic of dairy okay and let's say you're on the ketogenic plan. If you haven't seen this
- **[04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XzJqVCJYqys&t=279s)** — video you should probably check it out. I put it up right here.

- **[00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TYvz4hyYqhI&t=0s)** — Today, I want to share some really important information related to chronic kidney disease.
- **[00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TYvz4hyYqhI&t=6s)** — Chronic kidney disease is mainly made up by several types of problems with the kidney.
- **[00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TYvz4hyYqhI&t=11s)** — One would be just chronic kidney disease in general, which is usually or mostly caused
- **[00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TYvz4hyYqhI&t=17s)** — from diabetes. Okay. And then you have another type of kidney disease called polycystic kidney
- **[00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TYvz4hyYqhI&t=24s)** — disease. I'm going to be talking about that. And then you have another problem with the kidney,
- **[00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TYvz4hyYqhI&t=28s)** — which relates to kidney stones. We'll mention that as well. So if you have any of these problems,
- **[00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TYvz4hyYqhI&t=34s)** — this video is for you and you definitely want to watch it because I want to share some new
- **[00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TYvz4hyYqhI&t=39s)** — information, new research on this topic. When someone has end stage renal disease,
- **[00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TYvz4hyYqhI&t=46s)** — 10% of the time it's going to be related to this polycystic kidney disease. And that's a
- **[00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TYvz4hyYqhI&t=51s)** — situation where you have all these fluid filled sacks around the kidney. It kind of takes over
- **[00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TYvz4hyYqhI&t=57s)** — the blood and then the more cyst you have, the less ability for you to filter. And then now you
- **[01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TYvz4hyYqhI&t=63s)** — can't filter protein. So that starts going up in the blood and you start getting fluid retention
- **[01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TYvz4hyYqhI&t=68s)** — and you get a lot of problems. And polycystic kidney disease is mainly thought of as a genetic
- **[01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TYvz4hyYqhI&t=75s)** — problem. And until recently, like 2019, the thought was you really can't do anything about
- **[01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TYvz4hyYqhI&t=81s)** — genetic diseases, but you actually can. And this is actually quite fascinating because if someone
- **[01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TYvz4hyYqhI&t=88s)** — has these cysts that are overwhelming the kidney, pretty much they're just going to have
- **[01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TYvz4hyYqhI&t=92s)** — to wait until they get on dialysis or they get a kidney transplant. There just wasn't any
- **[01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TYvz4hyYqhI&t=99s)** — non-toxic solution. And this is the problem with the kidney and the liver especially.
- **[01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TYvz4hyYqhI&t=106s)** — Drugs tend to add more toxicity to these organs. And so there's too many side effects. So with the
- **[01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TYvz4hyYqhI&t=113s)** — polycystic kidney disease, you have increased risk of infection. You have urinary bleeding.
- **[01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TYvz4hyYqhI&t=119s)** — You have reduced function of the kidney, which the kidney is a filter and it filters out
- **[02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TYvz4hyYqhI&t=123s)** — the blood. And the person usually has high blood pressure. So in 2019, there was a study
- **[02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TYvz4hyYqhI&t=128s)** — that found that the ketogenic diet actually halted and reversed polycystic kidney disease
- **[02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TYvz4hyYqhI&t=137s)** — in mice. And so if you have a pet mouse or a gerbil or a rat that has this polycystic kidney
- **[02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TYvz4hyYqhI&t=144s)** — disease problem, definitely go low carb. But they also found that time restricted eating,
- **[02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TYvz4hyYqhI&t=149s)** — which is basically intermittent fasting, also created a similar effect. It slowed down the
- **[02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TYvz4hyYqhI&t=156s)** — the cysts developing in the kidney and the associated fibrosis or the scar tissue that
- **[02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TYvz4hyYqhI&t=162s)** — then comes after. It was also found that the ketogenic diet reduces the risk of kidney stones
- **[02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TYvz4hyYqhI&t=169s)** — as long as the person's on a low oxalate diet. Oxalates are things that contribute
- **[02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TYvz4hyYqhI&t=174s)** — to kidney stones and they're in the spinach, the almonds, the chocolate,
- **[02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TYvz4hyYqhI&t=179s)** — kiwi. But as long as you avoid those things and you're on the ketogenic diet and you're
- **[03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TYvz4hyYqhI&t=183s)** — water like 2.5 liters, at least a fluid per day, I think you're gonna be in pretty good shape.
- **[03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TYvz4hyYqhI&t=189s)** — This is what they found in the study. Okay. And I want to really make sure you get this one
- **[03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TYvz4hyYqhI&t=194s)** — point. These cysts that are developing in the kidney are absorbing glucose. And then of course,
- **[03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TYvz4hyYqhI&t=201s)** — with the glucose comes the water. So these cysts are fluid filled sacs that have water in
- **[03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TYvz4hyYqhI&t=208s)** — them. And of course, when they absorb water, they get bigger. But the surprising thing that
- **[03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TYvz4hyYqhI&t=213s)** — they found. And so if you checked out, check back in right now, because this is the most
- **[03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TYvz4hyYqhI&t=217s)** — important part of the video, is this. These cysts not only absorb glucose, but they are
- **[03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TYvz4hyYqhI&t=224s)** — dependent on glucose. In other words, they can only grow if they have glucose. And of
- **[03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TYvz4hyYqhI&t=231s)** — course, because this was a medical paper, they went on to say that maybe drug companies can
- **[03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TYvz4hyYqhI&t=237s)** — come up with a drug to block glucose to help reduce this polycystic kidney disease. Of course,
- **[04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TYvz4hyYqhI&t=244s)** — I have a different viewpoint. Why don't we just not consume glucose in the diet? Okay. Go on a
- **[04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TYvz4hyYqhI&t=249s)** — low carb diet, because it's been found that the ketogenic diet may improve this condition.
- **[04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TYvz4hyYqhI&t=254s)** — So that's pretty interesting, because if you can block sugar, or avoid sugar, you can actually
- **[04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TYvz4hyYqhI&t=259s)** — shrink these cysts. And then of course, I got to thinking there's cysts in the other parts
- **[04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TYvz4hyYqhI&t=265s)** — of the body too. You have cysts in the liver, and you even have Baker cysts that could be in
- **[04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TYvz4hyYqhI&t=269s)** — the back of the knee. And I've already experienced if you get the person off sugar, those tend to
- **[04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TYvz4hyYqhI&t=273s)** — go away. But then I actually kind of looked at the cyst in the liver. And I found that one
- **[04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TYvz4hyYqhI&t=278s)** — remedy for that is metformin. What is metformin do? It actually has to do with
- **[04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TYvz4hyYqhI&t=284s)** — regulating blood sugar by improving insulin resistance. Another interesting association,
- **[04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TYvz4hyYqhI&t=290s)** — and you can even improve the cyst by taking ketones. So apparently ketones are pretty
- **[04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TYvz4hyYqhI&t=297s)** — powerful in dealing with the cysts, which make a lot of sense, since they're dependent on
- **[05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TYvz4hyYqhI&t=302s)** — glucose. And the only way your body can generate ketones is if you lower insulin
- **[05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TYvz4hyYqhI&t=306s)** — and lower glucose. But apparently you can even take ketones, which I'm not recommending,
- **[05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TYvz4hyYqhI&t=311s)** — but that's one way to reduce the cysts. Now there's actually three ways to get ketones in
- **[05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TYvz4hyYqhI&t=317s)** — the body. One is a low carb diet. The other is to take ketones. And the third way is to fast,
- **[05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TYvz4hyYqhI&t=325s)** — forcing your body to make ketones from your own fat. And so apparently fasting
- **[05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TYvz4hyYqhI&t=332s)** — strongly inhibits the fibrosis or scar tissue that are associated with these cysts,
- **[05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TYvz4hyYqhI&t=337s)** — as well as inhibiting something called mTOR. Now what is mTOR? mTOR is something in the body
- **[05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TYvz4hyYqhI&t=344s)** — that can trigger the growth of cancer, tumors, and even cysts. So anything that reduces mTOR is a
- **[05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TYvz4hyYqhI&t=353s)** — really good thing, especially if you have kidney problems. And fasting is a potent stimulator,
- **[06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TYvz4hyYqhI&t=360s)** — but there's some other things too. Curcumin also reduces mTOR. Resveratrol will also reduce
- **[06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TYvz4hyYqhI&t=367s)** — it. And the EGCG in green tea, as well as cursitin and berberine. These are all potent
- **[06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TYvz4hyYqhI&t=375s)** — natural remedies to lower mTOR to help kidney cysts. But what about other types of kidney
- **[06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TYvz4hyYqhI&t=381s)** — disease, chronic kidney disease? Well, the majority of that is caused by the same thing,
- **[06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TYvz4hyYqhI&t=386s)** — glucose, because the root cause of this is definitely diabetes. So anything related to
- **[06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TYvz4hyYqhI&t=393s)** — like whether you have a pre-diabetic situation or even insulin resistance could contribute to
- **[06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TYvz4hyYqhI&t=398s)** — a worsening of the kidney function. There's an interesting protein. I won't get into the
- **[06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TYvz4hyYqhI&t=403s)** — biochemical name, but there's an interesting protein that triggers another protein
- **[06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TYvz4hyYqhI&t=406s)** — that then kind of goes around and around and around that leads to damage in the kidney.
- **[06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TYvz4hyYqhI&t=413s)** — And I'm going to put down a link down below of a new discovery of an inhibitor of that
- **[06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TYvz4hyYqhI&t=419s)** — specific protein that they're actually using a drug to do it to potentially halt or stop kidney
- **[07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TYvz4hyYqhI&t=426s)** — disease. So this protein that they're trying to inhibit is called TRPC5. Not that you needed
- **[07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TYvz4hyYqhI&t=434s)** — to know that, but I did a search on if there's any inhibitors to this protein,
- **[07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TYvz4hyYqhI&t=439s)** — and I found that there is curcumin and resveratrol. So if you have chronic kidney
- **[07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TYvz4hyYqhI&t=446s)** — disease, regardless of what caused it, this is what I would do. I would definitely take these
- **[07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TYvz4hyYqhI&t=451s)** — phytonutrients from these herbs. I would also go on a low oxalate ketogenic diet. So you're
- **[07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TYvz4hyYqhI&t=457s)** — not taking too many almonds or spinach or almond flour or kiwis. And if you added
- **[07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TYvz4hyYqhI&t=466s)** — intermittent fasting with that, you'd come up with a really good program to take those cysts
- **[07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TYvz4hyYqhI&t=473s)** — or take whatever damage in the kidney you have and hopefully bring it in the reverse. Anyway,
- **[07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TYvz4hyYqhI&t=478s)** — I wanted to share that information with you, especially if you have a kidney problem or know
- **[08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TYvz4hyYqhI&t=483s)** — of a person who has a problem. And if you hear anywhere that the ketogenic diet is really
- **[08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TYvz4hyYqhI&t=488s)** — bad for the kidneys, I think you should watch this video right here.

- **[00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNfVJIthdyA&t=0s)** — The real underlying deeper cellular cause of autism involves
- **[00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNfVJIthdyA&t=5s)** — oxidative stress to neurons leading to neuronal toxicity and inflammation.
- **[00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNfVJIthdyA&t=12s)** — Basically, there's inflammation in the brain and there's a lot of free radical damage, but there's
- **[00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNfVJIthdyA&t=17s)** — not enough antioxidant protection to counter that.
- **[00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNfVJIthdyA&t=21s)** — Now, your body makes antioxidants and they can come from the diet.
- **[00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNfVJIthdyA&t=25s)** — But I did a huge deep dive into this topic and I found some really interesting information
- **[00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNfVJIthdyA&t=30s)** — on some common deficiencies with many people who have autism. Number one, they tend to have
- **[00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNfVJIthdyA&t=38s)** — low amounts of antioxidants. I already mentioned that, especially glutathione.
- **[00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNfVJIthdyA&t=42s)** — That's the master antioxidant in the body that does a tremendous amount of work in
- **[00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNfVJIthdyA&t=47s)** — protecting you and getting rid of toxicity and free radical damage. There's also low vitamin A,
- **[00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNfVJIthdyA&t=52s)** — there's low vitamin E, low vitamin D, there's low zinc, selenium, low magnesium, and low omega 3.
- **[01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNfVJIthdyA&t=62s)** — There's also mitochondrial dysfunction, which is not surprising because anytime you have oxidative
- **[01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNfVJIthdyA&t=67s)** — stress, you're going to have problems in the mitochondria deep within the neuron. And there's
- **[01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNfVJIthdyA&t=73s)** — also something called high homocysteine, which you may connect with heart problems, but in this
- **[01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNfVJIthdyA&t=79s)** — case, it can create degenerative symptoms in the brain. And the solution for that is B12
- **[01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNfVJIthdyA&t=87s)** — in folate in a certain form, which I'll cover in a bit. And there's also amino acid
- **[01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNfVJIthdyA&t=94s)** — abnormalities, probably because of all the oxidation going on. These amino acids are
- **[01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNfVJIthdyA&t=98s)** — really important because they actually the raw material for all the enzymes in the biochemical
- **[01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNfVJIthdyA&t=103s)** — pathways. So based on that data, the best diet that I would recommend would be a version
- **[01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNfVJIthdyA&t=109s)** — of the carnivore diet because that will eliminate so many potential allergic type reactions that
- **[01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNfVJIthdyA&t=116s)** — the person's having, including the gluten intolerance problem or a gluten allergy or a
- **[02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNfVJIthdyA&t=122s)** — casein allergy or whatever, because a lot of people who have autism have food allergies and
- **[02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNfVJIthdyA&t=128s)** — that creates more oxidative stress. So anything we can do to take the load off this oxidative
- **[02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNfVJIthdyA&t=133s)** — stress by eliminating any potential allergic type things is going to be really good. And
- **[02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNfVJIthdyA&t=138s)** — within that carnivore diet, I would include eggs, okay, because you're going to get a lot of
- **[02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNfVJIthdyA&t=143s)** — vitamin A in the egg yolk, as well as other minerals and vitamins. I would also include
- **[02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNfVJIthdyA&t=150s)** — seafood and even shellfish, even though there might be a little bit more higher mercury. You're
- **[02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNfVJIthdyA&t=156s)** — also at the same time going to get higher levels of selenium and zinc and other trace
- **[02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNfVJIthdyA&t=162s)** — minerals, which are very protective against these heavy metals. I would also include Oregon
- **[02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNfVJIthdyA&t=168s)** — meats like beef liver. If you don't like liver, either get a good recipe or camouflage it
- **[02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNfVJIthdyA&t=176s)** — in hamburger or take grass fed liver pills, because not only does liver have pretty much
- **[03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNfVJIthdyA&t=183s)** — everything that I mentioned, including B12 and folate and zinc and selenium, but it's also a
- **[03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNfVJIthdyA&t=192s)** — mentioned and it has something else coq10. That is very, very powerful for the mitochondria,
- **[03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNfVJIthdyA&t=201s)** — and that can be extremely helpful. What I'm trying to do in this protocol is instead of
- **[03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNfVJIthdyA&t=206s)** — loading up with a lot of different vitamins, I'm trying to include the foods that contain
- **[03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNfVJIthdyA&t=211s)** — those vitamins so you wouldn't have to take every single nutrient. Now the tweak to this
- **[03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNfVJIthdyA&t=215s)** — carnivore diet, which will make it not quite carnivore, it's going to make it more
- **[03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNfVJIthdyA&t=220s)** — of a ketogenic plan because we're going to add a little bit of carbs, but not too much.
- **[03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNfVJIthdyA&t=226s)** — You would add microgreens or sprouts. Now if you could find microgreens grown in soil,
- **[03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNfVJIthdyA&t=233s)** — that would be the ultimate why. Because these baby plants, roughly about seven to ten days,
- **[04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNfVJIthdyA&t=242s)** — are some of the most vital nutrient, antioxidant rich things that you can possibly
- **[04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNfVJIthdyA&t=246s)** — eat. And some of them are loaded with sulforaphane, which is an effective known remedy for
- **[04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNfVJIthdyA&t=252s)** — autism. Microgreens and sprouts are basically antioxidants on steroids. Now to build up
- **[04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNfVJIthdyA&t=258s)** — glutathione, there's two things. You have a remedy called NAC, which helps indirectly
- **[04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNfVJIthdyA&t=265s)** — build up glutathione, and selenium. Now you could take selenium as a supplement, or if
- **[04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNfVJIthdyA&t=270s)** — you're doing shellfish or seafood, you're going to get a good amount of selenium. Now
- **[04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNfVJIthdyA&t=274s)** — another really important remedy would be cod liver oil. Why? Because it's the perfect EPA, DHA,
- **[04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNfVJIthdyA&t=282s)** — omega-3s, as well as vitamin A and vitamin D. And the person who has autism might need more
- **[04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNfVJIthdyA&t=289s)** — vitamin D, in which case the best thing to do is to expose themselves to a lot of sun,
- **[04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNfVJIthdyA&t=295s)** — without getting burnt. They can't do that, like in the winter. Then take a good vitamin D3
- **[05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNfVJIthdyA&t=303s)** — supplement, at least 10,000 IUs per day. Probably more, like maybe even 20,000 IUs.
- **[05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNfVJIthdyA&t=311s)** — That's going to act as a very potent anti-inflammatory. Now if you're not
- **[05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNfVJIthdyA&t=315s)** — doing the beef liver because you don't like liver, or you're not going to do the pills,
- **[05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNfVJIthdyA&t=319s)** — then I recommend that you get the type of B12 and folate that can help lower homocysteine
- **[05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNfVJIthdyA&t=325s)** — and greatly help this condition. The form of B12 that you need to take is called
- **[05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNfVJIthdyA&t=330s)** — methylcobalamin, not the cyanocobalamin that many people take that they don't realize it's
- **[05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNfVJIthdyA&t=335s)** — just a synthetic version. It's not the right one. And then the type of folate they need is
- **[05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNfVJIthdyA&t=340s)** — something called methylfolate, not folic acid. Now as far as coenzyme Q10, you could get that
- **[05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNfVJIthdyA&t=346s)** — in organ meats, but it is a very effective measure to improve your mitochondria. So you
- **[05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNfVJIthdyA&t=353s)** — may want to add that to the list with this extra thing called methylene blue. You can order on
- **[06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNfVJIthdyA&t=361s)** — Amazon or get it from the health food store. But methylene blue is very, very interesting.
- **[06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNfVJIthdyA&t=366s)** — I've done videos about it. And depending on the age of the person, let's say they're
- **[06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNfVJIthdyA&t=369s)** — a child, I would recommend maybe 10 drops. It's a very small amount. If they're older,
- **[06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNfVJIthdyA&t=375s)** — maybe take 20 drops. And both 10 to 20 drops is a very small dosage. And you would put that
- **[06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNfVJIthdyA&t=380s)** — in a glass of water. You might want to add some electrolytes to it and sip it with a straw,
- **[06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNfVJIthdyA&t=385s)** — because methylene blue can greatly help reduce the oxidative stress in the mitochondria,
- **[06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNfVJIthdyA&t=391s)** — taking the pressure off the neurons, improving the symptoms of autism. So there you have it.
- **[06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNfVJIthdyA&t=397s)** — That's the plan that I would recommend. And if you have not seen my video on
- **[06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNfVJIthdyA&t=402s)** — furifane and autism, you should check that out. I put it up right here.

- **[00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLrMpB5Bgtk&t=0s)** — The number one cause of heart disease is now what you think. I called up a heart surgeon, a friend,
- **[00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLrMpB5Bgtk&t=5s)** — Dr. Philip Ovadia. And I asked, do you ever see this problem when you do open heart surgeries?
- **[00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLrMpB5Bgtk&t=10s)** — And he said nearly 100% of the time. It's a type of visceral fat around the heart itself.
- **[00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLrMpB5Bgtk&t=16s)** — What's unique about this fat is it directly contacts the heart muscle and the arteries
- **[00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLrMpB5Bgtk&t=22s)** — itself. So that means the inflammation from this type of fat goes directly into the heart
- **[00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLrMpB5Bgtk&t=28s)** — first before any other place in the body. The big question is what causes this layer of fat?
- **[00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLrMpB5Bgtk&t=34s)** — And so the key to this whole story is insulin. If insulin is high, you're going to get really fat.
- **[00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLrMpB5Bgtk&t=38s)** — You're going to start gaining weight. When insulin is low, everything is reversed. You're
- **[00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLrMpB5Bgtk&t=42s)** — going to lose weight and get rid of fat, especially the fat surrounding the heart. This
- **[00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLrMpB5Bgtk&t=46s)** — problem with the fat around the heart relates to something called insulin resistance. Very simply,
- **[00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLrMpB5Bgtk&t=51s)** — the receptor for insulin is no longer accepting insulin. That's what insulin resistance is.
- **[00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLrMpB5Bgtk&t=58s)** — Now the problem is where does the fat go? It accumulates around the liver as a fatty liver,
- **[01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLrMpB5Bgtk&t=62s)** — accumulates around the organs as visceral fat. I'm going to give you
- **[01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLrMpB5Bgtk&t=65s)** — seven clues to determine if you have insulin resistance. Number one, if you're a guy
- **[01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLrMpB5Bgtk&t=71s)** — and your waist is greater than 40 inches, chances are you have insulin resistance. If
- **[01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLrMpB5Bgtk&t=75s)** — you're female and you have a waist size that's over 35 inches, chances are you might have
- **[01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLrMpB5Bgtk&t=80s)** — insulin resistance. Next one, if you have a skin tag or even like this darkened pigment
- **[01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLrMpB5Bgtk&t=86s)** — underneath the armpits in your groin, think insulin resistance. If your triglycerides are
- **[01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLrMpB5Bgtk&t=91s)** — high or you have low HDL, think insulin resistance. If you have difficulty losing weight,
- **[01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLrMpB5Bgtk&t=96s)** — you probably have insulin resistance. And the last clue is that you just can't go
- **[01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLrMpB5Bgtk&t=100s)** — very long without needing a meal. Fasting is difficult. That's called insulin resistance. But
- **[01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLrMpB5Bgtk&t=105s)** — this leads to a bigger question. What actually causes insulin resistance? Yes, starches like
- **[01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLrMpB5Bgtk&t=111s)** — potato, pasta, bread, cereal crackers, and all that stuff as well. Definitely out of a lot of
- **[01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLrMpB5Bgtk&t=116s)** — these, fructose is at the top of the list. But there's other causes like stress or even
- **[02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLrMpB5Bgtk&t=122s)** — having a chronic problem with your sleep where you just don't sleep that well. Maybe you have
- **[02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLrMpB5Bgtk&t=126s)** — sleep apnea or you just don't sleep. That can set you up for insulin resistance. This is
- **[02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLrMpB5Bgtk&t=130s)** — why people crave maybe junk food or sugar if they haven't slept or they're under stress.
- **[02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLrMpB5Bgtk&t=134s)** — But there's one other big cause to insulin resistance you need to know about. Seed oils.
- **[02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLrMpB5Bgtk&t=140s)** — That's right. Seed oils. Some people will say the omega-6 fatty acids are essential,
- **[02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLrMpB5Bgtk&t=144s)** — which they are. But you know a lot of these studies never look at oxidation from these oils.
- **[02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLrMpB5Bgtk&t=152s)** — You see these omega-6 oils are very, very fragile, very vulnerable to oxygen, heat,
- **[02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLrMpB5Bgtk&t=159s)** — and light. But do you ever notice when they make seed oils? Like this could sit on the
- **[02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLrMpB5Bgtk&t=163s)** — shelf. It doesn't even have to be refrigerated for a very long time. How do they get it to
- **[02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLrMpB5Bgtk&t=167s)** — These industrial seed oils are highly processed with high heats, with chemicals like hexane,
- **[02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLrMpB5Bgtk&t=174s)** — which is in your gasoline. And so that when you consume this stuff, it gets stuck in your
- **[03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLrMpB5Bgtk&t=180s)** — cells for like a year and a half. That is a major contributor to the insulin receptor damage
- **[03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLrMpB5Bgtk&t=187s)** — on the surface of that cell. And especially since the average person consumes literally 25%
- **[03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLrMpB5Bgtk&t=193s)** — to 30% of their calories being these oils. Here a person is, they go on the ketogenic diet,
- **[03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLrMpB5Bgtk&t=200s)** — the low-carb diet, and they're not eating sugars anymore, and they're not consuming
- **[03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLrMpB5Bgtk&t=205s)** — starches, and they're feeling better. But maybe their inflammation is not going away. Maybe
- **[03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLrMpB5Bgtk&t=209s)** — they're not reversing their heart problems. And maybe they're not even correcting insulin
- **[03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLrMpB5Bgtk&t=214s)** — resistance because the ketogenic low-carb diet is a low-carb diet. It's not a low-seed oil
- **[03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLrMpB5Bgtk&t=222s)** — diet. But if you read my book, I talk about the healthy version of the ketogenic diet.
- **[03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLrMpB5Bgtk&t=227s)** — I'm talking about doing the low-carb diet with higher quality ingredients. Cooking with butter,
- **[03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLrMpB5Bgtk&t=232s)** — tallow, maybe coconut oil, using olive oil, not the seed oil dressing. So one of the root
- **[03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLrMpB5Bgtk&t=237s)** — causes for heart disease is the epicardial fat, which comes mostly from the combination
- **[04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLrMpB5Bgtk&t=244s)** — of sugar, starches, but definitely seed oils. Aka, if you add all those up, you get
- **[04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLrMpB5Bgtk&t=251s)** — ultra-processed foods. But the good news is there's some really quick things to do to get
- **[04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLrMpB5Bgtk&t=256s)** — rid of this fat. So number one, get rid of the seed oils, replace it with healthy oils. I'll put
- **[04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLrMpB5Bgtk&t=261s)** — a link down below for more details. Number two, go on a low-carb, low-starch diet, aka keto
- **[04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLrMpB5Bgtk&t=267s)** — diet. The other interesting thing about this fat is it's not like regular fat. It's right
- **[04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLrMpB5Bgtk&t=271s)** — in the center. It's like a beige color. Of course, this is yellow, but it's really beige,
- **[04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLrMpB5Bgtk&t=276s)** — which means it's right in the middle. But it does respond very well to things that also
- **[04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLrMpB5Bgtk&t=281s)** — stimulate brown fat, like cold therapy, like taking a cold shower. Cold immersion tanks
- **[04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLrMpB5Bgtk&t=288s)** — are really good to help with this. It's one of the fastest ways to drop your insulin,
- **[04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLrMpB5Bgtk&t=293s)** — okay? Because it's the chronic insulin production that really creates the problem. So if we just
- **[04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLrMpB5Bgtk&t=298s)** — reverse the flow and not increase insulin by not eating, we can quickly turn things around.
- **[05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLrMpB5Bgtk&t=303s)** — So I would recommend two meals a day with your first one at lunch and your second one at dinner
- **[05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLrMpB5Bgtk&t=307s)** — and absolutely, positively no snacks because it's the snacks that destroy the ability to get
- **[05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLrMpB5Bgtk&t=313s)** — rid of this fat. And it's something that's been introduced as a normal thing that we need to
- **[05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLrMpB5Bgtk&t=318s)** — snack between meals, which is totally the worst habit you can do. And what's really
- **[05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLrMpB5Bgtk&t=323s)** — interesting, the type of exercise you do matters. I mean, just one bout of high-intensity
- **[05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLrMpB5Bgtk&t=329s)** — interval training can actually make your receptors for insulin more sensitive significantly.
- **[05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLrMpB5Bgtk&t=334s)** — So do not forget about exercise. And that high-intensity interval training works better
- **[05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLrMpB5Bgtk&t=339s)** — than a moderate intensity of running or jogging a long distance because of the cortisol spike
- **[05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLrMpB5Bgtk&t=344s)** — that happens when you do that. Two other things that can help you. Number one is doing
- **[05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLrMpB5Bgtk&t=347s)** — apple cider vinegar a few times a day in some water, like one tablespoon in a glass of water.
- **[05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLrMpB5Bgtk&t=352s)** — And then berberine is also something that can help you speed up the process. And to get the
- **[05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLrMpB5Bgtk&t=357s)** — details on how to do intermittent fasting, you should watch this video right here.

- **[00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JAUBavPuXpo&t=0s)** — So let's talk about the foods that most commonly rob you of nutrients. So this video is not about
- **[00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JAUBavPuXpo&t=6s)** — getting nutrients from food. It's about being aware of certain foods that deplete you of
- **[00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JAUBavPuXpo&t=11s)** — nutrients. So you have to know both sides. So the first one I'm going to talk about is raw
- **[00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JAUBavPuXpo&t=16s)** — egg whites. Okay, anytime you eat raw egg whites you can create a biotin deficiency.
- **[00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JAUBavPuXpo&t=22s)** — Biotin is really important for your nails and your hair. It makes the hair and nails thicker
- **[00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JAUBavPuXpo&t=28s)** — and stronger. And if you're deficient in biotin you're probably going to notice that your hair is
- **[00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JAUBavPuXpo&t=32s)** — starting to become brittle. Your nails break easily. Biotin also can become depleted after
- **[00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JAUBavPuXpo&t=39s)** — taking an antibiotic because a good portion of your microbes also make this biotin which is
- **[00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JAUBavPuXpo&t=44s)** — a B vitamin. Now of course the next three foods are... you pretty much already know this but
- **[00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JAUBavPuXpo&t=54s)** — you'll deplete you of vitamin B1, zinc, magnesium, and vitamin C. Massive calories in their diet,
- **[01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JAUBavPuXpo&t=63s)** — they're usually going to have these deficiencies. It's going to show up as
- **[01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JAUBavPuXpo&t=66s)** — bleeding gums, fatigue because of the vitamin C. They're also going to notice that their
- **[01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JAUBavPuXpo&t=71s)** — immune system is going to be very weak because of the zinc issue as well as noticing skin
- **[01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JAUBavPuXpo&t=76s)** — issues. A lot of skin issues are related to a zinc deficiency. And of course a B1 deficiency will
- **[01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JAUBavPuXpo&t=82s)** — cause a lot of anxiety, nervous tension, excessive stress, thinking about things, worrying about
- **[01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JAUBavPuXpo&t=89s)** — things too much, muscle cramps at night, difficulty in getting to sleep because your
- **[01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JAUBavPuXpo&t=94s)** — muscles are so tense. Next one is caffeinated beverages like in coffee and tea and soda. The
- **[01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JAUBavPuXpo&t=106s)** — And then we get into something else called trypsin inhibitors. Like what's a trypsin
- **[01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JAUBavPuXpo&t=113s)** — inhibitor? Trypsin is an enzyme and if you inhibit that with the following foods,
- **[01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JAUBavPuXpo&t=119s)** — soy, grains, beans, nuts, seeds, and nightshades, you could have a problem absorbing
- **[02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JAUBavPuXpo&t=127s)** — certain amino acids. Also absorbing fat soluble vitamins. Now what a lot of people do to
- **[02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JAUBavPuXpo&t=136s)** — germinate or sprout those foods. But people that don't germinate it and they just eat it raw
- **[02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JAUBavPuXpo&t=142s)** — thinking it's going to be better are in for a surprise. Because in that raw food, that
- **[02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JAUBavPuXpo&t=147s)** — un-germinated food, there's certain defense mechanisms that those plants have created to
- **[02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JAUBavPuXpo&t=154s)** — prevent the digestion of those plants. And then we get into another chemical called tannins
- **[02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JAUBavPuXpo&t=159s)** — and that's in tea. That will definitely create a B1 deficiency, especially for those people that
- **[02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JAUBavPuXpo&t=164s)** — are big tea drinkers and they just drink tea all day long, which is actually better than coffee,
- **[02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JAUBavPuXpo&t=169s)** — but it can create a B1 deficiency and it can start affecting your sleep and your mood.
- **[02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JAUBavPuXpo&t=175s)** — If you are taking too much calcium, you can actually create a magnesium deficiency. This
- **[03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JAUBavPuXpo&t=181s)** — also goes along with consuming a lot of dairy. Without leafy greens, you create a magnesium
- **[03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JAUBavPuXpo&t=187s)** — deficiency. Magnesium helps you relax at night. It helps the muscles relax. It prevents cramps.
- **[03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JAUBavPuXpo&t=194s)** — Arrhythmias and also magnesium is behind energy. So if you're fatigued, chances are you might be
- **[03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JAUBavPuXpo&t=201s)** — magnesium deficient. Then we get to something called oxalates. So oxalates are compounds that
- **[03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JAUBavPuXpo&t=208s)** — bind with calcium, magnesium, and iron. And when it binds with the calcium, it can actually
- **[03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JAUBavPuXpo&t=215s)** — form kidney stones. And there are certain foods, especially in the ketogenic diet,
- **[03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JAUBavPuXpo&t=220s)** — that are loaded with oxalates. Spinach being at the top of the list, but I think there's one
- **[03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JAUBavPuXpo&t=226s)** — bigger than that. That would be beet greens. Beets also have oxalates. Almonds, almond flour,
- **[03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JAUBavPuXpo&t=234s)** — chocolate, Swiss chard, and other non-keto foods like grains and beans. Phosphoric acid
- **[04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JAUBavPuXpo&t=242s)** — in sodas actually will definitely deplete you of magnesium and calcium. This is why
- **[04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JAUBavPuXpo&t=247s)** — drinking a lot of those sodas can actually really destroy your bones. And of course,
- **[04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JAUBavPuXpo&t=252s)** — you know, I don't even consider soda food, but I just threw that in there.
- **[04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JAUBavPuXpo&t=256s)** — And lastly, I want to mention something called phytates or phytic acid. Same thing. Phytates are
- **[04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JAUBavPuXpo&t=263s)** — in certain foods that then block zinc, calcium, vitamin B3, chromium, copper, iron,
- **[04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JAUBavPuXpo&t=274s)** — magnesium, manganese, and vitamin D. Like kids have a lot of cereal. They're getting a lot of
- **[04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JAUBavPuXpo&t=280s)** — phytates and that's going to deplete the zinc, which is really, really important for the
- **[04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JAUBavPuXpo&t=283s)** — immune system. And in certain parts of the world, the children that are deficient in zinc
- **[04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JAUBavPuXpo&t=289s)** — have a massive problem with diarrhea. And so that can cause other problems with electrolyte
- **[04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JAUBavPuXpo&t=294s)** — deficiencies. So in summary, the foods that really deplete you of other nutrients would be
- **[04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JAUBavPuXpo&t=299s)** — the grains at the top of the list. Now, because of the censoring and the suppressing of the
- **[05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JAUBavPuXpo&t=303s)** — algorithms on YouTube, it's becoming more difficult to find my content. And there's a
- **[05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JAUBavPuXpo&t=308s)** — lot of content that I cannot put on YouTube, unfortunately. So to make sure you have full

- **[05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JAUBavPuXpo&t=329s)** — is magnesium. And magnesium has a lot to do with your energy production. So if you have not seen

- **[00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGu8php0XoY&t=0s)** — Let's talk about the ultimate face remedy for both wrinkly and dry skin.
- **[00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGu8php0XoY&t=6s)** — The skin is the largest organ in the body. And anything that you put on the skin gets absorbed
- **[00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGu8php0XoY&t=11s)** — inside into the body, eventually through the liver. And it's amazing what types of things people
- **[00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGu8php0XoY&t=16s)** — put on their skin. I mean, just all sorts of chemical lotions and makeup, you name it.
- **[00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGu8php0XoY&t=23s)** — They scrub the skin, they sterilize it. You have friendly bacteria on your skin, right? And
- **[00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGu8php0XoY&t=28s)** — you sterilize it, the skin becomes red. It dries out. Or sometimes it becomes too oily. So it's
- **[00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGu8php0XoY&t=34s)** — very important to understand not to put anything on your skin that could be toxic.
- **[00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGu8php0XoY&t=38s)** — Compound that with pollution. If someone smokes secondhand smoke, or let's say you smoke,
- **[00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGu8php0XoY&t=44s)** — and all that goes into the body. I mean, you have fluoride and chloride in your shower,
- **[00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGu8php0XoY&t=49s)** — with it hitting your skin. You have the sun's UV radiation that damages the skin. And then
- **[00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGu8php0XoY&t=59s)** — alcohol or consumption of trans fats, all that goes into the body and it can greatly affect the
- **[01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGu8php0XoY&t=64s)** — skin. I think one of the worst things for the skin is going on a low fat diet, because
- **[01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGu8php0XoY&t=70s)** — skin is mainly protein and fat. And I remember in practice when I would see people come in
- **[01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGu8php0XoY&t=76s)** — that are low fat diet, even on the keto diet, and they're on low fat, as in the ideal
- **[01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGu8php0XoY&t=81s)** — where they're using this low carb and extremely low fat diet. And of course,
- **[01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGu8php0XoY&t=88s)** — the ingredients are very poor. Like I think they use soy protein isolates as a protein.
- **[01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGu8php0XoY&t=93s)** — I noticed very quickly the person starts looking older, not just their skin, but their hair.
- **[01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGu8php0XoY&t=98s)** — They just age. The more junk food that we eat, the faster the aging of our skin.
- **[01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGu8php0XoY&t=104s)** — What is alter process food? Well, now they synthesize
- **[01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGu8php0XoY&t=108s)** — corn to turn that into corn sugar or high fructose corn syrup. So you have this synthesized,
- **[01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGu8php0XoY&t=114s)** — synthetic sugars, you have these synthetic starches, right, corn starches. And then you
- **[02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGu8php0XoY&t=120s)** — have something probably even more deadly, which is the oils, the seed oils, highly
- **[02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGu8php0XoY&t=127s)** — industrialized, highly refined, very unstable oil that tends to create a lot of oxidation
- **[02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGu8php0XoY&t=133s)** — in the body. I mean, it creates inflammation in the inside of the arteries and the organs
- **[02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGu8php0XoY&t=137s)** — and the different tissues. And what about on the skin? Right. The thing about these oils is it
- **[02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGu8php0XoY&t=142s)** — gets lodged into our membranes and our skin, and it stays in there for two and a half to
- **[02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGu8php0XoY&t=148s)** — three years. And so when you have too much of these seed oils, right, that's omega six.
- **[02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGu8php0XoY&t=154s)** — Okay. And not enough of the omega three oils, that's like fish oils or cod liver oil.
- **[02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGu8php0XoY&t=159s)** — You start developing flaky, dry, red skin because they both compete with each other. And I'm
- **[02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGu8php0XoY&t=165s)** — talking about like soy oil, corn oil, canola, cottonseed oil, safflower oil, sunflower oil.
- **[02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGu8php0XoY&t=173s)** — These are all highly processed oils with the usolvents like hexane. They deodorize it,
- **[02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGu8php0XoY&t=179s)** — decolorize it. I mean, a lot of these omega six oils like sunflower oil, for example, are in
- **[03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGu8php0XoY&t=186s)** — facial creams. It's going to dry out your skin. It's going to make your skin older. So you also
- **[03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGu8php0XoY&t=192s)** — want to make sure there's no alcohol in your skin creams. So in the last 100 years, we
- **[03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGu8php0XoY&t=198s)** — basically have been increasing the seed oils in our diet to a factor of 1600% more. And even
- **[03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGu8php0XoY&t=206s)** — in the last 20 years, we've doubled the amount of seed oils. Highly inflammatory,
- **[03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGu8php0XoY&t=211s)** — oxidizes the skin. In fact, I'm thinking about doing like a 30-day seed oil detox. I'm going to
- **[03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGu8php0XoY&t=218s)** — call it an oil change, right? Just to see how many health benefits would happen, not just
- **[03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGu8php0XoY&t=223s)** — with your skin, but the whole body by just avoiding these oils for a short period of time.
- **[03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGu8php0XoY&t=229s)** — What would be the thing to put on the skin? Well, are you sitting down for this?
- **[03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGu8php0XoY&t=234s)** — Grass-fed tallow. That's actually beef fat. Now, before you click off, just hear me out.
- **[04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGu8php0XoY&t=240s)** — It might sound disgusting, but the chemistry of tallow is very similar to the chemistry of
- **[04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGu8php0XoY&t=247s)** — part of your skin. In fact, the Latin word for tallow means sebum. That's like the oil
- **[04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGu8php0XoY&t=254s)** — that your body produces, the skin oil. Tallow will not oxidize the skin. It will not cause
- **[04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGu8php0XoY&t=261s)** — inflammation. It has vitamin A, D, E, K. It also has something called CLA, which tends to retain
- **[04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGu8php0XoY&t=271s)** — moisture in the skin. And tallow is not like coconut oil, which will make your skin really
- **[04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGu8php0XoY&t=276s)** — greasy and oily. It gives your skin a very nice softness, a healthy glow, and a lot of
- **[04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGu8php0XoY&t=281s)** — the nutrients in this tallow can also help some of the dark spots as well in the skin,
- **[04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGu8php0XoY&t=286s)** — and help wrinkles. You should just try it for a week and just see what happens. Now,
- **[04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGu8php0XoY&t=291s)** — as far as the type of fat that's in here, you have about 50% of its actual saturated fats.
- **[04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGu8php0XoY&t=297s)** — You also have oleic acid, which is a really good moisturizer. You have palmitic acid,
- **[05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGu8php0XoY&t=304s)** — which softens the skin. You also have stearic acid, which repairs the skin. And then you have
- **[05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGu8php0XoY&t=309s)** — linoleic acid. That's at omega-6, but it's only like 2%. So it's very, very small numbers.
- **[05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGu8php0XoY&t=316s)** — So I'm not recommending a certain brand of tallow, but you can just look at the reviews and
- **[05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGu8php0XoY&t=321s)** — just read what people are reporting. But you start using tallow on your skin instead of
- **[05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGu8php0XoY&t=326s)** — regular chemical moisturizers with omega-6 oils, and you're going to see a huge,
- **[05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGu8php0XoY&t=333s)** — huge change. And there's no chemicals in it. And it's kind of a forgotten secret because
- **[05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGu8php0XoY&t=337s)** — we used to use this long ago, but then we replaced it because someone came up with this idea
- **[05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGu8php0XoY&t=343s)** — that, oh, saturated fat is bad for us. No, unsaturated fats in the quantities that we're
- **[05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGu8php0XoY&t=350s)** — consuming them. And then the type of these unsaturated fats that we're using is just
- **[05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGu8php0XoY&t=354s)** — so unhealthy. So if you did the combination of two things, just get rid of these
- **[06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGu8php0XoY&t=360s)** — omega-6 seed oils out of your diet, and you start using tallow on your skin,
- **[06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGu8php0XoY&t=365s)** — and you start consuming fish oils or cod liver oil for the omega-3, within a matter of weeks,
- **[06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGu8php0XoY&t=372s)** — I think you're going to see a huge shift in your skin. So go ahead and try this and then
- **[06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGu8php0XoY&t=377s)** — comment down below. And if you have not seen my video on how to address dry wrinkly hands,
- **[06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGu8php0XoY&t=384s)** — I put that video right up here. Check it out.

- **[00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ko5ThlWuYaw&t=0s)** — Today we are going to discuss the seven worst diets. Number one. Here we go. The junk food
- **[00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ko5ThlWuYaw&t=5s)** — ingredient version of the Atkins diet. And they also have these little shakes right here. Okay.
- **[00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ko5ThlWuYaw&t=10s)** — I mean, let's just take a look at the ingredients of the Atkins shake. The first one is milk
- **[00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ko5ThlWuYaw&t=16s)** — protein concentrate, soy protein isolates. Then of course we get the vegetable oil, canola,
- **[00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ko5ThlWuYaw&t=22s)** — soybean oil, artificial flavoring. And let's see if there's anything different in the Atkins bars.
- **[00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ko5ThlWuYaw&t=28s)** — First ingredient soy protein isolate. And then we get poly dextrose. Then it's sweetened with
- **[00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ko5ThlWuYaw&t=33s)** — something called sucralose. That's 600 times more sweet than sugar. So at one time the Atkins diet
- **[00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ko5ThlWuYaw&t=38s)** — was pretty good. I think it became very corrupted, unfortunately. Number two. Jenny Craig.
- **[00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ko5ThlWuYaw&t=45s)** — Now Jenny Craig, you also have these pre-made meals. They have something called the Anytime
- **[00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ko5ThlWuYaw&t=49s)** — Bar. And the first ingredient is, you guessed it, soy protein isolate. Second ingredient is the
- **[00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ko5ThlWuYaw&t=56s)** — milk protein that a lot of people are allergic to and that's highly processed from China.
- **[01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ko5ThlWuYaw&t=62s)** — It has eight grams of sugar per serving. It has rice flour. And then you can actually also
- **[01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ko5ThlWuYaw&t=66s)** — buy a bag of popcorn, right? Only 140 calories, 16 grams of carbs. And then you have, of
- **[01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ko5ThlWuYaw&t=72s)** — course, the Asian style chicken, which is loaded with potato flour, cornstarch, modified
- **[01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ko5ThlWuYaw&t=78s)** — food starch, and maltodextrin with 11 grams of sugar. You can also consume barbecue chips.
- **[01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ko5ThlWuYaw&t=84s)** — It's only 120 calories, 18 grams of sugar. I have a question. Why are they putting
- **[01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ko5ThlWuYaw&t=91s)** — alter process food ingredients in diet foods? Let's move on to the next one.
- **[01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ko5ThlWuYaw&t=99s)** — Weight Watchers. Now Weight Watchers is not doing too well financially right now. This
- **[01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ko5ThlWuYaw&t=104s)** — is why they're trying other things like adding in weight loss medication because their
- **[01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ko5ThlWuYaw&t=108s)** — diet is not working. It's all based on portion control. Their new brand called Smart
- **[01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ko5ThlWuYaw&t=113s)** — You can get a chicken pasta dish. If you look at the ingredients, wheat flour, wheat gluten,
- **[02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ko5ThlWuYaw&t=120s)** — then we have maltodextrin, then we have soy protein isolates, soybean oil, because what's
- **[02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ko5ThlWuYaw&t=125s)** — being identified is the same ingredients in junk food, okay, aka alter process ingredients.
- **[02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ko5ThlWuYaw&t=133s)** — All right, next one on list number four, Nutrisystem. Okay, claims to be diabetic
- **[02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ko5ThlWuYaw&t=138s)** — friendly, so it must be good. Let's see what the ingredients are. Well, we got milk,
- **[02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ko5ThlWuYaw&t=142s)** — protein concentrate, corn syrup, sugar, polydextrose that keeps coming up, maltodextrin
- **[02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ko5ThlWuYaw&t=149s)** — on the glycemic index, table sugar is about 65, maltodextrin can go up to 185. It's like
- **[02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ko5ThlWuYaw&t=156s)** — way the heck up there. Then we have wheat flour, sugar, corn flour, corn syrup,
- **[02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ko5ThlWuYaw&t=162s)** — modified cornstarch. Let's go to number five. Maybe this one will be a little bit better.
- **[02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ko5ThlWuYaw&t=167s)** — Ideal protein. Okay, now in practice, I had a lot of people come in after doing ideal protein,
- **[02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ko5ThlWuYaw&t=174s)** — which it's not ideal. I'll tell you right now. Wheat protein isolates. These are just
- **[02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ko5ThlWuYaw&t=179s)** — different names for starch. Okay, starch. And what's a starch? A starch is basically
- **[03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ko5ThlWuYaw&t=185s)** — a chain of sugars. Okay, and they behave just like sugar. So anytime I'm mentioning
- **[03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ko5ThlWuYaw&t=192s)** — maltodextrin, modified food starch, and these flowers, just think sugars because that's what
- **[03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ko5ThlWuYaw&t=198s)** — they really are. They also have another one called fluffy vanilla crisp. Okay, you can do
- **[03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ko5ThlWuYaw&t=203s)** — this on ideal protein, the same ingredients over and over and over. Number six is Optifast.
- **[03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ko5ThlWuYaw&t=211s)** — This is the medically supervised diet program. You go to an obesity doctor and he'll put you
- **[03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ko5ThlWuYaw&t=217s)** — Optifast. It's science based, so we know it must be legitimate, nutritionally complete,
- **[03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ko5ThlWuYaw&t=223s)** — excellent source of protein, meal replacement, you just do five servings a day,
- **[03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ko5ThlWuYaw&t=227s)** — and you'll just lose a lot of weight. They have three main types of food. You got the shakes,
- **[03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ko5ThlWuYaw&t=234s)** — you have the bars, and you have the soups. So the chocolate shake, you guessed it, contains
- **[04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ko5ThlWuYaw&t=240s)** — maltodextrin as the first ingredient, and then it has the milk protein, and then the soy
- **[04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ko5ThlWuYaw&t=245s)** — protein isolate, and then the seed oil, the canola oil. So anytime you have like a lot of
- **[04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ko5ThlWuYaw&t=249s)** — carbs and maybe lower sugars and no fiber, what you're going to be left with is starches.
- **[04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ko5ThlWuYaw&t=255s)** — Okay, just think about starches as sugar because in this area right here, it's basically sugar.
- **[04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ko5ThlWuYaw&t=261s)** — And then we get to the last one, which is Medifast. Okay, Medifast went into business,
- **[04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ko5ThlWuYaw&t=266s)** — if I'm not mistaken, or at least they had a lawsuit, but this is a scientifically designed
- **[04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ko5ThlWuYaw&t=271s)** — program. You do six servings a day. So you have the one called the Essential Chocolate Mint
- **[04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ko5ThlWuYaw&t=277s)** — Cookie Crisp Bar. Sounds pretty delicious. Take a while to guess what the ingredients are.
- **[04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ko5ThlWuYaw&t=283s)** — Soy protein isolates, sugar, polydextrose, soluble corn fiber, brown rice syrup,
- **[04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ko5ThlWuYaw&t=289s)** — milk protein isolates, which is that casein again, and rice starch. This totally goes
- **[04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ko5ThlWuYaw&t=297s)** — against this concept that I put out, which is it's not lose weight to get healthy. It's
- **[05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ko5ThlWuYaw&t=301s)** — get healthy to lose weight. If you use these ingredients to lose weight, you are literally
- **[05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ko5ThlWuYaw&t=306s)** — setting yourself up to destroy your metabolism. They're going to stimulate cravings for the
- **[05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ko5ThlWuYaw&t=310s)** — wrong things. They're highly addictive. And these ingredients are at the bottom of the
- **[05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ko5ThlWuYaw&t=314s)** — barrel. They're not even considered food. They don't really improve energy or life or
- **[05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ko5ThlWuYaw&t=319s)** — any type of health at all. But they are the prime number one contributors to diabetes,
- **[05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ko5ThlWuYaw&t=327s)** — obesity. And they're in these diet shakes, soups, bars, and prepackaged foods. These are
- **[05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ko5ThlWuYaw&t=335s)** — also the same ingredients that they use for institutional foods like the foods in prisons,
- **[05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ko5ThlWuYaw&t=340s)** — the foods in nursing homes, the foods in hospitals. These are cheap ingredients,
- **[05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ko5ThlWuYaw&t=345s)** — long shelf life, super profitable. Now, if you notice, I didn't talk about the vegan diet or
- **[05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ko5ThlWuYaw&t=351s)** — vegetarians or keto or carnivore, because people can lose weight on these other diets,
- **[05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ko5ThlWuYaw&t=356s)** — especially if they're using whole foods. But anytime we do a diet with alter process food
- **[06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ko5ThlWuYaw&t=361s)** — calories, whether they're meshed into this so called keto plan, or they're meshed into
- **[06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ko5ThlWuYaw&t=370s)** — the vegan fake meats, you're going to have problems losing weight and you're going to
- **[06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ko5ThlWuYaw&t=374s)** — have problems with your health. To keep this really, really simple, if you're interested
- **[06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ko5ThlWuYaw&t=378s)** — in losing weight, you really need to read the ingredients because you're going to find that
- **[06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ko5ThlWuYaw&t=384s)** — some of these keto products, just because they say they're keto, are not really keto.
- **[06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ko5ThlWuYaw&t=388s)** — Like this one right here. This is Duncan Hines. Okay, it says keto friendly,
- **[06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ko5ThlWuYaw&t=394s)** — two net carbs. Okay, it might be keto, but it's not healthy keto. Because if you look at the
- **[06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ko5ThlWuYaw&t=402s)** — ingredients, guess what it has? Modified tapioca starch, resistant dextrin, which we really
- **[06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ko5ThlWuYaw&t=411s)** — don't know the long term studies of consuming that ingredient would do for our microbiome.
- **[06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ko5ThlWuYaw&t=416s)** — But other than that, there's some good stuff in here, but they had to ruin it with those few
- **[07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ko5ThlWuYaw&t=420s)** — ingredients.

- **[00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBG8wWvModg&t=0s)** — Let's talk about the seven foods that you must never ever eat again.
- **[00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBG8wWvModg&t=4s)** — These foods are promoted as healthy foods, but in reality, behind the scenes, they are not healthy at all.
- **[00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBG8wWvModg&t=9s)** — In fact, they're going to make you sick. So we're going to go through all seven.
- **[00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBG8wWvModg&t=12s)** — And number seven is very interesting because I tested this food in my basement on rats.
- **[00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBG8wWvModg&t=19s)** — So you definitely want to stay till the end to hear about what happened.
- **[00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBG8wWvModg&t=21s)** — Let's start with number one. Granola bars, right? Nature Valley sounds wonderful.
- **[00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBG8wWvModg&t=26s)** — Is it really healthy? They promote using whole grains with just a touch of honey.
- **[00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBG8wWvModg&t=31s)** — So let's take a look at the actual ingredients.
- **[00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBG8wWvModg&t=34s)** — Now, I always like to ignore the nutritional facts because it doesn't really tell you much about what the ingredients are.
- **[00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBG8wWvModg&t=41s)** — So let's look just at the ingredients. It says whole grain oats.
- **[00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBG8wWvModg&t=44s)** — OK, so this doesn't tell us if it's organic or conventional.
- **[00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBG8wWvModg&t=49s)** — But if we scroll all the way down, it says contains bioengineered food ingredients.
- **[00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBG8wWvModg&t=55s)** — Now, what does that mean? It means that they have GMO ingredients, which they're going to have levels of glyphosate.
- **[01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBG8wWvModg&t=61s)** — That's an herbicide. And General Mills, who owns this company, dropped the 100% natural because they got sued.
- **[01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBG8wWvModg&t=69s)** — The problem is it contained a chemical called glyphosate, like I just mentioned, a weed killer, which is linked to cancer.
- **[01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBG8wWvModg&t=75s)** — Now you have to realize that glyphosate is the main ingredient in Roundup Ready.
- **[01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBG8wWvModg&t=79s)** — This is a popular herbicide, which, by the way, they were ordered to pay 300 million dollars to a man with terminal cancer.
- **[01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBG8wWvModg&t=85s)** — After being exposed to that herbicide.
- **[01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBG8wWvModg&t=88s)** — So the first thing to know is the whole grain oats are not organic.
- **[01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBG8wWvModg&t=92s)** — Second thing is sugar. They don't tell you what kind of sugar, cane sugar, beet sugar.
- **[01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBG8wWvModg&t=95s)** — Most likely it's beet sugar, which also is GMO.
- **[01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBG8wWvModg&t=98s)** — And then we get into canola and or sunflower oil.
- **[01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBG8wWvModg&t=102s)** — This is a seed oil, which is, from my viewpoint, not very healthy because it's going to create a lot of problems on the inside of your body.
- **[01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBG8wWvModg&t=110s)** — It's high in omega 6. Then we get into the rice flour.
- **[01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBG8wWvModg&t=113s)** — Okay, that's a starch highly refined.
- **[01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBG8wWvModg&t=115s)** — When you're dealing with the starch, you're really dealing with sugar, right?
- **[01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBG8wWvModg&t=119s)** — That's what a starch is. It's a group of sugar molecules connected together.
- **[02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBG8wWvModg&t=122s)** — Then we get honey. Like they said, only probably just a tiny bit of honey.
- **[02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBG8wWvModg&t=126s)** — Salt, brown sugar, syrup.
- **[02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBG8wWvModg&t=129s)** — When they make sugar into syrup, they have to refine it more.
- **[02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBG8wWvModg&t=134s)** — And it's actually going to create a really nice spike when you consume it with your blood sugars.
- **[02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBG8wWvModg&t=139s)** — One serving size equals just under seven teaspoons of sugar.
- **[02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBG8wWvModg&t=144s)** — Alright, let's dive into number two. Agave syrup.
- **[02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBG8wWvModg&t=148s)** — Now, this is a type of sweetener that a lot of people consider to be diabetic friendly, keto friendly, because it's low on the glycemic index.
- **[02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBG8wWvModg&t=158s)** — It sounds very natural, but any time they make a product into a syrup, especially agave, you're going to create more fructose.
- **[02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBG8wWvModg&t=168s)** — Now, the thing you need to know about fructose is only the liver can deal with fructose.
- **[02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBG8wWvModg&t=173s)** — So, whereas cane sugar has about 50-50 glucose and fructose, agave syrup is literally 85% fructose.
- **[03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBG8wWvModg&t=180s)** — Out of all the foods and sweeteners out there, agave has the most fructose.
- **[03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBG8wWvModg&t=185s)** — It has even more fructose than high fructose corn syrup.
- **[03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBG8wWvModg&t=188s)** — This means it's going to create a major problem for the liver.
- **[03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBG8wWvModg&t=192s)** — Your liver treats fructose like it does alcohol, like a toxin.
- **[03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBG8wWvModg&t=198s)** — And so, yes, it's low on the glycemic index, but it's going to create an indirect effect with insulin.
- **[03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBG8wWvModg&t=205s)** — That's going to create the risk for diabetes, insulin resistance, obesity.
- **[03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBG8wWvModg&t=210s)** — You know, think about sugar or fructose. You're taking this sugar out of the normal food.
- **[03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBG8wWvModg&t=215s)** — And you consume this in a concentrated amount, in large amounts.
- **[03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBG8wWvModg&t=219s)** — This is not healthy. This is not good at all. It's going to create a lot of damage to the liver.
- **[03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBG8wWvModg&t=223s)** — Number three, flavored yogurt. Right now, flavored and of course, they always add sugar to it.
- **[03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBG8wWvModg&t=229s)** — You have this appearance that it's a healthy thing because it's a probiotic.
- **[03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBG8wWvModg&t=234s)** — And it has calcium and has protein. It's very convenient.
- **[03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBG8wWvModg&t=237s)** — People give this stuff to their kids all day long.
- **[04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBG8wWvModg&t=240s)** — But you have to realize that most of these flavored yogurts have more sugar than a candy bar.
- **[04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBG8wWvModg&t=244s)** — Tons of sugar. 30 grams per serving size. Okay. This is like way too much sugar.
- **[04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBG8wWvModg&t=249s)** — And then when you're adding the sugar to the protein in it and all the other stuff,
- **[04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBG8wWvModg&t=253s)** — you're just going to feed your pathogens. Not the good bacteria.
- **[04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBG8wWvModg&t=257s)** — And the amount of probiotics or beneficial microbes in this product is not very significant.
- **[04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBG8wWvModg&t=262s)** — Most, if not all these microbes don't even survive the stomach acid.
- **[04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBG8wWvModg&t=266s)** — Personally, I do not believe there's any benefits whatsoever of these probiotics going
- **[04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBG8wWvModg&t=272s)** — into the actual intestine and increasing your microbes.
- **[04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBG8wWvModg&t=276s)** — Anytime you consume a yogurt, you want to consume it as the whole food, the whole fat.
- **[04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBG8wWvModg&t=281s)** — You don't want any yogurts being with skim milk or low fat at all.
- **[04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBG8wWvModg&t=286s)** — I mean, if you're going to do a yogurt, do Bulgarian yogurt,
- **[04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBG8wWvModg&t=289s)** — do Greek yogurt without the added sugars. I mean, yogurt by itself has, you know,
- **[04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBG8wWvModg&t=295s)** — six grams of sugar per serving size. Why would you want to add more sugar?
- **[04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBG8wWvModg&t=299s)** — What's even better than yogurt is kefir. I do it plain.
- **[05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBG8wWvModg&t=303s)** — You can even add berries to it. It's delicious.
- **[05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBG8wWvModg&t=306s)** — But the difference between kefir and yogurt is that kefir has
- **[05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBG8wWvModg&t=310s)** — way more friendly bacteria. So you're going to get more diversified microbes if you have kefir
- **[05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBG8wWvModg&t=315s)** — than actual yogurt. But in these flavored yogurts, they put thickeners as modified
- **[05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBG8wWvModg&t=320s)** — cornstarch. They have MSG in their monosodium glutamate as a flavor enhancer.
- **[05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBG8wWvModg&t=324s)** — So if you're consuming these flavored yogurts thinking that they're doing
- **[05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBG8wWvModg&t=327s)** — you some good health-wise, they're not. All right, next one on the list,
- **[05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBG8wWvModg&t=330s)** — non-dairy creamers that are considered a healthier alternative to milk and creams
- **[05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBG8wWvModg&t=336s)** — because they're lower in fat, right? But what's interesting is sometimes you don't even need to
- **[05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBG8wWvModg&t=340s)** — put them in the refrigerator. What is in these things? Well, there's a lot of crap in these
- **[05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBG8wWvModg&t=344s)** — things. They have high fructose corn syrup, they'll have glucose syrup, they'll have
- **[05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBG8wWvModg&t=348s)** — maltodextrin. And the type of fat that they use is trans fats. But a lot of times it's
- **[05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBG8wWvModg&t=354s)** — hidden because if you actually put trans fats, which are seed oils, if it's below a half
- **[05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBG8wWvModg&t=359s)** — of a gram per serving size, which is very easy to do in a non-dairy creamer, then they
- **[06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBG8wWvModg&t=366s)** — round it out to zero. And they can even say trans fat free, when in fact it has trans fats in there.
- **[06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBG8wWvModg&t=372s)** — So you really want to look at the ingredients and make sure it has no seed oils. Soy,
- **[06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBG8wWvModg&t=378s)** — corn, canola, cottonseed. Just use regular cream, organic cream, organic half and half.
- **[06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBG8wWvModg&t=384s)** — Then we get to my favorite soy milk. I mean, it's bizarre to me to think that
- **[06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBG8wWvModg&t=388s)** — they can even call it a milk. With the soy milk, you're getting a lot of estrogenic
- **[06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBG8wWvModg&t=393s)** — Personally, when I was in practice, I had a gentleman come in that started to develop
- **[06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBG8wWvModg&t=398s)** — breast tissue and he was consuming, I'm not kidding, gallons and gallons of soy milk every
- **[06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBG8wWvModg&t=403s)** — single week. So there's a lot of debate whether soy is healthy or not. Well, here's the thing,
- **[06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBG8wWvModg&t=408s)** — the way that they process soy, soy oils, soy isolate proteins, soy milk, I still to this day
- **[06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBG8wWvModg&t=416s)** — do not understand how soy milk can be considered or perceived to be something healthy or
- **[07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBG8wWvModg&t=423s)** — cleaner than actual organic wheel milk or milk products. Then we get to number six,
- **[07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBG8wWvModg&t=429s)** — which is the fast food lettuce or salad. Okay, now no one's going to consume that salad
- **[07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBG8wWvModg&t=434s)** — without dressing. So it comes with dressing. And if you've ever read the ingredients in
- **[07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBG8wWvModg&t=440s)** — these dressings for the salad, massive seed oils, hidden trans fats, hidden starches,
- **[07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBG8wWvModg&t=446s)** — high fructose corn syrup. I mean, it's just another chemical cocktail that you put on your
- **[07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBG8wWvModg&t=450s)** — to try to think that you're eating something healthier. There's a chemical called sodium
- **[07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBG8wWvModg&t=455s)** — bisulfide. This is something that they put into the lettuce to preserve it so it doesn't turn
- **[07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBG8wWvModg&t=460s)** — brown. It's a chemical. So you don't really know how long that salad has been sitting
- **[07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBG8wWvModg&t=464s)** — there. But I think the biggest thing is they use a chlorine wash to make sure all the E.
- **[07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBG8wWvModg&t=470s)** — coli salmonella is killed off. Well, realize when they're killing off this bad
- **[07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBG8wWvModg&t=475s)** — also killing off the good stuff as well. And I don't want to eat a salad that has this
- **[08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBG8wWvModg&t=481s)** — chlorinated bleached chemical on it. The next time you want a salad, don't get it from a
- **[08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBG8wWvModg&t=486s)** — fast food restaurant. And the last food that I would highly recommend that you avoid puffed
- **[08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBG8wWvModg&t=491s)** — cereal, puffed rice cakes. There was this chemist and he worked for Quaker Oats. Okay,
- **[08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBG8wWvModg&t=497s)** — they fired him because he noticed when they did the study on rats with puffed cereal,
- **[08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBG8wWvModg&t=501s)** — they would die. So I set up this experiment in my basement. I had four separate cages. Okay,
- **[08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBG8wWvModg&t=505s)** — in the first group of mice, I fed them mice food. The second group of mice or rats, I fed
- **[08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBG8wWvModg&t=512s)** — whole wheat bread. Okay, third group, I fed white bread. And the fourth group, I fed puffed
- **[08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBG8wWvModg&t=519s)** — cereal. In one of the cages of rats, I noticed that the eyes started turning bright red
- **[08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBG8wWvModg&t=525s)** — and started bulging out. And these mice were actually dying prematurely. And this is after a
- **[08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBG8wWvModg&t=530s)** — week and a half to two weeks. Okay, now take a while to guess what group you think this was.
- **[08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBG8wWvModg&t=535s)** — Most of you are thinking it's the white bread, right? No, something in the puffed cereal created
- **[08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBG8wWvModg&t=539s)** — the eyes to turn bright red and it was literally bulging out and it was killing the mice. So
- **[09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBG8wWvModg&t=545s)** — Paul Stitt's experiments were actually true from my viewpoint. He wrote a book called
- **[09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBG8wWvModg&t=550s)** — Beating the Food Giants. You can probably get it on Amazon. He goes through the whole
- **[09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBG8wWvModg&t=554s)** — story. That was enough of an experiment to get me to stop consuming puffed cereals. But
- **[09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBG8wWvModg&t=559s)** — here's the wild thing that happened. I went on vacation for a week. I had to do this seminar and
- **[09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBG8wWvModg&t=564s)** — I told my wife to take care of the mice. Somehow the mice that survived got out of the
- **[09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBG8wWvModg&t=570s)** — cage. I don't know if you know my wife, Karen, right? She comes downstairs and she sees
- **[09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBG8wWvModg&t=574s)** — that the cage is open and all these mice are getting out. She freaked out, right? So this is
- **[09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBG8wWvModg&t=580s)** — why I have never duplicated that experiment. I'm not allowed to have any type of gerbils,
- **[09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBG8wWvModg&t=586s)** — hamsters, mice ever ever again. We had to have some people come out to catch these mice. When I
- **[09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBG8wWvModg&t=593s)** — finally got home, I went out in the woods and I let them go free. So anyway, now you know the
- **[09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBG8wWvModg&t=597s)** — seven foods to completely stay away from if you want to retain your health. And if you haven't
- **[10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBG8wWvModg&t=601s)** — seen this video on the healthiest food that you should be eating, I put that up right here. Check it out.

- **[00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QePHCO8T8Q&t=0s)** — Welcome back everyone. I have a special guest today to talk about some real interesting
- **[00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QePHCO8T8Q&t=7s)** — effects of doing infrared on gout. And his name is Dr. Ben Pearl. He's a podiatrist and he's
- **[00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QePHCO8T8Q&t=18s)** — been in the field for quite some time. So welcome to the interview, doc.
- **[00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QePHCO8T8Q&t=22s)** — Oh, thank you for having me. I've been following you for a while and
- **[00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QePHCO8T8Q&t=26s)** — I really like the varied approaches that you take, you know, give people some armamentarium that
- **[00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QePHCO8T8Q&t=32s)** — they can do right from the home in their local drug store or health food store.
- **[00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QePHCO8T8Q&t=37s)** — That's great because you do the same thing. I think you kind of think outside the box.
- **[00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QePHCO8T8Q&t=43s)** — I've watched some of your videos, so that's why I wanted to interview and just kind of pick
- **[00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QePHCO8T8Q&t=46s)** — your brain. Today I want to kind of focus on this gout. A lot of people have gout and they
- **[00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QePHCO8T8Q&t=53s)** — don't like to take the medication because it could potentially create some wild side effects.
- **[00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QePHCO8T8Q&t=58s)** — So I know you have various therapies in your clinic. If we could just focus in on this
- **[01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QePHCO8T8Q&t=65s)** — red light, red light therapy, and there's different types of red light that we'll talk
- **[01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QePHCO8T8Q&t=69s)** — about on gout. And so thanks for being on and I won't take too much of your time, but
- **[01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QePHCO8T8Q&t=75s)** — a couple questions to get right off the bat. So it's a little confusing for people when
- **[01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QePHCO8T8Q&t=82s)** — they talk about red light because you have different spectrums or different wavelengths.
- **[01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QePHCO8T8Q&t=87s)** — You have the far and the near infrared. Can you just simply explain like is there much
- **[01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QePHCO8T8Q&t=94s)** — significance with therapy or does these different types of frequencies create different effects?
- **[01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QePHCO8T8Q&t=100s)** — Right. So I think when we're talking about what most people talk about in terms of infrared
- **[01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QePHCO8T8Q&t=106s)** — and LEDs, these are very safe units that have nice musculoskeletal benefits, nice clearing out
- **[01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QePHCO8T8Q&t=115s)** — of joint synovitis and tendonitis. And, you know, we're talking specifically about gout
- **[02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QePHCO8T8Q&t=122s)** — can even do things that help cell permeability, which as you know, is the exchange of ions
- **[02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QePHCO8T8Q&t=128s)** — and uric acid is essentially something that the body is over producing. So it can help with that
- **[02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QePHCO8T8Q&t=135s)** — process of cellular exchange and the cell getting rid of the waste byproducts.
- **[02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QePHCO8T8Q&t=144s)** — As far as the spectrums, which you mentioned, the lower levels aren't as strong, so they're
- **[02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QePHCO8T8Q&t=149s)** — going to require more time or more dosage time to apply them. But there's nothing wrong
- **[02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QePHCO8T8Q&t=155s)** — with that. You talk about the frequencies closer to visible light, like the I guess it's the
- **[02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QePHCO8T8Q&t=161s)** — near or the far. Oh, not yet. It's the near, right? Near infrared. Right. Right. Right.
- **[02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QePHCO8T8Q&t=167s)** — As we get into things like laser at different amplitudes, then we have accompanying heat.
- **[02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QePHCO8T8Q&t=174s)** — And then those obviously are more clinic based situations, although there are, as you know,
- **[03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QePHCO8T8Q&t=181s)** — and on the market now, home laser units that the FDA has approved for home
- **[03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QePHCO8T8Q&t=188s)** — distribution. And the best way to do that is really to go online and do your due diligence
- **[03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QePHCO8T8Q&t=194s)** — to make sure that they're legitimate devices. But those are getting into a different spectrum
- **[03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QePHCO8T8Q&t=202s)** — of light and they have their own effects. And what some people do is they'll do
- **[03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QePHCO8T8Q&t=210s)** — combinations of therapy where they'll do some at different frequencies. And that has the effect
- **[03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QePHCO8T8Q&t=217s)** — of the body not getting used to one particular frequency. And even within a frequency treatment,
- **[03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QePHCO8T8Q&t=224s)** — when you have the ability to change cycles as some protocols where you can change cycles,
- **[03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QePHCO8T8Q&t=230s)** — you'll get different lights operating at different intervals that can have also
- **[03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QePHCO8T8Q&t=237s)** — potentiating effects on healing the body. So when you do infrared on a patient that comes
- **[04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QePHCO8T8Q&t=244s)** — with gout, typically, are you going to use a specific protocol? Are you going to do a
- **[04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QePHCO8T8Q&t=252s)** — mixed frequency? Because I know some red light therapies have multiple frequencies.
- **[04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QePHCO8T8Q&t=258s)** — Can you give me more specifics on maybe what someone could do at home related to the red light?
- **[04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QePHCO8T8Q&t=265s)** — Right. I would make sure that they just look at it as a bona fide infrared unit that has
- **[04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QePHCO8T8Q&t=272s)** — you know, looking at the reviews and making sure that the company is not just giving you
- **[04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QePHCO8T8Q&t=282s)** — something that is the reporting to be at, you know, a certain standard. And I think that would
- **[04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QePHCO8T8Q&t=287s)** — be the best way to vet that out. You know, as an example, this one does not have the one
- **[04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QePHCO8T8Q&t=293s)** — that I have and that I'm using in conjunction with another modality, does not have multiple
- **[05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QePHCO8T8Q&t=300s)** — frequencies associated with this. This will put out one frequency. What we can do is we can adapt
- **[05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QePHCO8T8Q&t=306s)** — you know, the time on this one. And I'm all about trying to do mixed modalities of energy
- **[05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QePHCO8T8Q&t=315s)** — so that, you know, you're having the body get different effects that can work in tandem
- **[05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QePHCO8T8Q&t=320s)** — and in synergy. Totally. So if someone let's say someone has gout and they apply this
- **[05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QePHCO8T8Q&t=327s)** — therapy to their toe, how long would an average treatment be like 10 minutes, 5 minutes, 15 minutes?
- **[05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QePHCO8T8Q&t=335s)** — What would you do? I think if you're applying the home-based units, you want to go about
- **[05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QePHCO8T8Q&t=340s)** — 20 minutes at a minimum. And it would even be good to do that at a twice a day interval.
- **[05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QePHCO8T8Q&t=347s)** — So you could do it morning and night. And as you know, the nadir points of the metabolism,
- **[05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QePHCO8T8Q&t=354s)** — you know, typically in, you know, early in the morning and later in the night, you know,
- **[05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QePHCO8T8Q&t=359s)** — as our body is kind of coming to a more lower relaxed phase, are those are the points where
- **[06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QePHCO8T8Q&t=365s)** — these attacks generally are more prevalent, and the blood flow isn't as vigorous, etc. So
- **[06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QePHCO8T8Q&t=371s)** — those are good timing points that you could apply the therapies. And, you know, it also
- **[06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QePHCO8T8Q&t=376s)** — happens to coincide with the work schedule for most people. Totally. And then tell us a
- **[06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QePHCO8T8Q&t=384s)** — little bit about the results. What kind of results? Does it happen right away? Does it take
- **[06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QePHCO8T8Q&t=388s)** — some time? Multiple treatments, a week or so or two weeks? What's your thought on that?
- **[06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QePHCO8T8Q&t=392s)** — I'm glad you mentioned that because you need to be doing especially with a gout flare,
- **[06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QePHCO8T8Q&t=398s)** — some of the things that you mentioned on your videos to affect the uric acid production
- **[06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QePHCO8T8Q&t=404s)** — and excretion in tandem with I would not want somebody to think that this is a standalone.
- **[06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QePHCO8T8Q&t=411s)** — This is part of a puzzle. And this is one piece of the puzzle where we're using energy
- **[06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QePHCO8T8Q&t=416s)** — in complement with other things that we're doing with diet modification,
- **[07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QePHCO8T8Q&t=422s)** — obviously clearing out with hydration so that the body can resolve the gouty attack. Now for
- **[07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QePHCO8T8Q&t=428s)** — longer term maintenance, that's something where you might have to just cut down to like a once
- **[07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QePHCO8T8Q&t=433s)** — a day maintenance treatment as opposed to doing two treatments a day. As you know, one of the
- **[07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QePHCO8T8Q&t=440s)** — culprits to gout is this fructose. And so many people don't connect how much fructose they
- **[07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QePHCO8T8Q&t=446s)** — actually consume and they think, oh yeah, I'm eating natural fruits. Well, that has some
- **[07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QePHCO8T8Q&t=450s)** — fructose in it and so does normal table sugar has fructose. And from an evolutionary
- **[07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QePHCO8T8Q&t=457s)** — standpoint, we didn't consume nearly the amount of fructose that we do now. And fructose
- **[07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QePHCO8T8Q&t=465s)** — really turns into uric acid at a pretty high rate. But even the evolution just fruits,
- **[07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QePHCO8T8Q&t=472s)** — right? In general, if you take a look at where certain fruits came from, the amount of
- **[07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QePHCO8T8Q&t=478s)** — sweetness was like way, way, way lower. We have high breaded these fruits to the point
- **[08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QePHCO8T8Q&t=483s)** — where we're just like flooding the body with so much fructose. So that's one of the things
- **[08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QePHCO8T8Q&t=486s)** — that I found if someone just cuts that out, huge, huge changes in the intensity of the
- **[08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QePHCO8T8Q&t=493s)** — fructose. So we definitely need to take in consideration the diet part and certain things
- **[08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QePHCO8T8Q&t=498s)** — that really spike it. And even if you're on the ketogenic diet, xylitol apparently
- **[08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QePHCO8T8Q&t=504s)** — can increase what's called pseudogout, which could be oxalates and things like that can
- **[08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QePHCO8T8Q&t=509s)** — irritate that toe. So, you know, I'm on keto diet. I'm not eating any fructose. I'm
- **[08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QePHCO8T8Q&t=514s)** — not eating any sugar, but you're doing tons of xylitol. That can be like a hidden thing.
- **[08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QePHCO8T8Q&t=518s)** — But that's why I wanted to bring you on because there's two things that I want to talk about,
- **[08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QePHCO8T8Q&t=523s)** — which is infrared and also electromagnetic type therapy to use that. Can you just touch on that
- **[08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QePHCO8T8Q&t=530s)** — therapy as well? Because that can also be something that like a home therapy as well.
- **[08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QePHCO8T8Q&t=535s)** — Yeah. Yeah. So I'm going to show you first a larger base unit that I have here. And I
- **[09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QePHCO8T8Q&t=541s)** — like this so much, Dr. Bird, that I have one of these units at home. What it basically is,
- **[09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QePHCO8T8Q&t=548s)** — is a copper wiring that produces a magnetic field and it's electrocharged. And unlike,
- **[09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QePHCO8T8Q&t=556s)** — you remember the craze with magnets in your shoes, they just weren't high enough Gauss to
- **[09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QePHCO8T8Q&t=563s)** — affect the bigger changes that we would be looking for cellular exchange. What is the
- **[09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QePHCO8T8Q&t=570s)** — word Gauss? What is that? Is that just a level of magnetic energy or what is Gauss?
- **[09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QePHCO8T8Q&t=577s)** — So Gauss is the power, the electric power charge. So for instance, some of the mats that are
- **[09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QePHCO8T8Q&t=585s)** — widely available now, and I won't get into names and advertising, but they're widely
- **[09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QePHCO8T8Q&t=591s)** — available. They've been sort of the rage for health and wellness. They'll have something like
- **[09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QePHCO8T8Q&t=596s)** — 4,000 Gauss. And those are great for health and wellness. This particular unit goes up to 4,000
- **[10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QePHCO8T8Q&t=602s)** — Gauss. Now you do... Yeah. Yeah. So you have to be making sure, for instance, that if I had
- **[10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QePHCO8T8Q&t=611s)** — this near my chest, that I don't have a pacemaker because it would interrupt. It would
- **[10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QePHCO8T8Q&t=616s)** — interrupt the signal on my cell phone if I put this right up to it. And you'll see the,
- **[10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QePHCO8T8Q&t=621s)** — jacket lines, et cetera. So this is a larger thing. These are closed loops. So they are
- **[10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QePHCO8T8Q&t=628s)** — purported to be safer than what's emitting from the cell phone in terms of the energy. And
- **[10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QePHCO8T8Q&t=635s)** — that's, I think, a relevant point. As with anything, you have to do your due diligence
- **[10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QePHCO8T8Q&t=641s)** — if you're looking for a home unit. And there are sites that review some of the home units that
- **[10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QePHCO8T8Q&t=646s)** — for several hundred dollars, as opposed to several thousand dollars, you can find what it is,
- **[10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QePHCO8T8Q&t=653s)** — is a smaller ring unit. So instead of, you know, have being housed in a big plastic,
- **[10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QePHCO8T8Q&t=658s)** — it might just have a smaller loop about the size of a quarter or a half dollar. And it's a
- **[11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QePHCO8T8Q&t=665s)** — very flexible copper wire ring. And there might be a couple of these that you place on the,
- **[11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QePHCO8T8Q&t=672s)** — let's say, a whisk out on your big toe, for instance. And then the box, you know,
- **[11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QePHCO8T8Q&t=676s)** — the power charge unit will be a much smaller, it'll be, you know, this probably about the
- **[11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QePHCO8T8Q&t=681s)** — size of a little bit like half a loaf of bread kind of energy unit, as opposed to a much larger
- **[11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QePHCO8T8Q&t=689s)** — microwave size unit. I like the ones that generate more in the, let's say, several hundred
- **[11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QePHCO8T8Q&t=697s)** — gauss than the ones that are .6 gauss. Not that there's anything wrong, even at those lower
- **[11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QePHCO8T8Q&t=703s)** — levels, they've been shown up regulation of bone production, even at .6 gauss, because the
- **[11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QePHCO8T8Q&t=710s)** — frequency or the Hertz is also important. That's the other key to the puzzle. So the more
- **[11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QePHCO8T8Q&t=716s)** — sophisticated the unit, the more options on frequency. My unit, for instance, goes up to
- **[12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QePHCO8T8Q&t=724s)** — 60 hertz on the frequency. And some of the smaller units, they just won't have as many
- **[12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QePHCO8T8Q&t=730s)** — options on the frequency cycles. So on a gout situation, what kind of frequency or Hertz
- **[12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QePHCO8T8Q&t=735s)** — would you use? I go all the way up sometimes as high as the 60%, which is about 2500 gauss.
- **[12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QePHCO8T8Q&t=744s)** — And I would do the frequency cycle going from about seven to about 28 hertz. And what it does
- **[12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QePHCO8T8Q&t=752s)** — is it will go through an oscillation of that particular frequency for, let's say, two minutes,
- **[12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QePHCO8T8Q&t=759s)** — and then jump to the next frequency and so on, and then just go in a loop.
- **[12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QePHCO8T8Q&t=764s)** — And I think you mentioned when we talked before that you can actually
- **[12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QePHCO8T8Q&t=767s)** — see some difference in swelling just by one treatment, right? And swelling comes down,
- **[12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QePHCO8T8Q&t=772s)** — in some cases, I've been able to measure the circumference of the body part, and it'll decrease,
- **[12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QePHCO8T8Q&t=778s)** — let's say, in the ankle three quarters of a sonometer. And I do these measurements and I've
- **[13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QePHCO8T8Q&t=783s)** — done them on some of my videos to just document different cases so that people have
- **[13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QePHCO8T8Q&t=789s)** — an idea of the range of things to expect, because every patient responds a little bit
- **[13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QePHCO8T8Q&t=794s)** — differently, as you know. That's great. So, okay, so electromagnetic fields, and then also,
- **[13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QePHCO8T8Q&t=800s)** — which I've talked about the dangers, but if it's controlled like that
- **[13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QePHCO8T8Q&t=804s)** — in a ring, I think it's going to be a lot better. Have you ever heard of using like
- **[13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QePHCO8T8Q&t=811s)** — methylene blue with the light to potentiate the effect? I like that idea because of the
- **[13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QePHCO8T8Q&t=818s)** — color spectrum, so it's something that I'll have to research. You know, so this stuff is
- **[13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QePHCO8T8Q&t=825s)** — all related. I mean, it comes down to as elemental as like thinking about photosynthesis
- **[13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QePHCO8T8Q&t=831s)** — and how light affects plant energy production. It's the same basic core idea with a different
- **[14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QePHCO8T8Q&t=841s)** — application. So anything color related is going to have some effect on energy.
- **[14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QePHCO8T8Q&t=849s)** — Yeah, it's some fascinating new data, and even they're doing it right now,
- **[14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QePHCO8T8Q&t=853s)** — research on cancer where they're taking the methylene blue, which is kind of like
- **[14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QePHCO8T8Q&t=857s)** — has some really interesting properties to mitochondria, and then
- **[14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QePHCO8T8Q&t=862s)** — throwing a photo because the infrared can penetrate the body. So it penetrates in the
- **[14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QePHCO8T8Q&t=867s)** — body, and it potentiates the treatment in the mitochondria, and it works on that
- **[14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QePHCO8T8Q&t=872s)** — electron chain, which is kind of just like the conveyor belt of electrons. And so,
- **[14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QePHCO8T8Q&t=878s)** — since most problems are mitochondria related, then you're going right at the heart of this
- **[14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QePHCO8T8Q&t=886s)** — thing. So that's something that would be interesting to experiment on just adding
- **[14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QePHCO8T8Q&t=890s)** — methylene blue because methylene blue tends to go where you need it. And it has some
- **[14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QePHCO8T8Q&t=895s)** — fascinating effects of mopping up electrons if you have a leaky mitochondria. And of course,
- **[15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QePHCO8T8Q&t=901s)** — in the big toe, what I would be interested in, we'll just have to experiment on that,
- **[15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QePHCO8T8Q&t=907s)** — take methylene blue, do these other therapies, and see what creates the biggest effect.
- **[15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QePHCO8T8Q&t=914s)** — Because we're trying to deal with at the bottom level the cell. We're trying to improve the
- **[15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QePHCO8T8Q&t=919s)** — cell function. We're trying to get rid of stuff. We're trying to make sure electrons
- **[15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QePHCO8T8Q&t=924s)** — aren't creating so many free radicals. This goes hand in hand with that in terms of ion
- **[15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QePHCO8T8Q&t=933s)** — exchange. Our cells basically are sodium potassium pumps. So people think back to
- **[15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QePHCO8T8Q&t=939s)** — chemistry, physiology, oh, I remember something about sodium and potassium with the nerve and
- **[15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QePHCO8T8Q&t=944s)** — vaguely about the cell. But every cell, whether it be a bone cell, smooth muscle cell,
- **[15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QePHCO8T8Q&t=950s)** — has sodium potassium exchange. So our bodies are basically like batteries that respond to
- **[15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QePHCO8T8Q&t=956s)** — energy. And what you mentioned with color, if we can, just like our car, a dark upholstery
- **[16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QePHCO8T8Q&t=963s)** — and we're absorbing more light. So there's definitely implications there. And I'll be
- **[16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QePHCO8T8Q&t=967s)** — curious to see once I do the literature search, how that might be able to be
- **[16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QePHCO8T8Q&t=972s)** — incorporated into protocols. Yeah. So I've been doing some videos recently on
- **[16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QePHCO8T8Q&t=981s)** — looking at oxygen and CO2, looking at different pHs inside and outside the cell. How can you
- **[16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QePHCO8T8Q&t=986s)** — you know, because in order to have a battery, to have this energy built up in the cell,
- **[16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QePHCO8T8Q&t=993s)** — to keep it normal, you need these gradients, these differences, these two different,
- **[16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QePHCO8T8Q&t=999s)** — either two different electrolytes, two different pHs, two different
- **[16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QePHCO8T8Q&t=1005s)** — gradients of concentrations. So you create this flow. And when we're dealing with
- **[16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QePHCO8T8Q&t=1010s)** — crystals building up, waste building up, lactic acid building up, there seems to be some damage
- **[16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QePHCO8T8Q&t=1017s)** — in the membrane. So I think the wave of the future is going to be going away from drugs and
- **[17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QePHCO8T8Q&t=1022s)** — more to these natural things. So, but it's brand new. It's like people are just now
- **[17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QePHCO8T8Q&t=1027s)** — starting to look at it, but there's not going to be a lot probably of research because
- **[17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QePHCO8T8Q&t=1031s)** — there's not a lot of money in doing some of these simple things, unfortunately, especially
- **[17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QePHCO8T8Q&t=1035s)** — with methyl, methylene blue, because you can't patent it anymore. It's like,
- **[17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QePHCO8T8Q&t=1039s)** — it's one of the first drugs, but it seems to do some wonders on restoring the oxygen
- **[17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QePHCO8T8Q&t=1046s)** — into the mitochondria, mopping up the excess electrons. So you can then heal the mitochondria.
- **[17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QePHCO8T8Q&t=1054s)** — Yeah, so anyway, I just wanted to throw that out there.
- **[17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QePHCO8T8Q&t=1057s)** — To your point about research too, I was speaking with a company that is doing an IRB
- **[17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QePHCO8T8Q&t=1066s)** — on cellular healing for wound healing for like diabetics with electromagnetic in particular.
- **[17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QePHCO8T8Q&t=1073s)** — So you're talking IRB like infrared?
- **[17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QePHCO8T8Q&t=1075s)** — Oh, for an investigation review board where they're submitting to the NIH.
- **[18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QePHCO8T8Q&t=1081s)** — And just so people understand, why isn't there more research on this? Well, to do an IRB,
- **[18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QePHCO8T8Q&t=1086s)** — first you have to have funding. You have to have an application to the government,
- **[18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QePHCO8T8Q&t=1090s)** — several thousand dollars. So you really have to believe in your product to
- **[18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QePHCO8T8Q&t=1094s)** — even start that. The second layer is with the pandemic, things have gotten pushed to the back
- **[18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QePHCO8T8Q&t=1101s)** — seat. So if there's a cancer research grant, that is going to be at probably a higher
- **[18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QePHCO8T8Q&t=1108s)** — priority, even though you would think, oh my gosh, diabetic ulcers, it's a pandemic of
- **[18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QePHCO8T8Q&t=1113s)** — diabetes in our Tela-2 cities nation with obesity and so forth. But nonetheless, those are
- **[18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QePHCO8T8Q&t=1121s)** — very slow to get to the review board to even take action to start the study. So that's why
- **[18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QePHCO8T8Q&t=1130s)** — even on things like you said, where, oh, there's not as much money, even on when you
- **[18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QePHCO8T8Q&t=1135s)** — have a company backing to, we'd like to move this science forward, it is just glacial speed
- **[19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QePHCO8T8Q&t=1143s)** — sometimes. I know. It's crazy. But anyway, I really appreciate your time. I know you
- **[19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QePHCO8T8Q&t=1150s)** — have a patient sitting there. But listen, I'm going to put your website link down below in
- **[19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QePHCO8T8Q&t=1157s)** — the description so people can get ahold of you for maybe other related issues as well
- **[19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QePHCO8T8Q&t=1163s)** — that they might have. But thank you, Doc, for spending the time and I appreciate it. And
- **[19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QePHCO8T8Q&t=1168s)** — we'll follow up with some some additional information in the future. I really enjoyed the
- **[19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QePHCO8T8Q&t=1174s)** — interview, Dr. Berg. Thanks so much for having me on your program. I continue to learn from
- **[19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QePHCO8T8Q&t=1180s)** — you. I love the idea of collaboration and exchange of ideas. And I'm telling you folks,
- **[19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QePHCO8T8Q&t=1188s)** — Dr. McCoy's little thing that he was doing in the old Star Trek, that is a reality now.
- **[19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QePHCO8T8Q&t=1196s)** — We just, as you mentioned, we want to dial in on the protocol so that we have
- **[20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QePHCO8T8Q&t=1201s)** — as much science backing. Each study that we do, each patient though, becomes a part of
- **[20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QePHCO8T8Q&t=1206s)** — discussion where you have anecdotal to build up the body of knowledge. Awesome. Great. Thanks much.

- **[00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gKviXbX8xGM&t=0s)** — This one thing could literally replace our entire medical system.
- **[00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gKviXbX8xGM&t=5s)** — Now, I'm not talking about emergency care, things like that.
- **[00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gKviXbX8xGM&t=8s)** — I'm mainly talking about chronic disease.
- **[00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gKviXbX8xGM&t=10s)** — I really looked at this topic from many different angles.
- **[00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gKviXbX8xGM&t=14s)** — Just posing this question, what is the most powerful thing you can do for your health?
- **[00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gKviXbX8xGM&t=17s)** — Everyone can afford it. It will produce the most weight loss of anything that you do.
- **[00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gKviXbX8xGM&t=21s)** — It will fix a stubborn metabolism.
- **[00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gKviXbX8xGM&t=23s)** — And that's called the set point. So you might lose, let's say, 20 pounds, but then you...
- **[00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gKviXbX8xGM&t=27s)** — your body will not let you lose more than that.
- **[00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gKviXbX8xGM&t=29s)** — This particular thing will address that and fix that.
- **[00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gKviXbX8xGM&t=32s)** — This natural therapy has the ability to fix your brain, repair brain tissue.
- **[00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gKviXbX8xGM&t=38s)** — It actually helps regrow your brain cells.
- **[00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gKviXbX8xGM&t=40s)** — It increases your mood, your cognitive function.
- **[00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gKviXbX8xGM&t=43s)** — The effects of this therapy on your mitochondria are very similar to exercise.
- **[00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gKviXbX8xGM&t=48s)** — Can you guess what it is? If you guess fasting, you are correct.
- **[00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gKviXbX8xGM&t=52s)** — If you did fasting, your medical expenses will go way, way down.
- **[00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gKviXbX8xGM&t=56s)** — You're not starving your body. You are just controlling when you eat and when you're not eating.
- **[01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gKviXbX8xGM&t=62s)** — When I was first introduced to fasting, I really did not think anything about it.
- **[01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gKviXbX8xGM&t=65s)** — I thought it was like, what's that going to do?
- **[01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gKviXbX8xGM&t=67s)** — It's not changing the calories that you're eating.
- **[01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gKviXbX8xGM&t=70s)** — Until I started looking at it, especially from our history of how humans have developed.
- **[01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gKviXbX8xGM&t=76s)** — Because the root problem of over 80% of all diseases is insulin resistance.
- **[01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gKviXbX8xGM&t=80s)** — So all you really need to know at this point is that too much insulin creates a lot of problems for your body.
- **[01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gKviXbX8xGM&t=84s)** — So fasting fixes that problem.
- **[01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gKviXbX8xGM&t=87s)** — So you have genes right now in your body to fix almost everything.
- **[01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gKviXbX8xGM&t=92s)** — Okay, but the question is, how do you turn on those genes to fix things?
- **[01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gKviXbX8xGM&t=96s)** — Well, there are certain triggers. Things that you can control, lifestyle, food, not eating.
- **[01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gKviXbX8xGM&t=101s)** — It's the absence of eating that triggers a lot of these survival genes.
- **[01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gKviXbX8xGM&t=106s)** — So in this process of not eating, your body converts over into burning fat and ketones.
- **[01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gKviXbX8xGM&t=112s)** — So there's going to be a point where your body is now adapted to burning ketones.
- **[01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gKviXbX8xGM&t=117s)** — And that takes sometimes like three days.
- **[01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gKviXbX8xGM&t=119s)** — Now another question I get a lot is, how should someone fast if they're a woman versus a man?
- **[02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gKviXbX8xGM&t=124s)** — And there's a really good book I recommend. I'll put the link down below. It's entitled Fast Like a Girl.
- **[02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gKviXbX8xGM&t=128s)** — Now because a woman goes through this whole monthly cycle, you have to adjust the fasting schedule a little bit.
- **[02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gKviXbX8xGM&t=134s)** — So in Dr. Mindy's book, to keep this really simple, as soon as you have your period
- **[02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gKviXbX8xGM&t=138s)** — and the hormones are starting to build up between day one and day 10 is when you want to do some hardcore fasting.
- **[02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gKviXbX8xGM&t=145s)** — Because you have enough hormones to be able to afford to do fasting.
- **[02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gKviXbX8xGM&t=148s)** — And this is the time you want to do fasting, especially to lose weight.
- **[02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gKviXbX8xGM&t=152s)** — But as we get to day 20, okay, so now we're on day 20 all the way to the end of the month.
- **[02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gKviXbX8xGM&t=158s)** — That's when you don't want to fast. There's already too much stress on the body.
- **[02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gKviXbX8xGM&t=162s)** — You don't want to add fasting to alter those hormones.
- **[02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gKviXbX8xGM&t=165s)** — But then as soon as you have your period, the next 10 days, you're right back on track.
- **[02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gKviXbX8xGM&t=170s)** — That doesn't mean I recommend snacking. Maybe just three meals. I think that would be sufficient.
- **[02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gKviXbX8xGM&t=175s)** — So that's a real rough summary of her book. You can get a lot more details if you want to get it.
- **[02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gKviXbX8xGM&t=179s)** — I'll put the link down below.
- **[03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gKviXbX8xGM&t=180s)** — If we're dealing with hormones, these hormones are made out of cholesterol.
- **[03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gKviXbX8xGM&t=186s)** — Then that cholesterol is then turned into these steroid hormones.
- **[03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gKviXbX8xGM&t=190s)** — Out of all the hormones, progesterone is probably one of the most potent protectors of the brain.
- **[03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gKviXbX8xGM&t=199s)** — When progesterone goes too low, your brain is at risk.
- **[03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gKviXbX8xGM&t=203s)** — So the whole point on that is just to make sure you have enough of the raw material.
- **[03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gKviXbX8xGM&t=207s)** — And the raw material I'm talking about is cholesterol.
- **[03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gKviXbX8xGM&t=210s)** — There is a lot of cholesterol in egg yolks, in shellfish like shrimp.
- **[03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gKviXbX8xGM&t=216s)** — Liver has cholesterol. Fatty cheese has cholesterol.
- **[03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gKviXbX8xGM&t=219s)** — You also want to make sure that you really deal with the stress level.
- **[03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gKviXbX8xGM&t=222s)** — Because if the stress is really high during menopause,
- **[03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gKviXbX8xGM&t=224s)** — what will happen is your adrenals will start stealing some of the raw material
- **[03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gKviXbX8xGM&t=228s)** — and take them away from progesterone and other hormones.
- **[03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gKviXbX8xGM&t=232s)** — So doing things to reduce stress is super, super important.
- **[03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gKviXbX8xGM&t=235s)** — There's actually two cofactors that are really important that a lot of people are missing.
- **[04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gKviXbX8xGM&t=240s)** — And that would be magnesium and zinc.
- **[04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gKviXbX8xGM&t=244s)** — What you need to know about magnesium is number one, most people are deficient.
- **[04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gKviXbX8xGM&t=247s)** — Number two, it's almost impossible to test for it.
- **[04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gKviXbX8xGM&t=250s)** — You can't test for it in the blood because most of it is inside the cell.
- **[04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gKviXbX8xGM&t=254s)** — You have to do a very sophisticated test to measure it.
- **[04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gKviXbX8xGM&t=257s)** — And most, if not all, doctors do not test for magnesium.
- **[04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gKviXbX8xGM&t=261s)** — The one you want is magnesium glycinate before bed.
- **[04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gKviXbX8xGM&t=264s)** — And you want at least 400 milligrams.
- **[04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gKviXbX8xGM&t=267s)** — Now as far as zinc goes, you need about 50 milligrams of zinc.
- **[04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gKviXbX8xGM&t=272s)** — But if you had shellfish, you can easily get your zinc, especially oysters.
- **[04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gKviXbX8xGM&t=276s)** — Now a couple rules about fasting.
- **[04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gKviXbX8xGM&t=278s)** — The rule of thumb is don't eat if you're not hungry.
- **[04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gKviXbX8xGM&t=281s)** — Ride the wave. Go a little longer.
- **[04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gKviXbX8xGM&t=283s)** — Because if you were able to go 36 to even 72 hours of fasting,
- **[04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gKviXbX8xGM&t=289s)** — you literally are going to generate immune stem cells.
- **[04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gKviXbX8xGM&t=292s)** — That's huge. So number one, let your body tell you how long to fast.
- **[04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gKviXbX8xGM&t=297s)** — If you do fasting and you feel like crap, you need to eat.
- **[05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gKviXbX8xGM&t=300s)** — I would say everyone could do this intermittent fasting.
- **[05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gKviXbX8xGM&t=303s)** — But when we get into more prolonged fasting,
- **[05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gKviXbX8xGM&t=305s)** — allow your body to tell you if it's working.
- **[05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gKviXbX8xGM&t=308s)** — And also it really depends on what you're trying to solve.
- **[05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gKviXbX8xGM&t=311s)** — If you're trying to lose weight, of course you want to fast a lot longer.
- **[05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gKviXbX8xGM&t=314s)** — Now there's also this topic that you may have heard,
- **[05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gKviXbX8xGM&t=318s)** — when you do low carb, your cortisol is going to increase.
- **[05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gKviXbX8xGM&t=322s)** — There is no hardcore evidence that shows that cortisol is going to increase
- **[05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gKviXbX8xGM&t=325s)** — when you do fasting or on a low carb diet.
- **[05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gKviXbX8xGM&t=327s)** — Because that study was done on rats.
- **[05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gKviXbX8xGM&t=330s)** — And yeah, okay, so if something works on rats, it may work on humans.
- **[05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gKviXbX8xGM&t=334s)** — But that is in the area of opinion. It's not based on facts.
- **[05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gKviXbX8xGM&t=337s)** — I have over 8,000 success stories on my website.
- **[05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gKviXbX8xGM&t=341s)** — From people doing this, getting off medication,
- **[05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gKviXbX8xGM&t=344s)** — to losing a ton of weight, to sleeping better,
- **[05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gKviXbX8xGM&t=346s)** — to getting rid of inflammation.
- **[05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gKviXbX8xGM&t=348s)** — So how do you explain all that?
- **[05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gKviXbX8xGM&t=349s)** — Also, I've talked to a lot of people who have done low carb and intermittent fasting for many years.
- **[05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gKviXbX8xGM&t=353s)** — I don't know of anyone who told me all of a sudden they started getting stressed out
- **[05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gKviXbX8xGM&t=358s)** — or they're having stress problems at all.
- **[06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gKviXbX8xGM&t=360s)** — Also, when you do fasting, you're making your cells more sensitive to insulin.
- **[06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gKviXbX8xGM&t=366s)** — And that alone is going to offset the raising of cortisol.
- **[06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gKviXbX8xGM&t=369s)** — Because insulin now is working. It's more efficient.
- **[06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gKviXbX8xGM&t=372s)** — So there's two types of fasting I want to talk about.
- **[06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gKviXbX8xGM&t=374s)** — You have water fasting. So you're not eating food.
- **[06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gKviXbX8xGM&t=378s)** — Then you have something called a dry fast.
- **[06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gKviXbX8xGM&t=380s)** — Where you're not eating any food and you're not drinking any water.
- **[06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gKviXbX8xGM&t=384s)** — Now, I looked into the dehydration genes.
- **[06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gKviXbX8xGM&t=387s)** — So when you dehydrate yourself, okay, to a certain degree,
- **[06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gKviXbX8xGM&t=390s)** — you have a series of genes that kick in or are expressed.
- **[06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gKviXbX8xGM&t=396s)** — And I started looking at those genes.
- **[06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gKviXbX8xGM&t=398s)** — And a lot of the functions have to do with hydration and keeping your body hydrated
- **[06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gKviXbX8xGM&t=402s)** — and not letting too much fluid go out.
- **[06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gKviXbX8xGM&t=404s)** — But one is enhanced weight loss.
- **[06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gKviXbX8xGM&t=409s)** — This might be hard to believe, but your fat can be converted to water.
- **[06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gKviXbX8xGM&t=414s)** — If you take one pound of fat and you burn it with oxygen,
- **[06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gKviXbX8xGM&t=418s)** — it'll turn into a little bit more than one pound of water.
- **[07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gKviXbX8xGM&t=421s)** — So it's not that fat is saturated with water.
- **[07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gKviXbX8xGM&t=424s)** — When you burn that fat, it turns into water.
- **[07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gKviXbX8xGM&t=427s)** — And this is really bizarre. Look it up. It's totally true.
- **[07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gKviXbX8xGM&t=430s)** — The point is we're not trying to dehydrate you.
- **[07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gKviXbX8xGM&t=432s)** — We're just trying to control when you feed the body water.
- **[07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gKviXbX8xGM&t=436s)** — There's more antioxidants to develop in the brain.
- **[07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gKviXbX8xGM&t=439s)** — You get enhanced autophagy.
- **[07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gKviXbX8xGM&t=441s)** — So you get a deeper cleaning of the cells.
- **[07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gKviXbX8xGM&t=444s)** — You get more detoxification from the liver.
- **[07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gKviXbX8xGM&t=446s)** — As far as what I'm doing presently.
- **[07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gKviXbX8xGM&t=449s)** — And I will switch it up occasionally.
- **[07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gKviXbX8xGM&t=451s)** — But I used to fast from dinner all the way and just skip breakfast
- **[07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gKviXbX8xGM&t=455s)** — and have the first meal, let's say a late lunch at two, maybe three.
- **[07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gKviXbX8xGM&t=460s)** — And then also have a dinner.
- **[07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gKviXbX8xGM&t=462s)** — Now what I'm doing is I'm actually consuming a breakfast in the morning.
- **[07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gKviXbX8xGM&t=466s)** — Sometimes it's at 930. Sometimes it's at 10. Sometimes 11.
- **[07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gKviXbX8xGM&t=470s)** — And then I'll also have a lunch at one.
- **[07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gKviXbX8xGM&t=473s)** — Sometimes my second meal is at two.
- **[07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gKviXbX8xGM&t=475s)** — But what I've done is I'm feeding my body more when I need more energy,
- **[07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gKviXbX8xGM&t=479s)** — which is in the first part of the day versus later at night.
- **[08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gKviXbX8xGM&t=483s)** — I don't need all that energy.
- **[08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gKviXbX8xGM&t=484s)** — I don't want to go to bed with a big meal on my stomach.
- **[08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gKviXbX8xGM&t=487s)** — Now, if you do fasting and you notice your hair is falling out
- **[08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gKviXbX8xGM&t=492s)** — or you're losing your cycle, then you need to look at what you're eating more closely.
- **[08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gKviXbX8xGM&t=498s)** — Chances are you're not getting enough protein.
- **[08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gKviXbX8xGM&t=500s)** — I'm talking about the highest quality protein that you can get.
- **[08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gKviXbX8xGM&t=503s)** — And that would be grass-fed red meat.
- **[08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gKviXbX8xGM&t=505s)** — I would start to beef up that, no pun intended,
- **[08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gKviXbX8xGM&t=509s)** — to the point where your body can get those amino acids.
- **[08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gKviXbX8xGM&t=511s)** — And plus with the red meat comes all the B vitamins, the trace minerals,
- **[08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gKviXbX8xGM&t=516s)** — everything you need for hair growth.
- **[08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gKviXbX8xGM&t=518s)** — If you're not getting enough sea salt when you're doing fasting,
- **[08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gKviXbX8xGM&t=521s)** — you're not going to be able to sleep as well.
- **[08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gKviXbX8xGM&t=523s)** — So don't forget about that.
- **[08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gKviXbX8xGM&t=524s)** — Most people need about a level teaspoon of sea salt every single day.
- **[08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gKviXbX8xGM&t=528s)** — Sleep is really, really important too.
- **[08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gKviXbX8xGM&t=531s)** — If you don't feel like you're getting enough sleep, you're going to be hungrier.
- **[08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gKviXbX8xGM&t=534s)** — And for some people that just can't sleep when they're doing fasting,
- **[08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gKviXbX8xGM&t=538s)** — at that point, I do recommend taking melatonin.
- **[09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gKviXbX8xGM&t=541s)** — Maybe you work up to five milligrams and eventually up to 10 milligrams
- **[09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gKviXbX8xGM&t=545s)** — and you take that before bed.
- **[09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gKviXbX8xGM&t=547s)** — All right. So now that you know a little bit more about fasting,
- **[09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gKviXbX8xGM&t=550s)** — if you want to know what to eat, you should watch this video right here.
- **[09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gKviXbX8xGM&t=553s)** — Check it out.

- **[00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3EWt8jyX2E&t=0s)** — Let's talk about how to get rid of your belly fat. But if we just kind of step back for a second and
- **[00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3EWt8jyX2E&t=5s)** — just look at the purpose of fat, it's a survival mechanism. It helps to store fuel, but it has a
- **[00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3EWt8jyX2E&t=14s)** — limitation to how much it can store. So once it gets to a certain point, then we have a backup
- **[00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3EWt8jyX2E&t=21s)** — system. It's a plan B where you start storing fat around the organs and that type of fat is
- **[00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3EWt8jyX2E&t=28s)** — visceral fat. Now when visceral fat goes on too long and you don't use up that energy, then that
- **[00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3EWt8jyX2E&t=35s)** — type of fat becomes sick. It becomes damaged and it can no longer readily take in fats for storage
- **[00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3EWt8jyX2E&t=44s)** — or even sugar in its conversion into fat. So we have a third type of fat situation. This is
- **[00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3EWt8jyX2E&t=51s)** — fat that then spills over inside your organs. It's the fat inside your liver. It's the fat
- **[00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3EWt8jyX2E&t=59s)** — inside your pancreas. It's the fat inside your muscle. So by the time you have ectopic fat,
- **[01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3EWt8jyX2E&t=65s)** — which is fat in the liver, that's actually pretty bad. That's not a healthy situation.
- **[01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3EWt8jyX2E&t=70s)** — But on a positive note, it's the fastest thing to fix because when we reverse the
- **[01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3EWt8jyX2E&t=75s)** — can get rid of the ectopic fat first, then the visceral fat, then the subcutaneous fat.
- **[01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3EWt8jyX2E&t=83s)** — And so is it just a matter of too many calories that destroys the machine? Not necessarily. It's
- **[01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3EWt8jyX2E&t=88s)** — the type of calories that destroy this machine. Number one, alcohol will destroy the machine for
- **[01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3EWt8jyX2E&t=93s)** — sure. This is why chronic alcoholics have a pot belly and they have a lot of visceral fat
- **[01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3EWt8jyX2E&t=98s)** — and they definitely have a lot of liver fat. Now the next thing you need to know about is
- **[01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3EWt8jyX2E&t=103s)** — Now there's a big difference between the fructose in fruit versus the fructose in high fructose
- **[01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3EWt8jyX2E&t=110s)** — corn syrup. That goes into the body and just creates serious damage to your metabolism,
- **[01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3EWt8jyX2E&t=115s)** — including the liver because it's a refined product. It's an ultra processed food that
- **[02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3EWt8jyX2E&t=120s)** — doesn't have the protection. So when you eat these carbohydrates without those cofactors,
- **[02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3EWt8jyX2E&t=125s)** — as in the ultra processed food calories, you really starve off this biochemical machine.
- **[02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3EWt8jyX2E&t=131s)** — And this is really what causes the system to break down because over 83% of the food
- **[02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3EWt8jyX2E&t=137s)** — calories in the grocery store are ultra processed food calories. The next thing I want to share
- **[02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3EWt8jyX2E&t=142s)** — with you is something that doesn't involve food. It involves stress. Chronic stress can also
- **[02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3EWt8jyX2E&t=148s)** — activate the body and turn things into sugar inside your body. And Cushing syndrome is created
- **[02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3EWt8jyX2E&t=156s)** — by a high level cortisol. That's the stress hormone. Even getting less than five hours
- **[02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3EWt8jyX2E&t=161s)** — of sleep a night can increase cortisol and worsen more visceral fat. Steroids, also
- **[02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3EWt8jyX2E&t=168s)** — antibiotics, antidepressant medication, anti-anxiety medication can also increase
- **[02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3EWt8jyX2E&t=174s)** — visceral fat. Now another uncommon thing that people don't realize is the seed oils
- **[02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3EWt8jyX2E&t=178s)** — in our diet, which make up like 25-30%, directly contribute to damage mitochondria,
- **[03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3EWt8jyX2E&t=186s)** — that machine that controls our metabolism. Because even if you look at the past two or three
- **[03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3EWt8jyX2E&t=191s)** — or four decades and you look at the trends of sugar, they're not nearly as high as the seed
- **[03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3EWt8jyX2E&t=197s)** — oils. There's much more contribution to visceral fat from seed oils than actual sugar. So this
- **[03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3EWt8jyX2E&t=205s)** — is another thing that unfortunately people have been taught that seed oils are heart healthy,
- **[03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3EWt8jyX2E&t=211s)** — when in fact they're heart unhealthy. They go through an industrial refining process and when
- **[03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3EWt8jyX2E&t=218s)** — you consume them they're just very damaging to the system. And then of course you have sugar
- **[03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3EWt8jyX2E&t=222s)** — and starch. But the damaging effect from sugar and starch happens when you refine
- **[03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3EWt8jyX2E&t=228s)** — sugars and starches through this whole industrial process. So glucose syrup, dextrose, these are
- **[03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3EWt8jyX2E&t=234s)** — sugars that are highly refined. Starch is basically a sugar. I'm talking about maltodextrin,
- **[04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3EWt8jyX2E&t=240s)** — I'm talking about modified food starch and they're very deadly for your metabolism
- **[04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3EWt8jyX2E&t=244s)** — and they contribute to a lot of visceral fat and damage within the machine. So what do we do
- **[04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3EWt8jyX2E&t=250s)** — as the first step? Eliminate alter process food calories. Sugar, starches and seed oils. If you
- **[04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3EWt8jyX2E&t=258s)** — combine the seed oils with the sugar, oh my goodness, you're going to really severely damage
- **[04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3EWt8jyX2E&t=264s)** — that metabolism because your system is already gunked up. This is what's called metabolically
- **[04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3EWt8jyX2E&t=269s)** — inefficient. And a lot of these alter process food calories don't have a lot of protein in
- **[04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3EWt8jyX2E&t=274s)** — them. The protein is what satisfies you. Without protein you're just going to want more and
- **[04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3EWt8jyX2E&t=278s)** — more and more. You'll keep eating them until you're satisfied with protein. Well that's
- **[04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3EWt8jyX2E&t=283s)** — never going to happen. Like animal proteins, especially red meat, are so dense in the
- **[04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3EWt8jyX2E&t=287s)** — cofactors. I'm talking about the trace minerals, the minerals and the vitamins that
- **[04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3EWt8jyX2E&t=291s)** — need to actually metabolize. Red meat, fish, eggs, all will help you fix this problem.
- **[04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3EWt8jyX2E&t=298s)** — Another thing that people don't realize is that diet sodas are just as bad as regular
- **[05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3EWt8jyX2E&t=302s)** — sugar sodas. So don't think you're helping yourself by taking a diet soda. And I just
- **[05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3EWt8jyX2E&t=308s)** — have to say this one last point. Just because something says low carb or keto-friendly
- **[05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3EWt8jyX2E&t=313s)** — does not mean it's really keto-friendly. So you must read the labels. As far as exercise
- **[05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3EWt8jyX2E&t=319s)** — goes, what type of exercise is best for belly fat? Well, let's just first talk about
- **[05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3EWt8jyX2E&t=324s)** — high intensity interval training. Because it's short doses of high intensity with rest
- **[05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3EWt8jyX2E&t=330s)** — versus a sustained long-term run or a moderate amount of intensity on a treadmill. And that
- **[05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3EWt8jyX2E&t=338s)** — can even increase cortisol. So if you do high intensity interval training, you'll be more
- **[05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3EWt8jyX2E&t=343s)** — successful with visceral fat. But also other things like weight training are going to build
- **[05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3EWt8jyX2E&t=347s)** — more muscles so then you can actually burn more of these calories. You need muscle to have this
- **[05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3EWt8jyX2E&t=352s)** — whole thing work. But then we get to walking. Walking is very good for belly fat loss, but not
- **[06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3EWt8jyX2E&t=360s)** — just a little bit of walking a day. Like doing longer walks because walking also reduces stress.
- **[06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3EWt8jyX2E&t=367s)** — So this is why I like the combination of high intensity interval training with walking on the
- **[06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3EWt8jyX2E&t=376s)** — And I also take B1. A good source of B1 is something called nutritional yeast. You can
- **[06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3EWt8jyX2E&t=383s)** — put it on your salad, make sure it's unfortified, and that can greatly help reduce stress and
- **[06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3EWt8jyX2E&t=388s)** — increase sleep. Next thing on the list is vitamin D through a lot of sun. Getting more sun
- **[06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3EWt8jyX2E&t=392s)** — will help you lose more weight. Just don't go out into the point where you're burned.
- **[06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3EWt8jyX2E&t=397s)** — Go out to the point where you start developing a tan and getting more vitamin D. And in those
- **[06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3EWt8jyX2E&t=402s)** — days you can't get sun. Just take vitamin D as a supplement. At least 10,000 I use the vitamin D3.
- **[06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3EWt8jyX2E&t=409s)** — But don't forget about magnesium because magnesium also allows vitamin D to work.
- **[06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3EWt8jyX2E&t=414s)** — Magnesium also helps you sleep. It's also very important in making sure that the mitochondria
- **[06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3EWt8jyX2E&t=419s)** — works well since magnesium is one of the top co-factors or the helper things involved
- **[07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3EWt8jyX2E&t=425s)** — in that mitochondrial biochemistry. And the last point is fasting. And this is really
- **[07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3EWt8jyX2E&t=432s)** — up greatly because every time you eat you trigger insulin. And the more insulin you have,
- **[07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3EWt8jyX2E&t=438s)** — the less you're going to lose. So if you can include intermittent fasting and only
- **[07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3EWt8jyX2E&t=441s)** — have two meals, lunch and dinner, and then kind of graduate maybe even to one meal for a
- **[07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3EWt8jyX2E&t=446s)** — while, that would probably be very, very smart versus all the snacking that people do.
- **[07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3EWt8jyX2E&t=452s)** — And even if it's healthy snacking, probably not a good idea. But this is a way
- **[07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3EWt8jyX2E&t=456s)** — to actually fix the metabolism to the point where now you have the ability to use fuel
- **[07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3EWt8jyX2E&t=463s)** — because now you're matching an environment of how your body has evolved. And the body has not
- **[07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3EWt8jyX2E&t=469s)** — evolved with all this available food and snacking and eating constantly 24-7. Now the
- **[07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3EWt8jyX2E&t=476s)** — biggest question is what are the details of what do I eat? For that information, watch this
- **[08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3EWt8jyX2E&t=481s)** — right here.

- **[00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1nj4_iHb8M&t=0s)** — This will lower your blood sugar faster than anything else that I know.
- **[00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1nj4_iHb8M&t=3s)** — These hacks will also help you get into fat burning faster than anything I know.
- **[00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1nj4_iHb8M&t=7s)** — And I'm going to show that last. And that would be right after number seven.
- **[00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1nj4_iHb8M&t=11s)** — Well, let's first start with number one. High intensity interval training.
- **[00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1nj4_iHb8M&t=13s)** — And you don't have to do much of it. I'm talking about just a few minutes.
- **[00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1nj4_iHb8M&t=17s)** — A very short high intensity exercise with lots of rest.
- **[00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1nj4_iHb8M&t=21s)** — Wow! What this can do for your blood sugar is just off the chart.
- **[00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1nj4_iHb8M&t=24s)** — Anytime you force your muscles to contract,
- **[00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1nj4_iHb8M&t=27s)** — this type of exercise will deplete any excess sugar you have in your blood very quick.
- **[00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1nj4_iHb8M&t=32s)** — Some examples of HIIT training are burpees or plyometrics where you're jumping on a platform back and forth.
- **[00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1nj4_iHb8M&t=38s)** — Or spin bike or any type of resistance training where you're doing high intensity short intervals.
- **[00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1nj4_iHb8M&t=44s)** — Number two, apple cider vinegar. Okay, what's an upside of vinegar? Acetic acid.
- **[00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1nj4_iHb8M&t=48s)** — Acetic acid has the potential to slow down the spike of blood sugar after you eat sugar.
- **[00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1nj4_iHb8M&t=53s)** — Anytime you consume a high carb meal, you should always follow it up with a little bit of apple cider vinegar.
- **[00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1nj4_iHb8M&t=59s)** — I recommend like a tablespoon or maybe like eight ounces of water.
- **[01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1nj4_iHb8M&t=62s)** — Doing that right after a high carb meal can decrease the blood sugar spike by 34%.
- **[01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1nj4_iHb8M&t=67s)** — This acetic acid and apple cider vinegar also helps the absorption of glucose into your muscles.
- **[01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1nj4_iHb8M&t=73s)** — Number three involves certain supplements. Berberine is one considered a natural metformin.
- **[01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1nj4_iHb8M&t=80s)** — Metformin is a medication that helps with blood sugar. But the cool thing about berberine is it acts like metformin.
- **[01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1nj4_iHb8M&t=88s)** — Almost in equivalency with what it can do to your blood sugar without side effects.
- **[01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1nj4_iHb8M&t=92s)** — If we pair berberine with a couple other things, one would be NAC.
- **[01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1nj4_iHb8M&t=98s)** — You can reduce something called oxidative stress to be able to deal with this extra sugar.
- **[01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1nj4_iHb8M&t=103s)** — And if you're going to take NAC, I would take something like about 600 milligrams.
- **[01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1nj4_iHb8M&t=107s)** — So that would be a combination of berberine and NAC. There's a slightly better combination that you might want to use.
- **[01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1nj4_iHb8M&t=113s)** — Berberine and something called alpha lipoic acid. And so it could correct the damage from excess sugar on your nervous system.
- **[02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1nj4_iHb8M&t=121s)** — Now this is just a little extra thing, but I wanted to just at least mention vitamin B1.
- **[02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1nj4_iHb8M&t=125s)** — When you consume excess carbohydrates as a cheat meal, you are going to deplete your vitamin B1 levels.
- **[02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1nj4_iHb8M&t=131s)** — What happens next is you start storing more of this sugar as fat, as well as causing you to have this nervous anxiety that a lot of people get after they eat sugar.
- **[02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1nj4_iHb8M&t=139s)** — If we're talking about a cheat meal or you go off track or you fall off the wagon with carbohydrates, don't forget about taking more B1.
- **[02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1nj4_iHb8M&t=147s)** — Number four, this is something you already know. A post meal walk.
- **[02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1nj4_iHb8M&t=151s)** — After you eat that carbohydrate meal, like let's say for example your friends and family forced you to eat it.
- **[02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1nj4_iHb8M&t=156s)** — Now you get to deal with this extra sugar. Go for a walk for about 25 to 30 minutes.
- **[02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1nj4_iHb8M&t=160s)** — You're not going to necessarily get into fat burning. You are going to basically burn off all this extra sugar that you just ate that you don't want converting into cholesterol or being stored as fat.
- **[02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1nj4_iHb8M&t=170s)** — Literally forces the glucose in your bloodstream to be burned.
- **[02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1nj4_iHb8M&t=174s)** — Number five involves both potassium and magnesium. Let's start with potassium.
- **[03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1nj4_iHb8M&t=180s)** — Well, in order for you to store sugar in your liver, you need potassium.
- **[03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1nj4_iHb8M&t=185s)** — In order for you to store glucose in the muscles, you also need potassium.
- **[03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1nj4_iHb8M&t=188s)** — It's the thing that helps move glucose into your cells.
- **[03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1nj4_iHb8M&t=192s)** — Because if it doesn't go into the cell, a little signal is sent to the pancreas to tell the pancreas to now produce more insulin.
- **[03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1nj4_iHb8M&t=199s)** — And now we get this never ending cycle, which has a cascade of all sorts of problems down the road, which definitely influence your blood sugar.
- **[03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1nj4_iHb8M&t=207s)** — Now let's move to magnesium. Magnesium is critical for the cells that produce insulin for them to work.
- **[03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1nj4_iHb8M&t=214s)** — Nearly every diabetic is deficient in magnesium. Just by taking more magnesium, you can improve a diabetic situation as well as blood sugar.
- **[03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1nj4_iHb8M&t=223s)** — Let's go to number six. Ketone supplements. There's two main fuel sources that the brain can run on.
- **[03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1nj4_iHb8M&t=229s)** — Glucose and ketones. The problem with running your brain on glucose is that you're going to starve the nerves in the brain.
- **[03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1nj4_iHb8M&t=235s)** — And this is what's behind dementia, Alzheimer's, et cetera.
- **[03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1nj4_iHb8M&t=239s)** — But what they don't know is there's an alternative fuel, ketones, that the brain can survive on.
- **[04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1nj4_iHb8M&t=245s)** — The brain now has this extra fuel, ketones, to run itself on. That alone is going to decrease the need for glucose.
- **[04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1nj4_iHb8M&t=253s)** — So if you provide the brain with ketones, you instantly help the blood sugar situation of the brain.
- **[04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1nj4_iHb8M&t=257s)** — And the brain will start working better. It'll think better. Less brain fog, less inflammation.
- **[04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1nj4_iHb8M&t=263s)** — Number seven, salt water. What's interesting about sodium is it helps prevent stress-induced blood sugar spikes.
- **[04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1nj4_iHb8M&t=273s)** — This is one of the reasons why people don't sleep, right? They go through this stressful day and they try to go to sleep and they're stressed out and the blood sugars are going up.
- **[04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1nj4_iHb8M&t=280s)** — Sea salt is the antidote for that. And you can just add more to the last meal of the day or just put a little in some water, drink it down.
- **[04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1nj4_iHb8M&t=286s)** — And you're going to feel like, I feel calmer. You're going to sleep better.
- **[04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1nj4_iHb8M&t=290s)** — This is why a lot of stressed out people crave salty chips late at night.
- **[04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1nj4_iHb8M&t=296s)** — Okay, let's get to the most powerful way to help reduce your blood sugars really quick.
- **[05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1nj4_iHb8M&t=302s)** — Dry fasting. Now, wait a second. What's the difference between dry fasting and water fasting?
- **[05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1nj4_iHb8M&t=306s)** — Well, water fasting is when you're not eating anything but you're drinking water.
- **[05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1nj4_iHb8M&t=310s)** — But dry fasting is when you're not drinking any water and you're not eating any food.
- **[05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1nj4_iHb8M&t=314s)** — Interestingly enough, I've been doing dry fasting for a long time without knowing it.
- **[05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1nj4_iHb8M&t=319s)** — Just simply because I'm not thirsty until like four o'clock in the afternoon or maybe even five o'clock.
- **[05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1nj4_iHb8M&t=325s)** — And then, you know, until after dinner.
- **[05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1nj4_iHb8M&t=327s)** — But the point is it can have major effects on your blood sugar, even more than the water fasting.
- **[05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1nj4_iHb8M&t=333s)** — Let me tell you why. When you're not drinking, you're inducing a little bit of a dehydration.
- **[05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1nj4_iHb8M&t=339s)** — And so there's no extra water to dilute the blood sugar.
- **[05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1nj4_iHb8M&t=342s)** — And so what the body does with that is very interesting.
- **[05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1nj4_iHb8M&t=345s)** — Your body will start to increase a certain hormone that does the opposite of insulin.
- **[05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1nj4_iHb8M&t=351s)** — So it's going to help your blood sugar.
- **[05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1nj4_iHb8M&t=353s)** — Also increase growth hormone.
- **[05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1nj4_iHb8M&t=356s)** — Dry fasting basically adds a little more stress to the body.
- **[05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1nj4_iHb8M&t=359s)** — It'll help produce all sorts of natural antioxidants to counter this excess stress that you're inducing on the body.
- **[06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1nj4_iHb8M&t=365s)** — So we get more transportation of glucose going into the muscles.
- **[06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1nj4_iHb8M&t=369s)** — We get a faster blood sugar drop level.
- **[06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1nj4_iHb8M&t=372s)** — And we switch the fat burning really fast.
- **[06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1nj4_iHb8M&t=374s)** — Which I'm talking about generating ketones.
- **[06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1nj4_iHb8M&t=377s)** — But I think the biggest advice I would give you is to not cheat on your diet.
- **[06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1nj4_iHb8M&t=382s)** — And to be able to maintain a diet that's low in sugar so you don't have to do any of these.
- **[06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1nj4_iHb8M&t=387s)** — Thanks for watching.

- **[00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=0s)** — Knowledge Doc is a nutritionist and chiropractor specializing in healthy eating and alternative
- **[00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=6s)** — healthcare more broadly. He has published over 6,000 videos and amassed 13 million followers on
- **[00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=12s)** — YouTube, and has trained over 2,500 doctors and healthcare practitioners in how diet can impact
- **[00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=18s)** — your health. You reduce carbohydrates, it then forces your body to go after your own fat as
- **[00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=23s)** — fuel. So for weight loss, it's great. And for other things, it's good too.
- **[00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=26s)** — In this episode, we discuss his approach to health, from superfoods to intermittent fasting,
- **[00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=32s)** — and get his thoughts on Bobby Kennedy as HHS secretary.
- **[00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=35s)** — I think if we are going to make some changes, we have to first of all,
- **[00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=38s)** — make people aware of these hidden ingredients and start to get them out of your diet.
- **[00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=44s)** — This is American Thought Leaders, and I'm Jan Jekielek.
- **[00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=49s)** — Eric Berg, such a pleasure to have you on American Thought Leaders.
- **[00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=53s)** — Well, I'm really happy to be here. I've watched your show for many years.
- **[00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=57s)** — And so thank you for having me on.
- **[01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=60s)** — Well, so let's talk about disease and health in America. We spend here in America,
- **[01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=68s)** — an incredible amount per capita on healthcare, but the outcomes compared to the amount
- **[01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=73s)** — that's actually being spent, seem pretty low. Now, why is that?
- **[01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=76s)** — Yeah, you're right, because we spend $4.5 trillion, and we have the worst health.
- **[01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=81s)** — I think that I'd like to just kind of give everyone a bird's eye view of what I think
- **[01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=86s)** — the situation is, because it's really kind of simple when you step back and look at it.
- **[01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=91s)** — It's like on the one side, you have big pharma. Okay, they're helping provide the
- **[01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=97s)** — solutions to our medical problems. And then the other side, we have big food or the junk
- **[01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=101s)** — food, and they're both kind of funneling down this way. And right in the middle, you
- **[01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=106s)** — have the medical establishment, the system that we're operating off right now, and the
- **[01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=111s)** — shift basically, if you want to get healthy, you just take this pill for your symptom.
- **[01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=118s)** — But if we look at the chronic disease, most of that comes from our diet and
- **[02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=126s)** — ultra processed food calories. It's the junk food, right? That's the majority of
- **[02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=130s)** — problems. So when you look at it, these medications are basically treating the symptom
- **[02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=134s)** — of the junk food. We don't really bring up the diet in that consultation with the
- **[02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=139s)** — doctor. When the doctor evaluates someone, they're not really diving into what they eat.
- **[02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=143s)** — When I was in practice in Alexandria, Virginia for 30 years, I would all day long, the first
- **[02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=149s)** — question I would ask is, what are you eating? Someone came in with a problem, whatever it is,
- **[02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=154s)** — when did it start? What did you eat just before that? I had a patient who went to
- **[02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=160s)** — several doctors, including the emergency rooms spent out of pocket $40,000 for her heart
- **[02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=165s)** — problem. She had angina. And no one asked her, like, what did you eat just before you had the
- **[02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=170s)** — symptoms? It was a series of really bad banana splits, right? And like every day for like
- **[02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=177s)** — three days in a row. And all I had to do is just change her diet and all that angina went
- **[03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=182s)** — away. They couldn't find anything on the test. And define for me junk food, because I
- **[03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=187s)** — actually think that might mean different things for different people. In order to define junk food,
- **[03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=191s)** — you really have to define what food is first to compare it. Because it's kind of hard to talk
- **[03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=196s)** — about junk food without knowing what food is. Food is that which is eaten to sustain energy,
- **[03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=203s)** — the growth and repair of tissue, nourishment. That's what the Latin word for food means.
- **[03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=209s)** — If we compare that to other things that we're eating, like junk food,
- **[03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=213s)** — can junk food actually sustain life? Can it repair our bodies? Can it help us grow?
- **[03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=218s)** — The answer is no. You're taking a food that's so refined, so processed, so dead. There's nothing
- **[03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=225s)** — else in it. They take all the nutrients out of it. They put a couple of synthetic vitamins
- **[03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=229s)** — in there. You have a lot of byproduct and chemicals. It's so refined. It just can sit
- **[03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=233s)** — on the shelf for a long time. Is that food? I don't think it is. Junk food is not food.
- **[03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=239s)** — It's something else. And it's composed of mainly three things. We have the refined sugars,
- **[04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=245s)** — the refined seed oils, and the refined starches, which is basically hidden sugars.
- **[04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=251s)** — And of course, that's like the main three ingredients, but then there's
- **[04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=255s)** — food coloring, and then there's flavorings that you add onto it, and you have preservatives.
- **[04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=260s)** — So if you look at the ingredients of a lot of these foods, it's the same ingredients with
- **[04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=264s)** — different flavors, different colorings, different packaging. If over 50% of the population
- **[04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=269s)** — is consuming junk food, adults, and over 63% of teenagers are consuming
- **[04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=277s)** — these ultra processed foods, then how are we going to be able to create health? You can't.
- **[04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=280s)** — This is really at the root of chronic disease. We're not eating things
- **[04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=285s)** — to sustain life. And this is why we have the chronic illness.
- **[04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=290s)** — Let's talk a little bit about these 30 years that you were in practice. I understand you
- **[04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=293s)** — were a chiropractor primarily, but then of course, you sort of branched out from there.
- **[05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=300s)** — Can you give me a picture of that, please? I had no intention of kind of getting into
- **[05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=305s)** — what I am to now because I would literally eat pure junk food all the way up until I was
- **[05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=312s)** — like 28 years old. And I got away with it for so many years, but then it caught up with
- **[05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=317s)** — me. But the only thing green that I ate, I think was pistachio ice cream and lime green
- **[05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=322s)** — jello. But other than that, I never ate a vegetable, never ate anything healthy. And so
- **[05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=329s)** — getting in my 20s and all of a sudden I was like arthritic in my fingers and my back. I had
- **[05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=336s)** — chronic fatigue syndrome. I was just, I couldn't sleep. I started going downhill. In fact,
- **[05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=341s)** — my wife was like, you don't look too good. You look kind of gray and almost greenish.
- **[05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=345s)** — I was going downhill. So of course, it was a good and bad thing. The good thing was it
- **[05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=352s)** — kind of woke me up to eating healthily and figuring out things because I stumbled on what
- **[05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=357s)** — to do to correct things. But if I never had that experience, I never would have got into
- **[06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=362s)** — health at all. I stumbled on a book called Mastering the Zone. And I didn't even read
- **[06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=367s)** — the whole book. I just read the introduction and it said something about insulin and avoid
- **[06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=372s)** — carbs and eat high quality protein. So the next morning I had a buffalo burger instead of my
- **[06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=379s)** — cereal, which I thought was really bad for you at the time because it causes cancer,
- **[06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=384s)** — which is totally a lie. So I ate that and it was almost like someone just literally took a helmet
- **[06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=388s)** — off my head and I could actually think clearly. I was like, oh my goodness, this is amazing.
- **[06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=393s)** — The way I was trying to solve my problems back then, instead of changing my diet,
- **[06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=397s)** — I would just be taking this supplement, doing colon cleanses and detoxes and
- **[06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=402s)** — driving down the street. I would tell my wife, hey, there's the health house. Let's go
- **[06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=407s)** — in there and then come back with a whole bunch of vitamins. And it wasn't working
- **[06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=411s)** — because the foundation wasn't there. So tell me about the ketogenic diet.
- **[06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=415s)** — There's some people that, even medical professionals who say it can become dangerous.
- **[07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=421s)** — Explain to me how this works. Yeah, in real simple terms,
- **[07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=426s)** — you're basically just eliminating the massive amount of carbs that people eat.
- **[07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=431s)** — Because when you reduce carbohydrates, it then forces your body to go after your own fat as
- **[07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=436s)** — fuel. For weight loss, it's great. And for other things, it's good too. The average person
- **[07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=441s)** — that's not overweight has literally a hundred thousand calories of fat on their body.
- **[07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=445s)** — So they have a lot more stored energy for running on fat than they do from the dietary
- **[07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=452s)** — source of calories. If you don't tap into your own fat, then you're going to be
- **[07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=456s)** — dependent on the next meal. You're not going to be able to go long before you're hungry.
- **[07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=460s)** — So when you start shifting off to the ketogenic diet, which is basically,
- **[07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=464s)** — it's the breakdown of fat into ketones as an alternative fuel, then you can go a lot
- **[07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=470s)** — longer because you're running off these calories that are just stored.
- **[07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=475s)** — And that allows you to get rid of your cravings and your hunger and produce a whole bunch of
- **[08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=481s)** — health effects, especially for your brain and your heart that you never could do.
- **[08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=485s)** — If you're not in ketosis, there is a certain condition. If they forget their medication and
- **[08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=491s)** — they don't take insulin and their blood sugars go too high, then the body can develop
- **[08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=495s)** — a different type of ketosis, which is like a dangerous type of ketosis.
- **[08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=500s)** — People mix them together and say all of ketosis is bad, which is not true. Our bodies were
- **[08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=506s)** — designed to not have to eat every hour and a half. So our bodies were designed to be in
- **[08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=511s)** — ketosis. Even when we're born, we're going through the ketosis. So there's going to be some
- **[08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=516s)** — vested interest against that. And they're going to put out all sorts of things about
- **[08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=520s)** — ketosis. Mainly they'll say something like, well, yes, ketosis does work and it does help
- **[08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=524s)** — lose weight. But we don't know what's going to happen long term. Well, just a little bit
- **[08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=529s)** — of doubt in people's minds. And then they're discouraged. The bottom line is anyone can jump
- **[08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=534s)** — on the keto diet and do it. And there's no health risk really. This is what you're saying
- **[08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=539s)** — here, right? The risk is not doing it, especially since most people have what's called
- **[09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=545s)** — insulin resistance. That's a condition where you've eaten carbs for so long chronically
- **[09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=551s)** — your body is now having a... it's almost like a pre-diabetic situation where you can't use
- **[09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=559s)** — insulin as well. It's not working. And so then you get all sorts of problems like a fatty liver
- **[09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=565s)** — and you're overweight in your midsection. It starts swelling and the heart suffers,
- **[09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=570s)** — the brain suffers. Also a dirty keto people go on. They kind of like go to McDonald's and
- **[09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=574s)** — they'll just eat the meat without the bun. And that's fine as a step up. But the way that I
- **[09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=581s)** — teach people to do it is to do it the healthy version. And it's okay if someone goes off the
- **[09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=587s)** — ketogenic diet. It's actually sometimes good to remind themselves of what they feel like.
- **[09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=591s)** — Like for me, it took me a long time to change my diet because I love junk food, especially
- **[09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=598s)** — Doritos and chips. And so I had to go back and forth and back and forth to the point
- **[10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=604s)** — where I'm like, you know what? I don't want to feel bad anymore. I'm just going to keep
- **[10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=607s)** — consistent. Rarely do I ever go off just because I like the way I feel without it.
- **[10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=613s)** — Why is a McDonald's burger with no bun dirty keto? What does that even mean?
- **[10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=617s)** — That means like you're using the lower quality of calories on the ketogenic diet. For example,
- **[10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=623s)** — keto diet is not necessarily high fat. Like people think they can eat more fat and go into
- **[10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=630s)** — ketosis. No, no. The way you get into ketosis by lowering your carbohydrates.
- **[10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=634s)** — Okay. So now, of course, you have to replace those carbohydrates with something. So that's
- **[10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=639s)** — fat. Now, when people do like seed oils and like you can go and fry something in like
- **[10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=646s)** — corn oil and it's still keto because it's low carb, but is it the healthy version?
- **[10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=652s)** — Maybe not. So there's different levels of quality of ingredients. Like you look at the
- **[11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=660s)** — right. It's just filled with soy protein isolates. That's like pretty low quality protein.
- **[11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=667s)** — Yeah, it's keto, but is it healthy? I wouldn't think so.
- **[11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=673s)** — To your point here about getting the healthy carbohydrates, you actually live on a farm,
- **[11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=678s)** — right? So you're growing these carbohydrates and non-carbohydrates. So just tell me about
- **[11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=686s)** — that. I have the fortunate option to live on a farm. I lived in Bethesda for, actually,
- **[11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=695s)** — Alexandria for many years. And after a while, after 30 years, I was like, you know what?
- **[11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=701s)** — We need to kind of move into a location where there's more space. We actually live off the
- **[11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=706s)** — land. I have gardens. I have animals. We eat the meat. So that's, I'm lucky in that way
- **[11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=713s)** — I can actually have a freezer full of meat from my farm and control that. But you don't
- **[12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=720s)** — necessarily have to live on a farm to be healthy. You could get this high quality
- **[12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=723s)** — protein anywhere. But that's basically where I live. And I have a little studio that I'm in
- **[12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=728s)** — right now. I do my videos and basically one video every single day. And we have like 5,700
- **[12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=734s)** — videos that I've done. So yeah, that's pretty much what I'm up to lately.
- **[12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=738s)** — How is it that we got to this place where I guess we forgot what good food was?
- **[12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=745s)** — You know, I interviewed, I released a video today, I interviewed my father who's 87 years
- **[12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=750s)** — old. And I started interviewing him. I'm like, what did they eat back then? And how can we
- **[12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=754s)** — compare that to now? Did they have food allergies? No. Did they have autism? No.
- **[12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=758s)** — Was there anyone that was overweight? No. Was there any diabetes? No. Like you didn't even
- **[12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=763s)** — have these problems. And so one of the conclusions that I came up with is there has been a new
- **[12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=771s)** — category of food that was invented or created or manufactured by the food industry called the
- **[12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=778s)** — snack food and snack foods. So we have the crackers, the chips, the little bars,
- **[13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=784s)** — the snack bars. I mean, back then, your parents would tell you not to ruin your appetite.
- **[13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=789s)** — If they did have a snack, it was like an apple or something out of the garden. Now, we snack
- **[13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=796s)** — not on that. We snack on ultra processed food calories. So we're dealing with highly refined
- **[13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=801s)** — things that are just going to raise our insulin between the meals. So now we have three meals
- **[13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=806s)** — and then we add the snacks. Now we get these spikes all day long and we're creating a
- **[13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=812s)** — chronic insulin situation, which is literally destroying our health at a very early age.
- **[13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=819s)** — I remember asking my father, I said, What kind of cereal did you have? Oatmeal with milk. That
- **[13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=823s)** — was it. There wasn't these cereals that they have now. How is it that this actually happened?
- **[13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=829s)** — Because it's not just the reality of the junk food, but it's the actual guidance,
- **[13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=835s)** — to some extent, too. You remember when tobacco was considered healthy, and people smoked. And
- **[14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=842s)** — so that went over a period of time. And then there was a shift where smoking was bad.
- **[14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=847s)** — Cigarette manufacturing companies shifted gears, and they bought up some of the junk food
- **[14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=853s)** — industry. And then he started producing more food that was very profitable. If you take, for
- **[14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=859s)** — example, one ingredient, corn, the type of corn they use in junk food is not sweet corn.
- **[14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=866s)** — They use what's called dent corn or field corn. It's inedible. You can't even eat it.
- **[14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=871s)** — But that's the corn that's in the chips. It's in most of the products. Because of the
- **[14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=876s)** — subsidies, they basically can buy a cubic ton of this corn for $198. Okay. Now think about how
- **[14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=886s)** — many boxes of corn flakes you can make for under 200 bucks. So you have a super cheap
- **[14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=894s)** — food that gives you a lot of pleasure at the expense of no nutrition, very little protein.
- **[15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=901s)** — So it's going to keep you eating it. My problem was the Doritos. I could just start
- **[15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=905s)** — out with the whole bag. I mean, a large bag in one sitting without even thinking twice. So
- **[15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=910s)** — we created this industry and it's created addictions. 40, 50 years later, here we are
- **[15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=918s)** — with the problem. And unfortunately, you as a taxpayer pays for most of the raw material in
- **[15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=924s)** — this junk food unknowingly through the subsidies. And that's something that has to be cleaned up
- **[15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=930s)** — by this new administration. Let's talk about this new administration. But before we go there,
- **[15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=935s)** — just to finish off the first question, somehow a high carbohydrate diet became kind of what we
- **[15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=944s)** — were supposed to do. And so is that just pure lobbying? Or how did that happen?
- **[15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=950s)** — It's pure profit because you have to make profit on things that have no shelf life.
- **[15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=955s)** — I mean, let's just take beef, for example, the margins on beef is like 3%. So why would
- **[16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=961s)** — want to get into the beef business, right? If you look at junk food, if you take a look at
- **[16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=965s)** — just profit, they make about $260 billion a year just on the starches. And an average
- **[16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=972s)** — person consumes about 250 to 300 pounds of starch every single year. Whereas the sugars
- **[16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=977s)** — is like, they might make it's like 10 billion. It doesn't even compare. Yeah,
- **[16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=983s)** — people consume about 150 pounds of sugar a year. But starches are like, that's something
- **[16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=989s)** — people don't talk about. So I think if we are going to make some changes, we have to, first of
- **[16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=994s)** — all, make people aware of these hidden ingredients and start to get them out of your diet.
- **[16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=1001s)** — The other thing I noticed is that if there's these hidden, basically farm subsidies, right,
- **[16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=1008s)** — in the system, if you're going to start taking apart the system, you're actually going
- **[16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=1013s)** — to impact America's farmers. Those farmers, I think played a big role in
- **[16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=1018s)** — getting this administration elected. I think what we should do is reward the small farmer,
- **[17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=1023s)** — because they're being put out of business and support them, and maybe subsidize the farmers
- **[17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=1028s)** — that are doing it right with healthier foods, rather than the large industrial farms that are
- **[17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=1034s)** — just literally producing the lowest quality food you could imagine. What about large farms
- **[17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=1043s)** — that produce higher quality food, because there must be a range? Yeah, there's a total
- **[17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=1047s)** — range. And Cornucopia is a great activist group that I support. And they have a food scoring
- **[17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=1055s)** — system that they'll look at these farms and they talk about who's doing right,
- **[17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=1059s)** — who's not doing it right. Because they find these loopholes and they try to cheat the
- **[17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=1063s)** — system and it's called organic, but is it really organic? So they're really trying to
- **[17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=1067s)** — keep the integrity, at least in the organic sphere. There's going to be a lot more transparency,
- **[17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=1074s)** — because the largest privately owned company in the United States, I won't even say the name,
- **[18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=1082s)** — that's the company that makes most of the starches in the seed oils, and some of the
- **[18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=1088s)** — sugars too. And they're a privately owned company. And so they don't have to disclose
- **[18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=1093s)** — certain things. What is the promise of this new administration for me, in your view?
- **[18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=1099s)** — R.F.K. is a non-politician. He's going to be a really good person to get in there to
- **[18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=1106s)** — cut the umbilical cords between the cozy relationships and the conflict of interest
- **[18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=1112s)** — between industry and the government. Right now, the food guidelines are associated between
- **[18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=1119s)** — who has the strongest lobbyists. And so there's too much influence from industry
- **[18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=1124s)** — in our food system, in our medical system, in the research of drugs. He's going to clean that
- **[18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=1131s)** — up. And of course, they're going to attack him for this. But it's going to be a really
- **[18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=1136s)** — vital change to remove this conflict of interest and have more transparency. So we can actually
- **[19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=1143s)** — focus more on the root causes of health issues, support the smaller farmer and make it
- **[19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=1149s)** — for our generation to be healthy. Because right now, it's getting worse. The food guidelines
- **[19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=1155s)** — is so important because it trickles down into the school system, the hospitals, the assisted
- **[19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=1161s)** — living home. There's an individual I know who has um, he's in Arizona. He owns four assisted
- **[19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=1166s)** — living homes. Okay. And what's really interesting about him is he changes the diet. He doesn't
- **[19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=1173s)** — allow junk food. And these people are coming in from places like hospice and his rate of
- **[19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=1179s)** — reducing medications through the help of their online doctor or their doctor that's on site,
- **[19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=1184s)** — it's like 47%. So you go in there with certain medications and then you're coming out
- **[19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=1188s)** — with almost half of those medications. So he told me this, and this is really fascinating
- **[19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=1194s)** — that the software that he uses to coordinate between the medical doctor and the medications
- **[20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=1200s)** — is owned by a CEO that I told him to contact the CEO. And I want to know on average, what's
- **[20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=1209s)** — the average number of medications that these patients are on? So he did that for me.
- **[20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=1214s)** — And you're not going to believe what he said. He took a hundred people, random people out
- **[20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=1217s)** — of his database. And he works with people all over the United States in these assisted
- **[20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=1221s)** — living homes. And he found a range between 91 medications to 42 medications with an average
- **[20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=1228s)** — of 48 medications. He sent me a document with one patient on 48 medications. Okay. I look
- **[20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=1237s)** — through this. I almost vomited because I'm like, you got to be kidding me. An average person
- **[20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=1243s)** — going to an assisted living homes on 48 medications. I mean, this is like outrageous.
- **[20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=1248s)** — This is insane. So why wouldn't we want someone like Bobby Kennedy to go in there
- **[20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=1253s)** — straighten this up to improve this, to get people to start eating real food all over the place?
- **[21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=1260s)** — I remember thinking that too, in the past, that it's so bizarre that the food you get in
- **[21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=1265s)** — hospitals, you know, isn't really a very high quality. You would think it like nutritionally,
- **[21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=1270s)** — you would, you might want that, right? I lived in Thailand for a couple of years where
- **[21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=1274s)** — medical tourism is a popular thing, except that it's sort of like a five-star hotel
- **[21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=1280s)** — experience, right? That's part of what you pay for is doing whatever the medical procedure you
- **[21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=1285s)** — want. And they just, they feed you really well. And I thought, man, this is very different
- **[21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=1289s)** — from the hospital food I've seen, right? I know. Like I wanted for surgery and
- **[21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=1295s)** — I was like, do you have any protein? No, we have Jell-O crock. So I'm like,
- **[21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=1299s)** — I need protein. Can you, I mean, it's sickening, like especially with before surgery
- **[21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=1304s)** — and after the surgery, like you need actual food. It does seem crazy on the face of it that
- **[21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=1313s)** — there's the average number across 100 random people in, you know, elder care facilities.
- **[22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=1321s)** — An average person would be on 48 medications. That seems astonishingly high. However,
- **[22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=1328s)** — well, you know, presumably they need some of those medications. So you're arguing there's an
- **[22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=1336s)** — over-prescription scenario happening here. I mean, just like the question is,
- **[22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=1343s)** — did you bring up food? Are you using food in your equation when you're diagnosing? How do
- **[22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=1348s)** — you know what is causing what? Are you looking at the side effects from the medications? Maybe
- **[22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=1353s)** — you're just treating the side effects of the medication with another medication, and we go
- **[22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=1356s)** — around and around. When you treat symptoms and not real causes, you don't really improve the
- **[22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=1361s)** — health. So like even your blood sugars, right? You take a medication to lower your blood
- **[22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=1365s)** — sugars. Where do you think that's going? Where do you think that sugar is going? Is it
- **[22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=1369s)** — evaporating? It's you're just changing one problem. You're shifting it to another part of
- **[22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=1374s)** — the body. Especially there's something called iatrogenic disease. I don't know if you've
- **[22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=1378s)** — ever heard of that. That's medication caused disease. That's like number three, as far as
- **[23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=1384s)** — the top leading causes of death is iatrogenic is number three. So the question is, I think,
- **[23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=1392s)** — especially with the antibiotics and steroids and things like that, it should be reevaluated.
- **[23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=1397s)** — The system is unworkable. There are medical doctors, I guess the bottom line is that do
- **[23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=1403s)** — look at causes and not just symptoms. But the default is to look at the symptoms. Is
- **[23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=1409s)** — that a right way to characterize? There's more and more doctors are looking at the whole body,
- **[23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=1416s)** — even endocrinologists that I know that I'm friends with that are looking at the diet,
- **[23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=1420s)** — because there's just a kind of a disconnect. They refer anything related to food to the
- **[23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=1426s)** — dietitian. But then they don't have control of that. So I think the new trend is going
- **[23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=1433s)** — to be looking at the whole body. And so they're not just stuck in this managing the
- **[23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=1438s)** — symptom model. Just like if you take an engineer and an engineer looks at this logically,
- **[24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=1443s)** — like they're going to go, wait, what's wrong with this? No, what's the mechanism? What's
- **[24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=1448s)** — underneath it? Like, do we ever take people off the medication? What's the plan? What's the
- **[24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=1452s)** — long term plan? There's a lot of people that are interested in weight loss right now.
- **[24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=1457s)** — And there's these very popular new drugs, which a lot of people are going on. They're
- **[24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=1461s)** — actually working for people. If someone is interested in weight loss, where should people look first?
- **[24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=1469s)** — Well, I think if we look at just weight loss by itself, there's just one thing you need to know
- **[24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=1473s)** — about how the body stores fat. And that has to do with the hormone insulin. So if you want to
- **[24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=1479s)** — lose weight, you got to keep that insulin low. So there's two ways to do it. One is to lower
- **[24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=1485s)** — your carbohydrates, and that would be the sugars and starches. But the other way too,
- **[24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=1489s)** — is you can also do a different thing, which is to do intermittent fasting, start skipping
- **[24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=1495s)** — breakfast and having two meals and not the snacks. So if you go longer without the snacks,
- **[25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=1501s)** — what you're going to find is you'll go into ketosis, your appetite will go down.
- **[25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=1506s)** — And we're not even talking about lowering calories. We're just talking about not eating
- **[25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=1510s)** — so frequently. You can lose a lot of weight like that because every time you eat, you
- **[25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=1516s)** — raise insulin, regardless of what you eat. So it's very important to know that. And the
- **[25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=1525s)** — takes is a little bit of carbohydrate to bump you out of ketosis for a longer period of time,
- **[25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=1531s)** — like sometimes up to 48 hours. So that half a glass of wine or that toast, you kind of have
- **[25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=1539s)** — to now wait for a day and a half to two days before you get back in the ketosis. So
- **[25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=1545s)** — a lot of people are saying, well, I'm trying it, but it's not working. And then you ask
- **[25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=1549s)** — them what they're doing. They're like, well, yeah, I do have a little bit of something in
- **[25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=1552s)** — the meals. I'm like, okay, so just do intermittent fasting, watch what happens. And it finally works
- **[25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=1557s)** — for them. If you try to do a diet with higher in carbs, it's torture because you're trying to
- **[26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=1562s)** — lose weight with hunger and cravings. I mean, that's hard. You're going to at night, you're
- **[26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=1566s)** — like looking at the cupboard and like, oh my gosh, I need some carbs, right? So
- **[26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=1572s)** — it will make it easier. Yes, it does take discipline. But I think the best thing to do is
- **[26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=1576s)** — don't have it in the house or it can tempt you. I want to touch on a few things which
- **[26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=1581s)** — you, I guess, recommend. I don't know how broadly. But one of the things that we've
- **[26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=1588s)** — discussed before privately is vitamin D. I discovered it really as such an important
- **[26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=1593s)** — thing during the COVID-19 pandemic, where people with higher levels of vitamin D just had
- **[26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=1598s)** — a lot better outcomes on average. Vitamin D is the most important vitamin because it's
- **[26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=1606s)** — involved in 10% of all of our genes. That's like over 2500 genes. Think about how bass that
- **[26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=1615s)** — is, right? Everything from the immune system to the brain to inflammation to your bones. So
- **[27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=1621s)** — it's not just about bones, absorbing calcium for bones. It's about a lot of different things.
- **[27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=1627s)** — The question is, can you get enough vitamin D from the diet? No, you can't. It's impossible.
- **[27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=1631s)** — You can get it from the sun. But think about what happened in the 80s. We or someone had this idea
- **[27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=1638s)** — that we should stay out of the sun because sun causes skin cancer. We became sun phobic.
- **[27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=1644s)** — And even nowadays, it's hard to find even kids outside. What we really need as a maintenance
- **[27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=1649s)** — dosage on a daily basis to maintain all of the systems in the body with just as a
- **[27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=1656s)** — dose is 10,000. I use a vitamin D3. Very few people know that and very few people are doing
- **[27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=1662s)** — that. They're using the outdated information that was only researched about with your bones,
- **[27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=1670s)** — preventing rickets, which is like soft bones in children. And they're not looking at all this
- **[27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=1676s)** — amazing research. And I think because the amount of competition with medications is very
- **[28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=1681s)** — high. Because if you take a look at vitamin D, what it can do for inflammation, what it can do
- **[28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=1686s)** — for autoimmune, what it can do for respiratory infections, what it can do for insulin issues.
- **[28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=1693s)** — It's literally amazing when you dive into the research. I think I have over 280 videos in
- **[28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=1697s)** — vitamin D. So I am like very interested in this topic because it's the lowest hanging fruit
- **[28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=1704s)** — if you want to get someone healthy. Really. It's like if you just give them vitamin D
- **[28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=1708s)** — for so many issues, they can actually improve. It's inexpensive. You could use the sun if it's
- **[28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=1714s)** — summer. But if not, it's not that expensive as a modality, you know, a treatment.
- **[28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=1721s)** — What about turmeric? Okay. So turmeric has this active ingredient called curcumin.
- **[28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=1728s)** — Out of all of the herbal remedies, that one is the most research. It has the most broad
- **[28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=1734s)** — spectrum effects of anything. That is probably on the scale of importance is that's like a really
- **[29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=1741s)** — top herb that can literally do so many things. And I think because it can grow in very
- **[29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=1749s)** — dehydrated environments. And so that plant has adapted for hundreds of thousands of years to
- **[29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=1755s)** — create these amazing defense mechanisms and these properties of survival that we can then
- **[29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=1760s)** — consume and it helps our bodies in many different ways, especially as an anti-inflammatory.
- **[29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=1767s)** — I would highly recommend including that in your diet on a regular basis. You can do it through
- **[29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=1771s)** — curries or the teas. Curiously, in Polish, the word for turmeric is kurkuma. I'm a native
- **[29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=1780s)** — speaker. That's what I keep thinking as you say it. And I might add it's delicious. It's
- **[29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=1791s)** — I'm always the kind of guy that if it's a little as good, a lot of better. No, not with
- **[29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=1796s)** — turmeric. There's definitely a limit and you don't want to get it on your shirt.
- **[30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=1801s)** — Oh, yes. I grew it and then I dried it out and I started to eat it through the day,
- **[30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=1806s)** — like for several days in a row. I was just eating it constantly.
- **[30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=1810s)** — Got sick. You don't need much. Just have a little bit.
- **[30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=1816s)** — You help people with basically fatigue and so forth. You must have a broad approach to
- **[30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=1827s)** — dealing with that. When you take a symptom like fatigue, that can come from a lot of
- **[30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=1833s)** — different things. So the first question I always ask is like, what are you eating?
- **[30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=1837s)** — But as far as nutrients go, there's a really important nutrient that people know about,
- **[30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=1843s)** — but they don't really connect it to fatigue. But if you go into the cells, the energy
- **[30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=1848s)** — factory of the cell, the mitochondria, which is a very important part of the cell,
- **[30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=1853s)** — in order to make energy, the last little part of that requires magnesium. And it's a little
- **[31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=1860s)** — motor that spins. It's an enzyme that spins like 400 times a second. It's like the most
- **[31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=1867s)** — amazing little motor and it's in your body and it's working to make what's called ATP
- **[31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=1871s)** — and it requires magnesium. So yes, magnesium people take for leg cramps and to sleep and
- **[31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=1877s)** — for stress, but energy, you should take a magnesium for energy because if you take
- **[31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=1882s)** — vitamin D, that's the most important. The second one is magnesium. Magnesium is almost
- **[31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=1887s)** — impossible to test because most of the magnesium is inside the tissues. It's not in the blood.
- **[31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=1893s)** — Only 1% of it's in the blood. So you have to have a special test and no one gets that.
- **[31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=1898s)** — It's something that's also very commonly deficient. And the one that I would recommend
- **[31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=1901s)** — is something like a magnesium glycinate because that's the one that won't cause
- **[31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=1906s)** — diarrhea and it gets absorbed 80%. You take it right before bed. And great for muscle stuff,
- **[31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=1914s)** — sleeping. Apparently it's good for sleeping, but then it's also good for energy.
- **[31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=1919s)** — Yeah, right. Well, you know what? It takes energy to sleep, which is interesting.
- **[32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=1922s)** — Some people are too tired to actually rest. So they're laying down, they're restless,
- **[32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=1928s)** — and they just can't get into a relaxed state. What about the super foods? What is the top
- **[32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=1934s)** — super food in your mind? I think this is going to surprise you because when people think
- **[32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=1939s)** — they drink the green drinks, right? But there's a much higher level of super food that has
- **[32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=1947s)** — virtually every nutrient, very bioavailable. And it's actually red meat. Red meat. People
- **[32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=1954s)** — are going to say, Oh my gosh, I thought that was like, it's just like processed meat. No,
- **[32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=1957s)** — I'm talking about grass fed red meat, whether it's beef or it's lamb. I mean, it has so
- **[32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=1963s)** — many nutrients, iron and B12. And plus the protein is the highest quality. It's even
- **[32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=1970s)** — better than eggs because it has better omega-3 ratios. And so it's really a good healing food.
- **[32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=1977s)** — People have gone on to the plant proteins, and they're not going to feel as good. So
- **[33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=1981s)** — it's high quality protein. Most of our body is protein. And that would be something that
- **[33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=1987s)** — a person would notice immediately a difference. Eric, final thought as we finish?
- **[33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=1994s)** — I think my final thought on this would be instead of this huge focus on treating disease
- **[33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=2000s)** — and focusing on getting rid of disease, let's start to focus on creating our health.
- **[33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=2006s)** — It's a different question. It's a different model. Instead of waiting until you get a
- **[33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=2010s)** — disease and treating it, let's prevent that by looking at common, simple things that you can
- **[33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=2017s)** — do to lifestyle changes that involve, at the real essence of it, eating real food. That's the
- **[33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=2024s)** — most important thing you can do. Well, Eric Berg, it's such a pleasure to have had you on.
- **[33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=2028s)** — Thank you so much. I really appreciate it.

- **[00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAT_1LXlJqM&t=0s)** — Let's talk about the best foods to clean out your liver. Or shall we say just make the liver cleaner.
- **[00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAT_1LXlJqM&t=6s)** — Because many of us don't realize that the liver is not like a sponge that holds toxins.
- **[00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAT_1LXlJqM&t=13s)** — It's an organ that detoxifies, it removes toxins, unless you have a fatty liver.
- **[00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAT_1LXlJqM&t=19s)** — So three different problems with the liver. You can have a fatty liver, you can have an inflamed
- **[00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAT_1LXlJqM&t=23s)** — liver or a combination, and then that inflammation creates scar tissue. And then you
- **[00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAT_1LXlJqM&t=28s)** — develop cirrhosis. So the question is like what type of foods could you eat to make the liver
- **[00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAT_1LXlJqM&t=34s)** — healthier and cleaner? Let me just first briefly touch on what the liver does.
- **[00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAT_1LXlJqM&t=40s)** — I'm not going to go through all 500 functions, but it does a lot. It actually turns ammonia
- **[00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAT_1LXlJqM&t=47s)** — into urea. So if there's a problem with the liver, you get this backup of ammonia. And you
- **[00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAT_1LXlJqM&t=52s)** — can even actually smell it on someone's breath. Sometimes when you go to like a nursing home,
- **[00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAT_1LXlJqM&t=57s)** — it smells like ammonia. That is what's happening. Liver damage, it's backing up,
- **[01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAT_1LXlJqM&t=62s)** — it can go into the brain and create a lot of toxicity. So that's one thing it does. It
- **[01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAT_1LXlJqM&t=67s)** — helps detoxify ammonia, which comes from certain protein metabolism breakdown. Then we
- **[01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAT_1LXlJqM&t=72s)** — get the next one, the buffering of hormones. There's certain things in the liver that help
- **[01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAT_1LXlJqM&t=77s)** — buffer hormones. So if they're too much or they're too little, the body will regulate
- **[01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAT_1LXlJqM&t=83s)** — the amount of active form of a certain hormone based on the needs, especially estrogen,
- **[01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAT_1LXlJqM&t=90s)** — cortisol, and even testosterone. So for example, if you have cirrhosis of the liver,
- **[01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAT_1LXlJqM&t=96s)** — you can get a massive buildup of estrogen. And if you're male and you're older and you
- **[01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAT_1LXlJqM&t=102s)** — have cirrhosis of the liver, your skin becomes very, very smooth. You lose body hair,
- **[01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAT_1LXlJqM&t=108s)** — you might get man boobs, creating all sorts of estrogenic effects.
- **[01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAT_1LXlJqM&t=111s)** — Your cortisol can go up, you can be stressed because there's something in your liver that
- **[01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAT_1LXlJqM&t=116s)** — helps buffer cortisol. And because estrogen goes higher, you become lower with testosterone.
- **[02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAT_1LXlJqM&t=122s)** — So there goes your muscles, there goes your get up and go, there goes your libido. Okay,
- **[02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAT_1LXlJqM&t=127s)** — T4, that is the inactive form of the thyroid hormone. Did you realize that 80%
- **[02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAT_1LXlJqM&t=133s)** — of the activation of the thyroid hormone into this active T3 happens through your liver? So
- **[02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAT_1LXlJqM&t=139s)** — from T4 to T3. So we need a healthy liver to make that conversion. If that doesn't happen,
- **[02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAT_1LXlJqM&t=145s)** — you start developing hypothyroidism. Growth hormone, which is the anti-aging hormone,
- **[02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAT_1LXlJqM&t=151s)** — it has everything to do with proteins, building proteins, helping you sleep at night,
- **[02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAT_1LXlJqM&t=157s)** — longevity. That hormone works with the liver as well. And there's kind of like an
- **[02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAT_1LXlJqM&t=162s)** — extension of growth hormone. It's called IGF1, which does similar functions, if not
- **[02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAT_1LXlJqM&t=167s)** — identical functions of the growth hormone. So if there's a problem with the liver,
- **[02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAT_1LXlJqM&t=171s)** — growth hormone doesn't seem to work that well. Then we have vitamin D. Vitamin D is
- **[02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAT_1LXlJqM&t=176s)** — activated by the liver and the kidney. So without a good liver function, you don't get
- **[03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAT_1LXlJqM&t=182s)** — the benefit of the active form of vitamin D. And even when they check the blood, they always
- **[03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAT_1LXlJqM&t=186s)** — check the inactive form. They don't check the active form of vitamin D. They're checking the
- **[03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAT_1LXlJqM&t=192s)** — inactive form, assuming that it's being converted. But what if the liver and the kidneys are
- **[03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAT_1LXlJqM&t=198s)** — damaged? Okay, you're not going to be able to get a true picture of what's going on with
- **[03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAT_1LXlJqM&t=202s)** — vitamin D if you're just measuring the inactive form of vitamin D. But one of the
- **[03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAT_1LXlJqM&t=207s)** — main functions of the liver is to detoxify toxins and poisons to harmless water soluble
- **[03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAT_1LXlJqM&t=213s)** — particles. So whether that's pesticides, insecticides, herbicides, heavy metals,
- **[03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAT_1LXlJqM&t=218s)** — or even toxins from cigarettes or alcohol or processed foods, your body tends to break that
- **[03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAT_1LXlJqM&t=224s)** — down. If this liver function doesn't work, you get a backup of toxicity. There's also a
- **[03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAT_1LXlJqM&t=230s)** — function of producing bile to help you extract the fat soluble nutrients from the food,
- **[03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAT_1LXlJqM&t=235s)** — including omega-3, vitamin A, D, E, and K. So without this, you're going to have all sorts of
- **[04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAT_1LXlJqM&t=241s)** — problems with nutrients and being able to create an anti-inflammatory effect because the
- **[04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAT_1LXlJqM&t=246s)** — omega-3 just can't go into the body, can't work. Next one is glycogen. That's stored glucose in
- **[04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAT_1LXlJqM&t=252s)** — your liver. So the liver holds glycogen to allow you to run off that fuel between meals.
- **[04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAT_1LXlJqM&t=261s)** — And so let's say, for example, your liver is fatty or it's dysfunctional, you have cirrhosis,
- **[04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAT_1LXlJqM&t=265s)** — and you can't run off glycogen between meals. You're going to have issues with your brain
- **[04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAT_1LXlJqM&t=270s)** — because your brain doesn't store glycogen. It depends on the liver glycogen or whatever you
- **[04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAT_1LXlJqM&t=275s)** — eat for its fuel, unless you're on the ketogenic diet, in which you're going to live off the
- **[04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAT_1LXlJqM&t=279s)** — ketones that are going to generate it. But a lot of these ketones are generated from the liver.
- **[04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAT_1LXlJqM&t=284s)** — So again, we're going to have a problem with fuel if the liver is damaged, especially for
- **[04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAT_1LXlJqM&t=289s)** — your brain and other cells. Immune function. Until recently, I did not know of the
- **[04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAT_1LXlJqM&t=298s)** — magnitude of how important the liver is for your immune system. You have specialized immune
- **[05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAT_1LXlJqM&t=303s)** — cells in the liver. You have a lot of different lymphatic sinuses in the liver that help you
- **[05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAT_1LXlJqM&t=309s)** — from all sorts of different angles for the immune system. And so the more we lose the liver
- **[05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAT_1LXlJqM&t=314s)** — function, the more we lose the immune function. There are some really key things you want to
- **[05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAT_1LXlJqM&t=319s)** — avoid first, because you can eat a lot of healthy foods. But if you're eating these at
- **[05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAT_1LXlJqM&t=324s)** — the same time, the liver is just not going to work that well. And I'm not going to get into
- **[05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAT_1LXlJqM&t=329s)** — the obvious stuff like alcohol, like regular sugar, things like that. I want to get into
- **[05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAT_1LXlJqM&t=334s)** — some hidden things that you need to be aware of. Number one, soy protein isolates. Okay,
- **[05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAT_1LXlJqM&t=339s)** — that's in a lot of different foods. Now, if you do research on this, probably the first five
- **[05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAT_1LXlJqM&t=343s)** — pages in Google, you'll see that it's all healthy for the liver. It's totally fine. I
- **[05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAT_1LXlJqM&t=347s)** — don't buy that because I've had people when I was in practice come in and be on a certain
- **[05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAT_1LXlJqM&t=353s)** — diet for a bit of time. And in that diet, it was a weight loss diet. And one of the diets was
- **[05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAT_1LXlJqM&t=359s)** — called ideal protein. There's many others, but there are a lot of weight loss programs that have
- **[06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAT_1LXlJqM&t=363s)** — this as their main protein. It's low fat, highly refined protein in soy. And the way they
- **[06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAT_1LXlJqM&t=371s)** — process it, there's nothing that's going to resemble the actual soybean itself. So anyway,
- **[06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAT_1LXlJqM&t=376s)** — here's what I've noticed after someone being on this diet, being exposed to soy protein
- **[06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAT_1LXlJqM&t=381s)** — isolates for a period of time, I noticed that a common denominator is their liver. They have a
- **[06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAT_1LXlJqM&t=387s)** — lot of liver issues, like gallbladder issues, right lower abdomen heaviness and pain. And some
- **[06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAT_1LXlJqM&t=395s)** — people had to go to the doctor and have their gallbladders removed. So I can't buy
- **[06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAT_1LXlJqM&t=400s)** — that something that process can be good for the liver because the liver thrives on things
- **[06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAT_1LXlJqM&t=406s)** — like whole foods, not refined foods. So I would read the ingredients and avoid soy protein
- **[06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAT_1LXlJqM&t=413s)** — isolates. Soy protein meal might be good for animals, especially if they take out the fats
- **[06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAT_1LXlJqM&t=419s)** — out of it so it doesn't turn rancid. But for humans, I don't think it's the best protein.
- **[07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAT_1LXlJqM&t=423s)** — The next thing is seed oils, highly processed and is processed with hexane,
- **[07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAT_1LXlJqM&t=428s)** — which is a solvent. But that exposure of this highly refined fat, omega-6 fatty acid.
- **[07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAT_1LXlJqM&t=436s)** — Yes, we have oxidative stress, we have inflammation, but I think also it's replacing
- **[07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAT_1LXlJqM&t=440s)** — ourselves. It's going deep into the tissue. It's not a natural thing, but we consume so much
- **[07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAT_1LXlJqM&t=446s)** — of it. All right, the next food I would definitely avoid. And you probably already
- **[07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAT_1LXlJqM&t=450s)** — know this high fructose corn syrup. But what you probably didn't know, they're not starting
- **[07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAT_1LXlJqM&t=454s)** — out making this high fructose corn syrup with this sweet corn that people eat during
- **[07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAT_1LXlJqM&t=459s)** — the summer, right? They don't start out with that. They use what's called dent corn or field
- **[07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAT_1LXlJqM&t=464s)** — corn. It's completely inedible. I don't care how much butter you put on that corn or you
- **[07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAT_1LXlJqM&t=471s)** — add salt. It's disgusting. And the majority of corn grown is this field corn to fatten cattle,
- **[07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAT_1LXlJqM&t=478s)** — right? To make the meat marbly. What is it doing to us? And they also use it for
- **[08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAT_1LXlJqM&t=484s)** — high fructose corn syrup and glucose syrup and the modified starches. And so they start
- **[08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAT_1LXlJqM&t=492s)** — with this inedible corn, okay, and they go through probably like 18 different steps. I don't
- **[08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAT_1LXlJqM&t=498s)** — even know the exact number, but it's a lot of different steps. And they're taking the protein
- **[08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAT_1LXlJqM&t=502s)** — out and they're breaking it down with enzymes and acids. And then they add this chemical
- **[08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAT_1LXlJqM&t=506s)** — to it and that chemical and they use high heats. At the end of this chain of event,
- **[08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAT_1LXlJqM&t=510s)** — you get something that does not resemble anything related to corn. And we're putting
- **[08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAT_1LXlJqM&t=515s)** — this in our body. And it's been in the food supply since I think 1977, when farmers were
- **[08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAT_1LXlJqM&t=522s)** — paid or subsidized because of the corn. But the problem, it's so heavy in this
- **[08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAT_1LXlJqM&t=526s)** — alter processed foods, aka junk foods and flavored and sweetened in a way that makes it
- **[08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAT_1LXlJqM&t=535s)** — taste somewhat good, but highly addictive. And high fructose corn syrup has some very
- **[08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAT_1LXlJqM&t=539s)** — unique properties in that the majority of it is processed by the liver. Okay, not all,
- **[09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAT_1LXlJqM&t=543s)** — but the majority. So the liver takes the beating. It creates inflammation. It leads to
- **[09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAT_1LXlJqM&t=549s)** — insulin resistance. It leads to problems with your blood fats and cholesterol. It leads to
- **[09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAT_1LXlJqM&t=555s)** — problems with the fatty liver. It stimulates more hunger. The high fructose corn syrup is
- **[09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAT_1LXlJqM&t=560s)** — very, very different than the fructose from fruit. And it's just ultra refined. Okay, so
- **[09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAT_1LXlJqM&t=566s)** — that's one I would definitely stay away from. Then we get to refined starches. I'm talking
- **[09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAT_1LXlJqM&t=570s)** — about maltodextrin. I'm talking about modified food starch. And like, for example, like in
- **[09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAT_1LXlJqM&t=577s)** — this food right here, we have corn starch, corn syrup, dextrose, all made out of corn. Okay,
- **[09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAT_1LXlJqM&t=585s)** — so that's what this is made out of. So you're feeding kids and some adults, I don't even call
- **[09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAT_1LXlJqM&t=591s)** — it food, because it doesn't fit the definition of food. Food is something that gives you fuel
- **[09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAT_1LXlJqM&t=595s)** — and help nourish the body. Well, this fuel will not give you energy. It'll make you so
- **[10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAT_1LXlJqM&t=600s)** — tired. And the only nutrients in there are the synthetics that they spray in there,
- **[10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAT_1LXlJqM&t=605s)** — but they're all made from, you know, chemicals and things like that. And then we get glucose
- **[10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAT_1LXlJqM&t=609s)** — syrup itself. Now, what's interesting, there's no sugar in here from sugar cane. Okay,
- **[10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAT_1LXlJqM&t=616s)** — we replace sugar cane, which even I think growing up back in the early 70s, we use a lot of
- **[10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAT_1LXlJqM&t=623s)** — sugar cane and a lot of sodas and things like that. That's all been replaced with this
- **[10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAT_1LXlJqM&t=627s)** — synthetic or highly synthesized sugar, which I think behaves a lot differently than even
- **[10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAT_1LXlJqM&t=634s)** — sugar cane. And so it's all day coincidence, right, with this ultra processed food, which is
- **[10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAT_1LXlJqM&t=639s)** — mainly highly refined corn and other starch products with the GMO on top of that. And if
- **[10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAT_1LXlJqM&t=646s)** — you look at liver function, I think ultra processed foods, which what I just described
- **[10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAT_1LXlJqM&t=650s)** — is probably at the very top of the list as far as destroying your liver. So the question is,
- **[10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAT_1LXlJqM&t=655s)** — what can you eat to keep liver healthy? Okay, you want to eat whole foods. Let's first talk
- **[11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAT_1LXlJqM&t=660s)** — about fats. Okay, some of the best fats would be like olive oil. Okay, but also a different
- **[11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAT_1LXlJqM&t=667s)** — type of fat called medium chain triglycerides, MCT oil type fats, and that would be in butter.
- **[11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAT_1LXlJqM&t=674s)** — So you'd want to cook with butter, put butter in your food, but make sure it's from grass fed,
- **[11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAT_1LXlJqM&t=679s)** — you know, cow milk. But the MCT fats, the medium chain triglycerides are very different
- **[11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAT_1LXlJqM&t=685s)** — because they don't require bile. So they're less stressful on the liver when you consume them.
- **[11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAT_1LXlJqM&t=693s)** — I also found some research that these MCT oils or fats help protect against a fatty liver.
- **[11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAT_1LXlJqM&t=700s)** — You want to make sure you cook with it. And then on your salad, you put olive oil,
- **[11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAT_1LXlJqM&t=703s)** — extra virgin, high quality olive oil. Don't use the seed oils. Make your own salad dressing.
- **[11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAT_1LXlJqM&t=709s)** — Very important if you want to help your liver. Number two, fish. Okay, wild caught fish,
- **[11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAT_1LXlJqM&t=715s)** — preferably high in omega-3 fatty acids, because omega-3 fatty acids are anti-inflammatory.
- **[12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAT_1LXlJqM&t=721s)** — They're liver protective. They help balance the cholesterol issues. All right, number three,
- **[12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAT_1LXlJqM&t=727s)** — organic pasture raised eggs, not commercial eggs. But egg yolks have probably the highest
- **[12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAT_1LXlJqM&t=733s)** — amount of choline of any food that I know. I'm not sure about liver. Liver might have
- **[12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAT_1LXlJqM&t=738s)** — more choline, but egg yolks have a lot of choline. Choline is great for a fatty liver.
- **[12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAT_1LXlJqM&t=743s)** — If you're deficient in choline, you can end up with a fatty liver. But choline helps remove fat
- **[12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAT_1LXlJqM&t=748s)** — off your liver. Not to mention the high quality protein in eggs, as well as all the other
- **[12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAT_1LXlJqM&t=754s)** — nutrients. The next food on the list is a general category of dark leafy green vegetables,
- **[12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAT_1LXlJqM&t=758s)** — or just leafy green vegetables. Why? Because of the vitamin C, because of the folate,
- **[12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAT_1LXlJqM&t=765s)** — which is very important to the liver, because of the magnesium, the potassium,
- **[12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAT_1LXlJqM&t=772s)** — and the phytonutrients. There are so many great properties, antioxidant, anti-inflammatory
- **[12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAT_1LXlJqM&t=777s)** — properties that are really good for the liver. Now, the only time I wouldn't recommend them,
- **[13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAT_1LXlJqM&t=781s)** — if you had some type of inflammatory gut issue, which you can't deal with the fiber. But for
- **[13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAT_1LXlJqM&t=786s)** — everyone else, I would recommend that. Number five is a type of vegetable. It's a category
- **[13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAT_1LXlJqM&t=790s)** — of vegetables. It's cruciferous. Out of all the cruciferous, radish is probably the
- **[13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAT_1LXlJqM&t=795s)** — best thing for the liver. Unfortunately, I just can't eat radishes. I don't like them.
- **[13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAT_1LXlJqM&t=798s)** — I know my wife likes them. She just can eat them like candy. I can't consume them. But
- **[13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAT_1LXlJqM&t=803s)** — if I did like them, I would eat a lot of them. Radishes have this higher sulfur compound
- **[13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAT_1LXlJqM&t=808s)** — that is really good for the phase one, phase two detoxification. So we talked about this
- **[13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAT_1LXlJqM&t=815s)** — poison turning into water soluble things. Well, this enzyme complex takes this poison from
- **[13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAT_1LXlJqM&t=823s)** — very toxic and starts to break it down. And when you consume cruciferous vegetables and other
- **[13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAT_1LXlJqM&t=830s)** — herbs, there are certain things in them that activate our own phase one, phase two detoxifying
- **[13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAT_1LXlJqM&t=838s)** — enzymes, as well as give us enzymes to help break down these chemicals. So this is why
- **[14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAT_1LXlJqM&t=845s)** — we recommend cruciferous. So radishes are good. Second favorite is arugula. It's a little
- **[14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAT_1LXlJqM&t=850s)** — bitter. Anything bitter is good for the liver. And of course, we get brussels sprouts,
- **[14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAT_1LXlJqM&t=855s)** — cabbage, really good for the lower bowel, which support the liver as well. There's this whole
- **[14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAT_1LXlJqM&t=863s)** — connection between your bowel or your friendly bacteria and your liver. If one goes down,
- **[14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAT_1LXlJqM&t=868s)** — the other one goes down. So cabbage is good for anything inflamed in your gut and even in
- **[14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAT_1LXlJqM&t=874s)** — the liver. There's other cruciferous vegetables, but those are the four that I like the most.
- **[14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAT_1LXlJqM&t=878s)** — Number six category, probiotic foods. I just mentioned this, the friendly flora greatly
- **[14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAT_1LXlJqM&t=884s)** — supports the liver. If you were exposed to an antibiotic or something to destroy your good
- **[14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAT_1LXlJqM&t=891s)** — flora, the liver suffers. If you're exposed to something like aspartame or some other synthetic
- **[14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAT_1LXlJqM&t=897s)** — artificial sweetener, that alters the gut microbiome, which then raises liver enzymes
- **[15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAT_1LXlJqM&t=905s)** — and puts you at risk for a fatty liver. So the three top foods for that that I like,
- **[15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAT_1LXlJqM&t=909s)** — sauerkraut, make sure you get it raw, kimchi, same thing. And then we have kefir, make sure
- **[15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAT_1LXlJqM&t=915s)** — that it's organic kefir, unsweetened. If you can get goat kefir or sheep kefir, that's even
- **[15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAT_1LXlJqM&t=920s)** — better. Kefir is better than yogurt because it has strains of friendly yeast and friendly
- **[15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAT_1LXlJqM&t=925s)** — bacteria. It has a lot more than just the yogurt. And the last category is grass-fed meat
- **[15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAT_1LXlJqM&t=930s)** — in different forms. You can do lamb, you can do goat, you can do beef, deer meat. I would just
- **[15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAT_1LXlJqM&t=937s)** — make sure that it's grass-fed, grass-finished. That would be the ideal situation if you can. If
- **[15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAT_1LXlJqM&t=942s)** — you can't, well, then get what you can. But I will tell you from personal experience, when I
- **[15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAT_1LXlJqM&t=946s)** — consume high quality meat, my liver feels great. It feels good compared to me eating
- **[15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAT_1LXlJqM&t=955s)** — peanut butter or nuts or seeds. I have some experience with liver problems. I destroyed my
- **[16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAT_1LXlJqM&t=962s)** — liver from eating ultra processed foods and a lot of bad foods for many years. In fact,
- **[16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAT_1LXlJqM&t=966s)** — there was one year I remember I consumed every night margaritas, just every single night,
- **[16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAT_1LXlJqM&t=973s)** — and they were sweetened. And at first it was great, right? But then towards the end of the
- **[16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAT_1LXlJqM&t=977s)** — year, boy, my health started going down, down, down, down. And of course, then I
- **[16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAT_1LXlJqM&t=985s)** — went to a sugar coma to help myself sleep. And to perceive both of these actions,
- **[16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAT_1LXlJqM&t=990s)** — I lived on junk food for years, never ate anything raw or healthy. Everything was refined,
- **[16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAT_1LXlJqM&t=996s)** — lots of pasta, lots of bread, lots of refined carbohydrates, lots of cereal,
- **[16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAT_1LXlJqM&t=1002s)** — and a lot of Doritos and chips. Until I eventually started noticing a heavy,
- **[16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAT_1LXlJqM&t=1007s)** — full feeling underneath my right rib cage that little did I know it was my gallbladder,
- **[16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAT_1LXlJqM&t=1012s)** — which is connected to the liver. And then it started referring pain to my right shoulder,
- **[16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAT_1LXlJqM&t=1017s)** — which I've had this pain for years, like at least 12 to 15 years. I didn't know what it
- **[17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAT_1LXlJqM&t=1023s)** — was at the time. And of course, I had a lot of bloating and indigestion and I didn't connect
- **[17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAT_1LXlJqM&t=1028s)** — the dots. And it wasn't until I started getting rid of these grains and getting rid of the
- **[17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAT_1LXlJqM&t=1032s)** — cereal and replacing it with meat that I started nursing relief. And so I started
- **[17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAT_1LXlJqM&t=1038s)** — noticing, wow, that that sensation is going away. So it actually helped my blood sugar,
- **[17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAT_1LXlJqM&t=1044s)** — it helped my brain fog, but it took the inflammation away from my liver. Sometimes you
- **[17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAT_1LXlJqM&t=1049s)** — hear that meat is bad for you, but they're not differentiating grass fed grass finished
- **[17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAT_1LXlJqM&t=1055s)** — beef and processed meat. They put them all in one big category with junk food. Now let's
- **[17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAT_1LXlJqM&t=1061s)** — compare that with the fake meat products, right? You have soy protein isolates, you have
- **[17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAT_1LXlJqM&t=1067s)** — modified food starch, you have potato starch in there, maybe pea protein, maybe rice syrup,
- **[17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAT_1LXlJqM&t=1075s)** — solids, things like that. I mean, think about when you eat that, what you're going to feel
- **[17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAT_1LXlJqM&t=1078s)** — like. I was at Whole Foods a long time ago and I was at the deli and I was really hungry.
- **[18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAT_1LXlJqM&t=1084s)** — So I said, wow, those those chicken wings look pretty darn good, right? So I bought some
- **[18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAT_1LXlJqM&t=1089s)** — chicken wings. They looked all the same size and shape, but I didn't question it. I just
- **[18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAT_1LXlJqM&t=1094s)** — said, oh, okay, so there must be just some chicken meat, you know, that's maybe formed into one.
- **[18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAT_1LXlJqM&t=1100s)** — Little did I know that was the soy protein isolate fake meat with probably the textured
- **[18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAT_1LXlJqM&t=1105s)** — vegetable protein, whatever. Anyway, I was eating it on the way home. I thought, wow,
- **[18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAT_1LXlJqM&t=1110s)** — this is just tastes pretty good until I got home. And then I got really, really sick,
- **[18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAT_1LXlJqM&t=1117s)** — bloated. My eyes started feeling irritated. Not good. And there's two last supplements. I think
- **[18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAT_1LXlJqM&t=1124s)** — I'm going to recommend just if you have like cirrhosis of the liver, because the problem
- **[18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAT_1LXlJqM&t=1128s)** — with cirrhosis is that a lot of times people are on the liver transplant list and there's a
- **[18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAT_1LXlJqM&t=1134s)** — long waiting list. But why don't we just maybe try to revive the liver and to try to
- **[19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAT_1LXlJqM&t=1140s)** — reverse this damage if we can in the meantime. So tokatrinols, it's a type of vitamin E,
- **[19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAT_1LXlJqM&t=1146s)** — really good for everything liver. The next thing is called tutka. Tutka is a type of bile salt
- **[19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAT_1LXlJqM&t=1152s)** — that really keeps the liver healthy and keeps the sludge from building up in the liver.
- **[19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAT_1LXlJqM&t=1158s)** — And you'll feel much better if you take that. I would take two in the morning,
- **[19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAT_1LXlJqM&t=1162s)** — okay, empty stomach, take two in the afternoon, empty stomach. I'm not going to recommend any
- **[19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAT_1LXlJqM&t=1168s)** — brands. You just have to just search that out and look at various products and their reviews to
- **[19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAT_1LXlJqM&t=1174s)** — see if you could find a good one. So those are the two supplements. Now, if you have not seen
- **[19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAT_1LXlJqM&t=1178s)** — my video on how to diagnose your liver by using your foot, it sounds kind of funny,
- **[19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAT_1LXlJqM&t=1184s)** — but it's really interesting information. I put that video up right here. Check it out.

- **[00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Be7ndkw5aQ&t=0s)** — Kidney stones can be devastating. I mean, severe pain. So for those of you that
- **[00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Be7ndkw5aQ&t=7s)** — had a kidney stone or are interested in preventing a kidney stone, this video is for you. I've talked
- **[00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Be7ndkw5aQ&t=12s)** — a lot about kidney stones, but I have not emphasized this one really important factor
- **[00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Be7ndkw5aQ&t=18s)** — based on a recent study that I just read, which is actually very fascinating. And it's
- **[00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Be7ndkw5aQ&t=24s)** — including a very simple thing to your water. And that is called apple cider vinegar. Mostly
- **[00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Be7ndkw5aQ&t=30s)** — apple cider vinegar is acetic acid. And so the question is how does acetic acid influence or
- **[00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Be7ndkw5aQ&t=37s)** — help you dissolve a stone? Okay. Now, when we're dealing with kidney stones, we're dealing with
- **[00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Be7ndkw5aQ&t=43s)** — mainly what's called calcium oxalate stones. Okay. But there's other stones too. You can
- **[00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Be7ndkw5aQ&t=49s)** — have a uric acid stone. You can have stones made from other things, but mostly it's calcium
- **[00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Be7ndkw5aQ&t=54s)** — oxalates. So I've done videos in oxalates. Oxalates are in a lot of different foods,
- **[00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Be7ndkw5aQ&t=59s)** — especially in the ketogenic diet. They're high in almonds. They're high in spinach and
- **[01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Be7ndkw5aQ&t=65s)** — chocolate and kiwis. And then you have another factor of calcium in the urine, which can be
- **[01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Be7ndkw5aQ&t=71s)** — genetic weakness, genetic mutation, or quite a few people who have kidney stones and, or
- **[01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Be7ndkw5aQ&t=79s)** — a tendency to get osteoporosis. They may have a genetic problem with their gene that they just
- **[01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Be7ndkw5aQ&t=86s)** — are releasing a lot of calcium in the urine. So typically the scenario of kidney stone,
- **[01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Be7ndkw5aQ&t=92s)** — you have high oxalates, you have a high calcium, and you also have low citrates. Okay. Citrates.
- **[01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Be7ndkw5aQ&t=101s)** — Now you might think citrus like lemons and limes, things like that. And you're correct,
- **[01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Be7ndkw5aQ&t=107s)** — but your body also makes citrates. Okay. And the great majority of the time, if you have
- **[01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Be7ndkw5aQ&t=112s)** — a kidney stone, low citrates are part of the problem because one of the things that citrates do
- **[01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Be7ndkw5aQ&t=119s)** — is they can act as a chelator with this calcium and bind to the calcium,
- **[02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Be7ndkw5aQ&t=125s)** — lessening the amount of free calcium to bind with the oxalates. So that's one of the things
- **[02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Be7ndkw5aQ&t=131s)** — that citrates do. But citrates are involved in industry cleaning agents because it can
- **[02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Be7ndkw5aQ&t=138s)** — actually get rid of rust off of steel. It's used to help get rid of calcium carbonate.
- **[02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Be7ndkw5aQ&t=144s)** — So it's a chelator. It can bind with another mineral. And you may have taken biology and
- **[02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Be7ndkw5aQ&t=150s)** — learned about what's called the Krebs cycle, which is this biochemical pathway to help you
- **[02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Be7ndkw5aQ&t=155s)** — make energy or ATP. Another name for that is called a citric acid cycle. So citrate or citric
- **[02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Be7ndkw5aQ&t=162s)** — acid is very important in ensuring that you don't get kidney stones. So yes, you can start
- **[02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Be7ndkw5aQ&t=171s)** — to consume more lemons or limes. And that's what I recommend in the morning when you drink
- **[02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Be7ndkw5aQ&t=176s)** — your water. And I usually drink a pretty big glass. It's probably, I don't know,
- **[03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Be7ndkw5aQ&t=181s)** — maybe 20 ounces, something like that. And I'll fill it up with water and I'll put lemon
- **[03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Be7ndkw5aQ&t=186s)** — juice just because kidney stones do run in my family. And the other thing is just having
- **[03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Be7ndkw5aQ&t=190s)** — more fluid, right? If you have more fluid, you can dilute the urine because when you get
- **[03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Be7ndkw5aQ&t=197s)** — a kidney stone, you have what's called a super saturated situation. So too concentrated. But if
- **[03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Be7ndkw5aQ&t=204s)** — you're drinking at least 2.5 liters of water or other fluids, you can prevent the formation
- **[03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Be7ndkw5aQ&t=209s)** — of kidney stone. And you can also add the lemon juice in there. I mean, if you have
- **[03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Be7ndkw5aQ&t=214s)** — kidney stones or developing a stone, I mean, you should be consuming like a lot of lemon juice.
- **[03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Be7ndkw5aQ&t=219s)** — I would say maybe, I don't know, four to six ounces a day. And that can be either from
- **[03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Be7ndkw5aQ&t=226s)** — actual lemons or lemon juice. But if you're just preventing it, you can just do a little
- **[03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Be7ndkw5aQ&t=232s)** — bit of lemon, like the lemon juice from one lemon, or you can do like a tablespoon of lemon
- **[03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Be7ndkw5aQ&t=237s)** — juice. You also want to add the apple cider vinegar in there because from a genetic level,
- **[04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Be7ndkw5aQ&t=243s)** — actually it's an epigenetic action, which is above your genes. And I'm mainly talking about
- **[04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Be7ndkw5aQ&t=249s)** — the genetic problem with this calcium situation in your urine. You have too much calcium in
- **[04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Be7ndkw5aQ&t=254s)** — your urine. You can control that and curb that by adding apple cider vinegar. Because what that's
- **[04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Be7ndkw5aQ&t=261s)** — going to do, it's going to cause the reabsorption, the significant reabsorption of
- **[04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Be7ndkw5aQ&t=267s)** — citrates. So you won't lose them. You'll keep way more citrates in your urine, preventing
- **[04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Be7ndkw5aQ&t=275s)** — the formation of the oxalates to the calcium. Now, there is also other things you can do,
- **[04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Be7ndkw5aQ&t=281s)** — you can add some additional citrates from either potassium citrate or magnesium citrate,
- **[04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Be7ndkw5aQ&t=288s)** — which can be found in various electrolyte powders, and then drink one or two or even three of
- **[04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Be7ndkw5aQ&t=294s)** — those a day. And you just may find out you no longer have a kidney stone. Now, apple cider
- **[05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Be7ndkw5aQ&t=301s)** — vinegar has so many purposes. If you haven't seen my recent apple cider vinegar video and
- **[05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Be7ndkw5aQ&t=305s)** — how it can greatly boost your energy, I put that video up right here. Check it out.

- **[00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGXbg7FKpvg&t=0s)** — There's a really good indicator or clue for predicting heart attacks. Okay? And it's just
- **[00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGXbg7FKpvg&t=7s)** — looking at your earlobe. Yeah, a little crease in the bottom of your earlobe starting from where the
- **[00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGXbg7FKpvg&t=13s)** — hole is coming out 45 degrees as you see in this image right here. Go to the mirror right now.
- **[00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGXbg7FKpvg&t=20s)** — Take a look to see if you have this. Pause the video. Come back. I'm going to tell you
- **[00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGXbg7FKpvg&t=25s)** — what this is all about and what to do if you have it. Alright, you're back. Okay, what is going on
- **[00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGXbg7FKpvg&t=31s)** — with this earlobe and what do you mean the crease on the ear? What happens when you have coronary
- **[00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGXbg7FKpvg&t=36s)** — artery disease or another name for that is cardiovascular disease is you lose blood flow
- **[00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGXbg7FKpvg&t=43s)** — usually through an artery to the heart muscle and this affects your entire body circulation.
- **[00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGXbg7FKpvg&t=50s)** — You start losing collateral circulation. What is collateral circulation? Well, if your heart becomes
- **[00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGXbg7FKpvg&t=58s)** — obstructed in some way, you get collateral or extra circulation or extra arteries that start
- **[01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGXbg7FKpvg&t=64s)** — to branch out and serve as a plan B blood supply to the heart muscle. Those are collateral
- **[01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGXbg7FKpvg&t=70s)** — arteries. So, what happens when you get this chronic lack of blood flow to your heart? Okay,
- **[01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGXbg7FKpvg&t=75s)** — start losing circulation in the peripheral part of your body first. The earlobe is part of the
- **[01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGXbg7FKpvg&t=83s)** — periphery and without this blood supply to the tiny capillaries in your earlobes, you start
- **[01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGXbg7FKpvg&t=88s)** — losing elastin, connective tissue, cartilage, and it starts to wrinkle up. This little crease
- **[01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGXbg7FKpvg&t=97s)** — shows up in about 71% of everyone with coronary artery disease. But it's also
- **[01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGXbg7FKpvg&t=103s)** — found in other conditions like diabetes, high blood pressure. It's found in smokers,
- **[01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGXbg7FKpvg&t=109s)** — but it's most commonly found with people with heart problems. Now, since heart attacks are
- **[01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGXbg7FKpvg&t=114s)** — the number one cause of death, you should know this indicator not just for yourself,
- **[02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGXbg7FKpvg&t=120s)** — but for other people too. Because if you see this, you can let the person know they need
- **[02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGXbg7FKpvg&t=125s)** — to go get it checked out and they need to do something ASAP. Now, why the urgency? Well,
- **[02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGXbg7FKpvg&t=130s)** — first symptom of a heart attack over 50% of the time is death. So there is no symptoms or
- **[02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGXbg7FKpvg&t=139s)** — warning signs. You just drop dead. So you want to pay attention and you want to use this clue
- **[02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGXbg7FKpvg&t=143s)** — as a prediction of what could happen. And also you should realize that this is not just
- **[02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGXbg7FKpvg&t=148s)** — happening in your earlobe. It's happening throughout the entire body. The arteries can
- **[02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGXbg7FKpvg&t=153s)** — become thicker. You can have a lot of oxidative stress and a loss of a lot of
- **[02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGXbg7FKpvg&t=158s)** — collateral circulation in your body. So very simply, there's four things you need to do
- **[02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGXbg7FKpvg&t=163s)** — immediately. Number one, you need to go on the healthy version of the ketogenic diet
- **[02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGXbg7FKpvg&t=168s)** — with intermittent fasting. There's just no options. You need to start that. It's going
- **[02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGXbg7FKpvg&t=172s)** — to help you tremendously. Number two, you want to start a regular routine exercise program.
- **[02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGXbg7FKpvg&t=179s)** — That's going to flood the body with a lot more oxygen, including the heart,
- **[03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGXbg7FKpvg&t=183s)** — and you want to be consistent. And you pretty much want to keep this in
- **[03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGXbg7FKpvg&t=187s)** — for the rest of your life. The next thing I would recommend is something that's very,
- **[03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGXbg7FKpvg&t=190s)** — very important for the inside of your arteries and the heart muscle. And it's a type of
- **[03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGXbg7FKpvg&t=197s)** — vitamin E called tocotrinols. Tocotrinols is like 50 times stronger than tocopherols.
- **[03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGXbg7FKpvg&t=204s)** — So when you buy tocotrinols, you don't want to get tocotrinols mixed with tocopherols.
- **[03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGXbg7FKpvg&t=211s)** — You want to get just a pure tocotrinol mix or tocotrinol complex. That is going to drive
- **[03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGXbg7FKpvg&t=219s)** — oxygen to the heart muscle itself. And it's also going to protect the inside of the
- **[03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGXbg7FKpvg&t=224s)** — vascular system. It's one of the most potent antioxidants that you can get,
- **[03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGXbg7FKpvg&t=229s)** — and it's especially good for the heart. It's also good for the liver as well.
- **[03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGXbg7FKpvg&t=232s)** — It can actually slow down the progression of the fatty liver.
- **[03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGXbg7FKpvg&t=236s)** — All right, the next thing is to start to increase the omega-3 fatty acids. And the best omega-3
- **[04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGXbg7FKpvg&t=242s)** — is the cod liver oil. It's better than fish oils because not only does cod liver oil have
- **[04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGXbg7FKpvg&t=248s)** — the omega-3 fatty acids, but it also has vitamin A and vitamin D, which are also
- **[04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGXbg7FKpvg&t=253s)** — important in many different things, including heart health. And the last thing I'm going
- **[04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGXbg7FKpvg&t=258s)** — to recommend is to make sure you take something called vitamin K2. That keeps the
- **[04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGXbg7FKpvg&t=264s)** — calcium from building up in the arteries. And you want to take vitamin K2 with vitamin D3.
- **[04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGXbg7FKpvg&t=270s)** — So I just wanted to create this quick video to give you something really simple to use
- **[04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGXbg7FKpvg&t=275s)** — as a predictor. Now, if you have not seen my recent video that I just released on the worst
- **[04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGXbg7FKpvg&t=282s)** — food for the cardiovascular system, and by the way, it's not sugar, okay? There's something
- **[04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGXbg7FKpvg&t=289s)** — If you haven't seen that video, I put it up right here. Check it out.

- **[00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuZabnJ45r0&t=0s)** — So today we're going to talk about something called Fecal Microbiota Transplantation.
- **[00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuZabnJ45r0&t=6s)** — Now, why would anyone give a crap about this topic? I'm sorry, I had to do that. But this
- **[00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuZabnJ45r0&t=11s)** — fecal transplantation is becoming mainstream in medicine. It's highly effective for the infection
- **[00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuZabnJ45r0&t=17s)** — called C. diff. It can greatly help irritable bowel diseases. It's been found to be superior
- **[00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuZabnJ45r0&t=23s)** — antibiotics. There's been great results with autism, MS, rheumatoid arthritis, decreasing risks
- **[00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuZabnJ45r0&t=32s)** — of cancer, Parkinson's, chronic fatigue syndrome, acne, and even depression. However, I have some
- **[00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuZabnJ45r0&t=38s)** — basic questions about this therapy. How long does it really last? I mean, if you go back to your
- **[00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuZabnJ45r0&t=45s)** — usual eating habits, do you maintain this microbiome or does it become altered or affected
- **[00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuZabnJ45r0&t=51s)** — by your lifestyle? I mean, what people really should be doing is find out what the fecal
- **[00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuZabnJ45r0&t=57s)** — donor is eating and eat like that person. But this fecal transplant has been around for a
- **[01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuZabnJ45r0&t=64s)** — very, very long time. I'm talking like 2000 years. The Chinese actually used it as a therapy
- **[01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuZabnJ45r0&t=70s)** — for many different things. But there's some really important points to this topic. The
- **[01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuZabnJ45r0&t=74s)** — fact that it works so well for so many different conditions. I mean, the connection
- **[01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuZabnJ45r0&t=79s)** — between our microbes and both the innate and the acquired immune system, the importance in
- **[01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuZabnJ45r0&t=85s)** — brain health, the importance of digesting things that we can't digest like fiber,
- **[01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuZabnJ45r0&t=92s)** — the importance of these secondary bile salts made by microbes, and the importance of bile
- **[01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuZabnJ45r0&t=99s)** — in general. Also for our skin and autoimmune diseases, nearly every single autoimmune disease
- **[01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuZabnJ45r0&t=105s)** — starts in your gut. And if there was a much better friendly relationship with these microbes,
- **[01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuZabnJ45r0&t=110s)** — chances are you probably wouldn't get an autoimmune problem. I mean, there are certain
- **[01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuZabnJ45r0&t=115s)** — bacteria that help reduce the risk for kidney stones because these microbes help to
- **[02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuZabnJ45r0&t=120s)** — deal with oxalates. There's microbes that deal with uric acid to help reduce the risk of
- **[02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuZabnJ45r0&t=126s)** — gout. There are microbes that produce compounds that are anti-cancer. And really, we just need
- **[02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuZabnJ45r0&t=131s)** — change our overall viewpoint with these bacteria or microbes in general. We've been attacking
- **[02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuZabnJ45r0&t=138s)** — the germ as it's the sole cause of infection, but we're finding out more and more that that's
- **[02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuZabnJ45r0&t=144s)** — not the cause of infection. It's our immune system. It's the environment. And the more
- **[02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuZabnJ45r0&t=149s)** — that we sterilize our environments, our food, our gut, the more we're going to need this
- **[02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuZabnJ45r0&t=154s)** — therapy. So let's talk about what not to do and what to do. Okay. You want to limit
- **[02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuZabnJ45r0&t=158s)** — your exposure to drugs, chemicals, pesticides, herbicides, especially the one in GMO foods called
- **[02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuZabnJ45r0&t=167s)** — glyphosate, which has been patented as an antibiotic. We want to limit the exposure to
- **[02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuZabnJ45r0&t=173s)** — antibiotics and consuming animals that have been given antibiotics. We really want to
- **[02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuZabnJ45r0&t=179s)** — start avoiding foods that have been sterilized. You pasteurize all these foods like
- **[03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuZabnJ45r0&t=185s)** — milk products, the canned products like soups, the juices. We even use radiation to sterilize
- **[03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuZabnJ45r0&t=191s)** — our foods, which is crazy. Instead, you should have a good portion of your diet raw. Okay. I'm
- **[03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuZabnJ45r0&t=197s)** — talking about raw vegetables. I'm not talking about raw chicken. Okay. But maybe you can have
- **[03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuZabnJ45r0&t=203s)** — like beef. That's rare. That would be better. But the more you cook the food with more of
- **[03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuZabnJ45r0&t=207s)** — the pasteurized things, the more you kill off good bacteria. Now what's so special about
- **[03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuZabnJ45r0&t=211s)** — plants? Yes, they give us the fiber that the microbes will live on. But I don't know if you
- **[03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuZabnJ45r0&t=218s)** — knew this, but plants are filled with microbes. That's right. You're consuming microbes when you're
- **[03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuZabnJ45r0&t=225s)** — eating a raw plant. Of course, it really depends on where that plant is grown. If it's grown
- **[03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuZabnJ45r0&t=230s)** — maybe aeroponically or something like that, it probably doesn't have as many microbes. But if
- **[03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuZabnJ45r0&t=235s)** — it's grown on really good soils, chances are it's going to be filled with microbes and that
- **[03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuZabnJ45r0&t=239s)** — actually help you. One video I did talked about a really interesting topic on how plants really get
- **[04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuZabnJ45r0&t=249s)** — their nutrition. And they get to nutrition by eating bacteria. That's right. The majority of
- **[04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuZabnJ45r0&t=256s)** — nutrition that a plant gets is by eating bacteria. So the roots eat the microbe and then
- **[04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuZabnJ45r0&t=263s)** — extract the nutrients from it and then spit the microbe back out. And it starts to recycle.
- **[04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuZabnJ45r0&t=268s)** — A lot of these microbes travel up to the stem and to the leaf where they help that plant.
- **[04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuZabnJ45r0&t=275s)** — And so this opens up a whole new area to look at in growing food and in farming. And I'm
- **[04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuZabnJ45r0&t=283s)** — actually setting up several experiments on this topic very soon. And I'm going to share that
- **[04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuZabnJ45r0&t=288s)** — on a new YouTube channel. So stay tuned for more information about that. I found two labs
- **[04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuZabnJ45r0&t=293s)** — that can help identify the microbes in plants. And so we're going to do all sorts of tests.
- **[04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuZabnJ45r0&t=299s)** — Now these plants also have certain phytonutrients that go beyond just acting as a
- **[05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuZabnJ45r0&t=307s)** — prebiotic. They can actually help balance the bad bacteria. For example, sulforaphane
- **[05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuZabnJ45r0&t=313s)** — and broccoli sprouts and other cruciferous vegetables can help inhibit and destroy
- **[05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuZabnJ45r0&t=320s)** — H. pylori. That microbe that's behind ulcers, gastritis, and even certain types of gourd. You
- **[05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuZabnJ45r0&t=330s)** — get a lot of cool effects from eating plants. Certain flavonoids are antimicrobial. Cursitin
- **[05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuZabnJ45r0&t=336s)** — has been shown to inhibit E. coli. And another pigment found in plants called antho xanthin
- **[05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuZabnJ45r0&t=343s)** — has been known to inhibit salmonella. Now I know some people are going to say,
- **[05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuZabnJ45r0&t=346s)** — wait a second. I thought that plants were filled with anti-nutrients and we shouldn't be eating
- **[05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuZabnJ45r0&t=350s)** — plants. We should all be doing carnivore. Well, if you have certain digestive problems where you
- **[05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuZabnJ45r0&t=356s)** — can't digest plant food, well then maybe you should. But I'm not recommending that you eat
- **[06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuZabnJ45r0&t=361s)** — all plants. Just a portion of your diet. And probably the biggest anti-nutrient that
- **[06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuZabnJ45r0&t=366s)** — can affect people is oxalates. But that's really easy to solve if you just avoid the
- **[06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuZabnJ45r0&t=373s)** — are high in oxalates. Like you'd want to avoid the spinach, the beet green, the Swiss chard.
- **[06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuZabnJ45r0&t=379s)** — Also avoid nuts, kiwi, and of course potato. And if you're on the ketogenic diet, you don't
- **[06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuZabnJ45r0&t=385s)** — have to worry about that. Chocolate is another thing that is very high in oxalates that you
- **[06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuZabnJ45r0&t=389s)** — should avoid. And of course, beans and grains are just loaded with oxalates. And especially
- **[06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuZabnJ45r0&t=395s)** — quinoa, which is supposed to be like a healthy grain. So the point is that just because
- **[06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuZabnJ45r0&t=400s)** — plants have anti-nutrients doesn't mean we should just completely avoid all of them.
- **[06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuZabnJ45r0&t=404s)** — If you have gastritis, for example, I found cabbage, which also is pretty high in
- **[06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuZabnJ45r0&t=411s)** — sulforaphane, can be good for that condition. In fact, it's probably one of the only
- **[06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuZabnJ45r0&t=415s)** — vegetables that I found that you could actually digest without discomfort. So to increase
- **[07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuZabnJ45r0&t=420s)** — the diversity of your microbes in your gut, you want to increase a wide range of plant
- **[07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuZabnJ45r0&t=426s)** — of course, not the ones I just mentioned, instead of just having like one type of vegetable
- **[07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuZabnJ45r0&t=432s)** — all the time. You also want to eat fermented products, pickles and sauerkraut and kimchi,
- **[07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuZabnJ45r0&t=438s)** — which are all microbial enhanced. You can also do raw milk cheese or kefir, which are loaded
- **[07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuZabnJ45r0&t=445s)** — with microbes. Another way to increase the diversity of microbes is to try to reduce your
- **[07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuZabnJ45r0&t=452s)** — stress as much as possible because stress actually really affects the microbes in the gut, which is
- **[07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuZabnJ45r0&t=457s)** — interesting. Fasting, okay, regular intermittent fasting and periodic prolonged fasting also
- **[07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuZabnJ45r0&t=465s)** — increases the diversity and the health of your gut. And exercise can even help the microbiome.
- **[07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuZabnJ45r0&t=473s)** — So it's all about creating an environment where these microbes can thrive. When you
- **[07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuZabnJ45r0&t=479s)** — environment and you stress it out, as in someone taking an antibiotic, boy, you create all sorts
- **[08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuZabnJ45r0&t=486s)** — of, shall I say, like a shift of relationship with those microbes. So before they were
- **[08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuZabnJ45r0&t=491s)** — friendly, now they're unfriendly. And this happens in the soil as well. If you, for
- **[08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuZabnJ45r0&t=497s)** — example, start killing off certain things in the soil, sometimes you'll have an increase in
- **[08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuZabnJ45r0&t=503s)** — fungus, right? And see, in nature, fungus actually, as one of their foods, they eat bacteria.
- **[08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuZabnJ45r0&t=511s)** — And if there's not enough food for them, they start going after the plant and start creating
- **[08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuZabnJ45r0&t=517s)** — plant infections because their environment is not good. There's just not enough food. Well,
- **[08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuZabnJ45r0&t=523s)** — the exact same thing happens in our guts as well. When you take an antibiotic, you pretty
- **[08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuZabnJ45r0&t=528s)** — much stress the fungus. And I'm talking about candida. And then that starts to affect you.
- **[08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuZabnJ45r0&t=533s)** — It starts creating an unfriendly relationship where it negatively affects you. Whereas before,
- **[08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuZabnJ45r0&t=539s)** — it's like a symbiotic relationship that doesn't affect you. We normally have candida in our
- **[09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuZabnJ45r0&t=545s)** — system and candida normally doesn't affect us until we change that relationship by changing
- **[09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuZabnJ45r0&t=551s)** — the environment. If you are female and you're going to have a baby, I would highly recommend
- **[09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuZabnJ45r0&t=557s)** — that you breastfeed because the first breast milk is called colostrum. And in that colostrum,
- **[09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuZabnJ45r0&t=563s)** — you have the mother's immunity. You're giving that baby friendly bacteria that's going to
- **[09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuZabnJ45r0&t=569s)** — go in the digestive system and start to seed it. And the same principle occurs with plants.
- **[09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuZabnJ45r0&t=577s)** — A seed is not just something that has genetics that grow into a plant. A seed is really
- **[09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuZabnJ45r0&t=583s)** — like Noah's Ark. It's filled with all sorts of microbes inside and outside. And if you
- **[09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuZabnJ45r0&t=590s)** — really understand that concept, that could change your method of handling seeds and how
- **[09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuZabnJ45r0&t=595s)** — maybe you should inoculate the seed and add some microbes to the seed to help it to grow
- **[10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuZabnJ45r0&t=600s)** — better. A lot of people should be taking probiotics on a regular basis, especially if
- **[10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuZabnJ45r0&t=604s)** — they take antibiotics at the same time. So I've covered a lot of different areas of this
- **[10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuZabnJ45r0&t=609s)** — but I think it's a really important topic to have it sink into your brain. And there's a
- **[10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuZabnJ45r0&t=614s)** — lot more to talk about with the digestive system. There's a really important video
- **[10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuZabnJ45r0&t=618s)** — that I did that I'm going to put up right here. And if you haven't seen it, you should check
- **[10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuZabnJ45r0&t=622s)** — it out.

- **[00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HzMD8v8DFA&t=10s)** — that basically generates 280 million dollars a year. It doesn't really even work and it's super
- **[00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HzMD8v8DFA&t=16s)** — dangerous. Let's dive in. Number one, ear candling. There are people out there who believe that
- **[00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HzMD8v8DFA&t=21s)** — when you light one end of this candle, it actually heats up your ear wax and it creates
- **[00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HzMD8v8DFA&t=25s)** — a suction effect to pull that wax out of your ear canal and pull it into the candle. I even tried
- **[00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HzMD8v8DFA&t=31s)** — ear candles a long ago when I was in practice and I got my wife to do it, I got my parents to do it,
- **[00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HzMD8v8DFA&t=36s)** — I got some patients to do it. Because if you look at the pictures, it looks like it really
- **[00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HzMD8v8DFA&t=40s)** — works. You're sucking this wax out of your ear because combining the heat of the candle
- **[00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HzMD8v8DFA&t=44s)** — and as it burns down, it creates a vacuum and sucks all this wax out and you can actually
- **[00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HzMD8v8DFA&t=49s)** — see it. But are you really looking at the wax out of your ear? I watched a great video
- **[00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HzMD8v8DFA&t=54s)** — by a doctor of audiology who performed an experiment to look inside the ear before and
- **[00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HzMD8v8DFA&t=58s)** — after using these ear candles and he found there's absolutely no difference before and after
- **[01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HzMD8v8DFA&t=63s)** — the treatment of removing wax from your ear. So apparently that wax is the wax from the candle.
- **[01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HzMD8v8DFA&t=68s)** — You might want to save your money on that one. Number two, this one is a gallbladder flush.
- **[01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HzMD8v8DFA&t=73s)** — I did this one too and it almost killed me. What you're doing is you're going to drink
- **[01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HzMD8v8DFA&t=77s)** — 12 ounces of olive oil. Then you're going to chase it down with these beat tablets. I made
- **[01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HzMD8v8DFA&t=83s)** — a big mistake of washing down the beat tablets with the olive oil and the beat tablets solidified
- **[01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HzMD8v8DFA&t=92s)** — in my esophagus. I almost stopped breathing. I literally got really really scared. I do not
- **[01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HzMD8v8DFA&t=98s)** — recommend this. You'll see these videos that they'll show in the toilet. These huge gallstones.
- **[01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HzMD8v8DFA&t=104s)** — Here's the thing. They're all floating. Gallstones don't float. They sink. What these
- **[01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HzMD8v8DFA&t=113s)** — purge. Now you're going to be deficient in bile especially if you're trying to digest fats.
- **[01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HzMD8v8DFA&t=117s)** — I highly recommend you don't try to purge your gallbladder. A much better way of dissolving
- **[02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HzMD8v8DFA&t=123s)** — or preventing gallstones or preventing that sludge which is the formation of a gallstone
- **[02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HzMD8v8DFA&t=129s)** — is to actually take more bile. A good bile to take to help dissolve it is something called
- **[02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HzMD8v8DFA&t=134s)** — Tudka. Take Tudka on an empty stomach. Take two in the morning, two in the afternoon.
- **[02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HzMD8v8DFA&t=138s)** — That opens up and gets things to drain. But if you want to add more to help dissolve a gallstone,
- **[02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HzMD8v8DFA&t=143s)** — you want to start taking bile salts after the meal to help prevent the formation of stones and
- **[02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HzMD8v8DFA&t=149s)** — then keep the sludge from turning into a gallstone. I do not recommend purging or
- **[02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HzMD8v8DFA&t=153s)** — flushing gallstones by drinking a tremendous amount of olive oil. Number three. The master
- **[02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HzMD8v8DFA&t=158s)** — cleanse. Where you're combining lemon juice, cayenne pepper, and maple syrup. And yes,
- **[02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HzMD8v8DFA&t=164s)** — long ago, having this idea that I'm going to cleanse and purge all these toxins in my liver,
- **[02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HzMD8v8DFA&t=169s)** — that's not the best way to cleanse. It's a great way to create a lot of blood sugar issues
- **[02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HzMD8v8DFA&t=174s)** — because if you're doing this cleanse for three days, like I did it, I ate nothing,
- **[02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HzMD8v8DFA&t=178s)** — I drank nothing but a gallon of this mixture every single day. The sugar in the maple syrup
- **[03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HzMD8v8DFA&t=184s)** — kept me from converting into ketosis and kept me in the sugar burning mode where my blood
- **[03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HzMD8v8DFA&t=189s)** — sugar was up and down, up and down. I was like craving sugar throughout the day for three days.
- **[03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HzMD8v8DFA&t=196s)** — A much better way to do a cleanse would be to just eat healthy foods, especially maybe
- **[03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HzMD8v8DFA&t=200s)** — cruciferous foods to provide the enzymes for the liver to slowly detoxify chemicals
- **[03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HzMD8v8DFA&t=206s)** — throughout the body. Number four. Those foot detox pads. This is a waste of money. It's
- **[03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HzMD8v8DFA&t=211s)** — like $20. You buy these pads. I bought them. You put them on your feet in the hopes of
- **[03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HzMD8v8DFA&t=216s)** — pulling out poisons and heavy metals because if you wear them for a period of time and you take
- **[03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HzMD8v8DFA&t=221s)** — them off, they'll be black. Right? So that's toxins, right? No, it's some type of chemical
- **[03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HzMD8v8DFA&t=226s)** — reaction. You can just pour water on them and then watch them turn black. They're not pulling
- **[03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HzMD8v8DFA&t=231s)** — toxins out of your body. There's no detox pathways in your skin. You sweat through your
- **[03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HzMD8v8DFA&t=236s)** — skin, but sweating is not necessarily a detoxification. It's going to release excess
- **[04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HzMD8v8DFA&t=241s)** — sodium and also water. So you can actually cool the body down because it's kind of creating
- **[04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HzMD8v8DFA&t=246s)** — refrigeration action externally on your skin to get rid of excess heat. When these pads have
- **[04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HzMD8v8DFA&t=251s)** — certain herbs or certain things on them, it is not creating a magnet for metals. And that
- **[04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HzMD8v8DFA&t=256s)** — leads us to number five. The foot detox bath. Go to a clinic. You put your feet in these
- **[04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HzMD8v8DFA&t=261s)** — things and it has a certain electrode in there that then generates some current in the
- **[04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HzMD8v8DFA&t=266s)** — water. And then all of a sudden the water solution becomes like this brown toxic material.
- **[04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HzMD8v8DFA&t=272s)** — It's pulling all these heavy metals out, all this toxic waste from your kidneys and your liver.
- **[04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HzMD8v8DFA&t=277s)** — So you could become very clean, right? Wrong. That's not what's happening. It's not pulling
- **[04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HzMD8v8DFA&t=282s)** — any toxins out. You can actually create the same color in this bath without putting your
- **[04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HzMD8v8DFA&t=287s)** — feet in it. What's happening when you're adding the salt in there, it's interacting
- **[04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HzMD8v8DFA&t=290s)** — with the electrodes to create rust. It's a chemical reaction that has nothing to do with
- **[04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HzMD8v8DFA&t=296s)** — coming out of your body. My wife and I were in the Dominican Republic and we did a vacation
- **[05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HzMD8v8DFA&t=302s)** — and they had this little place where you can put your feet into these tiny little minnows
- **[05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HzMD8v8DFA&t=307s)** — that will eat the dead skin cells off of your feet. So your feet are really smooth after...
- **[05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HzMD8v8DFA&t=312s)** — My wife and I did this and it tickled when they were eating or nibbling on our feet,
- **[05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HzMD8v8DFA&t=317s)** — but I will say it did not make our feet really nice and smooth. I guess you'd have
- **[05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HzMD8v8DFA&t=321s)** — to probably put some piranhas in there to do that because these little minnows just
- **[05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HzMD8v8DFA&t=325s)** — didn't create an impact on our feet. Number six, the ab belts. There's two different versions.
- **[05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HzMD8v8DFA&t=329s)** — You have the belt that causes more sweating in your midsection and then you have the belt that
- **[05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HzMD8v8DFA&t=336s)** — creates this electric stimulation like it has like a tens unit where it's creating this
- **[05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HzMD8v8DFA&t=340s)** — contraction on your stomach muscles because of course wouldn't it be great to not have to
- **[05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HzMD8v8DFA&t=345s)** — exercise and you can just wear this belt all day and then at the end of the day you
- **[05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HzMD8v8DFA&t=348s)** — pop it off and you have these six-pack abs. Sorry, this one also is not going to work.
- **[05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HzMD8v8DFA&t=354s)** — Creating stimulation on your stomach muscles or even sweating is not going to remove any
- **[05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HzMD8v8DFA&t=359s)** — fat from your midsection. And creating the stimulation without you doing the work
- **[06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HzMD8v8DFA&t=363s)** — is not going to help you with your midsection. I'm sorry to tell you that.
- **[06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HzMD8v8DFA&t=367s)** — Most of that internal fat called visceral fat has to be removed through diet and there are
- **[06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HzMD8v8DFA&t=373s)** — also various toning things that you can do to tighten some of the fascia around your
- **[06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HzMD8v8DFA&t=377s)** — midsection. You're going to have to actually do something. Number seven, the blood type diets.
- **[06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HzMD8v8DFA&t=383s)** — I bought the book. Initially it sounded like there is some special technology
- **[06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HzMD8v8DFA&t=387s)** — that potentially could work. When you pull a string at the back of the book and search
- **[06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HzMD8v8DFA&t=392s)** — where this research goes, it doesn't go anywhere. I can't find any credible research
- **[06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HzMD8v8DFA&t=397s)** — on this at all. And that's because yes we have different blood types but these different
- **[06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HzMD8v8DFA&t=402s)** — blood types relate to more of an immune difference than a digestive food difference.
- **[06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HzMD8v8DFA&t=409s)** — If you are type O, the theory is your body thrives on animal proteins and low carbs.
- **[06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HzMD8v8DFA&t=414s)** — Type A states you should enjoy a vegetarian diet with limited red meat and dairy.
- **[06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HzMD8v8DFA&t=419s)** — The reason why it does work for certain people is because all of the recommendations
- **[07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HzMD8v8DFA&t=424s)** — for foods are whole foods. You're eliminating all the junk foods regardless of what type of
- **[07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HzMD8v8DFA&t=430s)** — specific diet you're doing based on the blood type. If you just go from refined foods
- **[07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HzMD8v8DFA&t=434s)** — to whole foods, you're going to feel better. You're going to do better. Number eight, EMF
- **[07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HzMD8v8DFA&t=439s)** — blockers. The stuff that comes out of this cell phone right here. And so when you have an EMF
- **[07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HzMD8v8DFA&t=443s)** — blocker, you're putting this little sticker on the back of your phone and that's supposed to
- **[07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HzMD8v8DFA&t=448s)** — block all the EMF waves. I just want to tell you right now, you can save your money. Don't
- **[07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HzMD8v8DFA&t=453s)** — buy into that. Because I talked to someone that really knows about this, a physicist,
- **[07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HzMD8v8DFA&t=457s)** — and he was just laughing about it because a little sticker on your cell phone is not going
- **[07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HzMD8v8DFA&t=462s)** — to block all the EMF radiation or nullify it or kind of suck it into the area. That's not
- **[07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HzMD8v8DFA&t=467s)** — how it works. Now you could put a layer of metal or tin foil along there and block it,
- **[07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HzMD8v8DFA&t=474s)** — but then you're not going to get transmission. Number nine, carb blockers. Have you ever seen
- **[07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HzMD8v8DFA&t=479s)** — those? Three in one carb blocker. That way you can continue to eat your pasta and your bread
- **[08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HzMD8v8DFA&t=484s)** — and lose weight. If you look at the ingredient, it has a certain extract from
- **[08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HzMD8v8DFA&t=489s)** — beans that does inhibit to a certain degree, starches, not sugar, only to a very tiny degree.
- **[08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HzMD8v8DFA&t=499s)** — Maybe if you're lucky, it would take a very small percentage, maybe
- **[08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HzMD8v8DFA&t=503s)** — 2% of that, the starch in the donut, and it may slow down the enzymes to break it down.
- **[08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HzMD8v8DFA&t=510s)** — Thinking that, oh, it's just going to now pass right through me, right?
- **[08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HzMD8v8DFA&t=514s)** — Now what's going to happen to that 2% of that starch, it's going to go down into the small
- **[08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HzMD8v8DFA&t=519s)** — intestine. If your enzymes don't break it down, your microbes will, then you're going to get
- **[08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HzMD8v8DFA&t=523s)** — bloating. Then you might say, well, why don't I just take more of that enzyme? Yeah,
- **[08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HzMD8v8DFA&t=528s)** — you could do that. Maybe you could consume nine bottles of the carb blocker to digest
- **[08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HzMD8v8DFA&t=534s)** — the starch in the donut, not the sugar, not the seed oils, but the starch. Maybe that
- **[08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HzMD8v8DFA&t=539s)** — might want to do an experiment. Be very expensive experiment. And how much pleasure are you going
- **[09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HzMD8v8DFA&t=544s)** — to get from eating that one donut if you're blocking just the starch of that donut? Probably
- **[09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HzMD8v8DFA&t=550s)** — not going to be worth it. Now we get to the big one, psychiatric medication. It treats the
- **[09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HzMD8v8DFA&t=555s)** — symptom of a theory. Depression is a chemical imbalance of a deficiency of serotonin. But
- **[09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HzMD8v8DFA&t=564s)** — that's been recently debunked. This whole time, psychiatrists were prescribing all these
- **[09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HzMD8v8DFA&t=568s)** — medications for this theory that wasn't even true. The very limited effectiveness of psychiatric
- **[09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HzMD8v8DFA&t=574s)** — drugs actually compares with placebo outcomes. Many of the studies that indicate any effectiveness
- **[09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HzMD8v8DFA&t=582s)** — from psych drugs is owed to the placebo effect. Then people might say, well, okay, so what if
- **[09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HzMD8v8DFA&t=588s)** — it's placebo? If it makes people think it's working, and it works for them, great, right?
- **[09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HzMD8v8DFA&t=593s)** — If it didn't account for the serious side effects emotionally, where you even become
- **[09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HzMD8v8DFA&t=597s)** — more depressed or have all sorts of problems with even feeling emotion in general. That's
- **[10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HzMD8v8DFA&t=604s)** — one of the big side effects is you just feel like a zombie. I mean, are we supposed to get on
- **[10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HzMD8v8DFA&t=608s)** — this medication and be on it forever or take it for a period of time until it corrects
- **[10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HzMD8v8DFA&t=613s)** — something? No, you keep taking it. It's highly addictive within two weeks. And now you're
- **[10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HzMD8v8DFA&t=618s)** — dependent on that. And the whole time the psychiatrist does not evaluate your foods, just
- **[10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HzMD8v8DFA&t=622s)** — giving you a pill for a symptom. And it's hilarious because all the things that the
- **[10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HzMD8v8DFA&t=627s)** — psychiatrist is against is any alternative to medicine. But the worst psychiatric treatment,
- **[10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HzMD8v8DFA&t=632s)** — even worse, I think, than drugs is the ECT, electro convulsive therapy, if you want to
- **[10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HzMD8v8DFA&t=639s)** — call it a therapy. Some doctors even claim that it's safe and effective. They don't even know
- **[10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HzMD8v8DFA&t=645s)** — why it might give some temporary improvement in depression. And they also downplay the
- **[10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HzMD8v8DFA&t=650s)** — long-term effects and also how many of these problems and side effects come back.
- **[10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HzMD8v8DFA&t=655s)** — And unfortunately, ECT is even administered to certain people that did not give their consent.
- **[11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HzMD8v8DFA&t=661s)** — Sometimes they even give it to people in hospice. Like, why would you want to give
- **[11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HzMD8v8DFA&t=665s)** — someone in hospice ECT? From my viewpoint, that's probably the most dubious treatment that you
- **[11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HzMD8v8DFA&t=670s)** — could possibly do. Especially if we're comparing that treatment to something like
- **[11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HzMD8v8DFA&t=673s)** — ear candles. Yet in the news or even online, you don't really see a lot of the dangers
- **[11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HzMD8v8DFA&t=678s)** — being promoted with ECT because there's too much money involved. Anyway,
- **[11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HzMD8v8DFA&t=681s)** — I appreciate you watching. I will see you in the next video.

- **[00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxdaLKfFD80&t=0s)** — Warning! Do not try this at home. I'm talking about the experiment between sugar and what sugar does to
- **[00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxdaLKfFD80&t=6s)** — vitamin B1. And the average person in the U.S. is definitely doing this experiment unknowingly.
- **[00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxdaLKfFD80&t=12s)** — And so today we're going to talk about what this experiment is in relationship to what high levels
- **[00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxdaLKfFD80&t=18s)** — of carbohydrates do to certain nutrients, specifically vitamin B1, and all the consequences
- **[00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxdaLKfFD80&t=24s)** — that occur from that. And of course the sugar I'm talking about at the top of the list
- **[00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxdaLKfFD80&t=27s)** — is the refined sugars. But not only that, there's hidden sugars like starches. A starch is really
- **[00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxdaLKfFD80&t=33s)** — sugar if you're consuming the starch that is in most foods in the U.S. So it's a combination of
- **[00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxdaLKfFD80&t=39s)** — those starches and sugars that will deplete your B1 and create all sorts of symptoms that
- **[00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxdaLKfFD80&t=43s)** — you might think are connected to something else, but they're merely a vitamin B1 deficiency.
- **[00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxdaLKfFD80&t=50s)** — But let me just touch on my personal story with sugar and B1. Growing up I lived on a
- **[00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxdaLKfFD80&t=55s)** — sugar. But further along my 20s I met my future wife. We ended up at a restaurant
- **[00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxdaLKfFD80&t=59s)** — and we both consumed a tremendous amount of pasta, pizza, wine, and one of the waiters was
- **[01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxdaLKfFD80&t=67s)** — going past us with a dessert tray. And he said this, before I throw these out,
- **[01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxdaLKfFD80&t=72s)** — do you want to sample any of these desserts? I was raised, you never want to waste food.
- **[01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxdaLKfFD80&t=76s)** — So of course we sampled every single dessert. Now as I drove home that night I had this
- **[01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxdaLKfFD80&t=81s)** — I think I ate too much sugar. I put my head on the pillow and what do I hear?
- **[01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxdaLKfFD80&t=86s)** — Pounding in my inner ear. Just my heart is just pounding like crazy. But you would think I would
- **[01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxdaLKfFD80&t=91s)** — learn from that situation. No, I continued to consume pasta, breads, cereals, crackers
- **[01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxdaLKfFD80&t=98s)** — for several years later. And then of course I had a sleeping problem at that point. So what
- **[01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxdaLKfFD80&t=102s)** — did I do? I created a sugar coma to sleep every night. I had a pint of Ben and Jerry's
- **[01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxdaLKfFD80&t=108s)** — before I went to sleep. Now that worked to at least get me to sleep but I woke up
- **[01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxdaLKfFD80&t=113s)** — completely with fluid retention. Which by the way is a B1 deficiency. But what happens when you
- **[01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxdaLKfFD80&t=118s)** — eat that much sugar without the B1, you get too much lactic acid. And that developed something
- **[02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxdaLKfFD80&t=123s)** — called Russ's leg syndrome. As time went on my health started going down, down, down, down,
- **[02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxdaLKfFD80&t=127s)** — down to the point where I had pre-diabetes. The inside of my eyelids were completely
- **[02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxdaLKfFD80&t=132s)** — like sandpaper. Bloodshot. I didn't know what that was. Obviously I finally figured things out
- **[02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxdaLKfFD80&t=138s)** — and here I am today and I don't have a B1 deficiency anymore. But at that time I was in
- **[02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxdaLKfFD80&t=144s)** — an experiment just like I think a lot of people are in the same experiment right now. An average
- **[02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxdaLKfFD80&t=149s)** — person's diet is well over 50 to 60 to even 70 percent refined carbohydrates. But I want to
- **[02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxdaLKfFD80&t=155s)** — kind of hone in on this B1. B1 is a fascinating vitamin and a lot of the complications that
- **[02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxdaLKfFD80&t=163s)** — from all sorts of diseases, especially type 1 and type 2 diabetes, is a lot with just the
- **[02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxdaLKfFD80&t=169s)** — B1 deficiency. B1 has everything to do with supporting a healthy nervous system. Also
- **[02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxdaLKfFD80&t=175s)** — everything to support the fuel to be turned into energy. But I want to kind of hone in
- **[03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxdaLKfFD80&t=181s)** — on this B1 deficiency. So one of the first symptoms is nervous tension, irritability,
- **[03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxdaLKfFD80&t=187s)** — restlessness, brain fog, and also something called air hunger where it affects your breathing.
- **[03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxdaLKfFD80&t=192s)** — You're going to start getting numbness on the bottom of your feet or the fingertips. You might
- **[03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxdaLKfFD80&t=196s)** — have tremors with the hands. You might be very confused. Also your pulse rate might be low,
- **[03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxdaLKfFD80&t=202s)** — but then when you actually do just a little bit of something it goes way too high. Personality
- **[03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxdaLKfFD80&t=206s)** — changes. They have very low tolerance to stress. You see this a lot with alcoholics. Well
- **[03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxdaLKfFD80&t=211s)** — that's because the alcohol really depletes B1 probably more than sugar does. Loss of
- **[03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxdaLKfFD80&t=216s)** — manual dexterity. The coordination is off. Headaches, insomnia, constipation. Other than
- **[03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxdaLKfFD80&t=222s)** — you're going to be perfectly fine. Nothing to worry about. Some people will say, well when I
- **[03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxdaLKfFD80&t=226s)** — eat my junk food it's enriched with B vitamins. Let's just talk about natural versus synthetic
- **[03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxdaLKfFD80&t=231s)** — B1. Unfortunately the top one of days are synthetically made. And the name for the
- **[03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxdaLKfFD80&t=237s)** — synthetic version would be thiamine mononitrate. Extremely cheap. You can buy a
- **[04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxdaLKfFD80&t=242s)** — kilogram of this stuff for roughly 30 bucks. So when you see a bottle of 100 pills and
- **[04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxdaLKfFD80&t=248s)** — each one has a hundred milligrams of B1 and it only costs five dollars and fifty cents. You have
- **[04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxdaLKfFD80&t=253s)** — to realize you're still making a massive profit. The bottle is more expensive than the material.
- **[04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxdaLKfFD80&t=258s)** — Whereas natural B1 is more expensive because you have to use natural sources. One natural
- **[04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxdaLKfFD80&t=264s)** — version that I like is called alethamine. It's very different than the synthetic version. It's
- **[04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxdaLKfFD80&t=269s)** — actually a fat soluble and so it can penetrate a lot of different tissues. Whereas the water
- **[04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxdaLKfFD80&t=275s)** — is not able to penetrate through some of these fat soluble membranes. The synthetic version is
- **[04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxdaLKfFD80&t=281s)** — dependent on something called active transport when it gets absorbed. Which means there's a certain
- **[04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxdaLKfFD80&t=286s)** — protein that allows it to go into the body. Number one it gets saturated pretty quick so
- **[04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxdaLKfFD80&t=290s)** — only a certain amount goes into your body. Also if you have gut problems. Because I'm
- **[04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxdaLKfFD80&t=296s)** — talking about the absorption in the small intestine. Anything going on with the GI system
- **[04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxdaLKfFD80&t=299s)** — or inflammation you're going to have a hard time absorbing the synthetic version of B1.
- **[05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxdaLKfFD80&t=303s)** — Whereas the natural B1 doesn't need active transport. It can go right in. So you can get
- **[05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxdaLKfFD80&t=309s)** — a lot of it with just small doses. One thing I like about the natural version. It can penetrate
- **[05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxdaLKfFD80&t=314s)** — the blood brain barrier. When you're taking the synthetic version and you're also consuming
- **[05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxdaLKfFD80&t=320s)** — carbs, alcohol, chances are you're not going to get very much absorption. When I talked about
- **[05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxdaLKfFD80&t=325s)** — B1 helping you make energy. It's this natural version of B1 that really can help the
- **[05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxdaLKfFD80&t=332s)** — mitochondria produce more energy. Another question that people want to know is what about
- **[05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxdaLKfFD80&t=336s)** — Benfotamine? Benfotamine is good for something called advanced glycation and products. Now what
- **[05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxdaLKfFD80&t=343s)** — does that mean? Well that's a situation when you're consuming sugar and carbohydrates at the
- **[05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxdaLKfFD80&t=348s)** — same time. And the sugar connects to the protein and makes the protein unavailable. So
- **[05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxdaLKfFD80&t=354s)** — it basically makes a lot of sticky proteins that clog everything up in your body. So if you're
- **[05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxdaLKfFD80&t=358s)** — diabetic, go with the Benfotamine. The other thing you should really know is in order for
- **[06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxdaLKfFD80&t=364s)** — B1 to work, you need to have coenzymes and the big one is magnesium. Like I said before,
- **[06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxdaLKfFD80&t=369s)** — when you consume too much carbohydrate and you don't then compensate by taking more B vitamins,
- **[06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxdaLKfFD80&t=375s)** — that fuel is not going to be utilized. Of course over time, all that sugar without the B1
- **[06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxdaLKfFD80&t=381s)** — damages the machine. Now you're going to have a hard time using energy. And this is what's
- **[06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxdaLKfFD80&t=388s)** — Alzheimer's because the neurons can no longer get energy from glucose and many other tissues. And
- **[06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxdaLKfFD80&t=394s)** — this is why the ketogenic diet is so important because it bypasses all that and it gives the
- **[06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxdaLKfFD80&t=399s)** — body a different type of fuel from fat, not sugar. And it's in a form of kind of a packaged
- **[06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxdaLKfFD80&t=405s)** — fat that we can absorb called ketones. Now we can start supporting these cells.
- **[06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxdaLKfFD80&t=410s)** — But you better also increase the B1 that's deficient or else you might still have issues.
- **[06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxdaLKfFD80&t=416s)** — Let's talk about the foods that have the most B1. It's not really vegetables. Vegetables
- **[07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxdaLKfFD80&t=420s)** — have some but they have anti-B1 nutrients like oxalates. That's an anti-B1. Pork, believe it
- **[07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxdaLKfFD80&t=426s)** — or not, has the most B1. And then beef, wheat germ, whole grains, but I don't recommend that
- **[07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxdaLKfFD80&t=431s)** — because that's going to give you the gluten and the other issues with the carbs, organ
- **[07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxdaLKfFD80&t=435s)** — meats, eggs, fish, nuts, things like that. But fat and dairy don't have a lot of B1.
- **[07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxdaLKfFD80&t=441s)** — Nutritional yeast that's unfortified has a good amount of B1. So like I said before,
- **[07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxdaLKfFD80&t=444s)** — do not try this experiment at home. If you are on a high carbohydrate diet,
- **[07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxdaLKfFD80&t=449s)** — go on a low carbohydrate diet. Also make sure you don't become vitamin B1 deficient.

- **[00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3sBFSidJcg0&t=0s)** — There are three steps I'm going to show you to alleviate constipation.
- **[00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3sBFSidJcg0&t=4s)** — For example, if you take a laxative for over a year, you start to create damage to the nerves
- **[00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3sBFSidJcg0&t=11s)** — and the muscles of your colon. And make sure you always read the ingredients. If it has mineral
- **[00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3sBFSidJcg0&t=17s)** — oil, do not take it because what that's going to do, it's going to leach out fat soluble
- **[00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3sBFSidJcg0&t=23s)** — vitamins from your liver and other parts of your body. The most common type of constipation
- **[00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3sBFSidJcg0&t=29s)** — is called primary constipation. There's not like a tumor in there that's abstracting it.
- **[00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3sBFSidJcg0&t=34s)** — The first line of treatment for primary constipation is polyethylene glycol,
- **[00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3sBFSidJcg0&t=41s)** — petroleum based medication. It's also used to preserve wood that's been waterlogged. It's
- **[00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3sBFSidJcg0&t=48s)** — used in propellants for missiles for the U.S. Navy. Now it is considered safe, but growing
- **[00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3sBFSidJcg0&t=55s)** — evidence has shown that it's becoming a problem. In between 1990 and 1998, they tested people
- **[01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3sBFSidJcg0&t=63s)** — and they found over 72% of those who they tested had anti-polyethylene glycol antibodies.
- **[01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3sBFSidJcg0&t=74s)** — Which means these people have developed a hypersensitivity to this product, which is in
- **[01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3sBFSidJcg0&t=79s)** — a lot of different things, including medications, like I mentioned. But when they're exposed to it,
- **[01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3sBFSidJcg0&t=84s)** — in other related products, they tend to get hives, might get dizzy. Now what we've been
- **[01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3sBFSidJcg0&t=91s)** — told about constipation, of what we need to do, despite hardly any evidence of this being true,
- **[01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3sBFSidJcg0&t=97s)** — is to eat more fiber and drink more water and exercise. Ideally, the microbes consume
- **[01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3sBFSidJcg0&t=103s)** — most of the fiber so you don't have this undigested fiber that's actually plugging up
- **[01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3sBFSidJcg0&t=108s)** — your colon. So if we just kind of step back and look at what we're dealing with,
- **[01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3sBFSidJcg0&t=113s)** — we're dealing with a digestive tube or a pipe, which is roughly between 20 and 25 feet. Now
- **[02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3sBFSidJcg0&t=120s)** — to the left and right, you have the gallbladder, which squeezes out bile to help you digest the
- **[02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3sBFSidJcg0&t=127s)** — fat. And then you have the pancreas, which releases enzymes to start breaking down the food
- **[02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3sBFSidJcg0&t=133s)** — and enzymes that are made by the small intestine, all working together to break down
- **[02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3sBFSidJcg0&t=138s)** — and absorb nutrients. Now think about this, if you don't have enough hydrochloric acid in your
- **[02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3sBFSidJcg0&t=144s)** — stomach to break down the protein, then you end up with undigested protein that enters the small
- **[02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3sBFSidJcg0&t=150s)** — intestine. And so you might get cramping and extra work by the pancreas to pump out more
- **[02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3sBFSidJcg0&t=156s)** — enzymes. One thing that humans cannot digest is fiber. A lot of the microbes that you have
- **[02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3sBFSidJcg0&t=162s)** — in the body act on this fiber. And ideally, a lot of that fiber is going to be broken down
- **[02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3sBFSidJcg0&t=168s)** — so then we have the actual stool or the residue that's left over. So the stool is composed of
- **[02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3sBFSidJcg0&t=174s)** — about 75% water, 25% bacteria, and then some dead cells. Now my digestive system was never
- **[03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3sBFSidJcg0&t=184s)** — worse than when I went on a vegan diet and I had beans, fruits, I had whole grains,
- **[03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3sBFSidJcg0&t=193s)** — I was doing soy. Oh my goodness, did my stomach get bloated and crampy and I was so uncomfortable.
- **[03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3sBFSidJcg0&t=203s)** — You have to have a super healthy digestive system to be able to be a vegan. Because if
- **[03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3sBFSidJcg0&t=209s)** — you have leaky gut, these are really going to irritate the already existing inflammatory
- **[03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3sBFSidJcg0&t=213s)** — surface area of your intestine. And this is why some people do so well on the carnivore diet
- **[03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3sBFSidJcg0&t=219s)** — because you eliminate all this fiber, we're getting more meat which has a lot of glutamine
- **[03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3sBFSidJcg0&t=224s)** — which actually can heal the intestine. So let's talk about the three steps that you should do
- **[03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3sBFSidJcg0&t=229s)** — to solve this problem. Okay, number one would be something called intermittent fasting. They
- **[03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3sBFSidJcg0&t=235s)** — should bring down their consumption of food to two meals a day, one for lunch, one at dinner,
- **[04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3sBFSidJcg0&t=240s)** — and eat nothing in between with those meals. That will at least give your system a chance to
- **[04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3sBFSidJcg0&t=246s)** — catch up and have a break. Okay, step number two. This is where we're going to fix the diet.
- **[04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3sBFSidJcg0&t=253s)** — The more complex your meals are with all these different ingredients, the more chance for more
- **[04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3sBFSidJcg0&t=259s)** — stress on the digestive system. Maybe you start off with some meat and maybe two cups of
- **[04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3sBFSidJcg0&t=264s)** — vegetables or salad which would be better, easier to digest than like broccoli, things like
- **[04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3sBFSidJcg0&t=271s)** — unless the broccoli is cooked or steamed. Now one really good vegetable would be sauerkraut,
- **[04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3sBFSidJcg0&t=277s)** — which is really good for healing a leaky gut. So you don't want to get your fiber from
- **[04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3sBFSidJcg0&t=283s)** — grain synthetically created. We want to give your microbes things that they recognize and
- **[04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3sBFSidJcg0&t=289s)** — they're used to digesting. Things like polyphenols to actually feed the microbes. But
- **[04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3sBFSidJcg0&t=294s)** — when you're dealing with the fiber from corn fiber, you're not getting these polyphenols.
- **[04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3sBFSidJcg0&t=298s)** — Another really really important thing to avoid is seed oils,
- **[05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3sBFSidJcg0&t=303s)** — soy, corn, canola, because these things have been severely refined. So change your diet and
- **[05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3sBFSidJcg0&t=310s)** — the diet I'm going to recommend is the healthy version of the ketogenic diet. And I'm going to
- **[05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3sBFSidJcg0&t=314s)** — put a link down below but you're going to tweak it by not consuming a massive amount of
- **[05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3sBFSidJcg0&t=320s)** — greens or salad. You can have just a small amount and probably cooked or fermented,
- **[05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3sBFSidJcg0&t=324s)** — at least initially. All right, the third step, betaine hydrochloride to build up your
- **[05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3sBFSidJcg0&t=330s)** — hydrochloric acid in your stomach. So how do you know if you need hydrochloric acid? Well,
- **[05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3sBFSidJcg0&t=334s)** — constipation is one symptom of a lack of bile. Then you need betaine hydrochloride.
- **[05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3sBFSidJcg0&t=339s)** — So you would take like five of those little tablets before you eat. That alone could get
- **[05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3sBFSidJcg0&t=344s)** — rid of your constipation because bile helps lubricate the colon. And then we get to
- **[05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3sBFSidJcg0&t=351s)** — probiotics. Okay. But realize that if you just get your diet corrected, you may not need
- **[05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3sBFSidJcg0&t=357s)** — probiotics. Now, another very interesting thing about your foods, when you consume plants
- **[06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3sBFSidJcg0&t=364s)** — that are raised on healthy soils, that plant is loaded with microbes. I mean, this is how
- **[06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3sBFSidJcg0&t=371s)** — cows, for example, populate their colons by consuming the grass that has the microbes from
- **[06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3sBFSidJcg0&t=377s)** — soil. Another really good thing for you to use is magnesium and more than just like the normal
- **[06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3sBFSidJcg0&t=385s)** — RDAs, which could come out to like 800 milligrams or even a little bit more. The other nutrient
- **[06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3sBFSidJcg0&t=390s)** — deficiency that is common in constipation is vitamin B1, which is if you've been consuming
- **[06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3sBFSidJcg0&t=395s)** — a lot of refined carbohydrates or sugars. And so you want to start taking a good vitamin B1.
- **[06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3sBFSidJcg0&t=402s)** — So you can then help stimulate the pumping action of the colon. This is where you might
- **[06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3sBFSidJcg0&t=407s)** — want to add some castor oil or senna, which is a really common natural herbal laxative that has
- **[06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3sBFSidJcg0&t=416s)** — very minimal side effects, if any, especially if you compare that to drugs. So these three
- **[07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3sBFSidJcg0&t=422s)** — steps should handle most constipation problems. There is always exceptions to the rules and
- **[07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3sBFSidJcg0&t=429s)** — there's other things to take. But for right now, I think the most important thing is to
- **[07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3sBFSidJcg0&t=433s)** — start with step one, which is intermittent fasting. So if you have not seen this video,
- **[07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3sBFSidJcg0&t=438s)** — check it out on intermittent fasting.

- **[00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CV8B82r5Sg&t=0s)** — What is the highest burning calorie exercise or activity that ever existed on this planet?
- **[00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CV8B82r5Sg&t=6s)** — That's what we're going to talk about today.
- **[00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CV8B82r5Sg&t=7s)** — Now, this information is based on a person that weighs about 155 pounds.
- **[00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CV8B82r5Sg&t=11s)** — And all of these activities are based on one hour of doing them.
- **[00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CV8B82r5Sg&t=16s)** — A lot of these exercises cannot be performed for a whole hour.
- **[00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CV8B82r5Sg&t=20s)** — But just to give you a relative comparison per unit of time,
- **[00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CV8B82r5Sg&t=25s)** — I'm going to list everything by calories burned.
- **[00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CV8B82r5Sg&t=28s)** — And then when we're done, I want to clarify some really important points on calories
- **[00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CV8B82r5Sg&t=32s)** — because it's not all about burning calories.
- **[00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CV8B82r5Sg&t=35s)** — We start with sleeping.
- **[00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CV8B82r5Sg&t=37s)** — You'll burn 50 calories per hour when you're sleeping.
- **[00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CV8B82r5Sg&t=41s)** — And then we graduate to sitting, being sedentary, sitting on the couch.
- **[00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CV8B82r5Sg&t=45s)** — 65 calories per hour you can burn just by doing nothing.
- **[00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CV8B82r5Sg&t=50s)** — And just as a side note, if you chew gum, you can burn a few more calories an hour.
- **[00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CV8B82r5Sg&t=54s)** — If you laugh, you can burn a few more calories per hour.
- **[00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CV8B82r5Sg&t=58s)** — And if you fidget, you can burn a few more calories per hour.
- **[01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CV8B82r5Sg&t=62s)** — All very insignificant.
- **[01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CV8B82r5Sg&t=64s)** — So when you're sitting there watching TV at night eating popcorn,
- **[01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CV8B82r5Sg&t=67s)** — find a comedy, start laughing, fidget while you're chewing gum
- **[01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CV8B82r5Sg&t=70s)** — and eating the popcorn at the same time.
- **[01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CV8B82r5Sg&t=72s)** — Then we have standing. It takes a little more energy to stand.
- **[01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CV8B82r5Sg&t=75s)** — So we have 110 calories.
- **[01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CV8B82r5Sg&t=77s)** — Sex. It's not an exercise. I guess it could be.
- **[01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CV8B82r5Sg&t=81s)** — You'll burn about 200 calories an hour.
- **[01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CV8B82r5Sg&t=84s)** — But most people do not spend an hour performing that exercise.
- **[01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CV8B82r5Sg&t=87s)** — Probably more like, I don't know, four minutes, maybe 10 minutes.
- **[01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CV8B82r5Sg&t=92s)** — Then we have planks. If you did plank for an hour, you'd burn 240 calories.
- **[01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CV8B82r5Sg&t=96s)** — That seems pretty strange because it seems like a plank would burn way more calories.
- **[01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CV8B82r5Sg&t=100s)** — I'll have to double check that one.
- **[01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CV8B82r5Sg&t=102s)** — But I tell you one thing, I don't think most people can do a plank
- **[01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CV8B82r5Sg&t=105s)** — for more than, you know, five, ten minutes, let alone an hour.
- **[01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CV8B82r5Sg&t=110s)** — Okay, then we have walking.
- **[01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CV8B82r5Sg&t=111s)** — Moderate pace, about three miles an hour. You'll burn about 240 calories an hour.
- **[01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CV8B82r5Sg&t=115s)** — Bowling is 250 calories. House cleaning, vigorous effort, 250 calories.
- **[02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CV8B82r5Sg&t=120s)** — Gardening or yard work is 270 calories.
- **[02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CV8B82r5Sg&t=124s)** — Yoga, you can burn 280 calories walking briskly at four miles an hour.
- **[02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CV8B82r5Sg&t=130s)** — 340 calories. Golfing, 360 calories per hour.
- **[02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CV8B82r5Sg&t=134s)** — And then if you do the elliptical training moderately, it's about 400 calories an hour.
- **[02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CV8B82r5Sg&t=138s)** — Now a more high-end yoga, like a power yoga, you could burn about 400 calories.
- **[02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CV8B82r5Sg&t=145s)** — Okay, and then the next series of exercise all burn about, roughly about, 420 calories.
- **[02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CV8B82r5Sg&t=150s)** — Softball, baseball, rollerblading, roller skating, bicycling at 10 miles an hour,
- **[02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CV8B82r5Sg&t=156s)** — weightlifting, vigorous effort, Zumba, dance workout, and aerobics, moderate effort.
- **[02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CV8B82r5Sg&t=163s)** — All are 420 calories per hour.
- **[02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CV8B82r5Sg&t=166s)** — Then we have like aerobic dancing, vigorously, that's 440 calories per hour.
- **[02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CV8B82r5Sg&t=172s)** — Volleyball is 450 calories per hour.
- **[02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CV8B82r5Sg&t=176s)** — Hiking with a backpack, 450 calories per hour.
- **[03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CV8B82r5Sg&t=180s)** — Playing tennis, it's 450 calories.
- **[03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CV8B82r5Sg&t=182s)** — Rowing, 470.
- **[03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CV8B82r5Sg&t=185s)** — Bicycling, about 12 to 14 miles an hour, is about 470 calories.
- **[03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CV8B82r5Sg&t=189s)** — And then the next series of exercises all burn about 480 calories per hour.
- **[03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CV8B82r5Sg&t=194s)** — Basketball, soccer, running, 5 to 6 miles an hour.
- **[03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CV8B82r5Sg&t=199s)** — Elliptical training, vigorously, all 480 calories per hour.
- **[03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CV8B82r5Sg&t=204s)** — And then we have swimming, moderate effort is 510 calories.
- **[03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CV8B82r5Sg&t=209s)** — Cross-country skiing, I've done that.
- **[03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CV8B82r5Sg&t=211s)** — It's a pretty serious workout. That's 550 calories per hour.
- **[03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CV8B82r5Sg&t=216s)** — Then we have martial arts, judo, karate, etc.
- **[03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CV8B82r5Sg&t=219s)** — 560 calories an hour.
- **[03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CV8B82r5Sg&t=220s)** — Jumping rope, 560 calories an hour.
- **[03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CV8B82r5Sg&t=223s)** — I want to see you jump rope for an hour.
- **[03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CV8B82r5Sg&t=225s)** — Rock climbing, indoor and outdoor, 570 calories.
- **[03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CV8B82r5Sg&t=229s)** — And of course, that all depends on, you know, how many breaks that you're taking in between the rock climbing.
- **[03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CV8B82r5Sg&t=234s)** — I don't think anyone could rock climb for a straight one hour.
- **[03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CV8B82r5Sg&t=238s)** — Then you have rowing, vigorously, 570 calories.
- **[04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CV8B82r5Sg&t=242s)** — Kickboxing, 580 calories.
- **[04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CV8B82r5Sg&t=245s)** — Bicycling, vigorously, at 14 to 16 miles an hour, 590 calories.
- **[04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CV8B82r5Sg&t=251s)** — Then we have running at 6 to 7 miles per hour, 590 calories.
- **[04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CV8B82r5Sg&t=255s)** — Swimming, vigorously, high intensity interval training, CrossFit.
- **[04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CV8B82r5Sg&t=260s)** — All of them are 590 calories an hour.
- **[04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CV8B82r5Sg&t=262s)** — Now, of course, they're not factoring in the rest periods and all that.
- **[04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CV8B82r5Sg&t=267s)** — Because obviously when you're resting, you're going to burn those calories.
- **[04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CV8B82r5Sg&t=269s)** — Running up a hill, 800 calories per hour.
- **[04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CV8B82r5Sg&t=273s)** — Yeah, I like to see you run up a hill for an hour.
- **[04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CV8B82r5Sg&t=276s)** — I think I can make it about 15 to 20 seconds before I have to take a break.
- **[04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CV8B82r5Sg&t=282s)** — Now we have running at 10 miles an hour. That's pretty fast.
- **[04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CV8B82r5Sg&t=285s)** — Over 1126 calories. Of course, no one's going to be able to run an hour at that speed.
- **[04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CV8B82r5Sg&t=291s)** — But just to look at how many calories you would burn comparatively, it's quite a few.
- **[04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CV8B82r5Sg&t=295s)** — Oh, check this out. Chopping wood with an axe.
- **[05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CV8B82r5Sg&t=301s)** — 1196 calories per hour.
- **[05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CV8B82r5Sg&t=302s)** — And then we have the top exercise that burns the most calories.
- **[05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CV8B82r5Sg&t=306s)** — And that's a flat-out sprint. That's at 1200 calories per hour.
- **[05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CV8B82r5Sg&t=313s)** — We know that's ridiculous.
- **[05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CV8B82r5Sg&t=314s)** — But if you're doing a flat-out sprint and you're using every bit of energy,
- **[05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CV8B82r5Sg&t=319s)** — you're going to burn some serious calories.
- **[05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CV8B82r5Sg&t=322s)** — Now, that's all really interesting, but I need to explain some key things about burning calories.
- **[05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CV8B82r5Sg&t=328s)** — What is the purpose of burning calories? Why do you want to burn calories?
- **[05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CV8B82r5Sg&t=331s)** — Chances are, it's probably to lose weight, right?
- **[05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CV8B82r5Sg&t=333s)** — Now, we have to ask the question, what type of calories do you want to burn?
- **[05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CV8B82r5Sg&t=338s)** — Do you want to burn your sugar calories? Or do you want to burn your fat calories?
- **[05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CV8B82r5Sg&t=343s)** — Or do you want to burn your protein calories? Your muscle protein? Probably not.
- **[05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CV8B82r5Sg&t=347s)** — So you probably want to burn fat, right?
- **[05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CV8B82r5Sg&t=348s)** — So if you actually consume sugar, you're going to burn sugar.
- **[05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CV8B82r5Sg&t=352s)** — If you consume fat without sugar, you will burn fat.
- **[05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CV8B82r5Sg&t=356s)** — And when your body starts burning off your own protein, your muscle,
- **[05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CV8B82r5Sg&t=359s)** — that's in a situation where you are over training, you haven't slept.
- **[06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CV8B82r5Sg&t=366s)** — Maybe you're doing prolonged fasting.
- **[06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CV8B82r5Sg&t=368s)** — And in addition to that, you've tapped out like not just your glycogen reserve,
- **[06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CV8B82r5Sg&t=372s)** — but your fat reserves.
- **[06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CV8B82r5Sg&t=374s)** — And then now the muscle is going to be the last thing to be burned.
- **[06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CV8B82r5Sg&t=377s)** — And that's called starvation.
- **[06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CV8B82r5Sg&t=379s)** — With some of these long-distance runners, they have a bit of atrophy
- **[06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CV8B82r5Sg&t=382s)** — because they're generating so much energy and burning so many calories.
- **[06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CV8B82r5Sg&t=387s)** — It's very difficult to maintain a large volume of muscles
- **[06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CV8B82r5Sg&t=392s)** — because if you keep the intensity high and you increase duration,
- **[06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CV8B82r5Sg&t=396s)** — you also increase cortisol.
- **[06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CV8B82r5Sg&t=398s)** — Cortisol destroys the muscles.
- **[06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CV8B82r5Sg&t=400s)** — It's very important as we're talking about calories
- **[06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CV8B82r5Sg&t=402s)** — to make sure you never over train.
- **[06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CV8B82r5Sg&t=405s)** — So if we take a look at what's really happening inside yourselves
- **[06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CV8B82r5Sg&t=408s)** — when you exercise, you're using energy through the machine
- **[06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CV8B82r5Sg&t=413s)** — called the mitochondria.
- **[06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CV8B82r5Sg&t=414s)** — The amount of calories that you're burning really is dependent on how healthy
- **[07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CV8B82r5Sg&t=420s)** — that mitochondria is.
- **[07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CV8B82r5Sg&t=422s)** — How do you know if you have a good mitochondria?
- **[07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CV8B82r5Sg&t=423s)** — Well, take a look at your energy.
- **[07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CV8B82r5Sg&t=425s)** — How much energy do you have?
- **[07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CV8B82r5Sg&t=426s)** — Can you exercise and have more endurance and have more energy
- **[07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CV8B82r5Sg&t=430s)** — even after you work out to some degree?
- **[07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CV8B82r5Sg&t=432s)** — Certain medications destroy the mitochondria like statin drugs
- **[07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CV8B82r5Sg&t=435s)** — which block cholesterol.
- **[07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CV8B82r5Sg&t=437s)** — And one of the big reasons is because it depletes a very important nutrient
- **[07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CV8B82r5Sg&t=442s)** — that's needed by the mitochondria to make energy
- **[07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CV8B82r5Sg&t=444s)** — and that's called coenzyme Q10.
- **[07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CV8B82r5Sg&t=448s)** — Also, L-carnitine is another one as well.
- **[07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CV8B82r5Sg&t=450s)** — So there are several things that can help increase the number
- **[07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CV8B82r5Sg&t=454s)** — of mitochondria and the strength.
- **[07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CV8B82r5Sg&t=457s)** — Of course, exercise will do it,
- **[07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CV8B82r5Sg&t=459s)** — but only if you're resting between your exercise and you're fully recovering.
- **[07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CV8B82r5Sg&t=463s)** — Having a good thyroid can help the number of mitochondria.
- **[07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CV8B82r5Sg&t=467s)** — Increasing more muscle mass will automatically give you more mitochondria.
- **[07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CV8B82r5Sg&t=472s)** — And this is why it's important if you want to improve your metabolism
- **[07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CV8B82r5Sg&t=476s)** — to make sure you have sufficient muscle mass.
- **[07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CV8B82r5Sg&t=479s)** — And even people doing Ozempic, right?
- **[08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CV8B82r5Sg&t=481s)** — What they do is they lose weight, but they also lose muscle as a side effect.
- **[08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CV8B82r5Sg&t=487s)** — I mean sometimes people have this idea that
- **[08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CV8B82r5Sg&t=488s)** — oh yeah, I'll be on this medication the rest of my life.
- **[08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CV8B82r5Sg&t=490s)** — Really? I don't think so.
- **[08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CV8B82r5Sg&t=492s)** — So you might start out losing weight
- **[08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CV8B82r5Sg&t=494s)** — and then all of a sudden lose your mitochondria.
- **[08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CV8B82r5Sg&t=497s)** — Doing intermittent fasting can also stimulate the production of more mitochondria.
- **[08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CV8B82r5Sg&t=504s)** — But I want to say something.
- **[08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CV8B82r5Sg&t=505s)** — There's a fascinating test that can look into the mitochondria.
- **[08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CV8B82r5Sg&t=509s)** — It's called metabolomics and determine if you're getting enough fuel to even feed the mitochondria,
- **[08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CV8B82r5Sg&t=513s)** — especially if someone is exercising.
- **[08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CV8B82r5Sg&t=515s)** — It's very important to get enough fuel to feed the machine.
- **[08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CV8B82r5Sg&t=520s)** — One of the best fuels for the mitochondria is meat.
- **[08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CV8B82r5Sg&t=526s)** — Meat apparently has all the cofactors, the B vitamins, the trace minerals,
- **[08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CV8B82r5Sg&t=530s)** — and the most protein to feed that mitochondria and make it strong.
- **[08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CV8B82r5Sg&t=537s)** — Cold immersion therapy or cold showers can actually do some interesting things
- **[09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CV8B82r5Sg&t=542s)** — because it forces the mitochondria to generate a tremendous amount of energy from your food.
- **[09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CV8B82r5Sg&t=550s)** — There's been some data that resveratrol can help stimulate more mitochondria.
- **[09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CV8B82r5Sg&t=555s)** — If you have insulin resistance, which probably 90% of the population has,
- **[09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CV8B82r5Sg&t=561s)** — that can severely destroy your mitochondria.
- **[09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CV8B82r5Sg&t=565s)** — It can prevent you from using glucose.
- **[09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CV8B82r5Sg&t=569s)** — And if you keep eating glucose, we can't burn ketones.
- **[09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CV8B82r5Sg&t=574s)** — So in other words, to get into fat burning, you need to cut down your carbs.
- **[09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CV8B82r5Sg&t=578s)** — Now, the other topic is growth hormone.
- **[09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CV8B82r5Sg&t=581s)** — Growth hormone can also help reduce this insulin resistance.
- **[09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CV8B82r5Sg&t=585s)** — It can also help you build more muscle.
- **[09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CV8B82r5Sg&t=587s)** — It can help you burn more fat.
- **[09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CV8B82r5Sg&t=589s)** — Even though you might be sprinting for 10 to 15 seconds and then resting for four minutes,
- **[09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CV8B82r5Sg&t=596s)** — you might not be burning a lot of calories.
- **[09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CV8B82r5Sg&t=599s)** — But what's going to happen is you're going to increase growth hormone 24 to 48 hours later while you're sleeping.
- **[10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CV8B82r5Sg&t=606s)** — So you're going to be burning fat while you're sleeping.
- **[10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CV8B82r5Sg&t=609s)** — And this is why you have to look beyond just the mechanics of burning calories,
- **[10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CV8B82r5Sg&t=614s)** — because there's other factors involved.
- **[10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CV8B82r5Sg&t=616s)** — One other big mistake that a lot of exercisers do is when they try to burn calories with exercise,
- **[10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CV8B82r5Sg&t=622s)** — they're putting tremendous amounts of energy out at the gym and their diet is too high in carbs.
- **[10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CV8B82r5Sg&t=628s)** — So they'll end up burning off the sugar.
- **[10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CV8B82r5Sg&t=631s)** — Now they're hungry and they're craving sweets and sugar and they keep putting the carbs back in having these little snacks.
- **[10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CV8B82r5Sg&t=639s)** — So they never really lose a lot of weight because they're running their body on glucose and they're just putting it right back.
- **[10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CV8B82r5Sg&t=645s)** — So if we're talking about weight loss, exercise accounts for 15% of your gains,
- **[10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CV8B82r5Sg&t=651s)** — whereas the diet can be about 85% of your gains.
- **[10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CV8B82r5Sg&t=657s)** — Because regardless of how many calories you're burning,
- **[11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CV8B82r5Sg&t=660s)** — what if you could just focus on burning fat calories?
- **[11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CV8B82r5Sg&t=662s)** — Wouldn't that be a smart thing to do?
- **[11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CV8B82r5Sg&t=665s)** — Versus increasing the metabolism to burn off more sugar calories, which you then replace with sugar.
- **[11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CV8B82r5Sg&t=669s)** — Doesn't make sense.
- **[11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CV8B82r5Sg&t=671s)** — But if we're talking about exercise and we want to do an exercise that burns the most calories,
- **[11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CV8B82r5Sg&t=675s)** — you'd want to keep the intensity, the highest possible intensity you can do,
- **[11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CV8B82r5Sg&t=680s)** — and involve the most muscles, upper body and lower body.
- **[11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CV8B82r5Sg&t=685s)** — Recently I was doing a metabolomic test on my mitochondria.
- **[11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CV8B82r5Sg&t=689s)** — I exercise a lot. I run up hills. I do all sorts of things.
- **[11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CV8B82r5Sg&t=692s)** — I was over training.
- **[11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CV8B82r5Sg&t=694s)** — So I cut that back, got more sleep, and now the mitochondria is better.
- **[11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CV8B82r5Sg&t=700s)** — So that's why the metabolomic testing I think is going to be the wave of the future
- **[11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CV8B82r5Sg&t=703s)** — because you can predict things well before they become symptomatic.
- **[11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CV8B82r5Sg&t=709s)** — For more information on the best diet that you should be on,
- **[11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CV8B82r5Sg&t=713s)** — to be able to have really healthy mitochondria,
- **[11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CV8B82r5Sg&t=717s)** — you should probably study this video right here.

- **[00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=serJmA0YFD0&t=0s)** — So what would actually happen to your body if you actually gave up sugar for two short weeks?
- **[00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=serJmA0YFD0&t=5s)** — And I know a lot of people will tell you that the trend for eating sugar is a lot less than it was
- **[00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=serJmA0YFD0&t=10s)** — before. And so how can that account for all of our health problems? Well, you're about to find
- **[00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=serJmA0YFD0&t=16s)** — out. Let's first dive into the benefits of what would happen after just two weeks of not eating
- **[00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=serJmA0YFD0&t=22s)** — sugar. The first thing you would notice is your face would be less round, okay? Less puffy.
- **[00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=serJmA0YFD0&t=28s)** — I used to have kind of a puffy roundish face. Now it's not a full-blown moon face but it was
- **[00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=serJmA0YFD0&t=34s)** — definitely rounder and it wasn't as thin as it is now. So the shape of your face will change
- **[00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=serJmA0YFD0&t=39s)** — because you're going to have less fat in your face. Number two, you're going to notice less
- **[00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=serJmA0YFD0&t=43s)** — puffy eyelids. You can always identify how much sugar someone's consuming by looking at how
- **[00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=serJmA0YFD0&t=49s)** — puffy their eyelids are. In fact, I had puffy eyelids for many years. I didn't know what it
- **[00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=serJmA0YFD0&t=54s)** — was. But after I get rid of the sugar, that puffiness went away. Number three, your midsection,
- **[01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=serJmA0YFD0&t=60s)** — your belly fat, will reduce. Too much sugar converts to excess liver fat which then spills
- **[01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=serJmA0YFD0&t=66s)** — over into your gut, the fat around the organs giving you belly fat. So belly fat is a really
- **[01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=serJmA0YFD0&t=71s)** — good indication that you're eating too many carbs. Number four, your cravings for carbs
- **[01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=serJmA0YFD0&t=76s)** — will go down to zero. You just will not want carbs anymore. But even a little bit of sugar
- **[01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=serJmA0YFD0&t=81s)** — here and there will keep that craving persisting to the point where it's going to be really
- **[01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=serJmA0YFD0&t=84s)** — hard to give it up. This next one, number five, your hunger is going to go way down. You're not
- **[01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=serJmA0YFD0&t=88s)** — going to be hungry all the time. You're going to feel satisfied which is going to be huge if
- **[01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=serJmA0YFD0&t=93s)** — you want to stick to any type of plan. It's torturous to crave things and be hungry all
- **[01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=serJmA0YFD0&t=97s)** — the time when you're trying to lose weight. So sugar increases insulin and insulin makes you
- **[01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=serJmA0YFD0&t=102s)** — hungry. The next one is your mood is going to greatly improve. If you were depressed before,
- **[01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=serJmA0YFD0&t=106s)** — if you had anxiety before, you're probably going to be a lot calmer. You're going to feel
- **[01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=serJmA0YFD0&t=111s)** — I remember getting a success story from this gentleman who was very very depressed to the
- **[01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=serJmA0YFD0&t=115s)** — point of suicide. In fact he wanted to kill himself. So he locked himself in his room and
- **[01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=serJmA0YFD0&t=119s)** — he stopped eating everything. So he was doing a fast and of course when you're fasting you're
- **[02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=serJmA0YFD0&t=125s)** — not eating any sugar and your body's in the ketosis. And so by the third day he felt
- **[02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=serJmA0YFD0&t=133s)** — wonderful. His depression went away. And so intermittent fasting or fasting and lowering
- **[02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=serJmA0YFD0&t=138s)** — your carbs create a similar effect. I remember when I was on a high carb diet,
- **[02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=serJmA0YFD0&t=147s)** — boy did I have brain fog. I had no idea that it was coming from all the sugar. I didn't make
- **[02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=serJmA0YFD0&t=152s)** — the connection until one day I decided to give up the sugar and it was like someone took this
- **[02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=serJmA0YFD0&t=158s)** — brain fog helmet off my head and I finally actually can think. I used to have it. I can
- **[02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=serJmA0YFD0&t=168s)** — press my finger into my ankles and it would leave a dent. That's pitting edema. I had that. I had
- **[02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=serJmA0YFD0&t=174s)** — no idea that was all the sugar that I was consuming. Sugar retains fluid. And this relates
- **[03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=serJmA0YFD0&t=180s)** — to the next point as well. Your eyes are going to improve. Your kidneys will improve. Your
- **[03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=serJmA0YFD0&t=184s)** — arteries will improve and your nerves will get better because those are the four tissues
- **[03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=serJmA0YFD0&t=189s)** — that higher amounts of sugar will affect. And when it comes down to the eye you can gain
- **[03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=serJmA0YFD0&t=195s)** — more fluid into the eye increasing your risk for glaucoma when you have high amounts of sugar
- **[03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=serJmA0YFD0&t=201s)** — in your blood because think about this. If you have this concentrated sugar in your blood,
- **[03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=serJmA0YFD0&t=205s)** — well it pushes off into other fluids like in your eye as well as in your lens of the eye
- **[03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=serJmA0YFD0&t=211s)** — which can lead to cataracts. Number nine. Your pain and your inflammation will go down
- **[03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=serJmA0YFD0&t=218s)** — considerably. Boy, it's not until you reduce your sugars that you'll realize how much of that
- **[03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=serJmA0YFD0&t=223s)** — was contributing to either arthritis or inflammation or pain in your body. Until you eventually give it
- **[03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=serJmA0YFD0&t=228s)** — up and you're going to be amazed how much less inflammation you have in your body. Number ten.
- **[03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=serJmA0YFD0&t=233s)** — You're bloating. Your abdominal pain will go down. But I had years of bloating and gallbladder
- **[04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=serJmA0YFD0&t=240s)** — problems and abdominal pain from eating so much sugar. Number eleven. Your sleep will be much
- **[04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=serJmA0YFD0&t=248s)** — better. I remember one time when I had really bad sleeping problems when I was consuming a
- **[04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=serJmA0YFD0&t=253s)** — lot of carbs. What did I do to solve it? Ate more carbs. In fact, I would consume, I'm not kidding,
- **[04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=serJmA0YFD0&t=260s)** — a pint of Ben and Jerry's ice cream before bed just to have like a just sugar coma so I can
- **[04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=serJmA0YFD0&t=265s)** — literally go to sleep. Little did I know that made things worse. I started having restless leg
- **[04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=serJmA0YFD0&t=271s)** — syndrome. Wake up in the middle of the night. I'd have to go run to get this energy out
- **[04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=serJmA0YFD0&t=275s)** — because I had all this energy. That was lactic acid coming from the buildup of all the
- **[04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=serJmA0YFD0&t=283s)** — the energy factories in my cell. Number twelve. You're going to feel really calm. Your adrenal
- **[04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=serJmA0YFD0&t=289s)** — stress that you might have will be much better. And if you have kids, you're going to notice
- **[04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=serJmA0YFD0&t=294s)** — that their demeanor is going to be better. They're going to be able to sit for longer
- **[04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=serJmA0YFD0&t=298s)** — periods of time. I mean think about how many kids are just wired on sugar. They're so
- **[05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=serJmA0YFD0&t=302s)** — restless. And one of the reasons is because all this sugar depletes you of B1 which will
- **[05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=serJmA0YFD0&t=307s)** — give you the symptom of nervous tension. If you want to see a really dramatic effect,
- **[05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=serJmA0YFD0&t=312s)** — if someone has nervous tension or this buildup of stress, just give them some B1 and watch
- **[05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=serJmA0YFD0&t=318s)** — within three minutes. They're just going to feel nice and calm. Number thirteen. You're
- **[05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=serJmA0YFD0&t=322s)** — going to notice your skin is going to be much much better. Not just improving acne,
- **[05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=serJmA0YFD0&t=328s)** — but also dry skin, excessive oily skin. The overall color and tone of your skin is going
- **[05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=serJmA0YFD0&t=333s)** — to be much healthier. So those are some of the benefits. But check this out. I don't know
- **[05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=serJmA0YFD0&t=338s)** — if you've ever heard this before. There is something in the majority of the population's
- **[05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=serJmA0YFD0&t=344s)** — diet that is creating a sugar-like effect. It's something that's not sugar, but it acts like
- **[05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=serJmA0YFD0&t=352s)** — sugar. But it not just acts like sugar, it acts worse than sugar. And we're talking about
- **[05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=serJmA0YFD0&t=359s)** — refined starches in certain food products, if you want to call it that. They're basically
- **[06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=serJmA0YFD0&t=365s)** — classified under ultra-processed foods, aka junk foods. Let's take a look at... it used to be my
- **[06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=serJmA0YFD0&t=372s)** — favorite, right? So if we look at the ingredients, this has dried potatoes, vegetable oil.
- **[06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=serJmA0YFD0&t=379s)** — It could be cottonseed, corn, or soy, or sunflower. And then it has corn flour,
- **[06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=serJmA0YFD0&t=386s)** — okay, corn starch, rice flour, maltodextrin. So all of those are refined starches. So in other
- **[06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=serJmA0YFD0&t=396s)** — words, maltodextrin, modified corn starch, modified food starch, dextrin, basically are not
- **[06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=serJmA0YFD0&t=404s)** — sugars, but they have a huge effect on your blood sugars. Maltodextrin has an effect on the
- **[06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=serJmA0YFD0&t=414s)** — glucose. Glucose is 100. Table sugar is 65. So you can see it's like way worse than sugar,
- **[07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=serJmA0YFD0&t=421s)** — but it's not really a sugar. If we take a look at the total carbohydrates, it's 16. 16 grams.
- **[07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=serJmA0YFD0&t=428s)** — The total sugars, zero. Zero sugars. So you might be saying, wow, that's great. It's no
- **[07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=serJmA0YFD0&t=435s)** — sugar. It's just carbohydrate. But this is going to turn into sugar so fast and raise your
- **[07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=serJmA0YFD0&t=444s)** — four teaspoons of sugar. And that is just one fifth of this. Okay. So it's like a,
- **[07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=serJmA0YFD0&t=450s)** — it's probably a stack of those chips about this big right here. Has four teaspoons of sugar.
- **[07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=serJmA0YFD0&t=456s)** — You can imagine if you consume the whole thing, which I used to do without any hesitation
- **[07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=serJmA0YFD0&t=460s)** — that you're dumping a lot of sugar into your body, but it's not listed as sugar. So when I
- **[07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=serJmA0YFD0&t=466s)** — talk about getting rid of these sugars for two weeks, I'm talking about also the starches. But
- **[07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=serJmA0YFD0&t=472s)** — I want to show you one last thing. Okay. It's with this sir right here. It used to be one of my
- **[07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=serJmA0YFD0&t=477s)** — favorites, right? Fruity pebbles. Okay. And I want to show you how much sugar that's in here.
- **[08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=serJmA0YFD0&t=484s)** — First, starting with the actual sugar itself. Okay. The sugar that's labeled there,
- **[08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=serJmA0YFD0&t=490s)** — one cup of fruity pebbles. Okay. That's about 4.5. But if we had the starches that
- **[08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=serJmA0YFD0&t=495s)** — turn into sugar, because they're really sugars in reality, because they create a much more
- **[08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=serJmA0YFD0&t=499s)** — damaging effect, we have to add four more teaspoons. Okay. Actually five more teaspoons.
- **[08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=serJmA0YFD0&t=506s)** — So that gives us a total of nine teaspoons per cup. All right. So you can see that this is a
- **[08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=serJmA0YFD0&t=512s)** — lot of sugar for one cup, right? Who consumes just one cup? An average child or adult is
- **[08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=serJmA0YFD0&t=518s)** — going to consume probably four cups per breakfast, right? So now we're talking about
- **[08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=serJmA0YFD0&t=525s)** — 36 teaspoons. So let's go ahead and add that. Okay. I'm not even at 36. I think you get the
- **[08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=serJmA0YFD0&t=530s)** — point. That's a lot of sugar for your breakfast. I found this one right here. It's called
- **[08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=serJmA0YFD0&t=534s)** — the granola bakery keto granola cinnamon pecan. Now check out the ingredients of this. Pecans,
- **[09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=serJmA0YFD0&t=544s)** — almonds, dried coconut, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, chicory root fiber, erythritol,
- **[09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=serJmA0YFD0&t=552s)** — coconut cream, coconut oil, cinnamon, monk fruit juice concentrate. That's not a lot of sugar by
- **[09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=serJmA0YFD0&t=560s)** — the way. Vanilla extract and sea salt. This is like one gram of sugar. Now it does have eight
- **[09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=serJmA0YFD0&t=567s)** — grams of carbs, but it has five grams of fiber. So if you deduct that, that is a three
- **[09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=serJmA0YFD0&t=573s)** — gram net carb with one gram of sugar. And this is not altered processed food. So it's
- **[09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=serJmA0YFD0&t=578s)** — not going to turn into sugar really fast. We're talking like one gram of sugar. If we compare
- **[09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=serJmA0YFD0&t=583s)** — to this one right here, one serving size, 150 calories roughly. This is like 36 grams of stuff
- **[09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=serJmA0YFD0&t=592s)** — that turns into sugar. This is one gram. So let's see 36 to one. Let's see which one I'm
- **[09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=serJmA0YFD0&t=598s)** — going to pick here. Now if you'd like to find out exactly what diet you should do to make

- **[00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8rMgJRuGj00&t=0s)** — So when you're working out, there's some very important things that you want to do before, during, and after your exercise.
- **[00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8rMgJRuGj00&t=7s)** — And this especially applies as we age. Because as we age, there's so many different illnesses that are connected with aging.
- **[00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8rMgJRuGj00&t=15s)** — Exercise seems to be one of the best things to counter that. In fact, I mentioned this in another video, the lack of exercise or activity
- **[00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8rMgJRuGj00&t=22s)** — actually causes some of these illnesses. And one of the real big things that exercise can do is increase your
- **[00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8rMgJRuGj00&t=30s)** — mitochondria. Now mitochondria is the energy factory of the cell. It's the thing that converts food into energy as well as the raw materials to build body tissue.
- **[00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8rMgJRuGj00&t=41s)** — An exercise directly increases the number of mitochondria. And that's important because so many diseases are related to mitochondrial dysfunction, including cancer.
- **[00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8rMgJRuGj00&t=54s)** — So anything you can do to improve the mitochondria, the better it's going to be for your health.
- **[00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8rMgJRuGj00&t=58s)** — Now I just want to mention something called stem cells. When you exercise, you increase your stem cells.
- **[01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8rMgJRuGj00&t=64s)** — They're cells that are not really anything yet. They're kind of potential body tissue. So they can turn into anything that you need, like joint tissue or pancreas tissue or your liver or anything.
- **[01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8rMgJRuGj00&t=78s)** — And when we get older, our stem cells go down. But exercise can help rejuvenate a lot of your stem cells.
- **[01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8rMgJRuGj00&t=85s)** — So if you're not exercising, you need to start and being consistent, especially as you age. Also exercise is one of the best things to reduce stress.
- **[01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8rMgJRuGj00&t=94s)** — Because we all experience stress, we want to keep the stress very low. If you don't exercise, you're going to find that your stress levels go up.
- **[01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8rMgJRuGj00&t=102s)** — Exercise will also help sleep, blood sugars. There's just many, many benefits. So the first point about exercise I want to bring up is the four variables to exercise.
- **[01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8rMgJRuGj00&t=110s)** — Really, exercise consists of four things. One is the duration of exercise. How long you go. Two is the intensity of your exercise.
- **[02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8rMgJRuGj00&t=120s)** — Three is the recovery after the exercise. And four is just the frequency of how many times you do that for a given workout or how many workouts you do for a given week.
- **[02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8rMgJRuGj00&t=131s)** — So all the different types of exercises that are out there are really just a combination of these four things.
- **[02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8rMgJRuGj00&t=136s)** — The first thing I'm going to talk about is the recovery. The rest. Not necessarily just between the workouts, like how many times you go per week, but how long do you rest between your actual sets.
- **[02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8rMgJRuGj00&t=151s)** — So let's say, for example, you do like eight reps of a certain exercise, which kind of makes up what's called a set. Now, how long do you rest between these sets?
- **[02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8rMgJRuGj00&t=161s)** — A lot of people, when they do the high intensity interval training, spend like 30 seconds resting. Let me tell you the problem with that.
- **[02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8rMgJRuGj00&t=169s)** — One is that you don't give your body a chance to replenish the ATP. So if you only rest for 30 seconds and then you go right into the next exercise, without that full ATP or energy to supply the muscle,
- **[03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8rMgJRuGj00&t=184s)** — you're not going to be able to train at that maximum output that you would if you rested a little bit longer. And this could inhibit your progress, especially if you're training for something like sprinting or some type of high intensity sport.
- **[03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8rMgJRuGj00&t=199s)** — 30 second rest is not going to be enough. You're not going to replenish your ATP. The best thing to do, especially if you're doing this high intensity interval training, to rest like four to five minutes between these sets.
- **[03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8rMgJRuGj00&t=209s)** — That'll give your body a chance to replenish the ATP and be able to train for more maximum power. Because also the intensity is really the key with exercise. The more intense, the more growth hormone, the more muscle activation.
- **[03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8rMgJRuGj00&t=224s)** — So it's much smarter to focus on the intensity and less reps and maybe more sets, then bring your intensity down because you're too tired and then try to do like a lot of reps because now you have to lower the weight and then you do less sets.
- **[04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8rMgJRuGj00&t=241s)** — So more rest between the sets, lower reps, high intensity. Also a lot of the benefit from this exercise, especially high intensity, occurs one to two days later when you're sleeping. You're creating all this damage with the muscle and then in the repair process your body becomes stronger because it's adapting to that stress.
- **[04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8rMgJRuGj00&t=264s)** — And let me just touch a little bit more on this high intensity interval training. So let's say, for example, you do some type of exercise to get your pulse rate really, really high, right? So let's say it's sprinting. You're sprinting as fast as you can for 10 seconds and your pulse rate comes all the way up to, I don't know, maybe 160, 170 or higher. What's causing that to go higher is the sympathetic nervous system. At the point where you're done sprinting, whether it's sprinting or
- **[04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8rMgJRuGj00&t=294s)** — maybe even running up the stairs, you're now going to rest. And a lot of people do what's called active recovery, which they maybe walk in place or they're doing some type of exercise where they're still exercising but not as a higher intensity. And that might work for some people if you're maybe doing sprinting and walking. But a much better idea would be to come to a full stop after the sprint. So why would a full stop be better than this active recovery? Well, because
- **[05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8rMgJRuGj00&t=324s)** — when you stop working out after a high intense type of activity, your pulse rate is going to come down, right? What's causing the pulse rate to come down is something called the parasympathetic nervous system. It kind of opposes this sympathetic response. So the sympathetic is raising your pulse rate. That parasympathetic is actively pushing that pulse rate down, much similar to when you pump the brakes after you're going
- **[05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8rMgJRuGj00&t=354s)** — fast in your car. You pump the brakes, you let off the gas. Now we're pumping the brakes. The parasympathetic come in there and actually push your pulse rate down. So when you come to a full stop and you're not exercising and you're sitting there, your body is exercising the parasympathetic nervous system. And this is a kind of a subtle thing but an important thing to do if you want to exercise and make stronger your recovery. And the reason I know about this is in
- **[06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8rMgJRuGj00&t=384s)** — practice, I had something called a heart rate variability testing unit and I would measure the recovery after exercise. And those people who did this, where they basically came to a full stop, started to show stronger parasympathetic nervous system control over time. And also remember that the vagus nerve is part of that parasympathetic nervous system. That's the main nerve that controls a lot of the digestive system, the heart, and many of the organs in your abdomen.
- **[06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8rMgJRuGj00&t=414s)** — And a strong parasympathetic nervous system will help you sleep at night, help you recover, especially after exercise. The next thing I want to bring up is something called contrast therapy. Where after an exercise, you either take a cold shower, and then you maybe take a hot shower, or you can do an ice bath and a sauna or a whirlpool. Now there's a lot of data to show that that really helps recovery and repair and it speeds up the rejuvenation process.
- **[07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8rMgJRuGj00&t=444s)** — Of that muscle damage, decreasing the inflammation and just decreasing the time it takes to repair. Now I've been experimenting with this and I found that I'm getting a lot of recovery after I do this cold water immersion. I have this unit that I jump into. I use this after the workout. It seems to be working very, very well. I have not added the heat therapy after that, but I'm going to experiment with that at some point. But if you can add cold after the exercise or even heat,
- **[07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8rMgJRuGj00&t=474s)** — whether it's a shower, sauna, whirlpool, you can increase more benefits, especially if you're someone like me, that tends to have more genetics leaning towards inflammation. And that's been my problem even in sports is that I have to be very careful of over training. And I also have to put a lot of it more attention on recovery between the exercise. And of course, I didn't know this when I was in sports. And so I just work out a couple times a day, seven days a week. Big mistake because
- **[08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8rMgJRuGj00&t=504s)** — at the end of the wrestling season, I could barely walk. The other thing I want to mention about this topic is you have muscle contraction and you have muscle relaxation. Okay. And the motions that shorten the muscle are called contractions or concentric motions. They're shortening the muscle. When you elongate the muscle, that's called eccentric motion. For example, if I'm going to do a pull up, I bring my
- **[08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8rMgJRuGj00&t=533s)** — chin over the bar. Okay, when I let myself down, I elongate the muscle. That's called a centric motion. Or for example, let's say I do a push up and then I let myself down slowly. That's also called a centric motion. And sometimes we forget about that because maybe we do this push up or we're pushing hard and then letting ourself passively go down or do a pull up or pulling hard and then very quickly letting ourselves go
- **[09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8rMgJRuGj00&t=563s)** — down the other direction. If you focus on the eccentric motions, you will get a lot more benefits from that workout. That can be related to doing a bench press or any type of exercise. Focus on the negative motion, elongation of that muscle. And you'll have stronger muscles, better recovery, bigger muscles, faster muscles, and even delayed soreness because you're adding more force to that muscle. And it's also a good
- **[09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8rMgJRuGj00&t=593s)** — way to progress. For example, a lot of times people can't do more than a few pull ups, right? If you were to get some type of step stool and stand on the step stool and help your body lift up with that pull up and then focus on slowly letting yourself down the eccentric muscles and you do that after a while, probably two or three weeks, you're going to find that you're going to be able to do way more pull ups because you worked on the reverse motion of that. Next topic is about
- **[10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8rMgJRuGj00&t=623s)** — carbohydrates. If you do a workout and you do a little snack before, during, or after the workout like a lot of people do, they want to get those carbs in there. Maybe they do a protein bar with sugar or they might do an energy drink, Gatorade with sugar. You're shutting down the benefits of ketosis, fat burning, as well as autophagy, which is the recycling of old damaged proteins in your body. The kind of the anti-aging effect. So here you are spending all this energy doing this
- **[10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8rMgJRuGj00&t=653s)** — workout and then this little bit of carb pretty much just nullifies the benefits, especially if you are trying to lose weight around the midsection. It's very beneficial to build up to the point where you exercise in a fasting state, maybe eat the next hour or hour and a half or two hours later. That would actually give you more improvements. Now that being said, when we're dealing with hormones, insulin always comes up when people work out and we're told that
- **[11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8rMgJRuGj00&t=683s)** — insulin will help. It's an anabolic hormone. It helps build that muscle. The research is mixed on that. Kind of on some studies it says it does. Other studies it says it doesn't. But I do know that it does affect the muscle and the ability for proteins or amino acids to go in the muscle and it preserves the muscle from losing protein. So what do we want to do? Do we want to increase insulin or not? Well, when someone's a diabetic or they consume a lot of carbs, they have insulin resistance.
- **[11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8rMgJRuGj00&t=713s)** — And when you have insulin resistance, you actually have a deficiency of insulin. This is why even diabetics have more muscle loss. Or people with insulin resistance, they have a hard time building their muscle. So what they've been told is like, oh, you just need to increase your carbs so you can increase insulin and build up more muscle. I wouldn't recommend that. What I would recommend is when you do the ketogenic diet, which is a low carb diet, bring your carbs up to 50 grams. And the type of carbs that you could do
- **[12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8rMgJRuGj00&t=742s)** — to fulfill that would be berries. So like three cups of berries per day would give you 50 grams of carbs. And maybe if you're younger, you can go a little bit higher than that, maybe up to 75. And the other thing to know about insulin is that you can also increase insulin by eating protein. Like even if you had 20 grams of protein in a meal, you would still raise insulin to some degree. Not as strong as carbs, but you'll increase it. So you'll have more insulin and you don't have to worry about increasing or adding sugar to it.
- **[12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8rMgJRuGj00&t=772s)** — But protein does increase insulin, but it also increases the opposing hormone called glucagon, which also helps fat burning and helps with muscle building. I also recommend adding in an electrolyte powder or more electrolytes because potassium, magnesium, calcium, chlorides, these are really important in the muscle contraction and relaxation and the power of the nervous system as well as the muscle. You're going to find if you have sufficient electrolytes, you'll have stronger muscles and you'll be more
- **[13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8rMgJRuGj00&t=802s)** — hydrated as well. But don't forget about the electrolyte sodium. The other point I want to bring up is when you eat that meal after you work out, maybe one to two, even three hours later, what should that meal be? Well, the most important thing to talk about is protein.
- **[13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8rMgJRuGj00&t=818s)** — Okay, and there's a lot to this topic, but I'm just going to give you the summary of it. The absolute best protein for muscle growth, repair, exercise is red meat. Okay, you can do that in hamburger or steak or whatever. You can do also lamb, which is a red meat or other types of red meat. Why is red meat so important?
- **[14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8rMgJRuGj00&t=843s)** — Not only does it have more concentrated amino acids and bioavailable amino acids than chicken, especially, than plant based proteins, which are very insufficient, but red meat is kind of what you're trying to build. You're trying to build your own red meat. And so you're going to get a really good smorgasbord of all the factors that come along with building muscle, repair of muscle and giving energy to the muscle.
- **[14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8rMgJRuGj00&t=870s)** — So we have something called carnitine and carnitine is kind of like a little shuttle bus that takes fat and it pushes it into the motor or the mitochondria, the energy factory. It allows you to burn more fat. That's carnitine. And that's in red meat and high amounts. Then we have creatine. What does that do? That gives your muscles the fuel for high intense burst of exercise. And it just so happens that red meat is loaded with creatine.
- **[14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8rMgJRuGj00&t=898s)** — Then we have another one called carnosine. That's in red meat and that can act as an antioxidant to buffer some of the lactic acid, the acidity that's generated when you exercise. That can actually increase your performance, increase your longevity, allow you to work out longer. But that's not all. Red meat also has all the co-factors. And I'm talking about like iron, the B vitamins that are necessary to allow these amino acids to work.
- **[15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8rMgJRuGj00&t=928s)** — You see, if you just consume like whey protein powder, you don't get the co-factors. You don't get the vitamins and minerals that allow that protein to be metabolized like you would if you had red meat.
- **[15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8rMgJRuGj00&t=940s)** — I mean, just think about this for a second. Inside your muscles, okay, what generates the energy is the mitochondria. I don't know if you've ever taken biochemistry before, but even if you have, most people still are still confused on what this Krebs cycle is all about.
- **[15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8rMgJRuGj00&t=956s)** — The Krebs cycle is like an assembly line of little things that occur inside the cells, inside the mitochondria. And your body is taking this food and transforming it into energy as ATP storage.
- **[16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8rMgJRuGj00&t=975s)** — And it's turning food into the building blocks so you can build up body tissue and body chemistry.
- **[16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8rMgJRuGj00&t=983s)** — So that's simply what the Krebs cycle is. But what a lot of people don't know is when you go through the different points or stages on this assembly line, you need certain nutrients for that to work.
- **[16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8rMgJRuGj00&t=994s)** — If you are low in these certain nutrients, you get a bottleneck. It just stops working and that's going to affect the Krebs cycle.
- **[16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8rMgJRuGj00&t=1003s)** — And that's going to back up your energy and your biochemistry of someplace which is occurring somewhere in the body.
- **[16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8rMgJRuGj00&t=1009s)** — There's actually a way to test it, which I'm going to do some videos about. But the point is you want this entire assembly line to be free flowing without any micronutrients missing.
- **[17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8rMgJRuGj00&t=1020s)** — I'm talking about iron, B1, B2, B3, B6, B5, magnesium, manganese, and another nutrient called coenzyme Q10. That's in the mitochondria as well.
- **[17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8rMgJRuGj00&t=1031s)** — Well guess what? When you have red meat, you don't have to worry about it. It's all in there. If you have a high quality like grass-fed beef or hamburger, whatever, all of those co-factors, everything I talked about is in a package.
- **[17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8rMgJRuGj00&t=1045s)** — It's inside there. You have everything you need to build muscle and repair the muscle. So these people that are cutting out red meat, they're maybe doing chicken breasts, which has way too many omega-6 fatty acids.
- **[17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8rMgJRuGj00&t=1056s)** — And it's definitely of lesser quality. And so is like plant-based protein. That's like really low on the list. Whereas sometimes people think those are clean proteins to help you. They're not. There's other things you can do too. You can do eggs, and those are good.
- **[17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8rMgJRuGj00&t=1069s)** — But if you do eggs, make sure they're not raw, because the raw can deplete your biotin, and it's not nearly as bioavailable as the cooked eggs.
- **[17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8rMgJRuGj00&t=1078s)** — Another protein that's not bad is a real good high quality cheese. Think about it. Where does cheese come from? It comes from milk. In nature, when does an animal need milk? When they're growing? Why? Because milk has a lot of growth factors to help muscle building.
- **[18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8rMgJRuGj00&t=1097s)** — And so a little bit of cheese can do wonders on your muscles for growth and increasing muscle size. Just don't do the low quality cheeses. If you can find a European cheese that's literally raw, that would be the best.
- **[18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8rMgJRuGj00&t=1111s)** — And another thing about cheese is it's fermented. So it has the additional benefits of the microbes. And it's better than whey protein, because whey protein is a different type of protein, and it's like purified. So it's kind of a refined protein product.
- **[18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8rMgJRuGj00&t=1125s)** — One last thing about red meat. Don't get the lean. I mean, if it comes lean because the animal is lean, that's fine. But don't try to have some type of animal protein that they've taken away the fat. Because again, that's refining the process. Grass fed beef would be the best, but just don't try to get the leanest version.
- **[19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8rMgJRuGj00&t=1146s)** — But again, it's hard to fatten these grass fed animals because they're not feeding them grains. Well, that's fine. But people are tend to obsessing with this low fat or lean this and lean that. Even if you have chicken, at least make sure it has the skin on it. Or if you have fish, it'd be a little bit better if you have the skin on it.
- **[19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8rMgJRuGj00&t=1164s)** — Another point I want to talk about is the recovery in between the workout. So let's say you exercise and you get sore. If you're sore, you should not exercise over that soreness. Let your body recover. And sometimes it might take more than a day or two or three or even four days. And instead focus on your sleep. But I just want to make one little point about the sleep. If you are an athlete and you work out hard, okay, one trace metal that usually shows up low and athletes is copper.
- **[19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8rMgJRuGj00&t=1195s)** — And that can lessen your ability to sleep, especially the REM sleep. So if you're an athlete and you're finding that you can't get the seven or seven and a half or eight hours, add a little copper before bed to your diet. Not a lot, just a little bit. And watch what happens. It might just enhance your sleep. You don't have to do it for a long period of time, maybe for a couple of weeks. But the point is that that exercise is depleting your copper and you need to know how to get more copper from the diet.
- **[20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8rMgJRuGj00&t=1224s)** — Now I've given you a lot of tips of what to do to optimize your workouts before, during and after a workout. But there's some really interesting information relating to this red meat and what's in a red meat that can help you recover from exercise. And I put that video up right here. Check it out.

- **[00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vL7NVrC_sUc&t=0s)** — Let's discuss what to drink when you're doing fasting, okay, in general.
- **[00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vL7NVrC_sUc&t=4s)** — Does it really matter?
- **[00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vL7NVrC_sUc&t=5s)** — Are there things that will bump you out of ketosis?
- **[00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vL7NVrC_sUc&t=8s)** — Let's first start with water.
- **[00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vL7NVrC_sUc&t=10s)** — Please comment down below of what type of water that you drink.
- **[00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vL7NVrC_sUc&t=15s)** — Is it tap water, plastic bottles?
- **[00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vL7NVrC_sUc&t=17s)** — Do you use glass bottles? Do you use a water filter?
- **[00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vL7NVrC_sUc&t=19s)** — I'm really curious.
- **[00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vL7NVrC_sUc&t=21s)** — Obviously, you probably already know that
- **[00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vL7NVrC_sUc&t=23s)** — tap water is pretty toxic.
- **[00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vL7NVrC_sUc&t=25s)** — So a lot of people are shifting to more bottled water.
- **[00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vL7NVrC_sUc&t=28s)** — The problem with bottled water is that
- **[00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vL7NVrC_sUc&t=30s)** — you're constantly consuming microplastics
- **[00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vL7NVrC_sUc&t=33s)** — and once it gets in your body, it's really hard to get out of your body.
- **[00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vL7NVrC_sUc&t=37s)** — And these are endocrine disruptors.
- **[00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vL7NVrC_sUc&t=39s)** — So in other words, they mimic estrogen
- **[00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vL7NVrC_sUc&t=41s)** — and they kind of mess up your hormones.
- **[00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vL7NVrC_sUc&t=44s)** — But there are certain types of plastics that are lower than others
- **[00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vL7NVrC_sUc&t=47s)** — like Perrier, Pellegrino, Lacroix, things like that.
- **[00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vL7NVrC_sUc&t=52s)** — And then of course, when you get into glass bottles,
- **[00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vL7NVrC_sUc&t=54s)** — those are better but they're very expensive.
- **[00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vL7NVrC_sUc&t=57s)** — And then you also have the canned water, right?
- **[00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vL7NVrC_sUc&t=59s)** — That is expensive but it also has another toxin called BPA.
- **[01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vL7NVrC_sUc&t=64s)** — Unless you live on a farm like I do and get your water from
- **[01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vL7NVrC_sUc&t=70s)** — you know, a well or a spring,
- **[01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vL7NVrC_sUc&t=72s)** — you're going to be better off getting a water filter.
- **[01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vL7NVrC_sUc&t=74s)** — When I lived in the city,
- **[01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vL7NVrC_sUc&t=77s)** — there was a really good water filter I got
- **[01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vL7NVrC_sUc&t=78s)** — from a company called Crystal Quest.
- **[01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vL7NVrC_sUc&t=81s)** — I'll put a link down below.
- **[01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vL7NVrC_sUc&t=82s)** — I'm not affiliated with this company.
- **[01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vL7NVrC_sUc&t=84s)** — I'm not getting an affiliate check or anything like that.
- **[01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vL7NVrC_sUc&t=86s)** — But it's a good company for different water filters.
- **[01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vL7NVrC_sUc&t=89s)** — But they have some really good pitchers
- **[01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vL7NVrC_sUc&t=91s)** — that I want to talk about like these
- **[01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vL7NVrC_sUc&t=92s)** — containers of water you can keep in your fridge.
- **[01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vL7NVrC_sUc&t=95s)** — So you just get it from the tap.
- **[01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vL7NVrC_sUc&t=97s)** — It filters it through four stages.
- **[01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vL7NVrC_sUc&t=98s)** — It pulls out the heavy metals, the chemicals, the medications,
- **[01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vL7NVrC_sUc&t=102s)** — bacteria, all this other stuff.
- **[01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vL7NVrC_sUc&t=103s)** — And you have some really good clean water.
- **[01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vL7NVrC_sUc&t=105s)** — And I'm not sure if they have shower filters that pull out fluoride.
- **[01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vL7NVrC_sUc&t=108s)** — And if you get rid of this fluoride,
- **[01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vL7NVrC_sUc&t=110s)** — you're going to find like your skin does a lot better.
- **[01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vL7NVrC_sUc&t=113s)** — And if you do do plastic water or these
- **[01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vL7NVrC_sUc&t=115s)** — canned water type things,
- **[01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vL7NVrC_sUc&t=117s)** — I probably just wouldn't do a lot of them.
- **[01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vL7NVrC_sUc&t=119s)** — You know, just don't make it your lion's share of liquids.
- **[02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vL7NVrC_sUc&t=123s)** — When I drink water,
- **[02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vL7NVrC_sUc&t=124s)** — I just don't feel that my thirst gets quenched.
- **[02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vL7NVrC_sUc&t=128s)** — There's something about it.
- **[02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vL7NVrC_sUc&t=129s)** — But when I drink carbonated water,
- **[02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vL7NVrC_sUc&t=132s)** — it's a whole different story.
- **[02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vL7NVrC_sUc&t=133s)** — I actually feel more hydrated.
- **[02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vL7NVrC_sUc&t=135s)** — I can drink that. It goes down fine.
- **[02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vL7NVrC_sUc&t=137s)** — And I do want to mention a theory I have on why that is
- **[02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vL7NVrC_sUc&t=141s)** — I think better for me.
- **[02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vL7NVrC_sUc&t=142s)** — Is because first of all, there's carbon dioxide.
- **[02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vL7NVrC_sUc&t=146s)** — When you introduce carbon dioxide to your body,
- **[02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vL7NVrC_sUc&t=149s)** — you create some real interesting effects,
- **[02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vL7NVrC_sUc&t=152s)** — especially with oxygen.
- **[02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vL7NVrC_sUc&t=154s)** — You actually increase more oxygen into your tissues.
- **[02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vL7NVrC_sUc&t=159s)** — With the carbon dioxide,
- **[02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vL7NVrC_sUc&t=160s)** — you also acidify the water a little bit more.
- **[02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vL7NVrC_sUc&t=164s)** — And that could potentially be better on your digestion.
- **[02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vL7NVrC_sUc&t=167s)** — But yes, we do need oxygen,
- **[02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vL7NVrC_sUc&t=169s)** — but we also need CO2.
- **[02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vL7NVrC_sUc&t=171s)** — Equally is important.
- **[02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vL7NVrC_sUc&t=173s)** — In fact, there's something called the Bohr effect.
- **[02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vL7NVrC_sUc&t=176s)** — The CO2 helps take that oxygen that gets absorbed in your blood
- **[03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vL7NVrC_sUc&t=180s)** — and helps push it deeper into your cells.
- **[03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vL7NVrC_sUc&t=183s)** — Let me just give you an example of
- **[03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vL7NVrC_sUc&t=185s)** — what happens when you get too much oxygen.
- **[03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vL7NVrC_sUc&t=187s)** — When you're hyperventilating
- **[03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vL7NVrC_sUc&t=189s)** — and you can feel more anxiety and more dizzy,
- **[03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vL7NVrC_sUc&t=192s)** — things like that.
- **[03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vL7NVrC_sUc&t=193s)** — So what's the remedy?
- **[03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vL7NVrC_sUc&t=194s)** — To breathe in a paper bag.
- **[03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vL7NVrC_sUc&t=196s)** — What are you doing when you're breathing in a paper bag?
- **[03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vL7NVrC_sUc&t=198s)** — You're getting more CO2,
- **[03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vL7NVrC_sUc&t=200s)** — which then helps the oxygen go into the tissues
- **[03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vL7NVrC_sUc&t=203s)** — and it can pull you out of a state of anxiety very, very quickly.
- **[03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vL7NVrC_sUc&t=207s)** — So again, we need this balance of CO2 and oxygen.
- **[03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vL7NVrC_sUc&t=211s)** — This is why,
- **[03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vL7NVrC_sUc&t=213s)** — anytime you're stressed, you should slow down your breathing,
- **[03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vL7NVrC_sUc&t=215s)** — breathe through your nose, slowly, in and out.
- **[03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vL7NVrC_sUc&t=219s)** — And in your sinuses, you actually condition the air
- **[03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vL7NVrC_sUc&t=221s)** — to allow better oxygen that penetrates deeper into the cells
- **[03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vL7NVrC_sUc&t=226s)** — with the CO2.
- **[03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vL7NVrC_sUc&t=227s)** — And so the CO2 in the water does help increase
- **[03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vL7NVrC_sUc&t=231s)** — something called the parasympathetic nervous system,
- **[03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vL7NVrC_sUc&t=234s)** — which actually is more calming
- **[03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vL7NVrC_sUc&t=236s)** — and it's more for relaxation.
- **[03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vL7NVrC_sUc&t=239s)** — And then we have, what can you put in your water?
- **[04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vL7NVrC_sUc&t=242s)** — Let's first start with
- **[04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vL7NVrC_sUc&t=244s)** — apple cider vinegar.
- **[04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vL7NVrC_sUc&t=246s)** — Okay, one tablespoon in a glass of water.
- **[04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vL7NVrC_sUc&t=248s)** — What does that do?
- **[04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vL7NVrC_sUc&t=250s)** — It can give you energy directly.
- **[04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vL7NVrC_sUc&t=252s)** — It can help with insulin resistance.
- **[04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vL7NVrC_sUc&t=255s)** — It can actually help make insulin more sensitive.
- **[04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vL7NVrC_sUc&t=258s)** — It can help the mitochondria work better.
- **[04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vL7NVrC_sUc&t=262s)** — It's also been shown in animal studies
- **[04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vL7NVrC_sUc&t=264s)** — to help counter the negative effect of aging
- **[04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vL7NVrC_sUc&t=268s)** — on your mitochondria.
- **[04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vL7NVrC_sUc&t=270s)** — That's pretty cool.
- **[04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vL7NVrC_sUc&t=271s)** — And it can even help you if you have a fatty liver.
- **[04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vL7NVrC_sUc&t=275s)** — If you add some lemon to that,
- **[04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vL7NVrC_sUc&t=276s)** — you get some additional benefits of vitamin C,
- **[04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vL7NVrC_sUc&t=279s)** — if it's from raw lemons.
- **[04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vL7NVrC_sUc&t=280s)** — I also add my electrolyte powder to the water sometimes.
- **[04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vL7NVrC_sUc&t=286s)** — Not with every single glass of water,
- **[04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vL7NVrC_sUc&t=288s)** — but maybe one time in the morning.
- **[04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vL7NVrC_sUc&t=290s)** — Some sea salt to the water.
- **[04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vL7NVrC_sUc&t=293s)** — This is something that I think is just really underrated,
- **[04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vL7NVrC_sUc&t=296s)** — but very important that a lot of people forget about
- **[04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vL7NVrC_sUc&t=299s)** — when they do the ketogenic diet.
- **[05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vL7NVrC_sUc&t=300s)** — If you don't have enough salt,
- **[05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vL7NVrC_sUc&t=303s)** — you're going to feel weak.
- **[05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vL7NVrC_sUc&t=305s)** — You're going to find that your sleep
- **[05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vL7NVrC_sUc&t=307s)** — isn't going to be as great.
- **[05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vL7NVrC_sUc&t=308s)** — In fact, just do an experiment.
- **[05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vL7NVrC_sUc&t=311s)** — Add a little bit of salt to some water
- **[05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vL7NVrC_sUc&t=313s)** — right after dinner and drink that down
- **[05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vL7NVrC_sUc&t=315s)** — and see if that doesn't improve your sleep.
- **[05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vL7NVrC_sUc&t=318s)** — Salt or sodium is very important
- **[05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vL7NVrC_sUc&t=321s)** — for reducing this stress state.
- **[05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vL7NVrC_sUc&t=324s)** — It's called the sympathetic nervous system.
- **[05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vL7NVrC_sUc&t=327s)** — Sodium helps reduce that.
- **[05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vL7NVrC_sUc&t=328s)** — If you're low on salt,
- **[05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vL7NVrC_sUc&t=329s)** — which a lot of people doing the ketogenic diet are,
- **[05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vL7NVrC_sUc&t=333s)** — especially if you're doing one meal a day,
- **[05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vL7NVrC_sUc&t=334s)** — they might end up finding that they feel a little bit weak,
- **[05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vL7NVrC_sUc&t=337s)** — their muscles tighten up,
- **[05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vL7NVrC_sUc&t=339s)** — they get more cramps,
- **[05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vL7NVrC_sUc&t=341s)** — all because they needed more sea salt.
- **[05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vL7NVrC_sUc&t=344s)** — I do have an electrolyte powder
- **[05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vL7NVrC_sUc&t=347s)** — specifically for sports.
- **[05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vL7NVrC_sUc&t=349s)** — If you're sweating that has more sodium.
- **[05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vL7NVrC_sUc&t=352s)** — So that can be something that you can use,
- **[05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vL7NVrC_sUc&t=354s)** — but the whole reason why I design my regular
- **[05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vL7NVrC_sUc&t=358s)** — electrolyte powder, which has a lower amount of salt,
- **[06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vL7NVrC_sUc&t=362s)** — is mainly for potassium and magnesium
- **[06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vL7NVrC_sUc&t=365s)** — because so many people just don't get enough of that.
- **[06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vL7NVrC_sUc&t=368s)** — And when someone starts getting enough of that,
- **[06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vL7NVrC_sUc&t=370s)** — boy, that can really change a lot of things
- **[06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vL7NVrC_sUc&t=372s)** — with their energy, their muscle, and their nervous system.
- **[06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vL7NVrC_sUc&t=377s)** — Okay, so that's water.
- **[06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vL7NVrC_sUc&t=378s)** — What about all these drinks that have stevia,
- **[06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vL7NVrC_sUc&t=382s)** — the natural sweetener?
- **[06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vL7NVrC_sUc&t=384s)** — You have to be careful because a lot of times
- **[06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vL7NVrC_sUc&t=386s)** — they'll add maltodextrin to this
- **[06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vL7NVrC_sUc&t=388s)** — natural sweetener, stevia.
- **[06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vL7NVrC_sUc&t=390s)** — So you have to make sure they don't put that in there.
- **[06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vL7NVrC_sUc&t=392s)** — But a lot of people have like different sodas
- **[06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vL7NVrC_sUc&t=395s)** — using stevia, different drinks with stevia, totally fine.
- **[06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vL7NVrC_sUc&t=398s)** — And you can also do the sugar alcohols,
- **[06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vL7NVrC_sUc&t=401s)** — but realize that a lot of times
- **[06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vL7NVrC_sUc&t=403s)** — they'll add different things in the ingredients.
- **[06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vL7NVrC_sUc&t=405s)** — So you have to read the label
- **[06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vL7NVrC_sUc&t=406s)** — and find something maybe with erythritol,
- **[06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vL7NVrC_sUc&t=409s)** — monk fruit, or stevia.
- **[06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vL7NVrC_sUc&t=410s)** — All right, what about coffee?
- **[06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vL7NVrC_sUc&t=412s)** — The thing about coffee, it's totally fine.
- **[06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vL7NVrC_sUc&t=415s)** — Personally, I just do one in the morning.
- **[06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vL7NVrC_sUc&t=417s)** — Some people do more.
- **[06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vL7NVrC_sUc&t=419s)** — Just realize that could affect your sleep
- **[07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vL7NVrC_sUc&t=420s)** — because of the caffeine.
- **[07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vL7NVrC_sUc&t=422s)** — I would recommend doing organic coffee
- **[07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vL7NVrC_sUc&t=424s)** — because out of all the things out there
- **[07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vL7NVrC_sUc&t=426s)** — that are so heavily sprayed with
- **[07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vL7NVrC_sUc&t=429s)** — insecticides and herbicides and fungicides,
- **[07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vL7NVrC_sUc&t=431s)** — coffee is at the top of the list.
- **[07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vL7NVrC_sUc&t=433s)** — And even better than even half and half,
- **[07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vL7NVrC_sUc&t=435s)** — like just 100% cream.
- **[07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vL7NVrC_sUc&t=437s)** — Sometimes people use bulletproof,
- **[07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vL7NVrC_sUc&t=439s)** — which is they're adding butter and MCT oil.
- **[07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vL7NVrC_sUc&t=442s)** — That's good for certain people,
- **[07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vL7NVrC_sUc&t=444s)** — but if you're trying to lose weight,
- **[07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vL7NVrC_sUc&t=446s)** — okay, and you add that,
- **[07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vL7NVrC_sUc&t=447s)** — that could slow you down a little bit
- **[07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vL7NVrC_sUc&t=449s)** — because your body is going to burn those fat calories
- **[07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vL7NVrC_sUc&t=452s)** — and not your own fat.
- **[07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vL7NVrC_sUc&t=454s)** — Now the next topic is tea.
- **[07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vL7NVrC_sUc&t=457s)** — You have black tea, green tea.
- **[07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vL7NVrC_sUc&t=458s)** — Just realize that if you do a lot of tea
- **[07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vL7NVrC_sUc&t=461s)** — in coffee, it can deplete you of vitamin B1.
- **[07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vL7NVrC_sUc&t=464s)** — So if that starts happening,
- **[07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vL7NVrC_sUc&t=466s)** — replace it with B1.
- **[07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vL7NVrC_sUc&t=467s)** — Because if you are low on B1,
- **[07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vL7NVrC_sUc&t=469s)** — you're going to feel irritable,
- **[07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vL7NVrC_sUc&t=471s)** — kind of stressed.
- **[07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vL7NVrC_sUc&t=472s)** — And you might think it's coming from stress,
- **[07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vL7NVrC_sUc&t=474s)** — but in reality, it's just coming from a B1 deficiency.
- **[07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vL7NVrC_sUc&t=477s)** — What about coconut water?
- **[07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vL7NVrC_sUc&t=479s)** — Well, some people can get away with that.
- **[08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vL7NVrC_sUc&t=481s)** — Most people cannot because there's sugar in coconut water.
- **[08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vL7NVrC_sUc&t=485s)** — There's electrolytes in there.
- **[08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vL7NVrC_sUc&t=486s)** — I would recommend not doing the coconut water.
- **[08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vL7NVrC_sUc&t=489s)** — Alright, what about alcohol?
- **[08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vL7NVrC_sUc&t=490s)** — Is that a good source of hydration?
- **[08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vL7NVrC_sUc&t=492s)** — No.
- **[08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vL7NVrC_sUc&t=494s)** — They recently have found out
- **[08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vL7NVrC_sUc&t=496s)** — that there is no benefits to alcohol.
- **[08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vL7NVrC_sUc&t=499s)** — Like they said before, like,
- **[08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vL7NVrC_sUc&t=500s)** — oh yeah, just enjoy a glass of wine each night
- **[08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vL7NVrC_sUc&t=503s)** — for your health, to add more health benefits.
- **[08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vL7NVrC_sUc&t=506s)** — They finally acknowledged that wasn't true.
- **[08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vL7NVrC_sUc&t=508s)** — Not to mention knocking you out of ketosis
- **[08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vL7NVrC_sUc&t=511s)** — and topogy, because of what it does to the liver.
- **[08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vL7NVrC_sUc&t=514s)** — Then we have something called kombucha.
- **[08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vL7NVrC_sUc&t=516s)** — A very carbonated,
- **[08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vL7NVrC_sUc&t=519s)** — highly pressured, so when you open it,
- **[08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vL7NVrC_sUc&t=521s)** — it could explode if you shake it.
- **[08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vL7NVrC_sUc&t=522s)** — But it's kind of a really acidic drink
- **[08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vL7NVrC_sUc&t=526s)** — that is really good if someone is coming off alcohol.
- **[08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vL7NVrC_sUc&t=529s)** — It gives kind of a calming effect.
- **[08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vL7NVrC_sUc&t=531s)** — It has a tiny little bit of alcohol,
- **[08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vL7NVrC_sUc&t=534s)** — but very carbonated,
- **[08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vL7NVrC_sUc&t=535s)** — but there's still some sugar in there
- **[08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vL7NVrC_sUc&t=536s)** — because that's how they make it.
- **[08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vL7NVrC_sUc&t=538s)** — The yeast actually eat up the sugar,
- **[09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vL7NVrC_sUc&t=541s)** — and it leaves you with all these different acids.
- **[09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vL7NVrC_sUc&t=545s)** — And a little bit of it is fine,
- **[09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vL7NVrC_sUc&t=547s)** — but I would not do a lot of it,
- **[09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vL7NVrC_sUc&t=548s)** — especially because it has a lot of sugar,
- **[09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vL7NVrC_sUc&t=551s)** — and it can actually slow down your benefits
- **[09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vL7NVrC_sUc&t=553s)** — of what you're trying to achieve.
- **[09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vL7NVrC_sUc&t=554s)** — What about blended shakes,
- **[09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vL7NVrC_sUc&t=556s)** — like kale and blueberry?
- **[09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vL7NVrC_sUc&t=558s)** — Those are fine, but they will kind of inhibit
- **[09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vL7NVrC_sUc&t=561s)** — your fasting to a certain degree,
- **[09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vL7NVrC_sUc&t=563s)** — because there's calories.
- **[09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vL7NVrC_sUc&t=565s)** — Now, the blueberries are a bit high in sugar,
- **[09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vL7NVrC_sUc&t=567s)** — so I would just look at that as a meal,
- **[09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vL7NVrC_sUc&t=571s)** — something that would be more around your meal,
- **[09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vL7NVrC_sUc&t=574s)** — not during the fasting time.
- **[09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vL7NVrC_sUc&t=577s)** — Now, what about sports drinks? Oh my gosh.
- **[09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vL7NVrC_sUc&t=579s)** — You really have to read the labels,
- **[09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vL7NVrC_sUc&t=581s)** — because like the Gatorade and Powerade
- **[09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vL7NVrC_sUc&t=585s)** — have a tremendous amount of sugar.
- **[09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vL7NVrC_sUc&t=586s)** — I'm talking like 34 grams of sugar.
- **[09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vL7NVrC_sUc&t=590s)** — I mean, if you compare that with a soda,
- **[09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vL7NVrC_sUc&t=592s)** — that has 39 grams of sugar.
- **[09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vL7NVrC_sUc&t=593s)** — And the type of sugar that they're giving you
- **[09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vL7NVrC_sUc&t=595s)** — is probably beet sugar, which is GMO.
- **[09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vL7NVrC_sUc&t=599s)** — And there's another type of drink called tonic drink,
- **[10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vL7NVrC_sUc&t=602s)** — which, I don't know, for some reason,
- **[10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vL7NVrC_sUc&t=604s)** — I love tonic drink, but the problem is
- **[10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vL7NVrC_sUc&t=606s)** — most of them have sugar.
- **[10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vL7NVrC_sUc&t=607s)** — You have to get the one that has zero sugar.
- **[10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vL7NVrC_sUc&t=610s)** — But anyway, I wanted to kind of give you
- **[10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vL7NVrC_sUc&t=611s)** — a summary of what you should drink when you're fasting.
- **[10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vL7NVrC_sUc&t=614s)** — And now the question is, what should you eat
- **[10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vL7NVrC_sUc&t=617s)** — when you come off fasting?
- **[10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vL7NVrC_sUc&t=619s)** — For that information, watch this video right here.

- **[00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15ZTN96VifU&t=0s)** — I like to talk about why I consume cheese every single day and why you should too.
- **[00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15ZTN96VifU&t=5s)** — No, it's not because I'm from Wisconsin. It's because cheese is a great protein source.
- **[00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15ZTN96VifU&t=10s)** — It's almost like a probiotic. And it's low in lactose. Okay, so it's totally keto friendly.
- **[00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15ZTN96VifU&t=15s)** — No, I'm not talking about processed cheese or Velveeta cheese. I think the best cheese would
- **[00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15ZTN96VifU&t=20s)** — be goat's cheese and sheep cheese. And I'm going to focus more on that in this talk.
- **[00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15ZTN96VifU&t=25s)** — Sheep cheese, goat cheese is A2 casein. That's the protein. And it's not going to create as much
- **[00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15ZTN96VifU&t=32s)** — issue on your digestive system. Some of the oldest people in the world consume sheep and goat cheese.
- **[00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15ZTN96VifU&t=40s)** — You're consuming a lot less lactose. Okay, that's the milk sugar. Cow's milk in general.
- **[00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15ZTN96VifU&t=46s)** — You're looking at about, I don't know, 3.8 to maybe 4% lactose. Mozzarella cheese or
- **[00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15ZTN96VifU&t=55s)** — cottage cheese, we're looking at between 1 and 4% lactose. But when we look at goat's cheese
- **[01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15ZTN96VifU&t=64s)** — or sheep cheese, now we're looking at like a 0.5%. That's a half of 1%. So it's so tiny,
- **[01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15ZTN96VifU&t=71s)** — it's you're not going to have any issues with that lactose component. And so now we have less
- **[01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15ZTN96VifU&t=75s)** — of a problem with lactose intolerance because it's barely anything there. And also less of a
- **[01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15ZTN96VifU&t=84s)** — problem is it's higher in protein, higher in vitamin A, E, folic acid, certain B vitamins,
- **[01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15ZTN96VifU&t=92s)** — calcium, CLA, which can actually help your exercise performance and weight loss.
- **[01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15ZTN96VifU&t=98s)** — Nearly 20 to 30% of the fat in sheep and goat cheese is MCT fats. And these fats are
- **[01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15ZTN96VifU&t=105s)** — really, really good because they bypass a lot of these systems and it goes right to the
- **[01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15ZTN96VifU&t=109s)** — liver and it's converted right into ketones. So you're generating quick energy. They're
- **[01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15ZTN96VifU&t=114s)** — going to be less stress on your digestion. MCT oil is partially made by the good bacteria
- **[01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15ZTN96VifU&t=119s)** — in the gut of these animals. I do consume cow cheese as well, but I make sure it's
- **[02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15ZTN96VifU&t=124s)** — from high quality sources, usually from Europe. I do not do the regular cheese that's
- **[02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15ZTN96VifU&t=128s)** — conventional. I do organic. If you can get a cheese that's been grown at high altitudes
- **[02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15ZTN96VifU&t=134s)** — in the mountains, like the Swiss Alps, because when these animals are grazing on higher
- **[02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15ZTN96VifU&t=139s)** — altitudes, the plants, the grass is higher to the sun and the sun's energy or radiation
- **[02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15ZTN96VifU&t=146s)** — are stronger. And so that plant or grass creates higher amounts of protective elements.
- **[02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15ZTN96VifU&t=153s)** — They're called polyphenols, which are phytonutrients. And so when you're
- **[02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15ZTN96VifU&t=157s)** — consuming this cheese that came from an animal that ate this grass at higher altitudes,
- **[02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15ZTN96VifU&t=161s)** — you're getting much higher polyphenols, which is also in grass-fed grass-finished
- **[02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15ZTN96VifU&t=166s)** — beef as well. When you introduce these polyphenols into the mitochondria, it triggers this what's
- **[02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15ZTN96VifU&t=174s)** — called an uncoupling effect. In the mitochondria, you can generate energy. When the mitochondria
- **[03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15ZTN96VifU&t=180s)** — is uncoupled, it goes to a different pathway. We're making a lot of heat and that's generating
- **[03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15ZTN96VifU&t=186s)** — a lot of extra, you could say wasted energy. So it's not very efficient. And this is a
- **[03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15ZTN96VifU&t=192s)** — good thing if you're trying to lose weight. But let me just give you another angle to this.
- **[03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15ZTN96VifU&t=196s)** — In the 30s, there was a certain drug, DNP. When they gave this drug to people in small doses,
- **[03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15ZTN96VifU&t=203s)** — they would lose about a pound a week, right? They're excited about that. But when they
- **[03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15ZTN96VifU&t=207s)** — increased the dosage, they started losing like five pounds of fat per week. But it's a drug
- **[03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15ZTN96VifU&t=213s)** — and it has side effects. It was so inefficient and wasted so much fuel,
- **[03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15ZTN96VifU&t=218s)** — the person couldn't get energy anymore. Because you're generating less energy,
- **[03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15ZTN96VifU&t=222s)** — the body is going to make more mitochondria in the cell. It's called mitochondrial biogenesis.
- **[03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15ZTN96VifU&t=229s)** — Okay. And that's really, really interesting. So we have this interesting effect of these
- **[03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15ZTN96VifU&t=234s)** — polyphenols in the cheese, creating more mitochondria uncoupling and more mitochondria.
- **[04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15ZTN96VifU&t=240s)** — They have found in some studies that people that live a long time have more mitochondrial
- **[04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15ZTN96VifU&t=247s)** — uncoupling. And just as a side note or not, there's other ways to stimulate more mitochondrial
- **[04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15ZTN96VifU&t=252s)** — uncoupling. Exercise, cold therapy, fasting, and some of these polyphenols and other
- **[04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15ZTN96VifU&t=260s)** — phytonutrients like sulforaphane, turmeric, and the phytonutrient in green tea. And so the
- **[04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15ZTN96VifU&t=267s)** — reason I'm even bringing up the topic is because I think it's very, very interesting to
- **[04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15ZTN96VifU&t=271s)** — be able to get some of these phytonutrients from your foods, whether it's from a grass-fed
- **[04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15ZTN96VifU&t=275s)** — or grass-finished meat or even the cheese. Now there's another topic that relates to this that
- **[04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15ZTN96VifU&t=282s)** — has me analyze certain phytonutrients in the beef sample that actually I sent off
- **[04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15ZTN96VifU&t=289s)** — to an experiment. If you haven't seen that video, you have to see it. I put it up right
- **[04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15ZTN96VifU&t=294s)** — here. Check it out.

- **[00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-OEeg2P9QM&t=0s)** — Today we're going to talk about that... oh my goodness... the deeper source of your fatigue.
- **[00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-OEeg2P9QM&t=7s)** — Now I will say this, I am an expert in this area simply because I've been tired
- **[00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-OEeg2P9QM&t=11s)** — a good portion of my life and I overcame it. So I have something very important I want to share.
- **[00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-OEeg2P9QM&t=18s)** — I remember driving down the street with my wife in my late 20s, being completely exhausted,
- **[00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-OEeg2P9QM&t=22s)** — trying to find a healthy store to find some vitamin to give me energy. It never worked.
- **[00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-OEeg2P9QM&t=27s)** — I had tons and tons of vitamins and didn't know what was going on. So if I can teleport
- **[00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-OEeg2P9QM&t=32s)** — this video back in time and show it to myself, this video would have solved my problem if I
- **[00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-OEeg2P9QM&t=38s)** — really understood how the body makes energy. And also this is going to be very motivating
- **[00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-OEeg2P9QM&t=42s)** — to you, especially because you're going to finally understand what really is behind
- **[00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-OEeg2P9QM&t=47s)** — fatigue in general. Because you can take various vitamins and energy drinks and try
- **[00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-OEeg2P9QM&t=52s)** — and get more energy and more coffee. But that doesn't fix the real problem.
- **[00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-OEeg2P9QM&t=57s)** — And if you go to any of these 7-elevens, you'll see right at the front counter,
- **[01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-OEeg2P9QM&t=60s)** — this huge section, five hour energy drinks. Everything starts with this mitochondria. What
- **[01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-OEeg2P9QM&t=67s)** — is the mitochondria? It's an energy factory deep inside your cells that produces energy.
- **[01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-OEeg2P9QM&t=72s)** — If you have any aspects of fatigue, even if you exercise and you run out of gas really fast,
- **[01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-OEeg2P9QM&t=78s)** — or even if you have many of the different problems, the health problems that most people
- **[01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-OEeg2P9QM&t=81s)** — have, this mitochondria is at the root of it. In fact, most diseases come directly from
- **[01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-OEeg2P9QM&t=87s)** — this mitochondria. So what is the mitochondria? It's a battery making machine. Because food
- **[01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-OEeg2P9QM&t=94s)** — directly can't give you energy. It has to be converted into a chemical form of a battery
- **[01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-OEeg2P9QM&t=100s)** — so you can use it. And so the energy battery itself is called ATP. So the mitochondria is
- **[01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-OEeg2P9QM&t=107s)** — actually the battery maker and the ATP is the actual battery. And whether you took
- **[01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-OEeg2P9QM&t=113s)** — biochemistry or not, this might help you to understand the simplicity of what's going on
- **[01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-OEeg2P9QM&t=119s)** — with the massive complexity of what's happening inside that mitochondria.
- **[02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-OEeg2P9QM&t=124s)** — Maybe you have or you haven't heard about this Krebs cycle thing, right? That's actually
- **[02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-OEeg2P9QM&t=129s)** — the pre battery maker. Okay. So it comes right before the battery maker because the actual
- **[02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-OEeg2P9QM&t=134s)** — battery maker is connected to it. The Krebs cycle gets everything prepared and ready
- **[02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-OEeg2P9QM&t=138s)** — and helps strip out some of these electrons. But we have to somehow extract these electrons
- **[02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-OEeg2P9QM&t=145s)** — from the food that you eat. And since we're on the topic of food, certain foods have more
- **[02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-OEeg2P9QM&t=150s)** — energy than other foods. And so if you're living on ultra processed foods, it's going to
- **[02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-OEeg2P9QM&t=155s)** — be almost impossible to extract energy from that simply because it's dead. There's not a lot
- **[02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-OEeg2P9QM&t=160s)** — energy in there. And on top of that, there's a lot of nutritional factors in food that we need
- **[02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-OEeg2P9QM&t=167s)** — that the battery maker assembly line requires. In each step of the assembly line, okay, you
- **[02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-OEeg2P9QM&t=173s)** — need B1, B2, B3, folic acid, B12, magnesium, manganese, selenium, vitamin C, and something
- **[03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-OEeg2P9QM&t=183s)** — else called coenzyme Q10. So these are the helper molecules that are essential for making
- **[03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-OEeg2P9QM&t=188s)** — this battery. Now, there's a very, very important enzyme that's involved in making ATP. It's
- **[03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-OEeg2P9QM&t=195s)** — called ATP synthase. Not that you needed to know that, but what's interesting about this ATP
- **[03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-OEeg2P9QM&t=200s)** — enzyme is that it's very, very tiny and it's a turbine. It spins. It helps to generate
- **[03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-OEeg2P9QM&t=208s)** — energy, but it's very, very tiny. Okay, so it would take like 100,000 of these little enzymes
- **[03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-OEeg2P9QM&t=217s)** — to be the same width as one hair. Okay, so they're that tiny, but they're spinning at
- **[03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-OEeg2P9QM&t=223s)** — an incredible speed. And every time they rotate one rotation, they produce three
- **[03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-OEeg2P9QM&t=231s)** — ATP's. And so how fast do they rotate? Well, they're rotating roughly about 7,000 to 9,000
- **[03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-OEeg2P9QM&t=238s)** — rotations every single minute. So you can imagine how much ATP is generated. I mean,
- **[04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-OEeg2P9QM&t=244s)** — just one enzyme, you're talking like 27,000 ATP's per minute. Now, if we just look at one cell and
- **[04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-OEeg2P9QM&t=252s)** — determine how many mitochondria is in that one cell, you're looking at on average between
- **[04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-OEeg2P9QM&t=258s)** — a thousand to 2,500 mitochondria per cell. And how many cells do you have in your body?
- **[04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-OEeg2P9QM&t=266s)** — You have 10 trillion cells. Incredible. Now check this out. A healthy person makes a massive
- **[04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-OEeg2P9QM&t=273s)** — amount of ATP. The actual weight of that ATP would be equivalent to your own weight. So if I
- **[04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-OEeg2P9QM&t=280s)** — weigh 180 pounds, I make 180 pounds of ATP every single day. That would be equivalent to
- **[04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-OEeg2P9QM&t=289s)** — 1200 watts, which comes out to about 282 AA batteries. Now that might not seem like a
- **[04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-OEeg2P9QM&t=296s)** — lot of wattage, but your body is very efficient at using this energy. But the
- **[05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-OEeg2P9QM&t=301s)** — fascinating thing about this ATP is it's not really stored. It's generated on demand. So
- **[05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-OEeg2P9QM&t=308s)** — if you're not really exercising or moving, you're not going to generate nearly as much as if you
- **[05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-OEeg2P9QM&t=313s)** — were exercising. The point is that this ATP doesn't really get stored. Now when it's used,
- **[05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-OEeg2P9QM&t=319s)** — okay, it turns into ADP, which then can be recycled back to ATP. And ADP does get stored,
- **[05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-OEeg2P9QM&t=328s)** — but ADP gets recycled about a thousand times a day into ATP. And so at any given time during
- **[05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-OEeg2P9QM&t=336s)** — the day, you have really only a quarter of a kilogram of ATP. That's not that much. But as
- **[05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-OEeg2P9QM&t=344s)** — soon as you start exercising, that ATP generation goes way, way, way up. Now the next question is
- **[05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-OEeg2P9QM&t=350s)** — if we don't store ATP, what energy do we store? Well, there's two fuel sources. You have
- **[05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-OEeg2P9QM&t=357s)** — sugar stored as glycogen in your muscle and your liver, which it's not really that much. It's
- **[06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-OEeg2P9QM&t=363s)** — probably have 1700 calories worth of stored glycogen. And as soon as you deplete it,
- **[06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-OEeg2P9QM&t=369s)** — your body is going to require more sugar or glycogen if you're dependent on that sugar.
- **[06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-OEeg2P9QM&t=374s)** — But you also store energy as fat. And once your fat adapted, you can tap into this fat
- **[06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-OEeg2P9QM&t=381s)** — a lot easier because you've grooved into this ketosis by lowering your carbohydrates,
- **[06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-OEeg2P9QM&t=386s)** — and you become very efficient at burning fat. And then you can very easily use that fat as
- **[06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-OEeg2P9QM&t=391s)** — energy and have that go through this Krebs cycle. But if you're not fat adapted,
- **[06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-OEeg2P9QM&t=396s)** — you're going to run out of energy pretty quick because you haven't adapted to the fat fuel.
- **[06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-OEeg2P9QM&t=400s)** — You're just going to run out of energy. And so this is why the ketogenic diet is so important
- **[06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-OEeg2P9QM&t=404s)** — for your energy. First of all, you get more ATP from ketones and fat, then you do
- **[06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-OEeg2P9QM&t=409s)** — glycogen or sugar. And secondly, you have a lot of fat reserved to tap into. I mean,
- **[06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-OEeg2P9QM&t=414s)** — average person who's not overweight has about 100,000 calories of fat on their body compared
- **[07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-OEeg2P9QM&t=420s)** — to the glycogen storage, which is only like 1700, enough for one day. So with my problem,
- **[07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-OEeg2P9QM&t=427s)** — way back when I was in my late 20s, I would consume pure carbohydrates. Okay. And my energy
- **[07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-OEeg2P9QM&t=434s)** — would come up when I would eat and then it would come crashing down because I ran out of
- **[07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-OEeg2P9QM&t=438s)** — energy and I required more sugar or more carbs to get my energy. I was completely
- **[07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-OEeg2P9QM&t=443s)** — dependent on carbs. I didn't know about ketosis back then, but I was always tired, especially
- **[07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-OEeg2P9QM&t=449s)** — in my head. Even when I would wake up in the morning, I would be so tired and I couldn't wake
- **[07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-OEeg2P9QM&t=457s)** — up like mentally until later in the morning or even the midday. So what's significant about
- **[07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-OEeg2P9QM&t=464s)** — that is that 70% of all your ATP is used by your brain. Your brain hogs a lot of this ATP.
- **[07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-OEeg2P9QM&t=472s)** — So if there's not enough of this ATP to go around for various reasons, your brain's going
- **[07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-OEeg2P9QM&t=478s)** — to suffer. And this is why we have so many problems with dementia, ADD, brain degenerative
- **[08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-OEeg2P9QM&t=485s)** — disorders, mood disorders. I mean, try to be depressed when you have a lot of energy
- **[08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-OEeg2P9QM&t=491s)** — available with your mitochondria. It's virtually impossible. If you reflect back on the times
- **[08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-OEeg2P9QM&t=497s)** — that you were depressed, chances are you were also tired at the same time. So the first clue
- **[08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-OEeg2P9QM&t=501s)** — about getting energy is to get on the ketogenic diet. So then you can supply your body with a
- **[08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-OEeg2P9QM&t=506s)** — quick source of fuel, which is more efficient. So you can not only make more ATP, but then so
- **[08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-OEeg2P9QM&t=511s)** — you can tap into this energy reserve a lot quicker and not be stuck with this machine
- **[08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-OEeg2P9QM&t=518s)** — that's only dependent on glucose as your fuel. It's dependent on cofactors. Yeah, research
- **[08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-OEeg2P9QM&t=524s)** — now has shown that the primary source of oxidative stress in cells is leakage of oxygen
- **[08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-OEeg2P9QM&t=530s)** — and these electrons from the mitochondria. And this leakage increases when the key nutrients
- **[08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-OEeg2P9QM&t=537s)** — or protective molecules are missing, like coenzyme Q10, especially if the person is taking
- **[09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-OEeg2P9QM&t=543s)** — a statin drug or other drugs that deplete that nutrient. That's a really important nutrient
- **[09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-OEeg2P9QM&t=548s)** — to help transport electrons. Now it just so happens that that biochemical pathway that
- **[09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-OEeg2P9QM&t=554s)** — the coenzyme Q10, which is needed to generate energy, is the same pathway that we make cholesterol.
- **[09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-OEeg2P9QM&t=563s)** — And so the drug statin, which basically inhibits that enzyme, also inhibits coenzyme Q10. And
- **[09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-OEeg2P9QM&t=570s)** — this is why one of the biggest side effects from people taking statins involves muscle
- **[09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-OEeg2P9QM&t=577s)** — problems, weak muscles, inflamed muscles, muscle disorders, lack of energy. Because think
- **[09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-OEeg2P9QM&t=583s)** — just in general, your muscles need energy to function. I mean, this is how we move.
- **[09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-OEeg2P9QM&t=589s)** — You can't move without muscles. So you'd imagine how much mitochondria is in your muscles and how
- **[09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-OEeg2P9QM&t=595s)** — much coenzyme Q10 that we need in our muscles. In fact, if you wanted to consume something
- **[10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-OEeg2P9QM&t=600s)** — with high amounts of coenzyme Q10, you want to eat muscle, like red meat, fish, things like
- **[10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-OEeg2P9QM&t=608s)** — the food that has the highest amount would be organ meats, liver, and especially heart extract.
- **[10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-OEeg2P9QM&t=615s)** — You can probably get in supplements, but people don't typically eat heart. But it's something that
- **[10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-OEeg2P9QM&t=621s)** — has a lot of coenzyme Q10. But you have to also realize that your body makes coenzyme Q10.
- **[10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-OEeg2P9QM&t=626s)** — So it's not just necessarily dependent on the diet. You can make it as well. If you have all
- **[10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-OEeg2P9QM&t=631s)** — the cofactors that allow it to be generated. And so all those cofactors, especially B
- **[10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-OEeg2P9QM&t=636s)** — needed to allow coenzyme Q10 to work. So just as a side note, if you're on a statin,
- **[10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-OEeg2P9QM&t=643s)** — if you're in a beta blocker, if you're on some medication for diabetes, chances are your coenzyme
- **[10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-OEeg2P9QM&t=650s)** — Q10 is very, very low. So you should start taking that. There's an interesting study that
- **[10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-OEeg2P9QM&t=656s)** — I will put down below about exercise. They tested like athletes versus people who don't
- **[11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-OEeg2P9QM&t=663s)** — and they gave them coenzyme Q10. So in both groups, they found significant improvement in
- **[11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-OEeg2P9QM&t=670s)** — endurance. So you can go longer without being tired. And now you know why. Because that
- **[11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-OEeg2P9QM&t=676s)** — coenzyme Q10 is necessary in the generation of ATP, as well as acting as an antioxidant to
- **[11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-OEeg2P9QM&t=683s)** — protect you against all this free radical damage that's created from the exercise.
- **[11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-OEeg2P9QM&t=687s)** — So one big side effect from statins too is you just run out of gas really quick,
- **[11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-OEeg2P9QM&t=691s)** — especially if you exert yourself or you exercise. Now, as far as the food that you should be
- **[11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-OEeg2P9QM&t=695s)** — eating, you want food that contains a lot of electrons and a lot of life and a lot of energy
- **[11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-OEeg2P9QM&t=701s)** — so you can extract the energy from them. If you're consuming like what the average American
- **[11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-OEeg2P9QM&t=705s)** — consumes, processed foods, I think it's 83% of all the calories in the grocery store are
- **[11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-OEeg2P9QM&t=711s)** — ultra processed foods. They don't resemble the actual food. It's going to be literally impossible
- **[11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-OEeg2P9QM&t=716s)** — to get energy if you're eating those foods. So we want nutrient dense foods with red meat
- **[12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-OEeg2P9QM&t=721s)** — at the top of the list. I will tell you when I have red meat, I have more energy. It's not
- **[12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-OEeg2P9QM&t=725s)** — just the iron that helps build up my hemoglobin. There's a lot of other factors in that meat that
- **[12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-OEeg2P9QM&t=731s)** — give me energy, not just coenzyme Q10, but just a lot of energy generating factors. There's
- **[12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-OEeg2P9QM&t=737s)** — another interesting study about this. I just found this. I think it's fascinating. I will
- **[12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-OEeg2P9QM&t=741s)** — put the link down below. But what they did is they wanted to test the nutrition factors
- **[12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-OEeg2P9QM&t=747s)** — in red meat versus the plant-based meats that they're coming up with now, like the artificial
- **[12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-OEeg2P9QM&t=754s)** — meats. And so if you look at the nutritional labels on both of them, they look very similar,
- **[12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-OEeg2P9QM&t=759s)** — right? Look healthy. But what they found is out of 190 biomarkers, they found 171 out of 190
- **[12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-OEeg2P9QM&t=766s)** — were significantly higher than the plant-based fake meat type food, if you want to call it
- **[12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-OEeg2P9QM&t=773s)** — the point is that when you eat nutrient dense foods, like truly nutrient dense foods,
- **[12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-OEeg2P9QM&t=778s)** — there's a lot of things in there that can actually help you get healthy. And instead of trying to
- **[13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-OEeg2P9QM&t=782s)** — make food just taste good, I would focus on trying to help grow your food that's more
- **[13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-OEeg2P9QM&t=788s)** — nutrient dense and eat more food that is nutrient dense, because what they're trying
- **[13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-OEeg2P9QM&t=792s)** — to do with the fake meat now is just to try to mimic the taste of it, the texture of it.
- **[13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-OEeg2P9QM&t=797s)** — But what about the nutrition? The other really, really, really important thing about
- **[13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-OEeg2P9QM&t=801s)** — your mitochondria and actually producing more mitochondria is exercise. Hands down,
- **[13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-OEeg2P9QM&t=807s)** — that is the number one way to produce more mitochondria. This is another reason why you
- **[13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-OEeg2P9QM&t=812s)** — should consistently exercise on a regular basis. And that's going to override a lot of other
- **[13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-OEeg2P9QM&t=818s)** — bad things that you might have done in your past. And also if you have any type of
- **[13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-OEeg2P9QM&t=823s)** — disease or problems currently, this can help counter that. Why? Because a lot of disease comes
- **[13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-OEeg2P9QM&t=831s)** — from damage to the mitochondria. And if you're exercising and you're making more and combine
- **[13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-OEeg2P9QM&t=837s)** — that with intermittent fasting, that fasting triggers another thing called autophagy. Autophagy
- **[14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-OEeg2P9QM&t=844s)** — is recycling old damaged proteins, but also the recycling of the mitochondria. How cool is
- **[14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-OEeg2P9QM&t=850s)** — that? And then you're creating new mitochondria. This is how you're going to get more energy.
- **[14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-OEeg2P9QM&t=855s)** — This is the stuff that I wish I knew back in my early 20s. Actually, before that, I wish I
- **[14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-OEeg2P9QM&t=861s)** — knew this in kindergarten. I would have saved myself a lot of years of fatigue. Now, a couple
- **[14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-OEeg2P9QM&t=866s)** — other things that can increase your mitochondria. Cold therapy. I do that on a regular basis.
- **[14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-OEeg2P9QM&t=871s)** — And man, do I feel better after doing it? If you're a little hesitant of doing that,
- **[14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-OEeg2P9QM&t=876s)** — you can do kind of like a partial cold immersion with a cold shower. The most difficult part
- **[14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-OEeg2P9QM&t=883s)** — about this is when you submerge around your heart, because your heart is pumping and it's
- **[14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-OEeg2P9QM&t=887s)** — trying to keep you warm. And it's kind of like the most vulnerable area, but you can always do
- **[14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-OEeg2P9QM&t=893s)** — half of your body cold and you'll get some benefits from that. There's also phytonutrients
- **[14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-OEeg2P9QM&t=897s)** — that can increase the reproduction of mitochondria and actually help repair some of the
- **[15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-OEeg2P9QM&t=903s)** — mitochondria as well. Like sulforaphane in the cruciferous vegetables and the broccoli
- **[15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-OEeg2P9QM&t=907s)** — microgreens, as well as the radish microgreens. It's a lot of different foods. There actually
- **[15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-OEeg2P9QM&t=912s)** — are quite a few phytonutrients that when you consume those, they help your mitochondria.
- **[15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-OEeg2P9QM&t=916s)** — And then on the flip side, it's avoiding certain things too, like avoiding the refined
- **[15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-OEeg2P9QM&t=920s)** — foods, avoiding the sugar, going on keto, avoiding chronic stress, heavy metals, smoking,
- **[15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-OEeg2P9QM&t=927s)** — alcohol. These are all the things I wish I would have known back in my 20s. And also this
- **[15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-OEeg2P9QM&t=933s)** — understanding of what the mitochondria really is. Now because of the censoring and the
- **[15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-OEeg2P9QM&t=937s)** — suppressing of the algorithms on YouTube, it's becoming more difficult to find my content.
- **[15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-OEeg2P9QM&t=942s)** — And there's a lot of content that I cannot put on YouTube, unfortunately. So to make sure

- **[00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-tboAto7so&t=0s)** — I think most people would agree that sugar is not very good for you. And sugar is a
- **[00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-tboAto7so&t=4s)** — type of carbohydrate. But there are other types of carbohydrate. You have fiber. That's
- **[00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-tboAto7so&t=9s)** — a carbohydrate. When we think about fiber, we think about, okay, that's something that's
- **[00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-tboAto7so&t=12s)** — fairly good for us, right? So we have good carbs and bad carbs. But what makes something
- **[00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-tboAto7so&t=17s)** — good and what makes something bad? It has to do with what it does to your blood sugar.
- **[00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-tboAto7so&t=20s)** — Sugar absorbs very quickly and it will raise your blood sugar. And fiber doesn't. We're
- **[00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-tboAto7so&t=26s)** — going to get into that a little bit. I'm excited to tell you that I have a brand
- **[00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-tboAto7so&t=29s)** — new product that's released. It's my magnesium powder. And the reason why I like magnesium
- **[00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-tboAto7so&t=33s)** — powder is because I don't like taking four to five capsules of magnesium versus just
- **[00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-tboAto7so&t=39s)** — one scoop of this magnesium powder, mix it in water, slug it down. We just got this
- **[00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-tboAto7so&t=43s)** — in. Last night I tried it. I slept like a baby. And the form of this is called
- **[00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-tboAto7so&t=47s)** — magnesium glycinate. The glycinate part helps calm you down and it will actually
- **[00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-tboAto7so&t=52s)** — enhance your sleep. And this form is absorbed at like 80% where other forms are absorbed
- **[00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-tboAto7so&t=57s)** — There's three things about magnesium. Number one, most people are deficient. Number two,
- **[01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-tboAto7so&t=62s)** — it's very difficult to test if you're deficient. And number three, magnesium is involved in
- **[01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-tboAto7so&t=67s)** — thousands of different things on the body that go way beyond just decreasing stress,
- **[01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-tboAto7so&t=71s)** — relaxation, and better sleep. And it's a one-time special offer. You'll get 20%
- **[01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-tboAto7so&t=76s)** — off this product if you order it within the next five days. Simply click on the
- **[01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-tboAto7so&t=80s)** — product icon in the left lower corner of this video and the discount will automatically
- **[01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-tboAto7so&t=84s)** — be applied to your purchase. But more importantly, it's understanding what the
- **[01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-tboAto7so&t=89s)** — third carbohydrate is. We have sugar, we have fiber, and then we have what's left. So I'm
- **[01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-tboAto7so&t=95s)** — going to give you a hint. See if you can figure it out. We take a look at this product
- **[01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-tboAto7so&t=98s)** — right here. This has a lot of carbohydrates. Not a lot of fiber. No sugar at all. Then
- **[01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-tboAto7so&t=103s)** — we have chips. A lot of carbohydrate. Not very much fiber and basically no sugar. Here's one
- **[01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-tboAto7so&t=109s)** — with high carbohydrates. A little bit of fiber but no sugar. You ever see these right
- **[01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-tboAto7so&t=113s)** — here? A lot of carbohydrate. No sugar. Instant potatoes. A lot of carbohydrate. No sugar.
- **[01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-tboAto7so&t=118s)** — But here's the biggest hint. Corn starch. A lot of carbohydrate. In fact, it's all
- **[02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-tboAto7so&t=123s)** — carbohydrate. Zero sugar. The carbohydrate we're talking about is starch. All of these foods
- **[02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-tboAto7so&t=129s)** — right here are loaded with starch. Not in a whole form. It's not like potatoes or actual
- **[02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-tboAto7so&t=136s)** — corn. We're dealing with something very highly processed. When you ultra process a
- **[02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-tboAto7so&t=142s)** — starch, like corn for example, this starch no longer resembles the original food it
- **[02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-tboAto7so&t=147s)** — came from. You could pretty much call this a synthetic starch. It's highly manipulated.
- **[02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-tboAto7so&t=153s)** — What you need to know about fiber and starch, both being similar, a chain of
- **[02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-tboAto7so&t=157s)** — glucose molecules, is this. The bonds that connect these sugars together are
- **[02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-tboAto7so&t=163s)** — very, very different. In fiber, they're extremely strong and this is why you can't break them down.
- **[02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-tboAto7so&t=168s)** — We as humans don't have the enzyme to break down certain fibers, therefore it doesn't get
- **[02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-tboAto7so&t=174s)** — absorbed as sugar. And what's really fascinating about this is how certain starches affect your
- **[03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-tboAto7so&t=180s)** — blood sugar. The first thing that's bad about starches, I'm talking about ultrafine starches,
- **[03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-tboAto7so&t=187s)** — is that a lot of these have the potential to spike your blood sugars more than sugar. An
- **[03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-tboAto7so&t=191s)** — average American consumes over 50% of their calories being ultra processed food calories.
- **[03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-tboAto7so&t=197s)** — We create this massive spike of blood sugar and we do it repetitively, day in and day out. At first,
- **[03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-tboAto7so&t=203s)** — our body can handle it to some degree. Maybe we're younger and we can burn off some of this
- **[03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-tboAto7so&t=207s)** — energy, but as we get older, we don't burn off the energy. Some of it gets stored as stored sugar in our liver.
- **[03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-tboAto7so&t=213s)** — That's called glycogen. Then it gets converted over into fat. There's going to be a point where the fat cell itself
- **[03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-tboAto7so&t=218s)** — is filled up. It had enough. It cannot absorb any more sugar. It becomes dysfunctional. And
- **[03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-tboAto7so&t=225s)** — another term for this is called insulin resistance. Now the fat cell no longer has the ability
- **[03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-tboAto7so&t=232s)** — to absorb any more fat. So then what happens? Where does this energy go? It goes inside the
- **[03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-tboAto7so&t=237s)** — organs as liver fat, as fat inside the pancreas, and it goes in between the organs too as
- **[04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-tboAto7so&t=245s)** — visceral fat. You may have this yourself. If you look down right now at your shoes and you can't see
- **[04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-tboAto7so&t=249s)** — them because your belly's in the way, then you have visceral fat. Visceral fat means that your
- **[04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-tboAto7so&t=253s)** — liver also has fat in it. There's no way you can have belly fat and not have any liver fat.
- **[04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-tboAto7so&t=259s)** — This goes on for a period of time until the insulin resistance gets so bad that now our
- **[04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-tboAto7so&t=265s)** — insulin just doesn't work anymore. We can't remove the sugar out of the blood. We have now
- **[04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-tboAto7so&t=274s)** — diabetes because of the amount of carbohydrates they're consuming. And I'm not talking about
- **[04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-tboAto7so&t=279s)** — the carbohydrates from vegetables and things like that, even fruit. I'm talking about the
- **[04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-tboAto7so&t=284s)** — ultra-process refined carbohydrates, specifically starch. People are so much against sugar,
- **[04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-tboAto7so&t=291s)** — but they don't really know this other hidden sugar in starch that's creating even more
- **[04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-tboAto7so&t=297s)** — damage than sugar. And now you're starting to get an idea of what starch really is.
- **[05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-tboAto7so&t=302s)** — Don't worry, it gets worse. If you're going on the ketogenic diet, for example,
- **[05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-tboAto7so&t=306s)** — the big thing is to keep your carbohydrates below 50 grams. Many times within the ketogenic diet,
- **[05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-tboAto7so&t=313s)** — no one's really talking about what type of carbohydrates you should keep below 50 grams.
- **[05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-tboAto7so&t=319s)** — And I want to mention another point about starches. Starches are hidden sugars,
- **[05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-tboAto7so&t=323s)** — but they're not classified as sugars. In fact, sometimes certain foods are advertised
- **[05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-tboAto7so&t=327s)** — sugar-free when in fact they're just loaded with this hidden sugar. The other problem with these,
- **[05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-tboAto7so&t=333s)** — we'll call them synthetic starches, there's no protein, there's no fat, and there's definitely
- **[05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-tboAto7so&t=337s)** — no fiber. Protein, fat, and fiber are the things that help buffer this spike in blood sugar.
- **[05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-tboAto7so&t=344s)** — And when we're consuming so much of this right here, we don't have any buffer for our
- **[05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-tboAto7so&t=350s)** — blood sugar. And so what I'm trying to tell you is that you're depleting your body in a
- **[05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-tboAto7so&t=357s)** — lot of ways. And the other thing that's also important for so many things, vitamin D would be
- **[06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-tboAto7so&t=360s)** — depleted by consuming these types of foods. You're going to get a lot of inflammation, and
- **[06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-tboAto7so&t=364s)** — the more inflammation you have, the less vitamin D can actually work in your cells. And vitamin
- **[06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-tboAto7so&t=370s)** — B1 is like the spark plug that allows you to burn those carbohydrates. So now we can't make
- **[06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-tboAto7so&t=376s)** — energy. You're going to get tired without B1, and you're going to deplete zinc. And the
- **[06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-tboAto7so&t=380s)** — other thing that these, we'll call them synthetic starches, do is they tend to feed more of
- **[06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-tboAto7so&t=384s)** — the pathogenic bad microbes, more than the good bacteria. Your good bacteria want fiber. They
- **[06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-tboAto7so&t=392s)** — can live on sugar, but they prefer the fiber. But your pathogens love these starches. They
- **[06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-tboAto7so&t=397s)** — can just thrive on them. They basically ferment them more than the good bacteria, because a
- **[06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-tboAto7so&t=401s)** — lot of this food is broken down so fast and absorbed very high up in your small intestine.
- **[06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-tboAto7so&t=408s)** — It doesn't slowly break down and end up in a large colon too much, because it's highly
- **[06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-tboAto7so&t=413s)** — processed. You end up breeding or growing the unfriendly microbes in the small intestine. And
- **[07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-tboAto7so&t=420s)** — this is called SIBO, small intestinal bacterial overgrowth. 50% of the population has that.
- **[07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-tboAto7so&t=425s)** — The breads, the pasta, the cereal, the crackers, the biscuits, the waffles, the
- **[07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-tboAto7so&t=429s)** — pancakes contain synthetic starches, which are actually way worse than sugar. But they contain
- **[07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-tboAto7so&t=433s)** — sometimes whole grains and they're considered heart healthy, which is a totally bunch of BS.
- **[07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-tboAto7so&t=437s)** — But now let's talk about something even more interesting. Why are they putting all of this
- **[07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-tboAto7so&t=444s)** — cornstarch, the food starch, the modified cornstarch? What is the purpose of this in our food?
- **[07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-tboAto7so&t=450s)** — This is going to shock you. The purpose of the modified food cornstarch in food is to
- **[07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-tboAto7so&t=457s)** — thicken things. That's why they put it in there. Just to thicken things? Another reason is
- **[07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-tboAto7so&t=462s)** — able to kind of like mix flavorings and sweeteners. It's like a delivery system.
- **[07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-tboAto7so&t=469s)** — When we get into maltodextrin, the purpose is basically a filler. You mean to tell me that
- **[07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-tboAto7so&t=476s)** — they're putting something very, very dangerous, worse than sugar in our food just to be a
- **[08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-tboAto7so&t=482s)** — filler? Something that they can actually make profit on that they can then classify
- **[08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-tboAto7so&t=486s)** — as sugar-free because it's classified as a, and I'm not kidding, a complex carbohydrate.
- **[08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-tboAto7so&t=491s)** — The last purpose of maltodextrin is an energy source. Put it in certain type of protein powders
- **[08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-tboAto7so&t=497s)** — or the muscle mass powders where they're literally one serving is over a thousand
- **[08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-tboAto7so&t=502s)** — calories and 80% of that is maltodextrin. I mean this is like creating such trauma,
- **[08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-tboAto7so&t=508s)** — such overwhelming shock to your mitochondria and your cells so fast in your body when
- **[08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-tboAto7so&t=513s)** — you consume this. I wanted to gain weight at some point, you know, and so I started doing
- **[08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-tboAto7so&t=517s)** — those protein powders and it was filled with maltodextrin. It didn't work for me. All it made
- **[08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-tboAto7so&t=523s)** — me do is want to go to sleep really quick. I just felt mentally groggy. The next time you're
- **[08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-tboAto7so&t=527s)** — at the grocery store and you are tempted to buy these or these, which I used to love,
- **[08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-tboAto7so&t=535s)** — or even these right here, realize that they have a tremendous amount of ultra-processed
- **[09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-tboAto7so&t=542s)** — starch that's actually worse than real sugar. Now, since we're on the topic of maltodextrin,
- **[09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-tboAto7so&t=545s)** — if you haven't seen this video, you should probably check it out. I put it up right here.

- **[00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WGLgSAwuygo&t=0s)** — Now, you may just end up quitting sugar after watching this video. I'm just warning you.
- **[00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WGLgSAwuygo&t=4s)** — Don't get mad at me. I'm just the messenger. There are 73 meta-analysis that make up
- **[00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WGLgSAwuygo&t=11s)** — 8600 different studies on sugar. And the conclusions are a high amount of added sugar,
- **[00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WGLgSAwuygo&t=18s)** — okay, is significantly associated with 45 negative health effects ranging from diabetes to asthma,
- **[00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WGLgSAwuygo&t=26s)** — depression, stroke, heart attack, gout, hypertension, dementia, cancer, and early death.
- **[00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WGLgSAwuygo&t=33s)** — Other than that, it's totally fine. Now, it's interesting because the World Health Organization
- **[00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WGLgSAwuygo&t=37s)** — allows people to consume up to 12 teaspoons of added sugar, right, before it becomes unhealthy.
- **[00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WGLgSAwuygo&t=45s)** — I've talked to many people who say, well, I don't need to do the ketogenic diet and go
- **[00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WGLgSAwuygo&t=49s)** — on a low carb diet because I don't have a weight problem. I usually say, have you ever
- **[00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WGLgSAwuygo&t=53s)** — heard of skinny fat? Chances are if they're consuming added sugar, they have visceral fat,
- **[00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WGLgSAwuygo&t=59s)** — they have liver fat. They just don't know it yet. But 40% of people of normal weight
- **[01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WGLgSAwuygo&t=66s)** — have metabolic syndrome. That includes high blood glucose, fatty liver, high cholesterol.
- **[01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WGLgSAwuygo&t=73s)** — And there's another point about obesity I want to make. There's a certain percentage,
- **[01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WGLgSAwuygo&t=77s)** — I think it's 20% of obese people have normal metabolism and they live a long life. And so
- **[01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WGLgSAwuygo&t=84s)** — just because someone's overweight doesn't necessarily mean they're super unhealthy
- **[01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WGLgSAwuygo&t=89s)** — or they're healthy. There's other factors involved. Now, then you have health authorities
- **[01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WGLgSAwuygo&t=94s)** — that will talk about sugar as being empty calories. In reality, sugar is very toxic.
- **[01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WGLgSAwuygo&t=102s)** — Roughly half of it is fructose. Okay. And the other half is glucose. Fructose is very,
- **[01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WGLgSAwuygo&t=108s)** — very toxic to the body. I would venture to say it's as toxic as alcohol. And if you ever
- **[01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WGLgSAwuygo&t=114s)** — think about where alcohol comes from, they usually make it from some type of sugar, right?
- **[01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WGLgSAwuygo&t=119s)** — But if we compare fructose with alcohol and which problems each one can influence both
- **[02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WGLgSAwuygo&t=125s)** — fructose and alcohol cause hypertension, myocardial infarction, heart attacks, cause
- **[02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WGLgSAwuygo&t=131s)** — insulin resistance, fatty liver. They both cause pancreatitis. You know, nature has basically made
- **[02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WGLgSAwuygo&t=137s)** — sugar hard to get. Our ancestors would get sugar during harvest season from fruit, right? And
- **[02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WGLgSAwuygo&t=145s)** — even honey has a season to it and it's hard to get because there's bees. But man has made
- **[02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WGLgSAwuygo&t=149s)** — sugar very easy to get. And you know, you have people who say, well, why doesn't the
- **[02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WGLgSAwuygo&t=153s)** — government regulate sugar just like alcohol, right? Well, that's not going to happen. There's
- **[02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WGLgSAwuygo&t=159s)** — too much money involved with sugar. The sugar lobbyists and the corn lobbyists and the
- **[02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WGLgSAwuygo&t=164s)** — sweet beverage lobbyists are extremely powerful. I mean, the sugar sector accounts for
- **[02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WGLgSAwuygo&t=171s)** — a third of all the donations from U.S. agriculture while they only make up 2% of the farms.
- **[02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WGLgSAwuygo&t=179s)** — So a lot of the money that goes into lobbying comes from the sugar industry. These lobbyists
- **[03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WGLgSAwuygo&t=185s)** — influence the dietary guidelines, food pyramid, but it's no secret that the U.S. sugar industry
- **[03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WGLgSAwuygo&t=192s)** — cannot afford negative perceptions of its products. And so it has a really strong
- **[03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WGLgSAwuygo&t=197s)** — purpose of discrediting research that says that sugar could be harmful to human health.
- **[03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WGLgSAwuygo&t=202s)** — So if you think the government's going to help regulate this, it's not going to happen. There's
- **[03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WGLgSAwuygo&t=206s)** — just too much money involved. It's going to have to be you stopping the consumption
- **[03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WGLgSAwuygo&t=213s)** — of sugar. Now there's many things that you can do to make this transition. There's all sorts of
- **[03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WGLgSAwuygo&t=220s)** — keto-friendly sweets and desserts. Like even, for example, Lily's chocolate.
- **[03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WGLgSAwuygo&t=228s)** — This has sugar alcohols. You can do this. You can consume this. Here's one right here. Look
- **[03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WGLgSAwuygo&t=233s)** — at this. One carb keto chocolate frosting. That's one. Here's one right here. Better sugar.
- **[04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WGLgSAwuygo&t=243s)** — Sweet leaf. Here's a called nutrell. No sugar. It's kind of like a little cereal you can consume.
- **[04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WGLgSAwuygo&t=254s)** — So these are things that you can do to make the transition. Here's one.
- **[04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WGLgSAwuygo&t=260s)** — Keto candied pecans. If you need to do these type of things and get off sugar, go ahead.
- **[04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WGLgSAwuygo&t=266s)** — It'll be easy because they taste very similar to sugar, but they don't have the actual sugar.
- **[04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WGLgSAwuygo&t=271s)** — When you eat sugar, you're supporting the sugar industry. And on top of that, you're destroying
- **[04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WGLgSAwuygo&t=275s)** — your body. Now if you want to know how to transition off sugar, I have a video just for
- **[04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WGLgSAwuygo&t=280s)** — you. This is the beginner's video on how to do keto. And I put the video up right here.
- **[04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WGLgSAwuygo&t=285s)** — Check it out.
