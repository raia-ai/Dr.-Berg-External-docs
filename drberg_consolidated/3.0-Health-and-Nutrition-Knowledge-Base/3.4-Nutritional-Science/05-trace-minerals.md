## What Is An Mct Powder In The Trace Minerals

# What is an MCT powder in the Trace Minerals?

**Medium Chain Triglyceride Oil Powder** 

- **Enhanced Absorption:** MCTs are known to improve the absorption of fat-soluble vitamins and minerals. Trace minerals like zinc, selenium, and chromium are better absorbed in the presence of fats. MCT oil provides a healthy fat source that helps carry these essential minerals into the bloodstream.  

- **Improved Bioavailability:** MCTs are metabolized differently than other fats. They are quickly broken down and absorbed by the liver, where they can be converted into energy or used to transport nutrients throughout the body. This rapid metabolism can help increase the bioavailability of trace minerals, making them more readily available for the body to use.  

- **Stability and Shelf Life:** MCT oil is a stable carrier oil that helps preserve the quality and potency of trace minerals in supplements. It prevents them from oxidizing or degrading, helping the nutrients remain effective for a longer period.

## What Is The Importance Of Zinc For Overall Health

# What is the importance of zinc for overall health?

Zinc is involved in a vast number of biochemical processes in the body, estimated to be over 200. This underscores its fundamental importance for overall health. While the immediate effects of zinc supplementation may not always be pronounced, adequate zinc intake contributes significantly to long-term well-being, potentially evidenced by stronger nails and hair. Furthermore, zinc deficiency is linked to low testosterone levels in men. Given that environmental factors, such as certain chemicals from plastics, can disrupt hormonal balance, maintaining sufficient zinc may play a supportive role in preserving hormonal health.

## What Is Gras

# What is GRAS?

GRAS (generally recognized as safe). GRAS applies to chemicals that are in our environment and food.  GRAS implies that the chemical is regulated and has been through a lot of safety studies. However, the FDA allows companies to self-certify their chemicals as safe.  There are about 10,000 chemicals in our food supply, and 99% of them have not been reviewed for safety.  GRAS is more of a loophole that companies use to imply that their chemicals are safe despite outside testing.

## What Is One Ingredient That Can Help Shrink An Enlarged Prostate

# What is one ingredient that can help shrink an enlarged prostate?

The prostate gland wraps around a small tube underneath the bladder and is usually the size of a walnut. When a prostate is enlarged, it can interfere with urine flow and can sometimes turn cancerous. An enlarged prostate is also called benign prostatic hyperplasia. Testosterone is said to cause prostate enlargement. With the help of an enzyme, testosterone is converted into DHT (dihydrotestosterone), a more potent form of testosterone. One of the best-selling drugs for prostate enlargement works by inhibiting this enzyme.

Testosterone and DHT decrease as we age, but the enzyme that makes DHT increases.

There is a natural inhibitor of this enzyme, called lycopene, that may decrease the risk of prostate enlargement by 21%. It may also reduce the risk of prostate cancer and decrease inflammation. It even has potent antioxidant effects.

Lycopene is a carotenoid found in watermelon, carrots, and grapefruit, but tomatoes are the best source.

Try growing your own tomatoes or getting them from the farmer’s market. You can also consume canned tomatoes, tomato sauce, or tomato paste because the lycopene in tomatoes becomes more bioavailable when heated. Make sure you choose tomato sauce without sugar! Lycopene is a fat-soluble compound, so add olive oil when cooking with tomatoes to help extract it.

Try adding tomatoes to your diet twice a week to help shrink an enlarged prostate.

Zinc and resveratrol are also helpful enlarged prostate remedies. Milk is one of the worst things for an enlarged prostate!

## What Is The Number 1 Superfood In The World

# What is the number 1 superfood in the world?

**Red Meat: The Underrated Superfood**

Move over, green powder! While we love the benefits of greens, there's another superfood that deserves a spot on your plate: **grass-fed red meat**.

**Why Red Meat is a Nutritional Powerhouse:**

- **Complete Protein:** Unlike green powders, red meat provides all the essential amino acids your body needs to build and repair tissues, create enzymes and hormones, and support a healthy immune system.

- **Nutrient-Dense:** Red meat is packed with B vitamins, fat-soluble vitamins (A, D, E, and K), iron, zinc, selenium, and even DHA – an omega-3 fat crucial for brain health.

- **Antioxidant Power:** Red meat is a rich source of glutathione, a master antioxidant, and carnosine, which helps protect against cellular damage.

- **Blood Sugar Control:** The protein in red meat triggers glucagon, a hormone that helps stabilize blood sugar and counter the effects of insulin.

- **Building Blocks for Your Body:** Protein is essential for building and maintaining muscle, collagen, bones, skin, and even your cell membranes.

- **Unique Amino Acids:** Red meat contains taurine, which helps regulate blood pressure, and leucine, an amino acid that stimulates muscle protein synthesis.

- **Energy Production:** Your body can convert protein into glucose through a process called gluconeogenesis, providing a steady source of energy.

- **Appetite Control:** The "protein leverage hypothesis" suggests that we instinctively eat until we meet our protein needs. This explains why protein-rich foods help us feel full and satisfied, reducing the urge to overeat.

- **Oxygen Delivery:** Red meat is rich in myoglobin, an iron-containing protein that helps transport oxygen throughout the body.

**Grass-Fed Advantage:**

Cows, sheep, and goats that graze on pasture have a unique ability to concentrate nutrients from the grass into their meat, making grass-fed red meat even more nutrient-dense.

**The Perfect Pairing:**

Combine the benefits of green powder with the power of grass-fed red meat for a truly optimal nutritional boost.

**Important Note:** While red meat offers numerous health benefits, it's essential to choose high-quality, grass-fed sources and consume it as part of a balanced diet.

## What Are The Health Benefits Of Selenium And How Do Its Antioxidant Pr B5Cc96

# What are the health benefits of selenium, and how do its antioxidant properties support immune function and thyroid health?

Selenium is a trace mineral, and it’s involved in thyroid function and helps detox mercury. Selenium is also a powerful antioxidant. It’s important to support cardiovascular and brain health and may help prevent strokes and cancer. Brazil nuts are loaded with selenium. One Brazil nut will give you the selenium you need for the day. Taking too much selenium could lead to selenium toxicity. Selenium is in many other foods, too, so why are so many people deficient in selenium? It has to do with the fact that it’s in a form that plant roots have a difficult time extracting—they need help from microbes. However, there aren’t enough microbes or diversity of microbes in the soil. A good solution is to start buying foods from farmers who care about their soil and grow things with microbial diversity. It’s also essential to consume fermented foods. Another overlooked cause of selenium deficiency is a certain genetic mutation related to the proteins or enzymes with selenium. Taking statins may also lead to selenium deficiency.

## What Is The Recommended Diet For Individuals With Hivaids And How Can  06C349

# What is the recommended diet for individuals with HIV/AIDS, and how can it support immune function and overall health?

When you have HIV, over time, if the immune system is weak, it can shift to AIDS. AIDS is a condition where you don't really have an immune system anymore.  This condition targets a key player in your immune system called the T helper cell. Without the T helper cells, your immune system can't work how it needs to. Without these cells, you can also develop serious secondary problems like tumors or cancer. 

Glutathione is the key antioxidant for all your cells, and it's intimately involved with your immune system. However, HIV depletes the precursors to make glutathione.  If you were to build up these precursors, and therefore, your glutathione, you could potentially prevent the transition of HIV to AIDS.  Other viruses use this mechanism, including hepatitis C, hepatitis B, and coxsackie. 

**A potential natural protocol for HIV and AIDS:** 

• Selenium (400 mcg) 

• Cysteine

• Glutamine

• Tryptophan 

• NAC

## What Is The Real Reason For Rosacea

# What is the real reason for rosacea?

Rosacea is when your cheeks become really red and it looks like there’s a broken blood vessel. There is a huge connection between rosacea and SIBO or small intestinal bacterial overgrowth.

SIBO is a situation where the bacteria that should be in the large colon are growing in the small intestine. The main cause of SIBO is malnutrition.

What NOT to do:

1\. Add Probiotics – You already have too many microbes.

2\. Add Fiber – These microbes in the small intestine eat fiber.

What you SHOULD do:

1\. Smaller Vegetables – Cut down the amount of vegetables that you are consuming.

2\. Clove, Oregano, Garlic – These are great natural antibiotics

3\. Intermittent Fasting – There is a certain process that happens between meals that occurs in the gut and cleanses any residue of food and particles and pushes it down into the digestive tract into the large bowel.

4\. Apple Cider Vinegar (and Betaine Hydrochloride) – One of the most important things to do is to acidify the stomach because these microbes can’t live in an acidic environment.

One of the causes of SIBO is low stomach acid.

Causes of Low Stomach Acid:

• Antibiotics

• Anti-acids

• Junk food

• Too much baking soda

## What Are Some Important Signs Of Too High Sugar Consumption

# What are some important signs of too high sugar consumption?

Now that we’ve covered the basics of how excess sugar can lurk in our diets, let’s explore the lesser-known consequences. Here are seven surprising signs you might be having a little too much of the sweet stuff.

Recognizing these signs early is crucial to nipping potential health problems in the bud. It can also help you make healthier food choices and decrease your intake of foods with added sugar.

### **1\. Premature Aging and Reduced Collagen**

Think of collagen as your body's natural [anti-aging remedy](https://www.drberg.com/blog/anti-aging) \- it's what keeps our skin firm, elastic, and youthful-looking. However, excess sugar throws a wrench into collagen production through a process called [glycation](https://www.drberg.com/blog/what-are-advanced-glycation-end-products-ages).

Over time, this leads to wrinkles, sagging skin, and a general aged appearance. So if you're noticing more fine lines and wrinkles than you'd like, that daily sugary soda could be a culprit.

It's like prematurely robbing your skin of its youthful glow. Limiting added sugar in your diet can have a positive impact on your skin.

### **2\. Persistent White Tongue**

A persistently white tongue is not just aesthetically unappealing but can also be a symptom of candida overgrowth. [Candida](https://www.drberg.com/blog/the-most-powerful-candida-and-yeast-killer) is a naturally occurring yeast in the body.

However, too much sugar disrupts the delicate balance, allowing Candida to flourish on the surface of your tongue. This leads to the stubborn white coating often associated with this imbalance.

It's not enough to brush it away. To address the root of the issue, you often need to cut back on sugar and starve those yeast overgrowths. High-sugar diets create an ideal environment for Candida to thrive, leading to this uncomfortable condition.

### **3\. Chronic Sinus Problems**

We often associate sinus problems with allergies or colds, but did you know they can also be linked to sugar? This one might come as a surprise.

As with the white tongue, an overgrowth of certain fungi can contribute to those stuffy noses and sinus headaches we often experience. And guess what those fungi thrive on? You got it—sugar.

A common culprit in [chronic sinus problems](https://www.drberg.com/blog/the-best-food-for-chronic-sinus-issue) is the fungus Aspergillus, which just loves to feast on sugar. Addressing a chronic sinus infection could involve cutting back on those sugary treats as part of a holistic plan.

Reducing sugar intake starves these fungi and may help in managing chronic sinus issues.

### **4\. Red or Pink Gums**

Next time you brush your teeth, pay attention to what you see on the bristles. A bit of pink, especially if it's more than usual, might indicate a very, very mild version of scurvy—yes, scurvy.

This [vitamin C deficiency](https://www.drberg.com/blog/an-interesting-cause-of-a-vitamin-c-deficiency) often appears as gum problems and is linked to excess sugar consumption. Why? Because sugar can interfere with your body's absorption and utilization of vitamin C.

### **5\. Low Testosterone**

Men, listen up. Did you know there is a surprising connection between sugar and testosterone? While the complexities of hormones and diet go beyond simple cause and effect, a diet high in sugar has been linked to dips in testosterone levels.

These imbalances often manifest as decreased libido, trouble building muscle (which we usually attribute solely to exercise and protein), and even low energy levels.

It's always essential to work with a healthcare provider to diagnose the root cause of any hormonal changes you're experiencing.

If you suspect your diet is impacting your hormone levels, consider consulting a registered dietitian or a certified nutritionist for personalized guidance.

### **6\. Susceptibility to Infections**

A robust immune system is our best defense against infections. However, excessive sugar can suppress the immune response, leaving you more vulnerable to various pathogens.

It's as if those extra sugary treats disarm your immune system, making it less effective at fighting off unwanted invaders. So if you’re finding yourself getting sick often, it might be worthwhile to examine your sugar intake as part of a bigger picture.

Eating too much sugar can weaken the body's natural defenses. By reducing your sugar intake, you can support your immune system's ability to fight off infections and stay healthy.

### **7\. High Adrenaline Levels**

When we think of high adrenaline, we often think of stress, right? But it turns out excess sugar consumption can be a hidden stressor for our bodies. Here's how: High sugar intake disrupts your cells' ability to create energy efficiently.

To compensate, your body churns out adrenaline—not necessarily due to mental stress, but because of this cellular energy chaos.

This explains why fatigue can sometimes be accompanied by nervous, jittery energy, often accompanied by restlessness. And it doesn't stop there—chronic adrenaline surges disrupt sleep, potentially leading to conditions like restless leg syndrome.

The effects extend to digestion (think sugar-induced heartburn.) and may even contribute to clotting risks in certain individuals.

## What Is Telogen Effluvium

# What is Telogen Effluvium?

Telogen effluvium is a reversible condition in which hair falls out after a stressful experience. The stress triggers many hair follicles to enter a resting phase, causing the affected hairs to fall out within a few months. Common triggers for this type of hair loss include surgery, childbirth, and severe illness, with the primary symptom being hair loss. In many cases, no treatment is necessary, and the hair often grows back once the underlying stress is resolved.

Long walks are a great way to relieve stress. If possible, walking in nature without the distraction of technology or music will help promote the most stress relief benefits.

While Dr. Berg Nutritionals cannot diagnose, treat, or cure telogen effluvium, we can offer general guidance for best practices for healthy hair growth.
Focusing on nutritional intake and lifestyle adjustments is essential to promote hair growth effectively. Here are some key strategies:

1. **Nutrient Intake**:

    - **Iron-Rich Foods**: Consuming foods high in iron can combat anemia, a common cause of hair thinning. Include red meat, lamb, and other iron-rich foods in your diet.

    - **Vitamin C**: Essential for collagen production, which is crucial for hair structure. Found in leafy greens and other vegetables.

    - **Trace Minerals**: Important for protein synthesis and hair growth. Ensure adequate intake of trace minerals.

    - **B Vitamins**: Particularly biotin, which supports hair health. Nutritional yeast is a good source.

    - **Omega-3 Fatty Acids**: Reduce inflammation and support healthy hair growth. Sources include fatty fish, flaxseeds, and walnuts.

2. **Lifestyle Adjustments**:

    - **Regular Exercise**: Improves blood flow and oxygen delivery to the scalp, supporting hair follicle health.

    - **Stress Management**: High stress can impact hair health, so incorporating stress-relief techniques like meditation or yoga can be beneficial.

    - **Proper Scalp Care**: Using gentle, sulfate-free shampoos and avoiding harsh chemicals helps maintain scalp health and supports hair growth.

3. **Hormonal Balance**:

## What Health Benefits Are Associated With Omega 3 Fatty Acids And How D 427Fdc

# What health benefits are associated with omega-3 fatty acids, and how do they contribute to overall well-being?

## **The Essential Role of Omega-3s in Brain Health**

[Omega-3 fatty acids](https://www.drberg.com/blog/basics-of-omega-3-fatty-acids), particularly DHA and EPA, are like the VIP nutrients for your brain. Omega-3s aren't merely beneficial but indispensable for nurturing and enhancing mental faculties like recollection, concentration, and emotional balance.

### **Understanding DHA's Impact on Cognitive Functions**

DHA acts as a cornerstone in brain health. It forms the building blocks of the brain itself, influencing how well we remember things, our ability to concentrate, and even our emotional stability.

[Studies](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4404917/) show that adequate levels of DHA can improve learning abilities, suggesting its significance cannot be overstated.

This fat isn't just sitting there; it's actively involved in creating cell membranes around neurons—think of it as insulation on wires that helps signals travel faster and more efficiently across your brain.

### **The Functional Benefits of EPA on the Brain**

EPA supports cognitive health from another angle—it plays a crucial role beyond structure by fostering an environment conducive to mental functioning.

While less direct than DHA’s structural benefits, research highlights the EPA’s importance in modulating mood disorders, which can indirectly impact cognitive function through improved mental well-being.

## The Importance Of Reducing Inflammation For Healthy Hair

# The Importance of Reducing Inflammation for Healthy Hair

[Inflammation](https://www.drberg.com/blog/the-inflammation-factor-in-common-diseases) is another factor that can contribute to hair loss, as it can damage hair follicles and disrupt the hair growth cycle. One common cause of inflammation is an imbalance of [omega-6 and omega-3](https://www.drberg.com/blog/get-your-omega-6-to-omega-3-ratios-balanced) fatty acids in the diet.

[Omega-6 fatty acids](https://www.drberg.com/blog/omega-6-fats-and-inflammation), which are found in many processed and fried foods, can promote inflammation in the body. On the other hand, [omega-3 fatty acids](https://www.drberg.com/blog/basics-of-omega-3-fatty-acids), which are found in fatty fish, nuts, and seeds, have anti-inflammatory properties.

To reduce inflammation and support healthy hair growth, it's important to limit your intake of omega-6-rich foods and increase your intake of omega-3s. Some good sources of omega-3s include:

- Fatty fish, such as salmon, sardines, and mackerel

- Flaxseeds and chia seeds

- Walnuts and almonds

- Avocados

By reducing inflammation in the body, you can create a more hospitable environment for healthy hair growth.

### **Balancing Hormones Through Diet**

Hormonal imbalances can also contribute to hair loss, particularly in women. Estrogen, in particular, plays a key role in promoting healthy hair growth, while an excess of androgens like DHT can lead to hair thinning and shedding.

To help balance hormones and support healthy hair growth, it's important to include plenty of hormone-balancing foods in your diet. Some good options include:

- Cruciferous vegetables, such as broccoli and cauliflower, which contain compounds that help regulate estrogen levels

- Soy products, such as tofu and tempeh, which contain phytoestrogens that can help balance hormones

- Healthy fats, such as avocados and nuts, which are important for hormone production and balance

- Adaptogenic herbs, such as ashwagandha and maca, which can help regulate the stress response and balance hormones

By incorporating these hormone-balancing foods into your diet, you can help create a more balanced hormonal environment that supports healthy hair growth.

## What Is The Recommended Daily Dosage Of Strontium Citrate For Optimal  732295

# What is the recommended daily dosage of strontium citrate for optimal health benefits, and how should it be adjusted based on individual needs?

When it comes to supplementing with individual minerals, especially trace minerals, it is crucial to approach with caution. Long-term supplementation with a single trace mineral can potentially disrupt the balance of other essential minerals in the body. To mitigate this risk, it is advisable to take these minerals as part of a complete trace mineral complex. This ensures a balanced intake and reduces the likelihood of imbalances.

For instance, when supplementing with zinc, it is important to also consider copper and other related minerals. The interactions and synergies among these minerals are complex and not yet fully understood. Hence, taking them in a comprehensive complex can help maintain proper mineral balance and support overall health.

Similarly, when using electrolytes, ensure they include trace minerals as part of the formulation. This holistic approach ensures that all minerals work together synergistically, enhancing their effectiveness and maintaining balance within the body.

In summary, rather than taking individual trace minerals for extended periods, it is more prudent to opt for a balanced mineral complex. This strategy helps prevent potential imbalances and supports the intricate interplay of minerals necessary for optimal health.

## What Comprehensive Regimen Would Be Beneficial For Managing Gastritis  719B7B

# What comprehensive regimen would be beneficial for managing gastritis and acid reflux symptoms effectively?

You may find that you can tolerate cabbage-based foods, such as cabbage juice, steamed cabbage, and possibly sauerkraut or coleslaw. Cabbage contains nutrients beneficial for gastritis and ulcers, which could support your healing process.

I recommend starting zinc carnosine immediately, as it can aid in healing. Additionally, considering a carnivore diet—potentially combined with cabbage—may help improve gut health.

It's also worth exploring the possibility of H. pylori involvement, which can affect stomach acidity. Healing your stomach and microbiome should be the priority, so a good probiotic is advisable. Once your gut is healed, you can focus on acidifying it, but that should not be your first step at this stage.

## The Role Of Keto In Stye Prevention

# The Role of Keto in Stye Prevention

It might come as a shock that what you eat could affect your ocular health, even for styes. Yes, even those pesky styles. A ketogenic diet, focusing on healthy fats and reduced carbohydrates, may be an effective way to improve eye health.

Firstly, it's crucial to understand how this works. A [keto diet](https://www.drberg.com/blog/keto-diet-for-beginners) may help regulate insulin levels. Insulin resistance is often linked with immune system impairment, which we know plays a role in stye formation. [Research](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2903931) supports this theory.

Besides managing insulin levels, the ketogenic diet also boosts the intake of essential nutrients like vitamins A and D and zinc – all critical for maintaining good eye health.

These micronutrients are essential for properly functioning our mucous membranes, including those in our eyes.

A word of caution, though - while going keto might sound tempting as a potential way to prevent styes, always remember: moderation is key. Overdoing anything isn't beneficial; balance remains paramount regarding nutrition.

## How Can I Manage Estrogen Dominance

# How can I manage estrogen dominance?

To help manage estrogen dominance, Dr. Berg recommends several natural strategies and supplements to help balance estrogen levels. Here's a summary of his recommendations:

1. **Cruciferous Vegetables**: Incorporating cruciferous vegetables like kale, broccoli, and Brussels sprouts into your diet is beneficial. These vegetables contain compounds that help balance estrogen levels.

2. **DIM Supplement Estrogen Balance**: Dr. Berg recommends the DIM Supplement Estrogen Balance supplement. DIM (Diindolylmethane) is a compound derived from cruciferous vegetables that supports healthy estrogen metabolism and helps balance estrogen levels in the body.

3. **Iodine Supplementation**: Iodine is essential for maintaining a healthy thyroid, which plays a crucial role in hormone regulation, including estrogen. Dr. Berg mentions getting iodine from sea kelp as a natural way to supplement iodine.

4. **Nettle Root**: Nettle root is highlighted as a natural aromatase inhibitor. Aromatase is an enzyme that converts testosterone into estrogen. By inhibiting this enzyme, nettle root can help lower estrogen levels.

5. **Organic Meat**: It is recommended that you consume meat from grass-fed animals to avoid GMOs from corn and soy feed, which can influence estrogen levels.

These recommendations aim to support the body's natural hormone balance, reduce high estrogen levels, and address symptoms of estrogen dominance. Always consult with a healthcare provider before starting any new supplement or dietary regimen, especially if you have underlying health conditions.

## N Acetylcarnosine Nac Eye Drops

# N-acetylcarnosine (NAC) Eye Drops

While Dr. Berg Nutritionals does not sell N-acetylcarnosine (NAC), we are happy to provide educational information about the amino acid. When purchasing NAC, consider reputable sellers with positive customer feedback. Always thoroughly research potential suppliers for any supplements.

**NAC and Eye Health**

- **L-carnosine:** This potent antioxidant supports mitochondrial function, counteracts glycation (a damaging sugar-protein reaction), and helps regulate pH levels. While excellent for overall health, L-carnosine alone cannot easily reach eye tissues.

- **N-acetylcarnosine (NAC):** This form enables carnosine to penetrate the eye. Research suggests a 1% NAC solution, used 1-2 drops, 2-3 times daily, may benefit conditions like glaucoma, cataracts, and macular degeneration.

- **Zinc's Role:** This essential mineral is both an antioxidant and crucial for optimal NAC utilization in the body. Consider supplementing NAC alongside zinc.

**Cataracts: Causes and Prevention**

- **What are Cataracts?** Clouding of the eye's lens is a leading cause of blindness. Surgery is the usual treatment, but prevention is key.

- **Oxidative Stress:** This imbalance between oxidants and antioxidants can contribute to cataract formation. Excess sugar consumption is a significant driver of oxidative stress in the eyes.

- **The Sorbitol Problem:** This sugar alcohol promotes inflammation and glycation, which is particularly harmful within the eye. Sorbitol can harm the retina and nerve tissue and contribute to glaucoma risk.

- **Prevention is Key:** If you have cataracts, a sugar-free diet is essential to help reverse damage.

## What Are The Most Effective Strategies Or Treatments For Managing And  3126F1

# What are the most effective strategies or treatments for managing and alleviating the symptoms of endometriosis?

Endometriosis is a very uncomfortable and often painful issue caused by estrogen dominance. To help relieve symptoms of endometriosis, you will want to get your estrogen balanced.

Dr. Berg's video on the subject can be found here: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yINSNtpCX2Q](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yINSNtpCX2Q).

As the video outlines, consuming organic foods is a great place to start. This will help you avoid estrogenic hormones and chemicals that can increase estrogen production.

Cruciferous vegetables can help balance estrogen as well. You can also consume a concentrated form of crucifers called DIM. Another nutrient you will want to add to your diet is iodine.

Dr. Berg has DIM Supplement Estrogen Balance which was specifically formulated to help with issues related to estrogen dominance. You can review the product page here - [https://shop.drberg.com/product/estrogen-balance-with-dim](https://shop.drberg.com/product/estrogen-balance-with-dim).

Dr. Berg's Sea Kelp Enhanced Iodine is a great way to get more iodine into your diet. You can review this product here - [https://shop.drberg.com/product/sea-kelp-enhanced](https://shop.drberg.com/product/sea-kelp-enhanced).

## What Is A Trace Mineral And How Does It Differ From Other Essential Mi Ec4Dd1

# What is a trace mineral, and how does it differ from other essential minerals in terms of function and required quantities in the body?

**What is a trace mineral?** A trace mineral is a mineral that’s needed in very tiny (or trace) amounts. Trace minerals are helper nutrients in enzymes and proteins.

Important trace minerals for hair:

**1\. Iron**

If you’re anemic and you’re deficient in iron, one symptom can be hair loss.

**2\. Silicon**

Silicon helps with the structure of your hair.

**3\. Zinc**

If you’re deficient in zinc, you could develop male pattern baldness.

**4\. Copper**

Copper is involved with the color of your hair and building collagen.

**5\. Selenium**

This is one of the most powerful antioxidants.

## What Biological Environmental And Genetic Factors Contribute To The De 8E4B79

# What biological, environmental, and genetic factors contribute to the development of allergies?

Allergic responses occur when the immune system has a hyperreaction to common and uncommon substances, which cause excess inflammation and many other symptoms.

**Cause: Low stomach acidity**

A low-acid stomach can create digestive problems. With low stomach acid some proteins end up undigested, resulting in your immune system attacking it inappropriately. This will cause hypersensitivity and allergic reactions.

Also, overgrowth of bad bacteria can cause increased intolerance to allergens.Acidifying the stomach can reduce the overgrowth of bad bacteria.

## How To Get Faster Weight Loss Despite Having Hypothyroidism

# How to get faster weight loss despite having hypothyroidism?

It’s a complex subject because there are different kinds of hypothyroidism such as Hashimoto’s and non-Hashimotos. Sometimes you can’t figure out what’s important and what’s trivial information. In this video, I focus on the most important things you need to know to achieve weight loss with a hypothyroid condition.

Your thyroid is located at the bottom of your neck. It produces a hormone called T4 which is an inactive thyroid hormone. T4 converts to T3 which is the active thyroid hormone. T3 goes into your cells and speeds up your metabolism as well as weight loss. 80 percent of conversion happens through your liver, 20 percent happens through your kidneys.

So many people with hypothyroid conditions have a fatty liver. If you have belly fat chances are you have a fatty liver, which decreases the capacity to convert T4 to T3. Your focus is to get the fat off your liver and improve its function. But it could also be a function of your gallbladder, or perhaps cirrhosis of your liver.

You’d think cutting fat from your diet would make the fat on your liver go away but that’s not what you want to do. You do need to cut carbs which is why I recommend keto and intermittent fasting.

As well, here are some things to speed up the process: Choline is one of the most powerful nutrients to strip fat from your liver very quickly. Get high quality choline and start taking it. It dissolves fat. Egg yolks have the highest amount of choline in a food. If you have a choline deficiency you could potentially get a fatty liver.

Selenium is also involved in the conversion of T4 to T3. It’s an antioxidant and is especially important if you have Hashimoto’s. Also, do more strict intermittent fasting to decrease inflammation and boost your immune system.

Iodine is part of the raw material to build thyroid hormones. I recommend consuming sea kelp as a source of iodine. Next is zinc which will help with almost every single side effect of being hypothyroid such as hair loss, fatigue, and constipation. It’s in oysters, meat, and pumpkin seeds, but I recommend taking a supplement. These are the steps you can take to get faster weight loss even with hypothyroidism.

## What Are The Various Causes Of Infertility

# What are the various causes of infertility?

Inability to get pregnant can be rooted in nutritional deficiencies. If you consume enough of certain nutrients in your diet (not from synthetic sources) you can greatly increase your chances of getting pregnant.

**Cause #1: Nutritional deficiencies**

There are certain nutrients that are needed for the female body to be able to get pregnant. Being deficient in those or consuming them from synthetic supplements can be a great barrier to your fertility.

Fat-soluble vitamins, specifically vitamins A, D and E, are very important for being able to get pregnant. These are the vitamins that can go through the fat layer of the cell and can go right into the DNA to start improving your health.

Trace minerals are the minerals that are needed in your body in very small amounts. Specifically, zinc and iodine can cause infertility if you are deficient in them.

If you are deficient in some of these nutrients, it can cause being infertile.

## How Can I Remedy Liver Cirrhosis Thats Caused By Excess Iron

# How can I remedy liver cirrhosis that's caused by excess iron?

If you have excess iron, it can cause a lot of inflammation in the body including inflammation in your liver. This can potentially cause damage to your liver, eventually (after a long time) resulting in liver cirrhosis. You can get too much Iron from consuming a lot of meat and proteins. Therefore, you should reduce the amount of protein and increase the quantity of vegetables in your diet.

- Avoid synthetic vitamin/mineral supplements

- Consume phytic acid (IP-6 version)

- Consume vegetables (7 to 10 cups daily)

    **\*We recommend consulting with your doctor before making any dietary changes or before you start taking any new supplements, especially if you have any existing health conditions.**

## What Can I Do For Early Puberty

# What can I do for early puberty?

**It ultimately comes from exposure to Xenoestrogens which is external so your body isn’t making it because it's coming from the environment.**

Chemicals that mimic estrogen would be BPA(Plastic Bags), PCB(Industrial Waste), in the food supply, and more. The main one you should know about is ZERANOL (Potent Estrogen) which is a growth hormone that they inject into cattle. It’s actually banned in Europe but it is still used in the U.S. and is 100,000 times stronger than BPA. When you eat meats or dairy you should do organic, even though it might be a little more expensive you save more if you're doing intermittent fasting by eating a few times a day to invest in higher quality food.

## What Are Pfas

# What are PFAs?

PFAS chemicals are called forever chemicals because they stay in the environment for thousands of years. They’ve been found in our fat cells and breast milk and are especially problematic in our drinking water. PFAS are linked to many health problems, including cancer, hormone problems, liver damage, and reproductive damage.

Forever chemicals are everywhere! They’re found in Teflon cookware, food packaging, and canned goods, and firefighters are exposed to them when they use their foam. PFAS were first introduced into the environment in the late 1940s and early 1950s. Companies used loopholes by conducting their own studies to classify their products as GRAS (generally recognized as safe).

To avoid the toxic side effects of PFAS, you should limit your exposure and build up your body’s tolerance to these toxic chemicals. The EWG (Environmental Working Group) evaluated 25 PFAS chemicals and found that only 3 water filters could effectively remove them from drinking water: Travel Berkey Gravity, Clearly Filtered, and Zero Water. Because the water supply exposes you to many of the forever chemicals, it’s a good idea to invest in a good water filter.

Forever chemicals build up in the body but don’t come out very easily. Here are some of the ways you can eliminate PFAS from the body and minimize their health effects:

•Sweating

•Autophagy

•Infrared light exposure

•Consuming spirulina and chlorella

Your body has detoxification enzymes that can help you eliminate poisons naturally. To help detoxify the body, consume foods with sulfur, such as eggs, garlic, and onion. Cruciferous vegetables like cabbage, broccoli, and Brussels sprouts are high in sulfur and other antioxidants that can help the detoxification process. Glutamine is a vital antioxidant that can help increase glutathione in the body. Red meat is the best source, and glycine and probiotics are also essential. It’s almost impossible to create a toxin-free environment! Trace minerals such as selenium, iodine, and copper, found in seafood and grass-fed red meat can help strengthen the biochemical pathways in your body to help eliminate forever chemicals.

## Should I Reduce Carbs Or Sugar On Keto

# Should I reduce carbs or sugar on Keto?

When you’re doing keto, you want to count net carbs, not total carbs. Net carbs are calculated by taking the total carb count of food then subtracting the fiber content. Although fiber is a carbohydrate it has no effect on insulin. The less fiber the more food will spike your blood sugar thus raising insulin. Always focus on net carbs and keep them between 20 and 50 grams daily, or even fewer if you have a slow metabolism or you want to lose more weight. Don’t even factor in veggies if they’re leafy greens. Avoid tomatoes, carrots, and beets because their carb count is high.

You also need to understand the glycemic index, which indicates how foods affect your blood sugar. Items that have less fiber and more sugar will spike your blood sugar more quickly than foods that are higher in fiber. Fiber buffers the sugar response.

Take a potato as an example. A raw potato has a lot of fiber which lowers its net carb count. But as soon as you fry, bake, or mash it, its sugar count climbs astronomically. Or, for instance, one slice of bread has a net carb count of just over 10 grams or almost half of your desired daily amount. Not only is bread high on the glycemic index but the specific fiber, which is from grains, has phytic acid which depletes certain minerals, especially zinc. And it has gluten, which many people are sensitive to. So I don’t recommend grains or grain fiber. You want to get your fiber from vegetables. And you want to avoid starches like rice.

What about fruit? Well, for example, an apple has a net carb count of just over 20 grams. And it has 19 grams of sugar! Berries are much better because they have more fiber and less sugar, and are lower on the glycemic index. In other words, you have to take fiber, net carbs, and glycemic index into account when you’re considering whether to consume a certain food. Also become aware of something called the insulin index, which states how much a particular food will affect your insulin level.

## Is Selenium An Effective Remedy For Different Body Issues

# Is selenium an effective remedy for different body issues?

Selenium serves as a crucial coenzyme involved in approximately 25 different proteins and acts as a potent antioxidant alongside glutathione, protecting tissues from damage caused by heavy metals, chemicals, or sugars, which can be detrimental to the brain and nervous system, especially in conditions like diabetes. It plays a role in improving insulin resistance and supporting heart health by preventing oxidation and aiding in the detoxification of substances like hydrogen peroxide and mercury.

Selenium is essential for thyroid function, facilitating the conversion of inactive thyroid hormone (T4) to its active form (T3), including reverse T3. It also exhibits anti-inflammatory properties, reduces the risk of male infertility, and can help decrease thyroid antibodies in autoimmune conditions like Hashimoto's thyroiditis. Good dietary sources of selenium include Brazil nuts, tuna, halibut, sardines, salmon, organ meats, meat, and eggs.

## How Can I Assess The Safety Of Beauty And Skincare Products For My Nee E11088

# How can I assess the safety of beauty and skincare products for my needs, considering ingredients and potential allergens?

The skin is a human sponge that directly absorbs everything you put on it. An average female absorbs 4 pounds and 6 ounces of chemicals every single year or puts 515 synthetic chemicals on the skin every day. Some of these chemicals are carcinogens which are things that can cause certain types of disease.

Chemicals in Makeup:

• Carcinogens

• Neurotoxins – These go into the brain and the nervous system

• Endocrine Disruptors – Chemicals in the environment that mimic estrogen, which affect the different endocrine glands (thyroid, pancreas, adrenal gland, ovary)

**Ways to Get Chemicals Out of the Body:**

• Evaluate what your body is being exposed to – replace toxins with more natural and less toxic.

• Detox using cruciferous vegetables to help the liver break down these poisons – These are very unique vegetables that help to naturally detoxify without harmful effects.

• Do intermittent fasting – It is a physiological vacation from constantly eating all the time and gives the organs time to rest, heal and repair. It also triggers autophagy, where the body is recycling all the things that it doesn’t need and then builds new tissue.

• Make sure to eat enough healthy fats – fish (wild-caught salmon), coconut oil, seafood, nuts, seeds, olive oil, avocado

**Cruciferous Vegetables:**

• Kale

• Broccoli

• Cabbage

• Brussels sprouts

• Bok choy

• Arugula

• Collard Greens

• Radish

## What Are The Key Signs Of Zinc Deficiency And How Can Early Recognitio 05Aa57

# What are the key signs of zinc deficiency, and how can early recognition help manage it?

**Zinc: The Unsung Hero of Your Health**

Zinc, often overlooked, is actually the third most crucial nutrient for your body, playing a role in over 200 enzyme functions. It's vital for producing glutathione, your body's most potent antioxidant, and it's highly concentrated in the prostate, aiding in sperm and testosterone production. Zinc is also crucial for insulin production in the pancreas and memory function in the hippocampus. From wound healing and collagen production to hair regrowth and reducing gastritis, zinc is truly a powerhouse nutrient.

**Zinc Deficiency: Watch Out for These 7 Signs**

1. Night blindness

2. Low testosterone, estrogen, or progesterone

3. Diarrhea

4. Acne

5. Alopecia (hair loss)

6. Cataracts

7. Thymus gland shrinkage

**The Thymus Connection: Zinc and Longevity**

The thymus, a key immune gland responsible for producing infection-fighting T cells, is highly dependent on zinc. Research by Professor Greg Fahy suggests that restoring the thymus gland could have profound anti-aging effects, potentially increasing lifespan by reducing cancer and infection risks. Studies in rats have shown that zinc supplementation can lead to full thymus function recovery and improved immunity.

**Causes of Zinc Deficiency:**

- Aging

- Gut issues

- Vegan/vegetarian diets

- Alcohol consumption

- Sugar intake

- Chronic stress

- Certain medications

**Zinc Supplementation: Remember Copper and Thymus Extract**

If you're considering supplementing with zinc it's important to also include copper, as zinc can deplete copper levels. Additionally, thymus extract can provide further support for thymus gland health.

**Key Takeaway:** Don't underestimate the importance of zinc. It's a vital nutrient for countless bodily functions, including immunity, hormone production, and even longevity. Ensure you're getting enough zinc through diet or supplementation to support your overall health and well-being.

## What Are The Best Methods For Detoxifying Heavy Metals And How Do They 8648F3

# What are the best methods for detoxifying heavy metals, and how do they support toxin removal and overall health?

Unfortunately, our environment is very polluted, and we are bathed in toxins on a daily basis. Heavy metals are one type of these toxins. Today we're going to talk about the best strategy for detoxifying heavy metals.

Heavy metals can accumulate in our tissues and can cross the blood-brain barrier. Heavy metal poisoning can affect different parts of the body, including the heart, digestive system, neurons, red blood cells, and certain proteins. Exposure to heavy metals also creates a lot of free radicals and oxidation and forces our antioxidants to work harder. Heavy metals even block our endogenous antioxidants.

Our bodies have a very powerful detoxification system, but heavy metals block this important system. While you can avoid heavy metals to a certain degree, you really need to strengthen your detox enzymes: glutathione and SOD. These enzymes help break down chemicals and help prevent oxidation and free-radical damage.

**The best foods to support heavy metal detoxification:**

1\. Sulforaphane (broccoli sprouts or broccoli microgreens)

2\. Cilantro

3\. Allicin (garlic)

4\. Curcumin (turmeric)

5\. Cruciferous vegetables

**Two of the best ways to avoid heavy metals:**

1\. Consume organic foods

2\. Get a water filter

## How Can I Fix The Deficiencies Behind The Vertical Ridges On My Fingernails

# How can I fix the deficiencies behind the vertical ridges on my fingernails?

Most of your biotin is made by your microbes, so a history of antibiotic use can contribute to biotin deficiency. Biotin deficiency symptoms include brittle hair, thin nails, neurological problems, and peripheral neuropathy. Biotin, zinc, and iron control collagen. A deficiency in either of these nutrients can cause vertical lines on the nails.

Once you identify which nutrient you are most likely deficient in, you can increase your intake of certain foods or supplements to fix the problem.

Grass-fed liver pills or spleen extract pills are the best option for an iron deficiency.

To increase zinc, consume more shellfish, oysters, and grass-fed beef. If you choose to take a supplement for zinc, take 50 grams in a blend with other trace minerals, including copper.

If you have a biotin deficiency, try increasing your biotin with a supplement. Take a good probiotic to support gut health, which will naturally help increase biotin.

---

## Do You Have Vertical Ridges On Your Fingernails

# Do you have vertical ridges on your fingernails?

Vertical ridges on nails are typically caused by one of 3 nutrient deficiencies:

1\. Iron deficiency

2\. Zinc deficiency

3\. Biotin deficiency

To determine which nutrient deficiency is causing the vertical ridges on your nails, first, look at your other symptoms. If you have an iron deficiency, you may also experience heavy menstruation and symptoms of anemia. Some people have a genetic problem that causes too much iron. Even with too much iron, you can become anemic because the iron in your body is dysfunctional. Liver problems and blood tests pinpointing a problem with iron could mean your nail ridges are caused by an iron deficiency. Cravings for ice or dirt and feeling cold with cold feet and hands can also signify iron deficiency.

## Does Zinc Carnosine Help With Ulcers

# Does zinc carnosine help with ulcers?

It's important to understand what causes ulcers and gastritis. For the longest time, it was believed that ulcers were a result of too much stomach acid. However, recent scientific evidence found that Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) infection is the leading cause of peptic ulcer formation. While most people are exposed to these microbes, not everyone gets ulcers, as healthy stomach acid levels help destroy H. pylori and prevent infection and associated stomach issues. Taking antacids or histamine blockers to manage gastritis can increase the risk of infection as these drugs lower the stomach’s acidity, creating a perfect environment for H. Pylori to thrive.

In contrast, zinc carnosine is a highly effective remedy that coats the stomach, increases stomach acid production, and stimulates the production of mucous lining the stomach wall. Zinc is also a potent antibacterial agent, directly inhibiting the growth of H. pylori, which helps prevent and manage ulcers and gastritis. Carnosine, on the other hand, is broken down and converted into superoxide dismutase (SOD), a powerful antioxidant that lowers inflammation. This explains why zinc carnosine is one of the best supplements to promote intestinal health.

Consider taking 75 milligrams of zinc carnosine twice daily. Although zinc carnosine is highly effective, it doesn’t work immediately and should be taken for one to three months to see results. To find relief from stomach pain, natural remedies such as baking soda or liquid chlorophyll help soothe stomach irritation.

## How Can I Handle The Bloating For Good

# How can I handle the bloating for good?

Ninety percent of digestion occurs in the small intestine, where bile and secondary bile salts made by your microbes break down your food. The large intestine, small intestine, and pancreas release enzymes to aid digestion. Around 20% of these enzymes are made by your microbes. Bloating is caused by a problem with digestion. The type, amount, and diversity of your gut bacteria directly affect bloating. This often depends on if you’ve taken antibiotics and how much you’ve taken over time.

Broad-spectrum antibiotics significantly reduce your microbes, and they do not come back! If you’re missing any of your gut microbes, you’ll experience bloating, gas, burping, constipation, and more. Other chemicals in the environment that mimic antibiotics can also cause a bloated belly. Glyphosate, birth control pills, steroids, anti-depression medications, PPIs, artificial sweeteners, fluoride, and statins can all contribute to bloating.

So many people can not properly digest food anymore because they don’t have all of their microbes in sufficient quantities. A high-quality probiotic is a great solution to bloating. Along with probiotics, consume fermented foods regularly, such as kefir, yogurt, sauerkraut, and pickles. Apple cider vinegar and kombucha can also help awaken dormant microbes by acidifying their environment. These microbes help support your bile and enzymes, helping you digest food, which takes stress off your organs.

## What Specific Nutrients Are Known To Support Prostate Health And How D 851952

# What specific nutrients are known to support prostate health, and how do they contribute to the prevention and management of prostate-related conditions?

Dr. Berg emphasizes several nutrients and foods that support prostate health. Here are the key points:

1. **Zinc**:

    - These vegetables contain indoles, which help detoxify excess estrogen, promoting hormonal balance.

    - Broccoli, in particular, is noted for its cancer-fighting properties and is especially good for breast and prostate cancer.

3. **Healthy Keto Diet**:

    - A well-structured keto meal plan that includes nutrient-dense foods such as lean meats, fatty fish, leafy greens, and cruciferous vegetables supports hormonal balance by reducing estrogen levels over time.

4. **Saw Palmetto and Nettle Root**:

    - Saw palmetto is used to alleviate urinary symptoms related to an enlarged prostate (BPH).

    - Nettle root exhibits anti-inflammatory properties and aids in improving urine flow among men with BPH.

5. **Avoiding Phytic Acid**:

    - Phytic acid in whole grains and cereals can block zinc absorption. Reducing the intake of these foods can help improve zinc absorption.

## Why Is It Advisable To Avoid Consuming Sugar

# Why is it advisable to avoid consuming sugar?

**Breaking Free from Sugar's Grip**

It's shocking but true: the average person consumes a whopping 74 teaspoons of sugar daily! With over 200 different names and hidden forms, it's easy to unknowingly overdo it.

Sugar's addictive nature is no joke. Food addiction expert Dr. Joan Ifland explains that sugar triggers a dopamine rush in the brain, leading to a temporary high followed by a crash. Over time, this cycle desensitizes your dopamine receptors, requiring more and more sugar to get the same effect.

The good news is you can break free! By shifting your body into a fat-burning state called ketosis, you can eliminate sugar cravings in as little as 72 hours.

**How to Kick the Sugar Habit and Enter Ketosis:**

- **Limit Carbs:** Keep your daily carb intake below 30 grams. This encourages your body to burn fat for fuel instead of sugar.

- **Change Your Environment:** Remove temptations! Clear your home of sugary snacks and enlist the support of your friends and family.

- **Find Healthy Alternatives:** Sugar isn't the only way to feel good. Boost your mood with exercise, dancing, music, laughter, nature walks, helping others, or even engaging in physical work. These activities increase endorphins and oxytocin without the dopamine crash.

Remember, setbacks happen. If you slip up and indulge in sugar, don't get discouraged. Learn from it and get back on track. Minimize the damage by consuming protein and healthy fats to stabilize your blood sugar.

You have the power to overcome sugar addiction and reclaim your health. By making these changes, you'll not only feel better but also pave the way for a happier, healthier life.

## What Dietary Choices Are Most Effective In Supporting The Reduction Of Eff669

# What dietary choices are most effective in supporting the reduction of an enlarged prostate?

**Prostate Health: Understanding Enlargement and Natural Solutions**

The prostate, a walnut-sized gland located below the bladder, can become enlarged with age. This condition, known as benign prostatic hyperplasia, can cause urinary problems and sometimes increases the risk of prostate cancer.

One common cause of prostate enlargement is the conversion of testosterone to a more potent form called DHT (dihydrotestosterone). Medications exist to block this conversion, but they carry potential side effects like decreased libido, increased prostate cancer risk, and withdrawal symptoms.

**Natural Support: Lycopene and Beyond**

A natural solution lies in lycopene, a potent antioxidant found in tomatoes (especially cooked or processed tomatoes like sauce or paste). Lycopene may inhibit the enzyme that creates DHT, potentially reducing prostate enlargement and cancer risk. For the best absorption, consume tomatoes with healthy fats like olive oil.

Additional prostate-friendly nutrients include zinc and resveratrol. Conversely, avoiding milk may be beneficial for prostate health.

**Take Action**

Consider adding tomatoes to your diet twice a week, either fresh, cooked from scratch, or via quality tomato products. Growing your own or sourcing locally from a farmer's market is ideal.

**Important Note:** While natural remedies can be helpful, always consult with your doctor for proper diagnosis and treatment of prostate issues.

## Is Plant Based Meat Legit

# Is plant-based meat legit?

It's important to understand that the marketing of plant-based meats as universally healthier and more environmentally friendly than real meat presents a simplified picture. Here's why:

- **Nutritional Differences:** While plant-based meats can offer some nutrients, they often lack the full range found in real meat, particularly protein, B vitamins, iron, selenium, and zinc. Manufacturers may use supplements and additives to compensate, but these don't fully replicate the natural nutrient profile of real meat.

- **Processing Concerns:** Plant-based meats rely on significant processing. Some ingredients, like the synthetic heme in the Impossible Burger, raise questions about long-term safety due to limited testing.

- **Environmental Complexity:** The environmental impact of plant-based meats isn't always clear-cut. They require considerable resources for production, including water and land. Some ingredients, like almonds, have notoriously high water demands.

## Why You Should Avoid Iron Supplements When Sick

# Why you should avoid iron supplements when sick?

## **Why You Should Avoid Iron When Sick**

Feeling sick? Skip the iron. While it's crucial for our bodies, extra iron intake during illness can be counterproductive.

### **The Protective Mechanism of Ferritin Storage**

Ferritin stores iron and acts as a protective mechanism when we get sick. By limiting iron availability in the bloodstream, ferritin helps prevent disease-causing microbes from thriving.

However, consuming additional iron while ill could feed harmful bacteria instead of starving them off.

### **Risks Associated with Excess Iron Consumption When Unwell**

Taking extra iron when sick undermines your body's natural defenses and poses other risks. For instance, excessive free iron levels have been linked with increased [oxidative stress](https://www.drberg.com/blog/oxidative-stress-immune-system-and-viral-infection), inflammation, and disease progression in certain conditions like infections or cancer.

- **Oxidative Stress:** Occurs when there's an imbalance between free radical and antioxidant activity in your body. An imbalance between free radicals and antioxidants in the body may cause cellular and tissue harm.

- **Inflammation:** High levels of circulating free iron have also been associated with inflammation - another factor that can exacerbate illness symptoms.

- **Disease Progression:** Some studies suggest excess dietary or supplemental iron may contribute to disease progression in certain conditions like infections or cancer.

Avoiding high-iron foods and supplements might be beneficial during sickness periods, especially considering how easy it is for most people to meet their daily recommended intake without supplementation.

## Underlying Cause For Autism

# Underlying Cause for Autism

## **Understanding Autism and Oxidative Stress**

The real root cause of autism is often overlooked. It's not just genetics or environment, but more specifically, oxidative stress impacting neurons. This neuronal toxicity leads to inflammation, which plays a significant role in autism.

### **Role of Oxidative Stress in Autism**

When the production of free radicals outweighs our body's ability to neutralize them with antioxidants, oxidative stress occurs. In individuals with autism, this balance tends to tip towards more oxidative stress.

This excess can damage cells, proteins, and DNA. When it comes to brain cells, or neurons as we call them, this impact becomes particularly profound due to its direct link with neurodevelopmental disorders like autism.

### **Connection between Mitochondrial Dysfunction and Autism**

Beyond the immediate toxic effects on neurons, excessive oxidative stress also causes mitochondrial dysfunction - an issue frequently seen in those with autism.

Mitochondria are the powerhouse of our cells; they produce energy needed for cellular activities.

However, under high levels of oxidative stress, these tiny powerhouses falter, leading to impaired cell function, which may further contribute to autistic behaviors.

## What Are The Most Effective And Scientifically Supported Strategies Fo C7175D

# What are the most effective and scientifically supported strategies for addressing and mitigating Candida overgrowth in the body?

A good portion of the microbes in your gut are fungi, and candida is one type of fungi. Friendly fungi support the body in many different ways. It’s not until we change the environment that our friendly bacteria and fungi live in that they can become a problem. For example, one of the biggest side effects of antibiotics is candida overgrowth.

If the ratio of candida to bacteria is incorrect, this can lead to health issues. But bacteria release certain things to help keep candida in check. If candida does turn unfriendly, you need to know what you can do. One important thing to remember to support a healthy microbiome is to take probiotics if you have to take antibiotics.

**The best candida home remedies:**

1\. Take a probiotic and consume probiotic foods

2\. Avoid sugar and dairy

3\. Avoid carbs (do Healthy Keto®)

4\. Avoid sugar alcohols

5\. Consume capric acid (coconut oil or MCT oil)

6\. Consume vegetable fiber

7\. Consume natural herbal antibiotics (garlic, oregano oil, thyme, sage, or turmeric)

## What Are The Potential Health Implications Of Alkalizing The Body And  Fd21D3

# What are the potential health implications of alkalizing the body, and how does this approach influence systemic pH balance and overall physiological function?

The alkaline-cancer myth is that if you alkalize your body, you will be better protected against cancer. This is not true.

The first question you have to ask is, what part of the body are they even talking about? The stomach, intestines, saliva, urine, and blood all have different pH levels. Are they saying that you need to alkalize the entire body? This would cause devastating effects.

It’s true that tumors grow faster in an acidic environment; however, tumors and cancers make an acidic environment.

No studies show that alkalizing the body will reduce the risk of cancer.

Cruciferous vegetables are incredible for lowering the risk of cancer. The nutrients in cruciferous vegetables help cut off the blood supply to cancerous cells, making it far more difficult for them to live and replicate.

## Does Zinc Supplementation Effectively Aid In Treating Acute Or Chronic 41717A

# Does zinc supplementation effectively aid in treating acute or chronic diarrhea, and what are the mechanisms behind its benefits?

**There are two main reasons why people are deficient in zinc:**

1\. They don't have enough zinc in their diet. Most zinc in the diet comes from animal products.

2\. They are consuming foods high in phytates or phytic acid, which is in the fiber part of grains. Phytates block the absorption of zinc. 

**The three main purposes of zinc in relation to preventing diarrhea:**

1\. Zinc restores the mucosal barrier integrity of your intestines.

2\. Zinc is involved in the enzyme activity in intestinal cells. 

3\. Zinc is needed for antibodies to fight off pathogens.

**Other natural remedies for diarrhea other than zinc:**

• Bentonite clay 

• Kefir (unsweetened and whole-fat) and blackberries blended together

Another problem when it comes to diarrhea is that you lose your electrolytes and trace minerals. It may be beneficial to take trace minerals and electrolytes as well as zinc for diarrhea.

## What Are The Various Causes Of Hearing Loss Including Genetic Environm Fbd4F8

# What are the various causes of hearing loss, including genetic, environmental, and age-related factors, and how do they affect auditory function?

Your hearing function is dependent on your thyroid and iodine. Your thyroid gland regulates energy levels in your body, including those in your brain. Some of the brain parts that are responsible for hearing function require normal thyroid function for hearing to happen.

**Cause #1: Iodine deficiency**

Low levels of iodine can reduce the production of thyroid hormones and lead to dysfunction of the brain areas that control your hearing. Pregnant women commonly have iodine deficiencies, which can transmit to their infants--causing them to have hearing problems and other side effects.

## What Strategies Or Lifestyle Changes Can Be Implemented To Naturally E 8F616B

# What strategies or lifestyle changes can be implemented to naturally enhance dopamine levels in the body?

Dopamine has many functions. It’s involved in body movement, sleep cycles, gastrointestinal motility, food intake, learning, kidney function, and blood pressure. Dopamine is associated with behaviors and certain emotions. However, people on the lower end of the emotional scale aren't going to just have low dopamine but also other neurotransmitters and hormones. Dopamine is increased with pleasure, but it’s also increased with stress and pain.

**Conditions related to low dopamine include:**

• Parkinson’s

• Schizophrenia

• ADD or ADHD

• Depression

Medications used to treat the above conditions can deplete other neurotransmitters and have potential side effects.

Dopamine isn’t a single molecule that works on its own to create an effect. It’s a system that creates many different effects. Trying to increase dopamine without looking at the bigger picture isn’t going to work.

**Here are some action steps you can take if you have low dopamine:**

1\. Get rid of artificial stimulus

2\. Balance dopamine and other neurotransmitters

3\. Consume a little more animal protein and fat

4\. Support your gut microbiome

5\. Get plenty of vitamin C (leafy greens or sauerkraut)

6\. Get plenty of copper (shellfish or seafood)

## What Types Of Foods Are Associated With An Increased Risk Of Cancer

# What types of foods are associated with an increased risk of cancer?

Several factors can trigger cancer, including exposure to environmental toxins, aging, infections, and pollution. Here are six main foods that may potentially cause cancer:

1\. **Alcohol**: Chronic alcohol exposure can damage mitochondria, increasing cancer risk.

2\. **Trans Fats**: Found in fried foods and processed snacks, trans fats are linked to cancer and other health issues.

3\. **Burnt or Charred Meat**: Cooking meat at high temperatures forms harmful chemicals like HCAs and PAHs. Adding garlic or rosemary can reduce this risk.

4\. **Advanced Glycation End Products (AGEs)**: Formed when protein and sugar are heated together, AGEs are present in barbecued meats, fried foods, and ice cream.

5\. **Processed Meats**: Often contain nitrates, which are associated with increased cancer risk. Opt for grass-fed and grass-finished meat instead.

6\. **Ultra-Processed or Junk Foods**: High in sugar, unhealthy fats, and chemicals, these foods can cause inflammation and nutrient depletion.

Be cautious of Generally Recognized As Safe (GRAS) foods that may be unhealthy, such as maltodextrin, modified starch, high fructose corn syrup, corn oil, soy oil, canola oil, and corn syrup.

## What Are Some Effective And Scientifically Supported Natural Remedies  9C9Fa1

# What are some effective and scientifically supported natural remedies for mitigating the symptoms of anemia?

Iron deficiency anemia is either a case of lowered red blood cells, decreased hemoglobin, or a decreased ability to carry oxygen through the blood.

Iron deficiency symptoms include feeling tired, craving ice, weakness, and shortness of breath. In advanced cases, paleness is also a sign of iron deficiency.

Several things can cause iron deficiency anemia. Blood loss caused by menstruation or trauma, ulcers, parasites, fibroids, cancer, infections, and genetics are all potential causes of iron deficiency. One of the most common causes of iron deficiency is decreased absorption of iron caused by low hydrochloric acid in the stomach. Many people have low stomach acid which causes problems like GERD, acid reflux, and heartburn.

Apple cider vinegar with your meal can increase the absorption of iron and also decrease the negative side effects of low stomach acid. Antacids can worsen the problem by further depleting your stomach acid, making the stomach more alkaline, and decreasing the absorption of iron.

Oxalates found in spinach and Swiss chard can also deplete iron. If your diet is high in grains, you’re probably consuming a lot of phytic acid which can also bind to important minerals and decrease their absorption. Gastric bypass surgery can cause you to become deficient in iron. This surgery decreases the surface area of the stomach and decreases the absorption of iron and other important minerals. Digestive problems like IBS, Crohn’s, and celiac can also cause you to become deficient in iron.

It can be helpful to add the following iron-rich foods to your diet if you have iron deficiency anemia:

•Clams

•Oysters

•Meat

•Eggs

•Liver (grass-fed)

•Octopus

•Spirulina

## What Are The Various Underlying Causes Of Anemia Including Nutritional Ebc30D

# What are the various underlying causes of anemia, including nutritional deficiencies, chronic diseases, genetic factors, and environmental influences?

1. **Low stomach acid**

Low stomach acid level can cause inability to absorb minerals from food, including iron, therefore causing anemia.

2. **Excessive menstruation**

This means too much estrogen in the body. Regulating estrogen levels (lowering them) can help.

**Cause #5: Vegan diet-related**

Some of the vegan diet foods have certain things like oxalates or phytates that block iron. This makes it difficult to have enough iron intake. Try to avoid eating too many refined grains.

## What Are The Potential Health Benefits And Therapeutic Advantages Of C 8Abf22

# What are the potential health benefits and therapeutic advantages of chromium picolinate supplementation?

Chromium is a trace mineral needed in tiny amounts.  Insulin resistance is a situation where the receptors for insulin are resisting insulin; this then tells the pancreas to make more insulin. So, now you have high levels of insulin, but the insulin is ineffective. 

**There are a lot of side effects of having high insulin, such as:**

• Prediabetes

• Diabetes

• Belly fat

• Artery problems

• Eye problems 

• Kidney problems

• Heart problems

• Brain problems

• And more

**A few things chromium can do:** 

1\. Increase glucose transporters

2\. Decrease stress in endoplasmic reticulum

3\. Inhibit inflammation and oxidative stress 

4\. Increase glutathione 

**Benefits of chromium picolinate:**

1\. It can decrease cravings 

2\. It can help get you into keto faster

## What Are The Important Factors In Building Muscle Mass Beyond Protein

# What are the important factors in building muscle mass beyond protein?

We often think that increasing protein helps build muscle because muscle is made of protein. But this doesn’t always work. Some people that eat more protein may even suffer from amino acid deficiency. You need sufficient amounts of protein to build muscle, but, more importantly, you need sufficient amino acids.

The general thought is that you need .8 grams of protein per kilogram of lean body mass—not overall weight. This might look like around 50 grams of protein per day. A moderate amount of protein would be between 1.2 and 1.7 grams per kilogram of lean body mass. High protein would be about 2 grams per kilogram of lean body mass.

**It’s essential to focus on consuming quality protein from eggs, meat, fish, and dairy. It’s not ideal to rely on getting your protein from plant sources or protein powder to build healthy muscles.**

**Factors that influence the production of muscle protein:**

**1\. Insulin resistance**

What to do:

• Get on a low-carb diet (Healthy Keto®)

• Do intermittent fasting

**2\. Growth hormone**

What to do:

• Intense exercise

• Get plenty of sleep

• Do intermittent fasting

**3\. Testosterone**

What to do:

• Consume zinc (red meat, shellfish, seafood)

• Avoid refined carbs and sugar

• Lower your stress

• Avoid soy protein isolates, soy milk, beer, and alcohol

**4\. Stress**

What to do:

• Take a look at my other videos on how to lower stress

**5\. The microbiome**

What to do:

• Consume probiotic foods

**6\. Low stomach acid**

What to do:

• Take betaine hydrochloride

**7\. Low enzymes in the pancreas or small intestine**

What to do:

• Consume enzyme-rich foods

• Take an amino acid supplement

**8\. Lean protein**

What to do:

• Consume fattier protein sources

## What Are The Physiological And Metabolic Advantages Conferred By Maint 1D7Be1

# What are the physiological and metabolic advantages conferred by maintaining optimal iron levels in the body?

Iron is a nutrient needed for several reasons. These include feeding good and bad bacteria. Iron helps to maintain many vital functions in the body, like general energy and focus, gastrointestinal processes, the immune system, and the regulation of body temperature.

The benefits of iron often go unnoticed until a person is not getting enough of it. Iron deficiency can cause fatigue, heart palpitations, pale skin and breathlessness.

**Benefits**

- Increases energy

- Increases focus

- Treats anemia

- Helps to maintain gastrointestinal processes

- Helps to maintain the immune system

- Supports the regulation of body temperature

**Symptoms of deficiency**

- Fatigue

- Paleness

- Brittle nails

- Breathing problems

- Grooved nails

- Hair loss / hair thinning

- Twitching

- Irritation

- PICA

- Dirt, chalk, ice cravings

- Restless leg syndrome

**Causes of deficiency**

- Excessive menstruation

- Ulcers

- Hemorrhoids

- Colon cancer

- Vegan diet

- Antibiotics

- Low stomach acidity

- Malabsorption

- Inflammation (the more chronic inflammation you have - the less iron in your body)

**Problems with too much iron**

Too much iron in the body is very dangerous to the mitochondria of the cells. It can create a lot of problems. When you combine free iron with oxygen, it forms a very powerful free radical that can damage the fat layer that surrounds the nervous system, called the myelin.

In the body, iron must be formed with protein. Too much Iron can also cause destruction to specific parts of the brain, specifically the hippocampus—which then can lead to dementia.

Here is some additional information on the negative effects of too much iron.

- Iron is attracted to damaged tissues in the body (brain, nerve, eye, liver and heart) and oxidizes them

- Oxidizes tissues (creates a rusting effect), including the fat layer around the nervous system cells, and the brain

- Accumulates in the body

- Body can’t get rid of it efficiently

- All bacteria need iron to survive (including bad ones)

**Where to get it**

- Seafood

- Red meat

- Poultry

- Eggs

- Insects

- Clams

- Liver

- Kidney and other organ meats

- Oysters

- Octopus

- Fish

- Eggs

## How Does Diet Influence Sleep Quality And What Specific Foods Or Nutri 95E29B

# How does diet influence sleep quality, and what specific foods or nutritional habits can enhance or disrupt restful sleep?

On a high-carb, low-fat diet, you’re going to be more deficient in zinc. Zinc can greatly influence parts of the brain that control sleep. If you have a sleeping problem, taking zinc before bed may help. You will also be hungry all of the time. On the other hand, if you’re on a low-carb, high-fat diet, you won’t be as deficient in zinc. You will also have decreased hunger.

If you have poor sleep (in quality and quantity), you will notice an increase in the desire to eat. Poor sleep equals more hunger. One study found that poor REM sleep increases the absorption of glucose, which spikes blood sugars, which affects insulin, which makes you hungry. Also, if you’re not sleeping, you could have high cortisol, which can also lead to an increased appetite.

## What Mechanisms Might Explain Why Consuming Red Meat Could Lead To A W 37Faa2

# What mechanisms might explain why consuming red meat could lead to a worsening of symptoms or discomfort in some individuals?

**First, you may not have enough hydrochloric acid in your stomach to digest the protein. This is a common problem, and it’s easy to fix. All you need to do is to take some betaine hydrochloride and apple cider vinegar capsules. This will help increase your stomach’s acidity so you can properly digest red meat. Many people have this problem as they get older.**

The second issue that you may be accumulating too much iron. While iron is essential for a healthy body, too much can be a problem. The thing is, our bodies don’t have a natural mechanism to get rid of iron. So if you have too much, you can develop some problems, including liver issues, headaches, joint pain, fatigue, and insomnia.

## What Are The Various Factors That Can Contribute To Low Testosterone Levels

# What are the various factors that can contribute to low testosterone levels?

Taking statins for high cholesterol can lower testosterone production due to reduced cholesterol levels in the body. Low-fat diets and liver damage can also contribute to testosterone deficiency, manifesting in symptoms like low libido and erectile dysfunction.

Surprisingly, high iron levels, often from supplements or fortified foods, can further disrupt testosterone balance. Accumulating excess iron, especially with conditions like hemochromatosis, can lead to joint inflammation, oxidative damage in arteries and the brain, fatigue, memory issues, and blood sugar problems.

To address high iron levels naturally:

\- Consider IP-6 (phytic acid) on an empty stomach and EDTA to chelate iron.

\- Incorporate green tea and intermittent fasting.

\- Donate blood regularly to reduce iron stores.

\- Avoid iron-rich foods and supplements.

\- Increase zinc intake to support iron regulation.

Consult with a healthcare provider to test iron levels and discuss appropriate management strategies.

This is a really easy recipe. You don't have to steam the cauliflower, you just mix up the ingredients, and it fries up really nicely. We love to make them in a cast iron pan and serve them warm with sour cream. This is another great recipe to help you get plenty of cruciferous. I think you're really going to love it. 

**Cauliflower 'Non-potato' Pancakes**

**Ingredients:**

- 1 cup shredded cauliflower

- ½ cup shredded mozzarella

- 1 egg (If small, use 2.)

- ¼ cup almond flour

- ¼ cup finely chopped onion

- 1 tbl parsley

- 1 tsp salt,

- ½ tsp pepper  

**Directions:**

- Mix all ingredients.

- Heat skillet and add oil until hot. I love the cast iron skillet for this. 

- Drop a mound in the hot pan (about ¼ cup) and press down gently. Let one side become fully brown before turning.  Brown second side.

- Move to a plate with a paper towel to remove excess oil. 

- You may want a little more salt on top.

- Serve warm with a dollop of sour cream.

## What Methods And Diagnostic Tests Can Be Utilized To Determine The Pre 63A153

# What methods and diagnostic tests can be utilized to determine the presence of a bowel disease?

Bowel disease typically relates to your microbes. You have trillions of microbes in your gut, and there could be an alteration in the amounts or types of these microbes. Fiber is important to help feed your microbes. However, even though many people might disagree, whole grains are not a healthy source of fiber.

A lot of the microbes in your gut can actually morph from neutral to bad. This can happen when the environment of your gut changes.

**How to test for gut problems at home:**

**Step 1:** Eliminate all fiber from your diet for three days

**Step 2:** Add the fiber back into your diet for three days

**Step 3:** Compare how you felt while you were consuming fiber and while you weren’t

If fiber is causing your gut problems and you have to cut it out, your microbes can still survive. If your body doesn’t function well with fiber—don’t consume it. Fermented foods are fantastic for supporting your microbes. If you want to eventually introduce fiber back into your diet, try foods containing fermented fiber, like sauerkraut and kimchi.

## Are Beets Good To Consume For The Liver

# Are beets good to consume for the liver?

Beets have a lot of amazing properties. They can actually bind and hook up toxins and poisons and convert them to water-soluble particles. Beets can essentially help transform poisons into non-poisons. 

Other benefits of beets:

• They support the eyes 

• They support the blood pressure and arteries

• They help reduce fat from accumulating on the liver 

• They help prevent DNA damage (decreasing the risk of cancer and shrinking tumors in certain places in the body) 

• They are loaded with vitamin C, manganese, and copper  

If you’re going to consume beets, I would recommend that you steam them for no longer than 15 minutes. They’re great to have on salads. Beets are higher are high on the glycemic index, but they have a low glycemic load because they’re high in fiber. This means that they won’t spike your blood sugars unless you juice them. You can steam them, cook them (but don’t overcook them), or have pickled beets.

## What Exactly Constitutes Subclinical Hypothyroidism

# What exactly constitutes subclinical hypothyroidism?

Subclinical hypothyroidism occurs when thyroid function is slow, but blood tests appear normal. Key trace minerals essential for thyroid function include iodine, selenium, copper, and zinc. Zinc is particularly crucial as it aids in the conversion and synthesis of thyroid hormones (T4 and T3) and the thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH).

A hypothyroid condition can impede zinc absorption, potentially leading to a deficiency. If you have thyroid symptoms, consider increasing your zinc intake through shellfish, sea kelp, or supplements.

## What Are The Most Effective Approaches For Managing Or Eliminating Cys Cfac74

# What are the most effective approaches for managing or eliminating cysts on the kidneys or liver, and how can they address symptoms and support overall organ health?

With the cyst usually the body is trying to encapsulate and contain some toxicity. There's not a lot of data out there on how to reverse cysts. I do know in general when people have cysts and other parts of their body, whether it's external on their knee or other surfaces, I do know there's a couple common things that I've seen. Number one they have insulin resistance, they're doing too many carbs. Number two, they might need more iodine because it could be even fibrocystic breasts, for example. The antidote to that is iodine. Seek help.

## What Are The Common Causes Of Right Shoulder Blade Pain

# What are the common causes of right shoulder blade pain?

There’s a connection between your liver and your right side shoulder blade. When you get pain in your right shoulder blade, there’s a good chance it could be your liver. Your liver is a huge source of this deferred pain.

The problem can also be the gallbladder or bile duct. This can also irritate the phrenic nerve, which is connected to the neck and shoulders.

**Inflammation and fatty liver are the two main causes of an irritated liver. This is often due to:**

1\. Alcohol

2\. High carb diets

3\. Too much iron

4\. Vegetable oils

5\. Medications

Your diet is by far the biggest factor in liver health. If we compare our diets now to back in the 70s, we can see just how bad things have gotten. Since the 70s, we have increased…

• Grains by 29%

• Corn by 300%

• Vegetable oil by 300%

All of these foods increase inflammation, which can cause liver issues.

## What Are The Most Effective Natural Methods To Enhance Testosterone Levels

# What are the most effective natural methods to enhance testosterone levels?

1\. Increase your cholesterol intake - Do not go on a low-fat diet! Cholesterol is a precursor to testosterone.

2\. Moderate protein - High amounts of protein can cause insulin to spike, which can disrupt a healthy hormone balance. 6-8 oz of meat per meal should be plenty.

3\. Lower your carbs - Carbohydrates boost your insulin levels, which can lower your T level. A low-carb diet such as keto is ideal for boosting your testosterone naturally. Add intermittent fasting for an extra boost.

4\. Exercise - High-intensity interval training (HIIT) will help stimulate testosterone.

5\. Sleep - Getting enough sleep is vital to normal and healthy hormone levels. Poor quality and duration of sleep can cause an increase in cortisol, which can throw off your testosterone level. Long walks are great for getting better sleep and lowering cortisol.

6\. Lower your estrogen - Testosterone and estrogen oppose each other. If you have high estrogen, you will have lower testosterone. Avoid soy and non-organic products.

7\. Supplements - Zinc, Korean red ginseng, L-arginine, and D-aspartic acid are great supplements for supporting healthy testosterone levels.

The last couple of things I want to mention is that a fatty liver, high iron levels, and statin drugs may also cause low testosterone levels. Make sure you talk with your doctor about these potential problems.

## What Potential Health Advantages Does Chromium Provide

# What potential health advantages does chromium provide?

Chromium is a trace mineral needed in tiny amounts. 

Insulin resistance is a situation where the receptors for insulin are resisting insulin; this then tells the pancreas to make more insulin. So, now you have high levels of insulin, but the insulin is ineffective. 

**There are a lot of side effects of having high insulin, such as:**

• Prediabetes

• Diabetes

• Belly fat

• Artery problems

• Eye problems 

• Kidney problems

• Heart problems

• Brain problems

• And more

**A few things chromium can do:** 

1\. Increase glucose transporters

2\. Decrease stress in endoplasmic reticulum

3\. Inhibit inflammation and oxidative stress 

4\. Increase glutathione 

**Benefits of chromium picolinate:**

1\. It can decrease cravings 

2\. It can help get you into keto faster 

3\. It can be beneficial for those with PCOS

## What Are Effective Treatments And Preventive Measures For Addressing T D5Ca35

# What are effective treatments and preventive measures for addressing toenail fungus, especially for those seeking natural remedies or over-the-counter solutions?

**Tea tree oil is a good one. Iodine will kill off the fungus. So you put that on the toe. That's a good one.There's many others. But the tea tree oil is a good one as well. You can also use garlic. There's quite a few things.**

**There's also a really good delivery natural remedy that actually comes from the processing of trees. It's called DMSO.** And it's a highly soluble solution that tends to have its own anti-inflammatory properties as well as anti-pain. And you can put it topically. But it can drive in.

You can put like aloe or put something with it to drive in nutrition into the body topically. You have to make sure that at the same time there's nothing else that's on your skin because let's say, for example you have some rat poison in your house and you're putting the rat poison out and you get that on your hand, and you put DSMO or DMSO on your hand, then it's driving the poison inside your body. So it has to be a clean area without any type of extra things that you don't want driven into your body.

What's really wild is a great little demo is to put a little couple drops on your feet and you'll taste some garlic almost instantly because it absorbs into the tissues. It's very soluble. It goes through right into the joint, into the muscles. That's just a great remedy. But of course, guess what? You're probably not gonna easily find it or anything positive about it when you do a search because all that stuff has been kind of filtered out as misinformation.

## What Steps Should Be Taken If Conventional Acne Treatments Prove Ineffective

# What steps should be taken if conventional acne treatments prove ineffective?

Let's say you've tried everything to get rid of acne, including the healthy version of keto and fasting, but you still have acne. What can you do? If you haven't tried healthy keto and fasting yet, this combination may be very beneficial to help clear up acne.

A spike in androgens, a spike in estrogen, or a spike in both of these hormones could be what's behind your acne. Stress is one thing that can spike androgens and cause acne. It's important to do what you can to lower your stress levels.

DHT is something that can trigger acne. A few potential remedies for acne in this situation are saw palmetto, stinging nettle root, or black cohosh. A spike in estrogen (estrogen dominance) can be behind acne, especially cystic acne. There is an enzyme called aromatase that converts testosterone into estrogen. A few potential natural remedies for acne in this situation are stinging nettle root, cruciferous vegetables, and DIM.

Your liver regulates excessive amounts of hormones, especially estrogen. There could be something going on creating a buffer. A powerful natural remedy for this situation is milk thistle. Of course, the ketogenic diet and intermittent fasting may be beneficial too.

High levels of insulin can potentially cause acne and many other symptoms. Consuming a high-carb diet could cause high levels of insulin.

Dairy may also cause high estrogen. If you have a problem with acne, cutting out dairy may clear it up.

**Tips to get rid of acne:**

• Avoid dairy

• Avoid sugar and refined carbs

• Lower your stress

• Take certain herbs based on your situation

• Take zinc

• Take cod liver oil

• Avoid fluoride

## What Are The Effects Of Iron Overload

# What are the effects of iron overload?

In the United States, many pastas, breads, and cereals go through a process of iron fortification.

A diet high in fortified grains can often lead to a very high iron intake. Too much iron can have negative implications on your health.

**Iron is attracted to damaged tissues of the brain, nerve, eye, liver, and heart. If you have insulin resistance or any issues with damaged tissues, iron targets these tissues and oxidizes them. It can also oxidize the fat layer around your brain and nervous system.**

Metals like iron accumulate in the body, and you don’t have the ability to remove them. Your body can only get rid of 1.2 mg of excess iron per day. Many iron supplements contain a copious amount of iron, but you only need 8 mg of iron per day to prevent a deficiency.
All microbes need iron to survive—both good bacteria and pathogens need iron. Probiotics are incredibly efficient in regulating excess iron. The good bacteria in your gut utilizes excess iron in your body.
**The best way to rid your body of excess iron is through a process called chelation—binding with a metal or mineral to remove it from the body.**
Phytic acid is one of the best chelators. IP-6(inositol hexaphosphate) is a potent antioxidant that combines phytic acid and the B-vitamin inositol. IP-6 is an amazing chelator that inhibits the oxidative effects of iron. Dietary sources of phytic acid include vegetables, nuts, and seeds.

## How Can One Enhance The Bioavailability Of Iron From Dietary Sources

# How can one enhance the bioavailability of iron from dietary sources?

There are two types of iron: heme iron and non-heme iron. Heme iron comes from animal sources and non-heme iron comes from plant sources. Non-heme iron is not absorbed by the body as well as heme iron.

Consuming foods high in vitamin C alongside iron can help increase iron absorption. It’s best to consume foods with vitamin C, rather than synthetic forms of vitamin C like those found in vitamin C supplements. Some of the best sources of vitamin C are lemons, berries, and bell peppers.

Vitamin C is especially important if you’re getting your iron from plant sources. Avoid synthetic sources of iron like ferric oxide and ferric hydroxide.

## What Are The Health Benefits Associated With Adequate Iodine Intake

# What are the health benefits associated with adequate iodine intake?

Iodine is a trace mineral (one of the minerals needed in small amounts) that is involved in many different health processes. Thirty percent of the body’s iodine is stored in the thyroid gland (it is concentrated there) and the thyroid uses iodine to make its hormones, so when you see “T4” and “T3,” the numbers 3 and 4 represent the number of iodine molecules in each hormone. In the body T4 gets converted to T3. T4 is an inactive form of thyroid; T3 is the active form of thyroid and one is converted to the other through the liver and the kidney.

Globally, there are 1,572 million people at risk for having an iodine deficiency.

**Benefits**

- Supports your thyroid

- Supports cognitive function

- Boosts healthy weight loss and digestion

- Supports the reproductive system

- Balances estrogen ratios

- Topical iodine is good to remove skin tags and warts

**Symptoms of an iodine deficiency**

- Slow metabolic rate

- Fatigue

- Weakness

- Hair loss

- Dry skin

- Feeling cold

- Trouble learning

- Lower IQ

- Higher estrogen

**Causes of iodine deficiency**

- Fluoride (in tap water) blocking the absorption of iodine

- Bromate in flour products

- Grains

- Our soils don’t have the microbes to mobilize these trace minerals, so a lot of foods don’t have iodine anymore

- Consuming too many cruciferous vegetables (but you would have to consume a tremendous amount of them over a long period of time)

**How to consume it**

Follow the directions in the label to prevent iodine toxicity. Too much iodine can cause some side effects and can be toxic to your body.

If you have skin tags and warts you can put a drop of iodine on the skin tag and continue to do this for several days in a row. You may also want to put a little bandaid over it. You can do the same thing for a wart.

**Where to get it**

You can get it from the health food store or pharmacy, or order it online.

One of the best sources of iodine is called sea kelp. It has other beneficial nutrients in addition to iodine, like selenium. If you get sea kelp, it’s best to get it from a very clean and pristine part of the world. Organic Icelandic sea kelp is a fantastic choice.

You can also get Dr. Berg’s Sea Kelp Enhanced, which has a lot of benefits in addition to iodine.

## How Do I Use Epsom Salt For Toenail Fungus

# How do I use Epsom salt for toenail fungus?

Epsom salt is an effective ingredient. It’s a naturally occurring mineral salt that has some pretty good antimicrobial and anti-fungal properties. Here’s what you do:

Dissolve two tablespoons of Epsom salt into four cups of water in a bucket. You can boil the water first, although you don’t have to. The main thing is to get the salt dissolved. Keep the water warm, but if you’ve boiled it first be sure to let it cool down to a comfortable temperature.

Soak your feet in the mixture daily for fifteen minutes. Do this for three to four weeks. You’ll see a great improvement. I suggest you also use a nail file to get rid of some of the dead nails because the problem is that the fungus tends to get up underneath the nail and destroys it.

**Depending on how infected the nail is, you may find that your nail has to come off then regrow. Or if the infection isn’t too deep, your nail may just grow without the microbe that’s been fading it.**

**Avoid moisture, because this microbe likes a humid environment. So go to work without your shoes on. Just don’t tell them it was me who said so!**

All these steps are part of an at-home toenail fungus treatment that’s simple and effective.

## Is It Recommended To Take Copper

# Is it recommended to take copper?

Copper is a very important trace mineral (minerals that are needed in small amounts) that has to do with normal functioning of your brain and nervous system. It is also important for other functions and parts of your body.

Copper is good in the right amounts. You don’t want to have too much of it, as it has some toxic effects on you. You should know that when you increase copper, you severely decrease zinc, and you can create an imbalance. Estrogen also would increase copper in the body, and copper itself can stop the liver from removing excess amounts of estrogen.

**Benefits:**

- Has powerful effects on brain function

- Involved in making neurotransmitters

- Anti-inflammatory

- Antimicrobial

- Supports the Immune system

- Helps with vitiligo (for it, use copper cream directly on the skin)

- Important for collagen

- Supports melanin

- Can immobilize sperm

- Can decrease iron

- Can increase estrogen

- Impacts the vaginal microbiome (the bacteria that regulate estrogen)

## What Are The Most Effective Natural Interventions That Could Potential 391028

# What are the most effective natural interventions that could potentially reverse or slow down the progression of premature graying of hair?

It’s natural for your hair to turn gray with age. However, many people are getting gray hair way too early. Even though you may have genes that give you the propensity to get gray hair, there are still things you can do to help prevent your hair from graying prematurely.

The pigment in your hair and the enzymes that allow the pigment to occur are both dependent on copper. You could be deficient in copper from not consuming foods high in copper. High levels of stress can also cause a copper deficiency. It’s important to do whatever you can to decrease stress and increase copper to prevent gray hair. It may be best to get the copper you need from foods rich in copper rather than a supplement.

As you age, you accumulate hydrogen peroxide in the hair shaft. Hydrogen peroxide can cause a bleaching effect on the hair. To slow this accumulation of hydrogen peroxide, you can try consuming foods rich in catalase.

**Foods high in copper:**

• Seafood (especially oysters)

• Mushrooms

• Organic, grass-fed beef liver

• Spirulina

**Foods high in catalase:**

• Organic, grass-fed beef liver

• Vegetables (especially cruciferous vegetables)

• Sprouts or microgreens

**Things to avoid:**

• Alcohol

• Smoking

•Junk foods

• Sugar

• Refined carbs

• Low-fat diets

## How Does Chronic Inflammation Contribute To The Development Of Anemia

# How does chronic inflammation contribute to the development of anemia?

**Inflammation**

## Can Kids Consume Cereal

# Can kids consume cereal?

Cereal for kids isn’t recommended.

The worst time to feed someone cereal is when they’re an infant. Infant rice cereal is very popular. It contains inorganic arsenic. Infants also don’t have the enzymes to digest the cereal.

In the soils where grains and plants are grown, there is always going to be some arsenic in very small amounts. This is called organic arsenic. Our bodies can actually deal with this very easily. But, inorganic arsenic is different and is not healthy.

There is even an interesting study that talks about the exposure of infants to cereal increasing the risk of autoimmune diseases.

The other big problem is the amount of sugar in cereals. This sugar could set the child up for blood sugar issues down the road. With some cereals, 1 cup contains the amount of sugar that’s in a Twinkie.

The whole grains in cereal contain phytate. Phytate is a chemical in grains that will block the absorption of zinc and other important minerals.

Additionally, some kids have an allergy to gluten, which is in many kinds of cereal.

GMO grains have also been exposed to glyphosate, which can create problems with the immune system.

This is all in addition to the fact that fortification of cereal with synthetic vitamins can also cause problems.

## Can I Eat Salmon On Keto

# Can I eat salmon on keto?

Yes, you can. Wild-caught salmon is one of the best protein/fat sources that you can consume on keto. It has amazing amounts of omega-3 fatty acids, and contains great protein that is easy to digest.

Make sure it is wild-caught (Pacific) and not farm-raised (Atlantic), because the chronic consumption of farm-raised salmon has been proven to dramatically increase visceral fat, insulin resistance, and type 2 diabetes. It has been detected that pesticides, dioxins, and PCBs (polychlorinated biphenyls, which are highly toxic industrial compounds) in farm-raised salmon were the cause.

Also, an important point is that salmon has a good amount of selenium, a trace mineral involved in the key enzymes that detoxify heavy metals – including mercury. Selenium-based enzymes protect the brain and nervous system.

## What Factors Might Explain Why You Feel Worse After Consuming Meat

# What factors might explain why you feel worse after consuming meat?

**There are several reasons why it can happen. Let’s take a look at two:**

1\. You may not have enough hydrochloric acid in your stomach to digest the protein. This is a common problem and it’s easy to fix. All you need to do is to take some betaine hydrochloride and apple cider vinegar before your meal. This will help increase your stomach’s acidity so you can properly digest red meat. Many people have this problem as they get older.

2\. If you feel bad after eating red meat, it could stem from too much iron. While iron is essential for a healthy body, too much can be a problem. The thing is, our bodies don’t have
a natural mechanism to get rid of iron. If you are not on keto and consume grains, this can increase iron in the body drastically. If you have too much iron you can develop problems that include liver issues, headaches, joint pain, fatigue and insomnia.

## Is Tuna Good To Consume On Keto

# Is tuna good to consume on Keto?

Yes you can. Some types of tuna are good to consume, and certain types are bad. The “bad” types contain excessive amounts of mercury – 3 times as much as the “good” tuna varieties contain. Mercury interferes with certain enzymes involving selenium.

Some fish have more selenium than others. The mercury in the environment that the fish are exposed to might not affect you too much if the fish is high in selenium. This is because selenium can counter mercury. But if there is too much mercury in the fish, it can lock up the selenium enzymes, making them inactive.

This can create a lot of different symptoms, including:

- Tremors

- Headaches

- Nausea

- Insomnia

- Muscle weakness

- Twitches

- Mood swings

    Types of tuna that have lower amounts of mercury:

- Skipjack tuna

- Canned light tuna

    Types of tuna that have high amounts of mercury:

- Albacore tuna (canned white tuna)

- Ahi tuna (yellowfin tuna and bigeye tuna)

## What Are The Possible Causes Of Dark Circles Under A Childs Eyes

# What are the possible causes of dark circles under a child's eyes?

**It has to do with an iron deficiency. It does not mean that the child has anemia, but they may have anemia. Iron is involved in different chemical pathways and enzymes.**  

**Iron deficiency symptoms** 

• Fatigue 

• Dizziness

• Pale 

• Irritable 

• Ice cravings

• Delayed growth 

**Children should not take iron supplements from a drug store for dark circles under the eyes. Always do food-based iron, a food-based complex, or just the food. The child should also be consuming vegetables because when someone has an iron deficiency, they probably have other deficiencies.**

## Should I Encourage My Kids To Play In The Dirt More

# Should I encourage my kids to play in the dirt more?

**More specifically, they should be playing in the soil.**

**The difference between dirt and soil:**

1\. Dirt is dead. This could be sand, rock, or clay.

2\. Soil is living. It contains bacteria and fungus, which make nutrients available.

There are two parts of the immune system. There is the innate part, which you're born with. Then there is the acquired part. The acquired part learns from the environment. If a child is sick, I believe the best thing is to let the child go through the infection while providing them with key nutrients and allow them to build up antibodies. There is a huge connection between the gut and the brain. There are a lot of microbes in the gut that play an important part in the immune system. The microbes work together to help keep pathogens from invading the body.

**Potential benefits of children being outside more often than inside:**

1\. A decreased risk of asthma, allergies, and autoimmune issues

2\. Less inflammation and respiratory illness

3\. Improved mental health (both cognitive function and mood)

## What Are The Most Important Benefits Of Zinc For The Kids

# What are the most important benefits of zinc for the kids?

It’s very important that children have enough zinc in their diet and that they don’t consume things that could deplete them of zinc.  Zinc is important for kids mostly because the neurons in the forebrain are dependent on zinc. This is the part of the brain involved in cognitive processes, including thinking, memory, and speech. 

There are two studies that show a link between a zinc deficiency and neuropsychological problems, especially reasoning. 

**A zinc deficiency could potentially:**

• Inhibit a person’s ability to learn 

• Reduce the ability to have attention

## What Are The Primary Causes Of High Cholesterol And How Do Factors Suc Ec3C55

# What are the primary causes of high cholesterol, and how do factors such as diet, genetics, and lifestyle choices contribute to this condition?

Cholesterol is vital for brain function, hormone production, and cell health, acting as a repair substance in arteries damaged by inflammation. Factors influencing cholesterol levels include diet, bile production, thyroid function, and various health conditions:

\- **High-Carb Diet:** Increases insulin production, converting blood sugar into cholesterol. Remedies include the Healthy Keto® diet and intermittent fasting.

\- **Lack of Bile:** Impairs fat absorption and cholesterol elimination. Remedies include apple cider vinegar and purified bile salts.

\- **Hypothyroidism:** Low thyroid function can elevate cholesterol levels. Remedies include consuming sea kelp and selenium-rich foods.

Other factors like intestinal damage, antibiotic use, and certain health conditions can also affect cholesterol levels. Managing these factors is crucial for maintaining optimal cholesterol levels and overall health.

## What Mechanisms Explain The Phenomenon Of Stress Induced Graying Of Hair

# What mechanisms explain the phenomenon of stress-induced graying of hair?

Of course, other things can cause grey hair, like the normal aging process and genetic factors. But, there are epigenetic factors, which are above your genes, and you may be able to do something about your genes through your nutrition, environment, and more.

In the hair follicle, you have stem cells, which create pigment. When exposed to chronic stress, you get an elevation of noradrenaline. Noradrenaline is the precursor of adrenaline. They found that noradrenaline causes stem cells to migrate away from the hair root and into the skin. So, you lose your stem cells and, with them, the ability to keep your hair pigmented. The key is to keep your stress low.

## What Are The Most Important Benefits Of Zinc For Sleep

# What are the most important benefits of Zinc for sleep?

Zinc is a sleep modulator. It helps control sleep. Any time you take zinc, you also want to take copper. For every 8-10mg of zinc, take .5-1mg of copper. You may also find it beneficial to get your zinc and copper from a blend of trace minerals.

Oysters have the highest amount of zinc. They are loaded with taurine, which supports physical performance and sleep. They also contain GABA receptor agonist, which supports sleep.

## Is The Baking Soda Safe To Consume

# Is the baking soda safe to consume?

**The stomach should be extremely acid with a pH between 1-3. This is normal.** You need your stomach acids to be at that pH to digest proteins, kill microbes, and absorb minerals. When food goes through the stomach and then into the small intestine, the pancreas releases bicarbonate. Our bodies are supposed to have bicarbonate in the small intestine, not the stomach, to neutralize the stomach acid so it doesn’t damage the small intestine. Bicarbonates are alkaline. Baking soda is sodium bicarbonate. If you’re putting baking soda into your stomach, you’re going to mess up your digestion down the road.

Taking apple cider vinegar or betaine hydrochloride can help increase stomach acid and potentially help with acid reflux. A combination of betaine hydrochloride and zinc carnosine may also be effective.

## What Are The Potential Underlying Causes And Contributing Factors Asso 1D86D6

# What are the potential underlying causes and contributing factors associated with the development of endometriosis?

**Endometriosis** is a condition whereby the body is making extra tissue that grows outside the uterus - including the Fallopian tubes and ovaries. Estrogen dominance is the deeper cause of this.

Estrogen is anabolic (which means it makes things grow). Symptoms include painful periods, low back pain, and infertility.

**WHAT TO DO:**

1\. Eat organic as much as possible

2\. Eat cruciferous vegetables

3\. Increase iodine, which helps regular estrogen, in the form of sea kelp.

## What Helps To Stop Cold At First Sign

# What helps to stop cold at first sign?

First, take zinc and vitamin C together, but eat foods high in vitamin C as opposed to a supplement. I recommend eating lemons, as opposed to pasteurized lemon juice.

You can also drink apple cider vinegar because when you acidify your body with it, you speed up the action of white blood cells called phagocytes. They clean up bacteria as part of your immune system.

Eat garlic. It’s the most powerful anti-viral food I know. It’s also anti-bacterial. Make sure you do these things right when you get the first symptom of a cold.

## Is Gallbladder Olive Oil Flush Effective

# Is gallbladder olive oil flush effective?

A gallbladder flush with olive oil is intended to remove gallstones but typically only expels bile salts. Ironically, reducing bile can increase the risk of gallstones. Gallstones form when there is a high concentration of cholesterol and low bile levels. Bile is crucial for absorbing fat-soluble vitamins and fatty acids. A high-carb diet reduces bile release, while a high-fat diet does not cause gallstones if sufficient bile is produced. Fat triggers bile release, preventing stone formation, not causing it.

## How Do I Know If My Supplement Contains Maltodextrin

# How do I know if my supplement contains maltodextrin?

Iodine mixed with water is a golden color. If you combine iodine with starch, it turns blue. When you add iodine to bread, for example, it turns blue. Or, if you put maltodextrin in water and add a few drops of iodine, the water will turn blue. My brand of electrolyte powder doesn’t have any sugar or maltodextrin in it. However, when we look at a competitor’s electrolyte powder that also claims it doesn’t have sugar or maltodextrin, it turns blue when iodine is added.

Maltodextrin behaves like sugar, spiking insulin, but can be classified on a label as a carb and not a sugar. On the glycemic index, table sugar is at 65, and glucose is at 100—maltodextrin is between 105 and 185. Maltodextrin is the most common starch added to supplements and other products. If there is less than one gram of maltodextrin in a product per serving size, the company doesn’t even have to state it. Maltodextrin can also be found in flavorings, energy gels, sports powders, and even baby formulas. It’s important to be aware that some so-called keto-friendly products can also contain maltodextrin.

## Unmasking Hidden Ingredients In Your Food

# Unmasking Hidden Ingredients in Your Food

**Unmasking Hidden Ingredients in Your Food**

Did you know food manufacturers employ sneaky tactics to conceal what's really in your food?

- **The Rounding Rule:** If an ingredient is less than 500mg per serving, it might not even be listed! This means you could be consuming unwanted additives without even knowing it.

- **Sugar Overload:** There are over 200 different names for sugar, making it difficult to track your intake.

- **Incidental Additives:** These ingredients aren't for flavor, texture, or preservation, and if they make up less than 5% of the product, they can be hidden from the ingredient list. A common culprit is maltodextrin, a carbohydrate that acts like sugar in the body and has a higher glycemic index than table sugar.

- **Hidden Dangers:** Hexane, a neurotoxin, is used to extract soy protein isolates found in many plant-based products. Despite its dangers, there's no regulation on how much hexane can remain in your food.

**DIY Ingredient Detective:**

Want to uncover hidden starches? Add a couple of drops of iodine to a glass of water. If your food turns blue or purple when mixed in, it contains hidden starch!

It's time to become a savvy label reader and take control of what you consume.

## What Are The Primary Underlying Factors That Contribute To The Develop 15D99C

# What are the primary underlying factors that contribute to the development of a nodular goiter?

A goiter is an enlarged thyroid gland. You have a gland in your brain called a pituitary that creates a hormone called thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH). This connects to the thyroid gland. There are two purposes of TSH. First, it tells the thyroid to produce T4 and T3. Second, it causes the thyroid gland to increase in size. If there’s too much TSH, this could be why your thyroid is enlarged.

90% of the time, a goiter is a result of an iodine deficiency. Also, keep in mind that goiters can be associated with both hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism.

When someone who has a goiter is tested, they may find that they have higher T3 levels. This is because the body is trying to compensate. They may also have lower T4 levels.

## What Could Account For Fluctuating Iodine Levels In The Body

# What could account for fluctuating iodine levels in the body?

When evaluating iodine levels, blood tests may not offer a comprehensive assessment as iodine is primarily stored in the thyroid gland, not freely circulating in the bloodstream. A more precise method involves a skin test using a 2% iodine solution, available at pharmacies:

\- Apply a small amount of iodine solution to the skin on your arm or thigh.

\- Cover with a band-aid and leave for 24 hours.

\- Check the color of the iodine spot after 24 hours. Fading or disappearance suggests potential iodine deficiency, indicating absorption by the body. Unchanged color suggests sufficient iodine levels.

This method provides a direct evaluation of iodine absorption, offering a clearer indication of iodine status compared to blood tests alone. Consulting a healthcare provider is advisable for interpretation and guidance based on test results.

## Can Hypothyroidism Develop Into Hashimotos Thyroiditis

# Can hypothyroidism develop into Hashimoto's thyroiditis?

While hypothyroidism doesn't always lead to Hashimoto's thyroiditis, it's important to note that in about 90% of cases, hypothyroidism is indeed linked to this autoimmune condition affecting the thyroid. Therefore, addressing the underlying autoimmune issue is essential.

In this context, I recommend focusing on selenium intake, as it is generally more beneficial than iodine, although a moderate amount of iodine can still be helpful. I've created a detailed video on this topic for further guidance.

Additionally, many cases of thyroid dysfunction can originate in the gut, highlighting the significant connection between gluten, grains, and autoimmune responses. It is crucial to avoid these foods to help manage symptoms effectively.

## What Are The Most Effective Strategies For Managing Hypothyroidism

# What are the most effective strategies for managing hypothyroidism?

To address hypothyroidism, particularly Hashimoto's, focus on managing the autoimmune aspect rather than just the thyroid itself. Selenium is crucial for converting thyroid hormones and should be prioritized over iodine. It's also essential to eliminate gluten from your diet, as it can exacerbate the condition by mimicking thyroid tissue, leading to increased autoimmune attacks and gut issues.

Remember, hypothyroidism is often a secondary issue stemming from an immune problem. Simply treating with thyroid hormones like Synthroid or T4 may not address the root cause. For effective management, ensure proper conversion of T4 to the active T3 hormone. For more in-depth guidance, explore detailed resources and videos on the topic.

## What To Do Before During And After A Workout

# What to do before, during and after a workout?

It’s no surprise that there is an association between a lack of exercise and many different health concerns. One of the biggest benefits of exercise is that it increases the mitochondria. Various diseases are related to mitochondrial dysfunction, including cancer. Exercise also increases stem cells, which can turn into just about anything your body needs.

Exercise helps reduce stress, balance blood sugar levels, supports sleep, and has many other incredible health benefits.

**The four variables of exercise:**

1\. Duration

2\. Intensity

3\. Recovery

4\. Frequency

You need to give your body time to recover, not just between workouts but also during workouts. It's important to rest between four to five minutes between each set. This will allow your body to replenish ATP and help you train with maximum power. Intensity is key with exercise. Focus on higher intensity with more sets and lots of recovery. Many of the benefits of exercise also occur one to two days later during sleep.

Just a small amount of refined carbs can nullify the benefits of exercise. However, if you have diabetes or insulin resistance and are trying to build muscle on the keto diet, you can increase your carbs to 50 grams per day. The type of carbohydrates you can consume are berries and protein.

Other essential tips to increase the benefits from your workouts and support recovery:

1\. Do high-intensity interval training (HIIT)

2\. Come to a full stop vs. active recovery during HIIT workouts

3\. Put more focus on eccentric motions (elongating the muscles)

4\. Do contrasting therapy after you exercise

5\. Build up to exercising during a fasting state (eat one to two hours after a workout)

6\. Consume enough salt and electrolytes (consume electrolyte powder if needed)

7\. Consume red meat, eggs, and high-quality cheese

8\. Don’t exercise over soreness and focus on sleep instead

9\. Take copper before bed to enhance sleep

## What Are The Nutritional Benefits Of Broccoli Sprouts

# What are the nutritional benefits of broccoli sprouts?

Broccoli sprouts have more sulforaphane than any other food on the planet.

Sulforaphane is one of the most studied phytonutrients. It has many health benefits. Most of all, it inhibits breast and prostate cancer and tumors. Sulforaphane is actually a defense mechanism of plants. If a bug or microbe begins to eat the plant, the sulforaphane can kill it.

In the human body, it can actually detoxify carcinogens, which are things that cause cancer. It’s also a powerful antioxidant, which may help decrease your risk for cardiovascular disease, diabetes, neurodegenerative disease, and autism.

Some people do have a sensitivity to plant foods that have high levels of sulforaphane—so if you notice adverse effects, don’t continue eating broccoli sprouts. However, most of the population won’t have a problem with them. One drawback is that broccoli sprouts can deplete your iodine. However, you can take some sea kelp to counter this effect.

I recommend that you consume broccoli sprouts raw—they have ten times the amount of sulforaphane raw.
