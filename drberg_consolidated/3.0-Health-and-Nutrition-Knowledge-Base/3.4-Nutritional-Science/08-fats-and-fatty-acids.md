## What Brand Of Black Seed Oil Does Dr. Berg Recommend

# What brand of black seed oil does Dr. Berg recommend?

**Black Seed Oil: A Timeless Remedy with Modern Benefits** 

While we don't have a specific brand recommendation for **Black Seed Oil** (also known as cumin oil), this ancient remedy, though not the best-tasting, offers a remarkable array of health benefits backed by extensive research. There are over 600 peer-reviewed studies on black seed oil, and it was even discovered in King Tut's tomb, highlighting its long-standing recognition. 

Black seed oil is a rich source of **trace minerals, B vitamins, and healthy fatty acids**. It's renowned for its powerful **antibacterial, antiviral, antifungal, and anti-inflammatory properties**. 

It's particularly effective for **pain and inflammation**, and can be used both **topically and orally**. 

Beyond these broad benefits, black seed oil is incredibly valuable if you're dealing with **insulin-related issues**, whether you're prediabetic or diabetic. It works by supporting the **beta cells** responsible for insulin production. It's also beneficial for **digestion, indigestion, and ulcers**. 

The recommended usage for black seed oil is **1 to 3 teaspoons daily**. It's best to start with **half a teaspoon** and gradually increase your intake to assess tolerance. For enhanced benefits, especially for pain and inflammation, you can **mix it with DMSO in a 1:1 ratio**, as DMSO can significantly aid its absorption when used topically.  

**Best Practices for Buying Black Seed Oil:** 

When purchasing black seed oil, focusing on quality is key to maximizing its potential benefits. Here's what to look for: 

1. **"Cold-Pressed" and "Unrefined":** This is crucial. Cold-pressing ensures that the oil's delicate compounds, including its volatile oils and fatty acids, are preserved and not damaged by heat. Unrefined means it hasn't been chemically processed. 

2. **100% Pure Black Seed Oil (Nigella Sativa):** Ensure the product contains only pure black seed oil without any fillers, additives, or other oils. The botanical name is *Nigella Sativa*. 

3. **Packaging: Dark Glass Bottle:** Black seed oil is sensitive to light and heat, which can degrade its beneficial compounds. Always choose oil packaged in a **dark glass bottle** (amber or cobalt blue) to protect it from UV light. Avoid clear plastic bottles. 

4. **Thymoquinone Content:** Thymoquinone (TQ) is the primary active compound in black seed oil, responsible for many of its therapeutic effects. Some high-quality brands will list the percentage or amount of TQ. Aim for at least 1-2% TQ, with higher percentages indicating more potency. 

5. **Organic Certification:** An organic certification ensures that the seeds were grown without synthetic pesticides, herbicides, or fertilizers. 

6. **Third-Party Testing:** Reputable companies often provide third-party lab testing results to confirm purity, potency, and absence of contaminants (like heavy metals or solvents). Check their website for this information. 

By following these recommendations, you can choose a high-quality black seed oil to incorporate into your wellness routine.

## What Is The Best Diet For Familial Hypercholesterolemia

# What is the best diet for Familial Hypercholesterolemia?

With this condition, a person has 50 percent of the LDL receptors than usual, which means they have a higher risk of a buildup of LDL. The top signs of familial hypercholesterolemia are fat deposits on the Achilles tendons, wrists, or eyelids and a condition called arcus senilis, which is whitening around the iris.

**Key points from an important study:**

• The current dietary guidelines for the management of coronary heart disease in familial hypercholesterolemia are based on outdated and unsupported information.

• There’s no evidence to support the recommendations of consuming a low saturated fat diet or low cholesterol diet, which are given to individuals with a genetic cholesterol problem.

• A low-carb diet was found to significantly improve cardiovascular disease biomarkers.

• There is sufficient rationale for conducting clinical trials to assess the effects of a low-carb diet on familial hypercholesterolemia individuals with insulin resistance.

It may be good to question if lowering the cholesterol and saturated fats in your diet is the best strategy to focus on. But talk to your doctor before making any changes to your diet or medications. In my opinion, people with high cholesterol should focus more on lowering their carbs rather than saturated fat or cholesterol.

## How Do I Know If The L. Reuteri Yogurt Is Working

# How do I know if the L. reuteri yogurt is working?

Dr. Davis's L. reuteri yogurt can help in many ways. Look for these signs after consuming the yogurt regularly for at least 3 weeks:

- Strengthened immune system

- Enhanced muscle tone and healing

- Improved digestion and gut motility

- Improved hair condition

- Increase libido

The L. reuteri must colonize in the gut for these signs to appear. It is recommended to perform a stool sample to test for bacterial strains before starting the L. reuteri yogurt and again 6 weeks after you have started. The count of L. reuteri in the stoll should increase dramatically. If you have already begun with the L. reuteri yogurt, you can take a stool sample test to determine the amount of L. reuteri in your stool, which will help determine if they are colonizing in your gut.
A low level of L. reuteri in a stool sample is generally considered below 1,000 colony-forming units (CFU) per gram of stool. There is no specific “optimal” level of Lactobacillus reuteri in stool samples established in the current research. Low levels may indicate insufficient colonization, possibly due to poor diet, stress, or lack of supplementation or improper yogurt preparation.

## What Are The Benefits Of Fish Oil For Cardiovascular Health And How Do Bcea81

# What are the benefits of fish oil for cardiovascular health, and how do its compounds affect blood lipids, inflammation, and circulation?

**Fish Oil: The Natural Blood Thinner with Many Benefits**

Ever wondered if fish oil acts as a blood thinner? The answer is yes! It contains omega-3 fatty acids (EPA and DHA) that can reduce blood clotting and promote healthy blood flow. This means a lower risk of heart attacks, strokes, and other cardiovascular issues.

But, there's a catch: if you're on blood-thinning medication, taking fish oil could increase your risk of excessive bleeding. So, it's important to consult your doctor before adding fish oil to your routine.

**The Power of Fish Oil**

Fish oil, derived from oily fish like salmon and sardines, is a fantastic source of EPA and DHA. These omega-3s play vital roles in:

- **Brain Health:** Boosting memory and cognitive function

- **Eye Health:** Protecting against age-related vision decline

- **Immune Function:** Strengthening your body's defense system

- **Heart Health:** Reducing inflammation, blood pressure, and cholesterol levels

- **Weight Management:** Improving insulin sensitivity and promoting satiety

- **Mental Health:** Lowering the risk of depression

- **Skin Health:** Strengthening the skin's barrier and reducing inflammation

**Fish Oil Dosage: How Much is Enough?**

Most fish oil supplements provide 1-2 grams of omega-3s per serving, which is a good starting point. However, higher doses (up to 4 grams) may be beneficial for specific health conditions.

Pregnant women and those with high triglycerides or cholesterol should consult their doctor about optimal fish oil dosage.

**Potential Downsides**

While generally safe, fish oil can have a few downsides:

- **Fishy Aftertaste & Bad Breath:** Taking it with food usually helps.

- **Increased Bleeding Risk:** Avoid if you're on blood thinners.

- **Potential Drug Interactions:** Check with your doctor if you take any medications.

- **Quality Concerns:** Choose high-quality supplements from reputable brands to minimize exposure to contaminants.

**Key Takeaways**

- Fish oil acts as a natural blood thinner, promoting cardiovascular health.

- It offers a wide array of benefits, from brain health to glowing skin.

- Consult your doctor before taking fish oil, especially if you're on medication.

- Choose high-quality supplements and consider taking them with food.

**Incorporating fish oil into your routine can be a simple yet powerful step towards a healthier you. Remember, always talk to your doctor first to ensure it's the right choice for you.**

## Why Do I Get Diarrhea On Keto

# Why do I get diarrhea on Keto?

Why do you get diarrhea on keto? There are a few reasons, which I’ll explain. First, you may not be used to digesting the amount of saturated fat required on keto. Your body will produce more bile, which lubricates your colon. Cut back on your oil consumption, especially if it’s in a liquid form like MCT oil. Also, reduce the amount of butter and coconut oil you’re consuming. See if that helps.

A more likely reason is that you’re not used to digesting the quantity of vegetables I recommend. Certain compounds in some vegetables can overwhelm the microbes in your small intestine. Switch the type of vegetables you’re consuming to safe ones: lettuce, cucumber, tomato, zucchini, bell pepper, and bean sprouts.

For now, avoid consuming onions, garlic, artichokes, beetroot, leeks, Brussel sprouts, and cabbage. As well, temporarily avoid green beans, avocados, blackberries, cauliflower, mushrooms, and fennel. Stick with the safe vegetables I listed, and try consuming fermented vegetables.

As your microbes start multiplying and adapting to the safe vegetables, you’ll be able to gradually include more of the ones you were temporarily avoiding. Ease more of them in after three or four weeks. You should no longer get diarrhea on keto.

## What Is The Best Treatment For Gout And How Do Therapies Target Its Un Cd98B5

# What is the best treatment for gout, and how do therapies target its underlying causes?

Today, I’m going to share the best remedies for gout. The current medical treatment has side effects, but these natural remedies have little to no side effects.

Gout is a situation where there is a buildup of uric acid. The crystals primarily build up in the big toe, but they can build up in other places as well.

This protocol for gout involves natural remedies that help excrete uric acid and help reduce pain during a gout attack.

It’s important to note that eliminating sugar and alcohol from your diet may help improve gout symptoms. You can also try drinking more water and raising the pH of your urine to help with the symptoms of gout.

The best foods for gout are probiotic foods like sauerkraut and kimchi. Consuming large salads may also be beneficial.

The best natural gout protocol:

1\. White Chinese mulberry extract

2\. Chinese cinnamon (Cinnamomum cassia)

3\. Omega-3 fatty acids (cod liver oil)

4\. Alpha-lipoic acid

5\. Devil’s claw or cat’s claw (for pain relief)

6\. Iporuru (for pain relief)

Try this protocol for at least two to three weeks, and I think you’re going to notice a difference.

## Whats The Worst Ingredient In The World

# What's the worst ingredient in the world?

This section explores the research of Dr. Chris Knobbe, an ophthalmologist who has studied seed oils and their potential connection to health problems.

**The Shift from Fat to Seed Oils:**

While sugar intake remained relatively stable between 1922 and 1987, obesity rates skyrocketed by 600%. During this same period, vegetable oil consumption soared from 78 to 497 calories per person per day. Today, the average American gets roughly a third of their daily calories from seed oils.

**Seed Oils and Metabolic Issues:**

Dr. Knobbe's research suggests that seed oils might contribute to diabetes by hindering the body's ability to burn fuel efficiently due to mitochondrial dysfunction.

Seed oils are high in omega-6 fatty acids, which can accumulate in fat tissue, cell membranes, and mitochondria. These polyunsaturated fats may promote oxidation and inflammation within the body. Additionally, seed oils might lack essential nutrients, forcing the body to use its reserves, leading to deficiencies.

**From Industrial Uses to Our Plates:**

Interestingly, cottonseed oil, the first widely used seed oil, was originally intended for industrial applications like machinery and lamps. Its introduction into food aimed to replace butter and lard, which ultimately proved successful from a commercial standpoint. By 2010, seed oil consumption in the US had reached a staggering 80 grams per person daily.

**Reducing Seed Oil Intake:**

The simplest way to minimize seed oil consumption is to limit processed foods and focus on whole, unprocessed options like meat, eggs, dairy, and fresh produce. These foods naturally contain a variety of essential nutrients.

While Dr. Knobbe's research raises interesting questions, it's important to consult with a healthcare professional for personalized dietary advice.

## What Is Glycine And What Are Its Essential Roles And Significance In P 1Fa4D5

# What is glycine, and what are its essential roles and significance in physiological processes, including metabolic functions, neurotransmission, and tissue repair?

**Glycine, beyond its crucial role in collagen production, supports various body functions contributing to overall health and disease prevention.**

**Antioxidant Production and Inflammation Reduction**

Glycine is essential for producing glutathione, the body's primary antioxidant, protecting cells from oxidative stress and inflammation. By supporting glutathione synthesis, glycine enhances the body's defenses against chronic diseases.

**Enhancing Sleep Quality**

Glycine improves sleep quality by promoting deeper, more restful sleep. Studies indicate that taking glycine before bed can help individuals fall asleep faster and achieve more restorative slow-wave sleep, crucial for repair, hormone balance, and cognitive function.

**Detoxification and Uric Acid Management**

Glycine aids liver detoxification processes, helping eliminate toxins and excess uric acid. This detoxification role may prevent conditions such as gout and kidney stones, illustrating glycine's impact on overall health.

**Regulating Blood Sugar Levels**

Glycine enhances insulin effectiveness and stabilizes blood sugar levels, essential for individuals with type 2 diabetes or those at risk. By supporting healthy insulin function, glycine may prevent diabetes and aid in weight management by reducing cravings and promoting satiety.

## What Is The Difference Between Real Food Vs. Processed Foods

# What is the difference between Real Food Vs. Processed Foods?

**Don't Be Fooled by Nutrition Labels!**

Product labels can be misleading. Let's look at two examples:

- **Product A:** 29 grams total fat, 4 grams saturated fat, 17 grams carbohydrates, 1 gram sugar.

- **Product B:** 8 grams total fat, 1 gram saturated fat, 16 grams carbohydrates, 0 grams sugar.

Based on numbers alone, you might think Product B is healthier. But here's the surprise:

- **Product A is an avocado** – a natural, whole food packed with healthy fats, vitamins, and fiber.

- **Product B is Doritos** – a highly processed snack with unhealthy ingredients like corn, vegetable oil, maltodextrin, MSG, and more.

**The Key Takeaway:** Nutrition labels tell only part of the story. To truly determine a food's healthfulness, you must examine the ingredients list.

**Real Food vs. Processed Products**

Real food nourishes your body. Ultra-processed products are often loaded with harmful ingredients and offer little nutritional value. They're a major contributor to disease and poor health.

**Focus on Ingredients, Not Numbers**

If you want to identify healthy foods, skip the nutrition facts and go straight to the ingredients. Here are 3 major red flags to look out for:

1. **Seed oils:** Highly inflammatory and damaging to your health.

2. **All forms of sugar:** Spikes blood sugar and contributes to numerous health issues.

3. **Starches:** Break down into sugar in the body, leading to the same problems as added sugar.

Choose whole, unprocessed foods for true nourishment and optimal health!

## What Is The 1 Food I Should Avoid If I Want To Have A Healthy Liver

# What is the #1 food I should avoid if I want to have a healthy liver?

It’s a myth that liver damage is permanent. The liver is one of the only organs that can regenerate itself 100%. Another myth is that the liver is filled with toxins. The liver detoxifies poisons, it doesn't store them. **The worst “food” or ingredient for your liver is seed oils.** **Seed oils are damaging, inflammatory, and high in omega-6 fats, specifically linoleic acid. Lard contains about 2.5% linoleic acid, and tallow only contains 0.7%. Corn oil contains 56.6% linoleic acid!**

**Seed oils contain oxidized linoleic acid that can cause significant oxidative damage in the body, especially in the liver and the nervous system.** The average diet is 25 to 30% seed oils, which is too much. Seed oils become lodged in our fat cells and the membranes surrounding the nervous system and can remain there for 2 to 3 years. Seed oils can’t be used for energy. They inflame the liver and contribute to insulin resistance. You should avoid seed oils, including canola oil, soy oil, and cottonseed oil, which are commonly labeled as vegetable oil.

Always check food labels and avoid seed oils and foods that contain them. Replace seed oils with oils high in omega-3 fatty acids rather than omega-6. Reduce your consumption of grain-fed animal products and look for grass-fed meats.

## What Is The Food That Creates Liver Problems

# What is the food that creates liver problems?

Liver problems often go unnoticed, but subtle signs like right shoulder blade pain or discomfort under the right rib cage can be indicators. Contrary to popular belief, liver damage isn't always permanent. This incredible organ has the unique ability to fully regenerate itself. Another misconception is that the liver stores toxins. Its role is to filter and neutralize them, not hoard them.

A major culprit for liver damage isn't a "food" at all, but rather seed oils. These oils are rife with inflammatory omega-6 fats, particularly linoleic acid. In contrast, animal fats like lard and tallow have significantly lower amounts. Seed oils contain oxidized linoleic acid, a substance that can cause serious harm to the liver and nervous system.

Unfortunately, seed oils make up a whopping 25-30% of the average diet. These oils get trapped in our fat cells and nervous system membranes, lingering for years. They can't even be used for energy! Instead, they contribute to liver inflammation and insulin resistance. Steer clear of seed oils, including common ones like canola, soy, and cottonseed, often masquerading as "vegetable oil".

Make it a habit to read food labels carefully and avoid any product containing seed oils. Swap them out for oils rich in omega-3 fatty acids, and opt for grass-fed meats over grain-fed. These small changes can make a world of difference for your liver health.

## The Transition To Ketosis During Fasting

# The Transition to Ketosis During Fasting

During fasting, glycogen stores are depleted, prompting the body to produce ketones from stored fat. This process, known as ketosis, allows the brain and other organs to use ketones as an alternative fuel source when glucose is scarce.

**Glycogen Depletion and Ketone Production**

Within the first 12 to 24 hours of fasting, glycogen stores are exhausted, leading to lipolysis, where fat is broken down into free fatty acids and glycerol. The liver then converts these fatty acids into ketones through ketogenesis, typically starting around 12 to 24 hours into the fast.

As fasting continues, glucose and insulin levels decrease, prompting the body to use fat for energy. By 12 to 72 hours, approximately 40% of fat is utilized for ketone production. Prolonged fasting promotes adaptation to ketosis, enhancing the body's efficiency in using ketones and fat for energy.

## What Are The Signs Of Leaky Gut Present

# What are the signs of leaky gut present?

**A very thin, single layer of cells acts as a barrier between the inside and the outside of your intestines. The intestines provide protection and absorption of 90 percent of all your nutrients. They also contain a mucus layer, microbes, and 80 percent of your immune system.**

Medical professionals typically recommend increased soluble fiber intake to fix leaky gut when you should actually do the opposite. The carnivore diet is the best leaky gut diet. More fiber creates more inflammation in this situation. Medical professionals also do not point to diet as a primary cause or solution of a leaky gut. Most diseases are triggered by something in your gut, which has everything to do with your diet.

Broad-spectrum antibiotics can also affect gut health. Tampering with your gut microbiome can have serious consequences. You need the microbes in your gut to help you digest, and you don’t want them to become pathogenic.

**Glyphosate is an herbicide sprayed on most GMO and conventional foods patented as an antibiotic, so it has an antibiotic effect on your body. Whole grains are also recommended, but they can wreak havoc on a leaky gut and cause an immune reaction. Seed oils are another major contributor to leaky gut.**

**Here are seven signs of a leaky gut:**

1\. Abdominal pain, cramping

2\. Constipation, diarrhea

3\. Fatigue

4\. Brain fog

5\. Mood issues, anxiety

6\. Skin inflammation

7\. Autoimmune diseases

When you have an autoimmune response, your body considers normal tissues foreign or pathogenic. If your body sees your thyroid as an invader, your thyroid will become inflamed. This is known as Hashimoto’s and starts with inflammation and a leaky gut. The carnivore diet for a few months can help repair a leaky gut by removing the foods causing inflammation. Glutamine and glycine can also help with leaky gut repair.

## What Is Essential Fatty Acid Deficiency

# What is essential fatty acid deficiency?

## **Understanding Essential Fatty Acid Deficiency**

[Essential fatty acid deficiency](https://www.drberg.com/blog/the-danger-of-not-absorbing-fats) is no joke. It can lead to some pretty gnarly symptoms if left unchecked. The good news is that you can prevent it by making sure you eat enough of the right foods.

![Image](https://drberg-dam.imgix.net/others/blog-hair-loss-the-missing-link-1.jpg?w=992&auto=compress,format)

### **Symptoms That Signal a Deficiency**

So, what are the red flags to watch out for? Here are some of the most common symptoms of essential fatty acid deficiency:

- Bumps on the back of your arms (not the cute kind)

- Dry, scaly skin that just won't quit

- Hair loss and changes in hair color (and not in a fun, experimental way)

- Vision problems (and not because you've been staring at your phone too long)

- Mood issues (because who needs stable emotions anyway?)

- Cognitive function problems (wait, what were we talking about?)

If you're experiencing any of these symptoms, it's time to examine your diet more closely and make some changes.

### **The Role of Dietary Sources**

So, what should you be eating to prevent essential fatty acid deficiency? Here are some of the best dietary sources:

- Eggs (the incredible, edible kind)

- Fish (but not the kind that sings "Under the Sea")

- Olives (and not just in your martini)

- Nuts (but not the kind that drives you crazy)

- Seeds (the kind you eat, not the kind you plant)

Integrating these edibles into your meals will boost your intake of vital fatty acids crucial for optimal bodily performance.

But what happens if you're eating all the right foods and still experiencing deficiency symptoms? That's where absorption issues come into play.

## The Brains Unique Nutritional Needs

# The Brain's Unique Nutritional Needs

## **The Brain's Unique Nutritional Needs**

Our brains are fascinating, complex organs. Despite making up just 2% of our body weight, they use a whopping 20% of the energy we consume. But that's not all; the brain has other unique characteristics.

### **The Brain's High Energy Consumption**

A high-performance engine needs top-quality fuel to run efficiently; your brain is no different. It consumes about one-fifth of your daily calorie intake. That's quite impressive, given its tiny size compared to the rest of your body.

This high demand for energy underscores how important it is to feed your mind with nutrient-rich foods. Doing so, you help ensure optimal performance and health for this critical organ.

### **Brain Regeneration and Size**

Contrary to popular belief, intelligence is not determined by the size of one's brain. No correlation exists between intellect and brain size. What matters more is the complexity within our grey matter.

Fascinatingly, certain parts of our brains can regenerate, too – something once thought impossible in neuroscience. While not all areas have this capability, some regions, like the hippocampus, show promising signs of regrowth under specific conditions.

## **Harmful Foods for Brain Health**

Despite weighing only 2% of your body mass, the brain is an enormous energy consumer, devouring up to 20% of your daily caloric intake. It gobbles up to 20% of your daily calorie intake. However, not all foods are beneficial for this vital organ.

### **The Impact of Omega-6 Fatty Acids**

[Omega-6 fatty acids](https://www.drberg.com/blog/omega-6-fats-and-inflammation) can be tricky. They're essential fats our bodies need but can't produce - so we must get them from food. Excess consumption of omega-6 fatty acids relative to [omega-3s](https://www.drberg.com/blog/omega-3-fatty-acids-reduce-insulin-resistance) can lead to inflammation in the brain.

Foods like vegetable oils (think soybean or corn oil) and certain nuts and seeds are high in omega-6s.

When these foods dominate our diet without adequate counterbalance from omega-rich fish or flaxseeds, it's like inviting a rowdy party-goer into your home who starts throwing furniture around—that's what inflammation does to your delicate brain cells.

### **Sugar and Refined Carbohydrates' Role in Insulin Resistance**

Next on the 'bad guys' list are sugar and refined carbohydrates—these culprits aren't just waistline expanders but also dangerous for the mind.

[Research shows](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5133120) that diets high in sugar lead to [insulin resistance](https://www.drberg.com/blog/insulin-resistance-and-gluconeogenesis) over time—a condition where cells stop responding effectively to insulin signals. The result? Your neurons starve as they struggle with glucose uptake, impacting cognitive function negatively.

Frequent consumption of sodas, candy bars, pastries—even seemingly healthy foods like some breakfast cereals—can be akin to signing a 'do not disturb' sign for your brain cells. The takeaway? Be mindful of what you feed your body—it directly impacts your mind's health and function.

## What Is Bill Gates Apeel

# What is Bill Gates Apeel?

Bill Gates’ new product, Apeel, is used to make fresh produce last longer. Of the ingredients in Apeel, 99.34 percent are listed as “other ingredients,” which is a red flag because of the lack of transparency. We know that Apeel contains monoglycerides and diglycerides—emulsifiers, which help mix things together. Apeel also contains solvents and heavy metals, including palladium, cadmium, lead, mercury, and arsenic! Manufacturers claim these metals are safe in small amounts, but there is no data about chronic consumption over time. Apeel also contains polyethylene glycol, a compound found in antifreeze.

Apeel could be a partially hydrogenated product. The FDA has banned trans fats, but loopholes still allow manufacturers to use them in their products. If a product has less than .5 grams of trans fats, the FDA allows them to round it down to zero and not report the trans fats in the product. If a product is classified as an emulsifier, not a lipid or fat, it is exempt from the FDA’s ban on trans fats.

There is some controversy surrounding the function of the Apeel coating on produce. Is it a coating to keep food fresh or a fungicide? The EPA and the OMRI describe Apeel as a fungicide used after harvest, but Apeel is advertised as a protective coating. There’s no way to remove the Apeel coating from your fresh produce, so it could potentially lock pesticides or pathogens inside. Think twice about buying fruits and vegetables that have this coating on them.

## What Strategies Or Practices Are Most Effective For Enhancing Learning 74977C

# What strategies or practices are most effective for enhancing learning and cognitive performance?

**It all starts with the hippocampus.** Your hippocampus is the structure in your brain that has to do with learning and spatial memory. The omega-3 fatty acid called DHA makes up 20% of your brain’s grey matter (including your hippocampus).

**DHA also helps…**

• Support your retina

• Lower oxidative stress/acts as an antioxidant

• Reduce inflammation

• Increase BDNF (this helps your brain grow)

• Boost the volume of the hippocampus

As you age, the structure of your hippocampus shrinks. In turn, this can affect your ability to learn and maintain spatial memory. If you’re DHA deficient, your hippocampus will get even smaller. Taking omega-3 fatty acids can greatly benefit the hippocampus and improve your ability to learn. DHA is involved with the synapses—these allow communication between neurons. Low levels of DHA can even cause ADHD and dyslexia. The brain and retinas depend on DHA.

**If an infant is not breastfed, the makeup of their retina may be abnormal due to low levels of DHA. In fact, DHA can even influence a child’s IQ.**

**The best sources of DHA are:**

• Fatty fish

• Cod liver oil

• Algae

## What Are The Potential Causes Of White Patches On The Tongue And How D 821Faf

# What are the potential causes of white patches on the tongue, and how do factors such as infections, oral conditions, and irritants contribute to this phenomenon?

White tongue can cause cosmetic discomforts. I always suggest handling the problem from the inside out. Cleaning the tongue is only a temporary solution and will not resolve the underlying issues.

**Cause 1: Overgrowth of candida**

Candida normally is a friendly microbe in the body. But this microbe can turn into fungus if you take antibiotics, birth control pills, or if you are on a high-carb diet. The solution is to improve your bacterial balance in the body. It should be noted that if you take probiotics in quantities that are too great, or fermented foods without preparing for them, these can be the cause of microbial imbalance and can result in continuance of the white tongue. Therefore, start gradually.

## What Is The Worst Food For Heart Health

# What is the worst food for heart health?

Seed oils, such as vegetable oil, are industrial products processed multiple times and devoid of nutritional value. They are primarily composed of unstable polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), prone to oxidation and linked to numerous health risks. Consumption of seed oils contributes to inflammation, oxidative stress, lipid peroxidation, and increased risk of heart disease and metabolic syndrome. Common in processed foods and cooking oils, they should be replaced with stable fats like butter, olive oil, coconut oil, avocado oil, and lard to maintain a healthier omega-3 to omega-6 fatty acid balance.

## What Are The Main Benefits Of Exercise

# What are the main benefits of exercise?

Diet contributes to 85% of your progress with weight loss, and exercise contributes only 15%. But then, there are various benefits of exercise for your weight goal.

The first thing you should know is that all of the benefits of exercise are in recovery after the exercise. The problem is, many people don’t give their bodies enough time to recover. Then, they feel tired and fatigued, and don’t lose weight or gain any strength or stamina.

You must have good sleep and enough recovery time for your body to fully repair. Otherwise, you won’t lose weight and you won’t have any other benefits.

If you don’t feel good after a workout, you’re overtraining. This is not good for the heart. For hard-core workouts, you want to only do them every third day rather than every day. Between these workouts, you can do light exercises like long-distance walks and yoga.

The best formula for exercise is 1 minute of exercise and 5 minutes of rest. Repeat three times to get started, and then increase the number of repetitions. You always want short intervals of intense exercise and a long period of rest.

**Benefits**

- Increases oxygen

- Gives you energy

- Lowers stress

- Increases fitness

- Improves muscle tone

- Good for atrophy

- Increases muscle mass

- Improves blood sugars

- Enhances sleep

- Helps with joint stiffness

- Improves blood flow

- Increases flexibility

- Strengthens the heart

- Enhances cognitive function and mood

- Builds antioxidant reserves

**Exercise time**

The best time to work out is in the evening. When you work out in the evening, you recover much more quickly than if you work out in the morning. You also burn more fat.

Keep in mind that exercising in the evening will spike your cortisol a little bit, but it normalizes much faster. If you are an adrenal body type, you may benefit from walking in the morning. However, for those who are not, high-intensity interval training is ideal in the evening. If you work out twice a day, try doing your light workout in the morning and more intense exercises in the evening. You should see a big difference in your results and recovery when you work out in the evening.

**High intensity interval training (HIIT)**

High-intensity interval training is intermittent exercise. This can help stimulate growth hormone. Doing this high-intensity exercise intermittently is important because it won’t stimulate the opposing hormone: cortisol. It keeps the stress down while still stimulating growth hormone. The growth hormone is stimulated by the high intensity. Cortisol is stimulated by duration, which you’re keeping short.

**Long-distance walking**

Walking is a low-stress, higher-oxygen type of exercise (aerobic), and better for stress. If you have a history of being an athlete or doing a sport that involved lots of cardio, then your cells have developed a larger capacity to use energy and you will need to do regular exercise to release that energy.

**Tips for getting the most out of your workout**

• Get good sleep

• Don’t eat anything before, during or after your workout

• Avoid insulin-spiking foods

## How Often Should I Do Intermittent Fasting

# How often should I do Intermittent Fasting?

Intermittent fasting offers several schedules, each with its own benefits. The 16:8 method involves fasting for 16 hours and eating within an 8-hour window, typically with two meals. Alternatively, the 20:4 schedule extends the fasting period to 20 hours, followed by a 4-hour eating window, offering additional benefits for brain function, heart health, repair, and anti-aging. OMAD (One Meal A Day) condenses eating into a single daily meal, sometimes necessitating alternate-day OMAD for optimal results. While intermittent fasting, it's advisable to combine it with a healthy ketogenic diet. Try to start with three meals a day without snacking, gradually transition to fewer meals, and listen to your hunger cues so that you can adjust your intermittent fasting plan to best suit your needs.

## Can I Eat Apples During My Weight Loss Journey

# Can I eat apples during my weight loss journey?

I used to think apples were a great snack. I even used to recommend apples to help with weight loss, but I don’t anymore.  

Recently I looked up the nutritional profile of an apple, and this is what I found:

• Saturated fats — .1g

• Cholesterol — 0g 

• Carbohydrates — 25g

• Fiber — 44g

• Sugar — 19g

Apples have enough sugar to stop fat burning for at least one to two days. 

At least until you’re at your ideal weight, I don’t think consuming apples (or any fruit) is a good idea.

## What Is The Most Effective Remedy To Remove Blackheads

# What is the most effective remedy to remove blackheads?

A big mistake is doing things like over-cleansing the skin and using pore strips. These things actually make the problem worse by removing friendly bacteria that are there to help protect you against bad bacteria.

The root cause of blackheads is a spike in androgens caused by a spike in insulin and IGF-1.

**How to get rid of blackheads permanently:**

1\. Go on a low-carb diet (Healthy Keto)

2\. Cut out dairy from your diet

3\. Decrease omega-6 fatty acids and increase omega-3 fatty acids

4\. Take borage oil

## What Is The Gallbladder

# What is the gallbladder?

The gallbladder stores and concentrates bile. Bile is the fluid that dissolves dietary fat into small particles, lubricates the colon, and alkalizes the stomach acid. Your bile also kills bacteria in your food. The gallbladder is located below the right ribcage, just below the liver.

The pancreas releases its enzyme (lipase) to fully break down fat into the smallest elements (fatty acids).

Without enough bile, you can experience:

• Bloating

• Dry skin

• Constipation

• Floating stool

• Anal leakage

• Bad stool odors

• Pale-colored stool

• Digestive pain

• Poor mood

• Inflammation

• Poor heart health

## What Are Liposomal Vitamins And How Do They Differ From Regular Vitami C91D93

# What are liposomal vitamins, and how do they differ from regular vitamins in terms of absorption and effectiveness?

**Understanding Liposomal Vitamins**

Liposomal vitamins offer a unique delivery method. They use tiny spheres called liposomes, made of phospholipids, to encapsulate vitamins (or drugs). This protective layer helps the vitamins travel deeper into the body. The smaller the liposome, the higher the quality – so look for certified products.

**Pros and Cons**

Let's weigh the advantages and disadvantages of liposomal vitamins:

**Pros:**

- Significantly increased absorption (up to 4-9 times greater)

**Cons:**

- Much higher cost than traditional supplements

- Susceptible to breakdown by macrophages (immune cells)

- Often contain synthetic vitamins, sometimes from GMO sources

**Important Tip:** Always inquire about the source of the vitamins to ensure you're choosing natural options.

**Bottom Line:** Liposomal vitamins can be beneficial if you opt for a high-quality, certified product. However, be prepared for the significantly higher price tag compared to other forms of vitamins.

## Is Fat Absorption Possible Without Gallbladder

# Is fat absorption possible without gallbladder?

## **Fat Absorption Without a Gallbladder**

Without a gallbladder, only 50% of fats consumed are absorbed, leading to issues with cell membranes, hormone production, and deficiencies in vitamins A, D, E, and K. This can also cause inflammation.

**Importance of Fats**

Fats provide energy, support skin and hair health, brain function, hormone production, and absorption of essential vitamins.

**Hormone Production Impact**

Poor fat absorption without a gallbladder affects cholesterol levels, leading to hormonal imbalances and symptoms like mood swings and muscle weakness.

**Gastric Emptying and Digestion**

Slower gastric emptying without a gallbladder can cause nutrient absorption issues. Consuming healthy fats aids digestion.

**Tips for Healthy Fat Intake**

\- Opt for avocados, nuts, seeds, olive oil, and fatty fish.

\- Avoid trans fats and limit saturated fats.

\- Eat fiber-rich foods like vegetables and nuts for better digestion.

## What Are The Indicators Of Healthy Eggs

# What are the indicators of healthy eggs?

For optimal health benefits, focus on how hens are raised and fed rather than egg color.

Pasture-Raised Eggs: Hens are free to roam outdoors and forage, leading to eggs rich in vitamins D and E and omega-3 fatty acids.

Pasteurized Eggs: Hens are typically confined indoors with a grain-based diet, resulting in lower nutrient levels.

Organic Eggs: Hens are fed without synthetic pesticides or fertilizers and have outdoor access, ensuring fewer chemicals.

Vegetarian-Fed Eggs: Hens are fed a plant-based diet, but without the "organic" label, they may still consume GMO feed and miss out on the benefits of a varied diet.

## What Are Some Optimal Food Choices For Brain And Eye Health

# What are some optimal food choices for brain and eye health?

## **Navigating Dietary Choices for Optimal Brain and Eye Health**

Navigating dietary choices for optimal brain and eye health involves selecting foods rich in nutrients like omega-3 fatty acids, antioxidants, and vitamins crucial for cognitive function and vision.

By incorporating fatty fish, leafy greens, berries, and nuts into your diet, you can provide essential nutrients that support brain function and protect against age-related eye conditions.

Understanding the impact of dietary choices on brain and eye health can empower individuals to make informed decisions to maintain cognitive sharpness and visual acuity throughout life.

![Selection of ketogenic foods](https://drberg-dam.imgix.net/others/healthy-low-carbs-products-ketogenic-diet-0.jpg?w=992&auto=compress,format)

### **Incorporating Fish into Your Diet**

Diving into a diet abundant with these underwater wonders, like salmon and mackerel, elevates your brainpower and enhances your eyesight. 

Omega-3 fatty acids are essential for constructing brain cell barriers and play a pivotal part in maintaining the health of your retina.

But it's not just about throwing fish onto your plate willy-nilly. Variety is key. Mixing up your fish intake ensures you get both DHA and EPA types of omega-3s - essential for mental clarity and reducing inflammation that could cloud your vision.

To ensure you're hitting the mark with omega-3 intake without breaking the bank or getting bored at dinner time, consider adding flaxseeds or walnuts to salads for an extra crunch of these vital nutrients when seafood isn't on the menu.

### **Vegan Alternatives for Omega-3s**

If you’re navigating a plant-based path but still want those juicy cognitive benefits from omega-3s, don’t fret. Microalgae supplements are a fantastic vegan source of DHA. They directly provide what fish consume to become rich in these fatty acids.

For everyday eating, chia seeds, hemp seeds, and walnuts offer ALA (alpha-linolenic acid), which our bodies can convert into EPA and DHA, albeit less efficiently than consuming them directly from animal sources or algae-based supplements.

So sprinkle some on oatmeal or blend them into smoothies.

## What Are The Key Nutritional Benefits Of Fiber And How Does It Contrib 34566A

# What are the key nutritional benefits of fiber, and how does it contribute to overall health and digestive function?

When I’m talking about fiber, I’m talking about vegetable fiber, not grain fibers, like bran, for example. On the healthy keto diet, I believe it’s important that a person consumes a lot of vegetables as a part of the healthy keto lifestyle. But, there are times that a person wouldn’t want to consume large amounts of vegetables, for example, if they have SIBO.

**10 benefits of fiber:**

1\. It has zero effect on insulin

2\. It contains phytonutrients, vitamins, and minerals

3\. It binds to bile and helps regulate the amount of bile in the body

4\. It can help feed the microflora

5\. Small-chain fatty acids (blood sugar control and more)

6\. It may help regulate pH

7\. It may help regulate transit time

8\. It may help regulate lipids

9\. It may have anti-cancer effects

10\. It can help buffer the blood sugar response

## What Are The Potential Side Effects Of Gallbladder Removal

# What are the potential side effects of gallbladder removal?

**Some of the common symptoms associated with gallbladder removal include the following:**

• Constipation

• Diarrhea

• Anal leakage

• Fullness under the right rib cage

• Right shoulder pain

• Collins’ sign pain

You can live a long, healthy life without a gallbladder, but unfortunately, 40% of people who’ve had their gallbladder removed end up with persistent pain and symptoms for a year or more.

The gallbladder is an extension of the liver that holds and concentrates bile. Every time you eat, it contracts and releases bile into the small intestine. Bile begins to break down fat, allowing the pancreas to further break down fat by releasing an enzyme called lipase. Bile is critical for the absorption of fat-soluble vitamins A, E, D, and K, as well as essential fatty acids. Bile also helps you get rid of excess cholesterol.

## Which Method Of Vegetable Preparationraw Or Cookedprovides Superior He F677C5

# Which method of vegetable preparation—raw or cooked—provides superior health benefits and nutritional advantages?

Vegetables have numerous health benefits. They are packed with important vitamins and minerals and are high in fiber. Vegetables are also loaded with phytonutrients, which are hard to get from other types of foods. Phytonutrients have a range of incredible health benefits, from protecting against inflammation to fighting cancer.

Raw vegetables grown on soil even contain probiotics, which are friendly bacteria. Organic vegetables have a higher diversity of friendly microbes than non-organic vegetables. But keep in mind that the more you cook a vegetable, the more you’ll lessen the probiotic effects.

It’s important to note that not everyone can tolerate high amounts of vegetables. If you are immune compromised or have any inflammatory condition in the gut, you may have difficulty consuming vegetables. If you consume raw vegetables and you feel worse, you may do better on the carnivore diet for a while. However, you could also try fermented vegetables or cooked vegetables.

However, if you lightly steam or sauté your vegetables, you won’t lose minerals or as many vitamins. Steaming or sautéing vegetables may actually enhance the phytonutrients—but the data on this is inconsistent.

**As far as raw vegetables vs. cooked vegetables, I believe it’s best to consume a good portion of your vegetables raw. But, certain vegetables should be cooked, like Brussels sprouts, broccoli, and cauliflower. The worst thing you can do as far as preserving the nutrient content in your vegetables is to fry them. You can still consume fried vegetables but don’t think you’re getting a lot of nutrients from them.**

## Is Mct Oil Good Or Bad For The Liver

# Is MCT Oil good or bad for the liver?

Omega-3 fatty acids are very good for a fatty liver. This includes fish oil and cod liver oil. MCT oils, which are medium-chain triglycerides, are a unique type of fat that can be very good for your liver.

**MCT fats are “burned” or oxidized into energy very quickly. Unlike other oils, MCT oil is water-soluble. Why is this significant? It doesn’t depend on bile or enzymes—you don’t have to break down MCT oil at all.**

MCT oil bypasses your digestive system and is absorbed directly into the body.

**MCT oil is great for:**

• Malabsorption

• Epilepsy

• Supporting a healthy heart

• Those with no gallbladder

Keep in mind that MCT oil doesn’t contain vitamins, minerals, and omega-3 fatty acids—so you’ll still need to get these in your diet when using MCTs.

## What Are The Key Benefits Of Fish Oil For Heart Health And How Do Its  4E5E9B

# What are the key benefits of fish oil for heart health, and how do its omega-3s support heart function, reduce inflammation, and prevent disease?

**Health benefits of fish oil (omega-3 fatty acids):**

• They are antiarrhythmic

• They are anti-inflammatory

• They trigger genes that can help turn off the fibrosis effect of the heart

• They are antithrombotic

• They support the endothelial layer in the arteries

• They can help make your cell membranes more fluid and less rigid

Omega-6 fatty acids are common in oils like vegetable oils and seed oils. These oils invade cell membranes and make them more rigid. It’s crucial to have the correct ratio of omega-3 fatty acids to omega-6 fatty acids, which should be 1:1. The average person in the US has a 15:1 ratio of omega-6 fatty acids to omega-3 fatty acids. Omega-6 fatty acids not only increase the risk of heart problems but many other health issues. Omega-6 fatty acids also compete with omega-3 fatty acids. So keep in mind that the more omega-6 fatty acids you have in your diet, the less of an effect you will have from omega-3 fatty acids.

## What Are The Health Effects Of Degraded Omega 3 Fatty Acids And How Ca Ca5Da4

# What are the health effects of degraded omega-3 fatty acids, and how can their degradation impact overall well-being?

Omega-3 fatty acids are essential for maintaining optimal health, supporting brain function, and reducing inflammation. However, omega-3s in oils like canola can degrade when exposed to high heat during processing, reducing their benefits.

**Key Health Impacts**

\- Inflammation: Degraded omega-3s disrupt the balance with omega-6 fatty acids, promoting inflammation. This can worsen conditions like arthritis and inflammatory bowel disease.

\- Oxidative Stress: Degraded omega-3s can lead to oxidative stress, increasing the risk of chronic diseases such as cardiovascular issues and type 2 diabetes.

\- Cognitive Function: Omega-3s are crucial for brain health. When degraded, they may not provide the same mental benefits, potentially increasing the risk of neurological issues.

**Alternative Oil Choices**

To minimize the risk of consuming degraded omega-3s, consider using oils like olive oil or coconut oil, which are less likely to degrade under high heat and do not contain trans fats.

**Concerns About Canola Oil**

While the European Union's food safety authority considers canola oil safe, concerns remain about its high erucic acid content, especially in genetically modified crops designed to reduce this acid. This has raised concerns among European consumers and farmers.

For healthier alternatives, consider using avocado oil and sunflower oil, which provide similar benefits without the risks associated with canola oil.

## Is Ashwagandha The Same As American Ginseng Or Are There Distinct Diff 951334

# Is ashwagandha the same as American ginseng, or are there distinct differences between these two herbal supplements in terms of their properties and uses?

**It's not the same. But it's, they both are adaptogens, and what those adaptogens do is they help strengthen the part of the autonomic nervous system, whether it's one side or the other, dominant.**

**So they just strengthen the autonomic nervous system, allowing you to cope with stress a lot more. And I did release a video relating to this, it's called Heart Rate Variability Technology, HRV, and so there is a device that you can get to measure both the sympathetic and parasympathetic.**

But there's a, it's a fascinating tool to be able to identify, first of all, your stress dates, and then also try out different adaptogens to see what creates the most change on your autonomic nervous system. You can go by symptoms, but it's nice to kind of see objectively what's happening with your parasympathetics, in relationship to stress and exercise.

You have to really be creative and kind of think of all sorts of things. But as a side note, the hormone that seems to be one of the best things to reduce cortisol is oxytocin. And oxytocin can be stimulated by bonding your baby, or an animal, or taking care of animals, or donating.

## What Are The Potential Health Risks Associated With Low Cholesterol Le 9D3F0E

# What are the potential health risks associated with low cholesterol levels, and how can they affect overall well-being?

Cholesterol is often misunderstood as solely harmful, but it serves crucial roles in the body:

1\. **Recycling**: About 90% of cholesterol in the body is recycled, highlighting its essential nature.

2\. **Hormone Precursor**: It is a precursor for sex hormones like testosterone and estrogen, vital for hormonal balance.

3\. **Protective Role**: Cholesterol acts as a repair substance for damaged arterial walls, crucial in response to inflammation.

4\. **Daily Production**: The body produces approximately 2000 mg of cholesterol daily, underscoring its physiological necessity.

5\. **Metabolic Link to Sugar**: Excess sugar can convert to cholesterol and contribute to inflammation, emphasizing dietary impacts.

6\. **Role of Bile**: Bile aids in cholesterol breakdown, illustrating its regulated metabolic processing.

## What Strategies Can Be Employed To Mitigate Or Reverse The Health Effe 28591A

# What strategies can be employed to mitigate or reverse the health effects associated with long-term consumption of seed oils?

To reverse damage from consuming seed oils over a lifetime, transitioning to omega-3 fatty acids is crucial. This switch supports the body in gradually replacing harmful seed oils with healthier alternatives. Although it may take time—potentially a couple of years—this dietary shift can significantly improve overall health and well-being, despite other contributing factors.

## What Are The Health Benefits Of Dietary Fiber

# What are the health benefits of dietary fiber?

Fiber is a carbohydrate, but it has no effect on blood sugar or insulin. It is low on the glycemic index. It feeds the microbes, the bacteria in the gut, and the microbes give back butyrate (or butyric acid) that then feeds the colon cells energy. Butyrate also helps with blood sugars and can help lower insulin indirectly.

The problem with fiber is that it can cause fluid retention. Certain fibers tend to gel and expand in your gut. It can actually feel like your belly is swelling, as if you’ve gained fat, but actually it is just water weight.

**Benefits**

1. Zero effect on insulin

2. Contains phytonutrients (healthy substances found in plants), vitamins and minerals

3. Binds to bile and helps regulate the amount of bile in the body

4. Can help feed the microflora

5. Contains small-chain fatty acids

6. May help regulate pH

7. May help regulate lipids

8. May have anticancer effects

9. Can help buffer the blood sugar response to a meal

**When not to consume fiber**

## What Are The Heart Healthy Fats Found In Olives And How Do They Contri 762B87

# What are the heart-healthy fats found in olives, and how do they contribute to cardiovascular health?

Olives are rich in healthy monounsaturated fats (MUFAs), especially oleic acid, which provides numerous health benefits, particularly for the heart.

**Oleic Acid and Anti-Inflammatory Properties**

Oleic acid, an omega-9 fatty acid, has potent anti-inflammatory effects. It helps combat chronic inflammation, which is linked to diseases like heart disease, diabetes, and cancer. Research shows oleic acid can suppress cancer-related genes and enhance the effectiveness of certain cancer treatments.

**Monounsaturated Fats for Heart Health**

MUFAs in olives help improve cholesterol levels by lowering LDL (bad) cholesterol and increasing HDL (good) cholesterol, reducing heart disease risk. A study in the European Journal of Clinical Nutrition found that a diet rich in MUFAs from olive oil significantly reduced heart disease risk.

**Low-Carb Benefits**

Olives are low in carbohydrates, making them an excellent snack for low-carb or ketogenic diets.

Incorporating olives into your diet supports heart health, reduces inflammation, and fits well with low-carb eating plans.

## What Are The Primary Causes And Risk Factors Associated With Diverticu B92C6B

# What are the primary causes and risk factors associated with diverticulitis, and how do dietary and lifestyle choices contribute to its development?

Diverticulitis is an inflammation of the little pouches (diverticula) in your colon. It can create a lot of abdominal pain and discomfort in the body.

**Cause #1: Consuming foods that are inflammatory**

If you consume a lot of refined carbs and GMO foods, as well as oils containing omega-6 fatty acids, these things can cause a lot of problems throughout the body--including the inside of your colon. This is because these types of foods create inflammation. Snacking often and consuming a lot of carbs in general will increase the quantity of insulin, an inflammatory hormone, in your blood.

## How Can Glycine Benefit Older Individuals And What Are Its Potential R 12221F

# How can glycine benefit older individuals, and what are its potential roles in supporting health and well-being as people age?

As we age, our bodies experience changes that impact health and well-being, such as joint aches, wrinkles, and muscle loss. These issues are often linked to declining collagen levels. Glycine, a key building block for collagen, can support healthy aging by mitigating some of these effects.

**Supporting Joint Health**

Age-related joint pain and stiffness are often due to the breakdown of cartilage and connective tissues. Glycine supports collagen production, essential for maintaining healthy joints. Studies suggest glycine supplementation can benefit individuals with osteoarthritis by promoting cartilage repair and regeneration, potentially reducing pain and improving mobility.

**Enhancing Sleep Quality**

Older adults frequently face sleep issues, including difficulty falling asleep and achieving restorative sleep. Glycine has been shown to improve sleep quality by promoting deeper, more restful sleep. For older individuals struggling with insomnia, glycine supplementation may enhance sleep quality and duration, supporting overall health and well-being.

## Can I Cook With Seed Oils Or Vegetable Oil

# Can I cook with seed oils or vegetable oil?

Vegetable oils do not come from vegetables. Vegetable seed oils are highly processed oils that are processed with high heat and chemical solvents. When heat is added to refined oils, toxic byproducts like trans fats are created. Seed oils are genetically modified, so they often contain traces of glyphosate. BHA is a toxic byproduct found in seed oils and is classified as a possible human carcinogen. Other toxic byproducts can affect the immune system, nervous system, and liver.

All chronic diseases involve inflammation. Vegetable oils are the most inflammatory thing that you can consume. They create damage at the cellular level and are often stored in the fat cells because they can’t be used for fuel. It takes a year and a half to detoxify seed oils from the membranes in our bodies.

Soy, corn, sunflower, canola, and cottonseed are the most common seed oils. Cottonseed oil is the worst seed oil as it produces the most toxicity and has the most omega-6 fatty acids. Cottonseed oil is highly inflammatory and is often hidden in animal feed. Any time you have inflammation, you also have a lack of oxygen. Cancer thrives in an area that’s inflamed or doesn’t have oxygen. Inflammation from seed oils can also contribute to insulin resistance.

Do not use vegetable oils at all! Replace seed oils with the following healthy cooking oils:

•Extra virgin olive oil

•Coconut oil

•Butter

•Ghee

•Red palm oil

•Tallow

•Lard

Mayo contains seed oils, so look for one without, like Chosen Mayo, which is made with avocado oil. It's best to avoid deep-fried foods. An air fryer can simulate fried foods, and crushed pork rinds rather than wheat products can be used as breading.

## Fatty Acid Deficiency   Despite Taking Essential Fatty Acids   Efa

# Fatty Acid Deficiency - Despite Taking Essential Fatty Acids - EFA?

I heard from someone who had symptoms of an essential fatty acid deficiency, even though they were taking essential fatty acids (EFA). EFAs are omega 3 and omega 6. Here are the symptoms of a deficiency:

● Small red bumps on the back of your arms

● Dry, scaly skin

● Hair loss

● Loss of pigment in your hair

● Heart issues

● Vision problems

● Mood issues

● Problems with cognitive function

If you’re taking essential fatty acids and not seeing a change in your body, then you know you’re not absorbing them. Here are the potential reasons why:

● Pancreatic insufficiency

● Insufficient stomach acid

● Intestinal issues like irritable bowel syndrome or Crohn’s

● Gallbladder problems such as lack of gallbladder, or one that’s congested

● Liver issues such as fatty liver, hepatitis, or cirrhosis

The last two on this list are the most common reasons why someone isn’t properly absorbing essential fatty acids. If you have a big belly, chances are you have a fatty liver. An ultrasound can confirm. This results from insulin resistance, which itself is caused by consuming things like alcohol and refined sugars, and eating far too often. As well, if you have a fatty liver then chances are you have a congested gallbladder.

These are good sources of essential fatty acids:

● Eggs

● Fish

● Fish oil

● Olives and olive oil

● Vegetables

● Nuts

● Seeds

● Grass-fed animal products such as meat and cheese

I hope this answered the question about how you can develop an essential fatty acid deficiency!

## The Best Types Of Exercises For Recovery

# The Best Types of Exercises for Recovery

There are three main types of muscle contractions:

- **Isometric:** The muscle contracts, but its length stays the same (like holding a plank).

- **Concentric:** The muscle shortens while contracting (like the upward phase of a bicep curl).

- **Eccentric:** The muscle lengthens while contracting (like the downward phase of a bicep curl).

**Why Eccentric Training Matters**

Eccentric contractions offer unique benefits compared to concentric movements:

- **Muscle Growth:** Eccentric training may lead to increased muscle size and strength.

- **Force Production:** You can generate greater force during eccentric movements.

- **Efficient Repair:** Eccentric focus promotes healthy muscle repair and recovery.

- **Metabolic Advantages:** Eccentric training may be more efficient for boosting metabolism and reducing inflammation.

- **Specific Conditions:** Eccentric exercises might benefit people with muscle loss (sarcopenia), reduced bone density (osteopenia), or tendon injuries.

## Can Intermittent Fasting Help With Psoriasis

# Can intermittent fasting help with psoriasis?

Yes, intermittent fasting can help with psoriasis. Here are some key points from Dr. Berg's recommendations:

- **Reducing Inflammation**: Intermittent fasting has been shown to reduce inflammation in the body, which is a key factor in many chronic diseases, including psoriasis. By giving your digestive system a break and allowing your body to focus on repair and regeneration, you can help calm the inflammatory response and promote overall healing.

- **Cell Regeneration**: During fasting periods, the body undergoes a process of cell regeneration, which can help strengthen the immune response. This process is beneficial for skin health as it helps remove damaged cells and promotes the growth of new, healthier cells.

- **Hormonal Balance**: Intermittent fasting can help regulate insulin levels and increase growth hormone levels. This hormonal change triggers autophagy, a cellular cleanup operation that eliminates accumulated cell debris, which could otherwise trigger skin issues like psoriasis.

- **Immune System Enhancement**: Fasting has been shown to enhance immune function by stimulating the production of white blood cells and antibodies, helping your body fight off infections and diseases more effectively. A stronger immune system can better manage autoimmune conditions like psoriasis.

By incorporating intermittent fasting into your routine, you may experience improvements in psoriasis symptoms due to reduced inflammation, enhanced cell regeneration, and a stronger immune system. Always consult with your healthcare provider before making significant changes to your diet or fasting regimen.

## Does My Diet Affect My Knee Pain And Arthritis

# Does my diet affect my knee pain and arthritis?

The foods you eat can have a significant impact on knee pain and arthritis. It all comes down to the balance between omega-6 and omega-3 fatty acids in your diet.

[Omega-6 fatty acids](https://www.drberg.com/blog/omega-6-fats-and-inflammation) are found in many common foods, such as vegetable oils and processed snacks. While some omega-6 is necessary for health, consuming too much can contribute to inflammation in the body, which can worsen [knee pain](https://www.drberg.com/blog/knee-pain-relief) and arthritis symptoms.

### **The Impact of Omega-6 Fatty Acids on Inflammation**

Omega-6 fatty acids are a type of polyunsaturated fat that is essential for various bodily functions. However, when consumed in excess, they can promote inflammation.

In fact, research has shown that a diet high in omega-6 fatty acids can increase the production of pro-inflammatory compounds in the body, such as prostaglandins and leukotrienes.

These compounds can contribute to joint pain, stiffness, and swelling in people with knee arthritis. Some common sources of omega-6 fatty acids include:

- Soybean oil

- Corn oil

- Sunflower oil

- Safflower oil

- Processed snacks and baked goods

- Fried foods

## How To Choose Correct Fats To Add My Salads

# How to choose correct fats to add my salads?

Now that you know why fat is essential for nutrient absorption, let's talk about choosing the right types of fat for your salad. Not all fats are created equal when it comes to health benefits.

### **Healthy Fats vs. Low-Fat Dressings**

You might think light or fat-free salad dressings are always better, but scientific research reveals they can block vegetable nutrient absorption.

A [study from Purdue University](https://www.purdue.edu/newsroom/research/2012/120619FerruzziSalad.html) found that people who ate salads with fat-free dressing absorbed far less carotenoids and other fat-soluble nutrients than those who used regular salad dressing containing fat.

### **The Best Oils for Salad Dressings**

So, what are the best oils to use in your salad dressing? Experts recommend choosing oils that are high in healthy monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fats, such as:

- [Olive oil](https://www.drberg.com/blog/can-olive-oil-be-the-next-ibuprofen)

- [Avocado oil](https://www.drberg.com/blog/7-benefits-of-avocado-oil)

- Walnut oil

- Flaxseed oil

Good oils do more than aid in nutrient absorption—they're also vital for heart health. Take olive oil, a favorite in [the Mediterranean diet](https://www.drberg.com/blog/why-the-mediterranean-diet-has-not-worked-for-you), which significantly reduces the risk of chronic diseases such as hypertension.

Incorporating healthy fats into your diet, especially in marine fish, can offer extensive nutritional benefits and support overall well-being. These beneficial oils contribute to a proper diet and enhance the flavors of various dishes, making them an essential component of cooking and healthy living.

Focusing on these nutritious fats can help protect your heart and improve your dietary habits for better health outcomes.

On the other hand, it's best to limit saturated fats like butter and [coconut oil](https://www.drberg.com/blog/coconut-oil-benefits), as well as highly processed vegetable oils like soybean and canola oil. When consumed in excess, these fats can contribute to inflammation and other health issues.

## Has Canola Oil Been Banned In Europe

# Has canola oil been banned in Europe?

**Concerns Over Canola Oil in the European Union**

**Erucic Acid in Canola Oil:**

\- **Health Risks:** Erucic acid, a monounsaturated fatty acid found in rapeseed oil (from which canola oil is derived), is linked to serious health concerns. High consumption may cause cardiac lipidosis, a condition where fat accumulates on the heart muscle, impairing cardiac function. It is also associated with an increased risk of insulin resistance, which can lead to type 2 diabetes.

\- **EU Scrutiny:** Due to these risks, some European nations consider canola oil potentially hazardous. To mitigate these concerns, genetically modified canola plants have been developed to lower erucic acid levels.

**Healthier Alternatives:**

\- **Olive and Coconut Oils:** These oils offer nutritional benefits and are often considered healthier alternatives to traditional cooking oils like rapeseed or sunflower oil.

## Link Between Diet And Neurological Disorders

# Link Between Diet and Neurological Disorders

## **Link Between Diet and Neurological Disorders**

Diet can have a profound impact on neurological health. Diet has a noticeable impact on neurological conditions, particularly [Alzheimer's](https://www.drberg.com/blog/alzheimers-simplified) and [dementia](https://www.drberg.com/blog/the-6-warning-signs-of-dementia).

### **Alzheimer's Disease, Insulin Resistance, and Glucose Starvation**

The brain relies heavily on glucose for energy. However, when insulin resistance occurs due to poor dietary choices like consuming excessive sugar or refined carbs, it can lead to what we call 'glucose starvation' in the nerves.

This starvation scenario, where neurons are deprived of essential fuel, has been linked directly with Alzheimer's disease. So you see how your dinner plate might be affecting your cognitive health.

### **The Connection Between Gluten and Dementia**

Gluten isn't just about avoiding bread for those wanting to lose weight. It may seem harmless, but gluten sensitivity could potentially trigger gut problems that affect more than just digestion.

Studies suggest a correlation between these gluten-triggered gut issues and an increased risk of dementia - surprising, right? While research is ongoing, reducing gluten intake seems sensible for your belly and possibly for protecting against neurodegenerative disorders such as dementia.

## **Wild-Caught Salmon: A Superfood for the Brain**

For optimal brain health, wild-caught salmon should be the food of choice. But why is it considered so beneficial?

![Wild pacific salmon](https://drberg-dam.imgix.net/others/atlantic-salmon.jpg?w=992&auto=compress,format)

### **Nutrient Profile of Wild-Caught Salmon**

The secret lies in its rich nutrient profile. Packed with Omega-3 fatty acids, including DHA and EPA, salmon provides essential building blocks for neurotransmitters - those vital messengers in our brain.

These Omega-3s improve memory, learning capacity, and mood and help lower inflammation and insulin resistance, which are detrimental to our cognitive functions.

## Is It Possible To Consume An Excessive Amount Of Omega 3 Fatty Acids

# Is it possible to consume an excessive amount of omega-3 fatty acids?

Achieving a balanced intake of omega-6 and omega-3 fatty acids is essential for optimal health. While both are necessary, modern diets often emphasize omega-6 sources, which can contribute to inflammation if consumed excessively. Omega-3 fatty acids, found in foods like fish and flaxseed, help counteract inflammation and promote overall well-being. It's crucial to reduce intake of processed omega-6 oils and prioritize natural sources of omega-3 to maintain a healthy fatty acid balance.

## Is There A Common Keto Ingredient That Stops Keto

# Is there a common Keto ingredient that stops Keto?

Keto is a low-carb diet. Most people know that, on keto, they need to cut out sugar and grains. But, it’s also important to cut out grain oils, or more specifically, seed oils. Many people call grain oils vegetable oils, but they’re really not vegetable oils. They don’t get the oil from vegetables—they get it from the seed of the plant. The problem with grain oil is omega-6 fats. Omega-6 fats are highly inflammatory. They can actually trigger insulin resistance just as much as sugar or refined grains. Grain oils can also get stuck in the body and clog up the liver and brain. Not to mention that many grain oils are GMO.

**Oils and foods higher in omega-6 fats:**

• Soy

• Cottonseed

• Canola

• Corn

• Safflower

• Sunflower

• Almond flour

• Peanut butter

I’m not saying you can’t have some things higher in omega-6 fats like almond flour and peanut butter, but you might want to balance it out by getting omega-3 fats. An average person in America has 15 times more omega-6 than omega-3.

**Top sources (some are keto, some are not)**

1\. Chicken

2\. Grain desserts

3\. Salad dressing

4\. Chips

5\. Nuts/seeds

6\. Pizza

7\. Bread

8\. Fries

9\. Pasta

**The definition of keto is low-carb, and it doesn’t really emphasize the type of fat you should be consuming. I believe healthy keto is the best way to go.**

**Healthier oils:**

• Coconut oil

• Butter

• Olive oil

• Avocado oil

If you’re plateauing on keto, you may be consuming too many grain oils, or you could be using too much almond flour or peanut butter.

**Foods high in omega-3 fatty acids:**

• Fish

• Cod liver oil

• Grass-fed beef and other animal products

• Walnuts

• Chia seed

• Brussels sprouts

**Do not use:**

**• Soy oil**

**• Cottonseed oil**

**• Canola oil**

**• Corn oil**

**Limit:**

• Safflower oil

• Sunflower oil

**Reduce these if you have a problem with inflammation or you’ve hit a plateau:**

• Almond flour

• Peanut butter

## What Foods Can Make You Live Longer

# What foods can make you live longer?

Certain foods rich in specific molecules can potentially enhance longevity by supporting mitochondrial function and reducing oxidative stress:

1\. **PQQ**: Found in cacao, boosts mitochondrial count and supports energy production.

2\. **Polyphenols**: Found in berries, grass-fed meats, and cheese, enhance mitochondrial function and reduce inflammation.

3\. **Coenzyme Q10**: Found in liver, red meat, and fatty fish, essential for mitochondrial energy production and acts as an antioxidant.

4\. **L-carnitine and carnosine**: Found in red meat, support fat burning, muscle preservation, and reduce oxidative stress.

5\. **Phycocyanin**: Found in spirulina, supports mitochondrial biogenesis and has antioxidant properties.

6\. **EPA and DHA**: Found in salmon, sardines, and cod liver oil, improve mitochondrial function, reduce oxidative stress, and have anti-inflammatory effects.

Incorporating these foods into your diet may increase mitochondrial health, improve energy production, reduce inflammation, and potentially slow down aging processes.

## What Should Be Avoided If I Have An Enlarged Prostate

# What should be avoided if I have an enlarged prostate?

If you have an enlarged prostate, it's advisable to avoid certain foods:

1\. **Dairy:** Dairy products like cheese, milk, yogurt, and butter can exacerbate prostate swelling due to their hormone content, particularly growth hormones.

2\. **Vegetable Oils:** Omega-6 rich oils found in salad dressings, such as corn, canola, and soy oil, are inflammatory. Opt for olive oil instead.

3\. **Sugar and Grains:** Sugars and foods that convert to sugar, like grains, bread, and pasta, should be limited to manage inflammation and hormone balance.

4\. **Soy:** Avoid soy products due to their estrogenic properties, which can impact prostate health negatively.

These dietary adjustments can help alleviate symptoms associated with an enlarged prostate.

## What Are The Effects Of Omega 6 Fatty Acids On Liver Health

# What are the effects of Omega-6 fatty acids on liver health?

If you consume oils containing omega-6 fatty acids, they can create a lot of inflammation because these fats are highly inflammatory in your body. Avoiding these, while treating the liver, should help. You should avoid the foods containing these fats and substitute with foods high in omega-3 fats (anti-inflammatory).

**Remedies:**

- Avoid the following (contain omega-6)

- poultry

- nuts

- grains

- pumpkin seeds

- flax oil

- sunflower oil

- cottonseed oil

- safflower oil

- vegetable oil

- canola oil

- corn oil

- grain-fed dairy

- GMO oils

• Substitute with the following (contain omega-3):

- high-quality fish oil

- virgin cod liver oil

- sardines

- fish

- anchovies

- eggs

- grass-fed products

## What Sardines Can I Eat On Keto

# What sardines can I eat on keto?

Always check the package to make sure that your sardines are in olive oil or water. Soybean oil is full of omega-6 fatty acids. This can nullify the benefits of the omega-3 fatty acids naturally found in sardines.

Soybean oil is the most used oil in America today. It’s also the second most used oil in the world.

Soybean oil is used in everything from fast food to animal feed to canned foods.

Research shows that soy oil can induce obesity and diabetes more than fructose. Soybean oil can also contribute to insulin resistance and fatty liver disease.

Soybean oil affects the hypothalamus, reduces oxytocin and influences over 100 genes in the brain.

Because soybean oil is so heavily processed, it acts as a powerful oxidizer, it is estrogenic, and it can induce inflammation–especially in your arteries.

If all of that isn’t bad enough, soybeans are also GMOs. This means they are exposed to the chemical glyphosate.

In summary, make sure that your sardines do not contain soybean oil. Instead, choose sardines in water or olive oil.

## Can I Consume Coconut Oil On Keto

# Can I consume coconut oil on keto?

Some people are a little nervous about consuming coconut oil, based on false information. By the way, it’s not bad for your heart, nor is it a poison. It’s been used for hundreds of years by many cultures without problems. In fact, there are some cultures whose diet is 60 percent coconut-based, who are quite healthy. Coconut oil will boost HDL, the so-called good cholesterol.

The coconut is the largest seed on earth. It takes 3 years to break the soil it is in, so that the seed can actually grow.

The three significant benefits of coconut oil are:

- Supports your brain. A significant part of coconut oil is what’s called MCTs, or medium chain triglycerides – a type of fat that turns into ketones. Your brain cells love ketones. Ketones protect the nerves and brain cells against stress. They’ve been shown to boost cognitive function and to help people with dementia as well as Alzheimer’s.

- It’s antibacterial and antimicrobial. Its 3 main fatty acids are caprylic, capril and lauric, and they’re responsible for these properties, along with being antifungal, anti-candida, anti- yeast and antiviral. Monolaural, the precursor to lauric acid, has the capacity to dismantle the fatty layer around certain viruses. So it’s beneficial for your immune system.

- Provides you with more energy, because MCT oil doesn’t require digestive enzymes. It gets absorbed directly into your body. You get fatty acids and ketones for fuel, which are much more efficient than glucose. You’ll get more of what’s called ATP, the body’s energy currency, than you do from carbs.

## Whats The Difference Between Fasting And Starvation

# What's the difference between fasting and starvation?

Fasting is when you deplete the glycogen reserves (stored sugar in the liver and the muscles) and fat for energy. Starvation differs because it means you have already depleted your glycogen and fat reserves, and the body is now breaking down muscles and organs are breaking down for fuel.

Fasting is healthy because it helps your body repair damaged cells while purging necessary fat and glycogen reserves. Starvation is extremely damaging and causes long-term health problems and even death if left unaddressed.

## What Are The Benefits Of Intermittent Fasting For Healthy Skin

# What are the benefits of intermittent fasting for healthy skin?

Intermittent fasting has many great benefits for the skin. For instance, it can delay vascular cell deterioration while preventing oxidative stress. It can also stimulate autophagy (cell repair) and boost stem cell production. It also lowers inflammation because glycogen in the skin is reduced. Anti-aging effects can be seen in the skin through fasting as well, because more elastin is produced by the body.

## Keto Low Carb Blueberry Mini Bites

# Keto Low Carb Blueberry Mini Bites

If you're on a low-carb diet weight loss journey, this is a fantastic keto-friendly low-carb recipe for muffin bites that you can have as a healthy treat when you really need one.

Right now, there is a craze called mug cakes. It's a really cool concept that you have a small number of ingredients that you mix in mug and pop in the microwave to have as a single serving cake. This is a cool theory, but it relies on a microwave, which we don't feel good about using. 

These recipes turn out way better in the oven over the microwave anyway. We also realized that having a mug full of cake was just too much. So, we made these muffin bites that are perfectly proportioned, they don't have regular sugar or flour, and they're delicious! 

Have these delicious muffin bites with a meal.  Low Carb Blueberry Muffin Bites  

**Makes 8 bites. Ingredients:**

1 tbl coconut flour

2 tbl almond flour

2 tbl granulated sugar of choice

½ tsp baking powder (aluminum free, always!)

1 large organic egg

1tbl melted organic butter or Ghee

1tbl unsweetened almond milk

3 tbl frozen blueberries

**Directions:**

Grease a mini muffin pan or use cups.

Mix all dry ingredients. Separately, mix all wet ingredients.

Blend wet into dry and mix well with wooden spoon until most lumps are gone.

This recipe tends to produce a VERY runny batter. No worries. Pour into cups or wells until about half full, or distribute evenly until all batter has been used.

Bake at 350 for about 12 minutes or until toothpick comes out clean.

Gently remove from pan and cool on rack. Enjoy!

## Are Seed Oils Worse Than Sugar

# Are seed oils worse than sugar?

On average, we’re consuming way too many foods high in omega-6 fats. Ideally, a person should consume a 1:1 ratio of omega-3 fatty acids to omega-6 fatty acids. However, the average ratio is 15:1. This imbalance can lead to all kinds of health problems, especially in the cell membranes.

Refined sugar also leads to health issues and is converted to fat, but the extra sugar doesn’t accumulate in the body like omega-6 fatty acids do.

Omega-6 fatty acids (seed oils) lodge into your cells and accumulate in your tissues for 600 days. They are not water-soluble like sugar is and can't be burned off like sugar can.

Both refined oils and refined sugar can deplete important nutrients. While certain whole foods, like fruit, have sugar, they also have nutrients and phytonutrients to help replenish what was lost and provide protection. But seed oils are a highly refined, over-processed part of a seed that doesn’t have any protective factors.

To make seed oils they also use a solvent called hexane to extract the oil from the seed—is it possible some of this solvent could end up in the oil?

Overall, while sugar isn't good for you, omega-6 fatty acids are worse for your health than sugar is.

## Is Quinoa Considered A Carb

# Is quinoa considered a carb?

Yes, it's a grain. We want to stay away from grains. It's not just about the carbs and grains. It's also about the phytic acid and other things that prevent nutrient absorption, and then the high omega-6 fats versus very low omega-3 fats.

## Chocolate Chia Pudding Recipe

# Chocolate Chia Pudding Recipe

This is another great recipe made with chia seeds. Chia seeds are very nutritious, and it's always great to find new delicious ways to include them in your diet. They are packed with omega 6 and omega 3 fatty acids. These fatty acids are especially good for dry skin.

We like this homemade chocolate chia pudding with a lot of chocolate. You can play around with the amount of cocoa powder you put in it to make it more or less "chocolatey." This is a fantastic, easy, and healthy chocolate pudding. Give it a try!

Remember, if you're on the healthy keto diet, this is a perfect little keto dessert—not a snack. 

Chocolate Chia Pudding Recipe: 

**Ingredients:**

30oz almond/coconut milk (or your favorite)

1 tbsp cocoa powder (less if you like milkier chocolate)

½ cup chia seed (or more for thicker texture)

¼ tsp chocolate stevia (The more cocoa you use, the more stevia you'll need.)

1 quart mason jar

**Directions:**

Pour milk into the mason jar, leaving about an inch of room at the top.

Add cocoa powder and stevia. 

Put on top and shake vigorously to mix the cocoa.

Add chia seed and immediately put on top and shake. 

Leave on its side on counter or in fridge for about 10 minutes, and shake again. 

Any cocoa clumps will be breaking down and you need to mix the chia with a good shake.

Then put in fridge for a few hours to thicken.  Enjoy!

## Can I Consume Green Apples On Keto

# Can I consume green apples on keto?

No. If you look up the nutritional profile of an apple, this is what you’ll find:

- Saturated fats – .1 g

- Cholesterol – 0 g

- Carbohydrates – 25 g

- Fiber – 44 g

- Sugar – 19 g

Apples have enough sugar to stop fat burning for at least one to two days. At least until you’re at your ideal weight, consuming apples (or any fruit) is probably not a good idea.

What should you snack on? You actually shouldn’t snack at all. Any time you eat, especially sugar, you spike insulin. In the presence of insulin, you can’t burn fat. It’s good to keep insulin very low. If you can’t go without snacking, you need to increase the amount of fat you consume in your meal. Fat helps keep you satisfied and helps keep insulin low.

## Can Keto Cause Diarrhea

# Can Keto cause diarrhea?

Diarrhea on a ketogenic diet can occur for several reasons. One common cause is that your body may not be accustomed to digesting the higher levels of saturated fat required on keto. To address this, consider reducing your intake of oils such as MCT oil, butter, and coconut oil to see if symptoms improve.

Additionally, excessive consumption of certain vegetables can overwhelm gut microbes. It's advisable to stick to more easily digestible options like lettuce, cucumber, tomato, and bell pepper, gradually reintroducing other vegetables as your gut adapts. Incorporating fermented vegetables can also support gut health.

With time and appropriate dietary adjustments, diarrhea should subside as your body adapts to the ketogenic diet.

## How To Avoid Excessive Bloating On Intermittent Fasting

# How to avoid excessive bloating on intermittent fasting?

When reducing meal frequency, increasing portion size can lead to bloating and stress the digestive system. Strategies to overcome this include separating macro-calories, stretching out meals over two hours, and avoiding combining too many food types. Additionally, issues like low stomach acid, certain bloat-inducing vegetables, food allergies like dairy, and fat intake are important to manage, as they can affect digestion and hunger levels differently for each person.

Adjustments should be made based on your individual needs and reactions, but after the body adjusts to a fast, bloating becomes very unlikely as the digestive system will be running smoother than ever.

## How Does Intermittent Fasting Affect The Gut Flora

# How does intermittent fasting affect the gut flora?

Intermittent fasting is one of the best ways to ensure the health of your gut. When you begin fasting regularly, this helps your gut increase resistance to oxidative and xenobiotic stress. It also increases the diversity of microbes in the gut while helping tolerance for bad bacteria. If you struggle with a weak intestinal lining, fasting can help your body repair this as well. Regular fasting also helps reduce *Candida* infections and allows healthy gut microbes to live longer.
