## What Brand Of Creatine Monohydrate Does Dr. Berg Recommend

# What brand of creatine monohydrate does Dr. Berg recommend?

**Creatine Monohydrate: Enhancing Strength and Recovery** 

While Dr. Berg doesn't have a specific brand recommendation for **creatine monohydrate**, it's a popular supplement known for its benefits in strength training and muscle recovery. 

Creatine is naturally formed from three amino acids: **arginine, glycine, and methionine**. Within your muscles, it combines with phosphate to help **recycle ATP**, which is essentially the energy currency your muscles use. This process aids in rapid energy recovery during intense activities. 

**Key Benefits of Creatine:** 

- **Tolerate Heavy Weight Training:** Creatine can help you push through more intense workouts. 

- **Muscle Recovery:** It supports faster recovery of your muscles after exercise. 

- **Muscle Strength:** Regular supplementation can lead to increased muscle strength. 

- **Muscle Size:** It can contribute to gains in muscle size. 

**Types of Creatine and Allergy Considerations:** 

There are different types of creatine available. Two versions often considered superior are: 

- **Creatine Ethyl Ester:** Some believe this form is better absorbed, though research is mixed. 

- **Micronized Creatine:** This is a very common and effective form, known for its fine particle size which can improve solubility and reduce stomach upset. 

It's important to note that some individuals can be **allergic to creatine**. If you're trying it for the first time, it's wise to **start with a small amount** to ensure you don't have an adverse reaction.  

**Best Practices for Buying Creatine Monohydrate:** 

When purchasing creatine, especially creatine monohydrate, here’s what to look for to ensure you get a high-quality product: 

1. **Third-Party Testing:** Choose brands that utilize **third-party testing**. This means an independent lab verifies the product's purity, potency, and absence of contaminants (like heavy metals or unwanted byproducts). This information is often displayed on the product's label or the manufacturer's website. 

2. **No Fillers or Additives:** Opt for products with minimal ingredients. You primarily want just creatine monohydrate, not a lot of unnecessary fillers, artificial flavors, or sweeteners, unless you prefer a flavored version from a reputable brand. 

3. **Mixability:** Micronized creatine generally mixes well in water or other beverages, reducing grittiness. Check reviews to see if users report good mixability. 

4. **Brand Reputation:** Purchase from well-established and trusted supplement brands with a history of quality control and customer satisfaction.

## What Is The Most Important Factor In Building Muscle

# What is the most important factor in building muscle?

We often think that increasing protein helps build muscle because muscle is made of protein. But this doesn’t always work. Some people that eat more protein may even suffer from amino acid deficiency. You need sufficient amounts of protein to build muscle, but, more importantly, you need sufficient amino acids. The general thought is that you need .8 grams of protein per kilogram of lean body mass—not overall weight. This might look like around 50 grams of protein per day. A moderate amount of protein would be between 1.2 and 1.7 grams per kilogram of lean body mass. High protein would be about 2 grams per kilogram of lean body mass. It’s essential to focus on consuming quality protein from eggs, meat, fish, and dairy. It’s not ideal to rely on getting your protein from plant sources or protein powder to build healthy muscles.

## How To Tighten And Flatten Stomach Just In A Few Days

# How to tighten and flatten stomach just in a few days?

A caloric deficit is not a sustainable way to lose weight or get a flat stomach! Most people find that their metabolism slows down in their 20s and 30s after a series of calorie-restrictive diets. Lowering calories increases hunger and cravings, which will require immense willpower and can stifle weight loss. The caloric deficit model is not sustainable!

Insulin is the hormone that controls whether you burn or store fat. If you reduce insulin, you can tap into your body fat for energy. Carbohydrates have the most significant effect on insulin, while fat is neutral and protein has a moderate impact. All calories are not the same! To lose weight, you must lower insulin, which means you must reduce your carb intake. If you’re on a low-carb diet, your body can use both food and body fat for fuel. This eliminates hunger and cravings between meals. Fat provides more than double the energy of glucose.

It takes 2 to 3 days to get into ketosis and 2 to 3 weeks for fat adaptation. Fat adaptation means your body is burning the most fat possible. Your body can burn ketones and fat, which are two different fuel sources. To get your body into ketosis, carbohydrates should make up about 5% of your diet, protein 20%, and fat 75%. Visceral fat in the abdomen may prevent a flat belly, but you can eliminate it with this diet. The dead bug exercise stimulates the fascia and muscles that can act as a girdle, giving you a flat belly fast! Do this exercise every day, and within 1 to 2 weeks, you will start to see amazing results!

## What Effective Strategies Can Quickly Alleviate Rhomboid Pain And Shou 1E6232

# What effective strategies can quickly alleviate rhomboid pain and shoulder blade discomfort, and how do these methods support long-term musculoskeletal health?

Ever felt that persistent ache between your shoulder blades? That's rhomboid pain, a common issue often caused by poor posture or strain. But don't worry, there are natural ways to alleviate it.

**Understanding Rhomboid Pain**

Rhomboid pain stems from strained muscles in your upper back. It's often linked to hunching over computers or carrying heavy loads, but stress can also play a role. In some cases, nerve irritation due to neck injuries or herniated discs can be the culprit. Surprisingly, issues with your gallbladder, bile ducts, or liver can also refer to pain in this area.

**Dietary Changes for Relief**

Your diet significantly impacts rhomboid pain. Avoid processed foods, excessive alcohol, and sugary drinks, as they can irritate your liver and gallbladder. Instead, focus on high-quality proteins like lean meats or plant-based options and load up on vegetables for their anti-inflammatory properties.

**Intermittent Fasting: A Natural Remedy**

Intermittent fasting gives your liver a break from constant food processing, reducing inflammation and strain on your bile ducts and gallbladder. This can indirectly alleviate rhomboid pain.

**Supplements for Support**

TUDCA, a bile acid, can help improve bile flow and protect liver cells. This may offer relief for rhomboid pain linked to gallbladder or liver problems. Always consult your doctor before starting any new supplements.

**Physical Therapies**

Mobility sticks and stretching exercises can work wonders for rhomboid pain. Rolling a mobility stick over your muscles improves blood flow and reduces tightness. Specific stretches targeting the rhomboids can also provide significant relief.

**Conclusion**

Reclaiming your life from rhomboid pain is achievable through natural methods. By adjusting your diet, incorporating intermittent fasting, considering supplements, and engaging in physical therapies, you can alleviate discomfort and enjoy a pain-free life.

## What Is An Autophagy On Steroids

# What is an autophagy on steroids?

Water fasting is when a person only consumes liquids for a period of time. When a person does dry fasting, they’re not consuming food or liquids. One of the biggest benefits of fasting is autophagy. Autophagy is a condition where your body recycles damaged proteins and turns them into new enzymes and structural proteins. Autophagy also helps you get rid of pathogens. Detoxification is just as important, if not more important, in some cases, as getting plenty of nutrients. One of the big purposes of sleep is to detoxify your cells. Fasting, especially dry fasting, mimics a lot of the benefits of sleep.

It’s important to note that about eight to ten percent of the water you get is produced by your own cells, which also enhances detoxification. But, if you drink a lot of water, your body doesn’t get a chance to produce metabolic water.

Dry fasting is essentially enhanced autophagy. Anything you can do to remove extra waste from the body is a great thing, especially for longevity.

**Top benefits of dry fasting:**

• It can help remove intracellular toxicity

• It can help strengthen biochemical machines

• It can help improve mitochondrial function

• It’s a strong epigenetic stimulus

• It can mimic some of the benefits of a deep sleep

## What Is The First Complication Of Diabetes

# What is the first complication of diabetes?

Maybe I should really say, the first complication of pre-diabetes! First, you have high insulin, which keeps your blood sugar normal for years. Then it creeps up a little bit. That’s pre-diabetes. And then it goes up even more, turning into full-blown type 2 diabetes.

The complications of diabetes really have to do with something called glycation, which is when sugar binds with protein or fat. You can get glycation from food that is made up of sugar and fat, or sugar and protein and are heated. For example, ice cream, donuts, or a hot dog or burger with a bun.

When you consume the type of sugar called fructose, it can increase glycation by up to ten times more than other sugars. And your own body can glycate too, with its own sugar.

When you take diabetes medication to lower blood sugar, where does the blood sugar go? No one talks about this! It doesn’t leave your body; instead, it gets hidden in different nooks and crannies inside you. Then it rots your body from the inside out. That’s why, even when you take diabetes medication, you still develop problems with your coronary arteries, eyes, nerves, and kidneys. So, the problem of high sugar hasn’t really been solved.

The first complication of diabetes is high insulin levels, and it gets worse from there.

## What Is The Worst Food To Consume For The Gut Microbiome

# What is the worst food to consume for the gut microbiome?

Your gut health is crucial, as it influences 80% of your immune system and plays a role in producing vitamins and neurotransmitters. A leaky gut, where the intestinal barrier becomes compromised, can lead to food allergies and autoimmune diseases. Symptoms like bloating, diarrhea, and skin issues can signal gut microbiome imbalances.

To protect your gut, avoid these culprits:

1. **Industrial Fibers:** Cellulose, soluble corn fiber, tapioca fiber, and resistant dextrin can disrupt the microbiome and contribute to leaky gut.

2. **Emulsifiers:** Maltodextrin spikes blood sugar, while xanthan gum, monoglyceride, and propylene glycol also pose risks.

3. **Industrial Proteins:** Gluten, casein, and soy protein isolates can trigger gut inflammation and allergies.

4. **Seed Oils:** These promote inflammation and leaky gut.

5. **Refined Sugars:** High fructose corn syrup and refined starches disrupt blood sugar balance and fuel harmful bacteria.

6. **Sugar Alcohols:** Some, like maltitol, are problematic. Opt for erythritol combined with monk fruit or stevia.

7. **Artificial Sweeteners:** Aspartame and sucralose wreak havoc on the microbiome, turning beneficial bacteria into harmful ones.

If you suspect gut issues, consider probiotics to replenish good bacteria. For persistent or worsening problems, a carnivore diet might help heal severe gut inflammation.

## What Is Serrapeptase And What Are Its Mechanisms Of Action Therapeutic 410Abb

# What is serrapeptase, and what are its mechanisms of action, therapeutic applications, and potential benefits in the context of inflammation and pain management?

Serrapeptase is a powerful proteolytic enzyme found initially in the intestines of silkworms but is now produced through fermentation. Here are some critical points about serrapeptase based on Dr. Berg's recommendations:

- **Protein-Dissolving Enzyme**: Serrapeptase is known for its ability to break down non-living tissues within the body, such as scar tissue, clots in the arteries, and fibrous tissue. This makes it beneficial for managing conditions like fibrosis and improving blood flow.

- **Anti-Inflammatory Properties**: It supports healthy inflammation responses, which can be crucial for tackling various health issues, including fatty liver disease and fluid retention in feet and ankles.

- **Liver Health**: Serrapeptase helps dissolve scar tissue in the liver, which can benefit individuals with cirrhosis or other liver conditions. Promoting better organ functionality indirectly supports healthier hormone regulation processes.

- **Usage**: Serrapeptase should be taken on an empty stomach or between meals for optimal absorption. This ensures that it enters the bloodstream and targets the intended areas rather than digesting food.

- **Supplement Form**: It is available in supplement form, and it's essential to choose a high-quality product, ideally with at least 250,000 IU (about 450 mg) for effectiveness.

Serrapeptase can be a valuable addition to your health regimen, especially for addressing issues related to scar tissue, inflammation, and liver health. Always consult with a healthcare provider before starting any new supplement.

## What Is The Most Crucial Collagen Tip For Achieving Remarkable Improve 675780

# What is the most crucial collagen tip for achieving remarkable improvements in the health and appearance of hair, nails, and skin?

**Glycine: The Unsung Hero of Your Health**

Collagen, the protein that keeps your skin, joints, and connective tissues strong, is made up of about 30% glycine. While your body produces some glycine, it may not be enough – especially if you don't regularly eat skin and cartilage from meat.

**Why You Need Glycine**

- **Fights Inflammation:** Glycine is both a powerful anti-inflammatory and helps your body produce glutathione, its master antioxidant.

- **Supports Detoxification:** Without sufficient glycine, your body's ability to remove toxins is reduced.

- **Benefits Beyond Beauty:** Glycine is essential for healthy gums, DNA, sleep, liver function, blood sugar balance, and even weight loss.

- **Glucose Without the Spikes:** Your body can use glycine to make glucose when needed, but it also helps balance blood sugar by stimulating glucagon.

**Are You Getting Enough?**

If you don't eat a nose-to-tail diet, experience stress, take medications, drink alcohol, or are exposed to toxins, you might be deficient in glycine.

**How to Boost Your Glycine Levels**

- **Homemade Gelatin:** A delicious and easy way to increase your glycine intake.

- **Glycine Supplements:** Aim for 4 to 10 grams per day.

- **Bone Broth & Pork Rinds:** Offer some glycine, but you'll need to eat plenty to get a significant amount.

As we age, our glycine needs increase. Boosting your levels could help with conditions like osteoarthritis, osteoporosis, insomnia, and more.

## What Exercise Burns The Most Calories

# What exercise burns the most calories?

We're diving into the truth about calorie burning and the best exercises to maximize it.

It's crucial to understand that the type of calories you burn is directly linked to your diet. A sugary diet leads to burning sugar calories, while a sugar-free, higher-fat diet promotes fat burning.

Overtraining is a common pitfall, as it elevates cortisol levels, which can break down muscle protein. Instead, prioritize the health of your mitochondria – the powerhouses of your cells.

Healthy mitochondria are key to energy levels, recovery, and endurance. Factors like certain medications (e.g., statins) can weaken them, so it's important to support them through:

- Exercise with ample rest

- Maintaining thyroid health

- Building muscle mass

- Intermittent fasting

- Cold therapy

- Including meat in your diet

Mitochondrial health can be assessed through metabolomics testing. Additionally, addressing insulin resistance, which can harm mitochondria, is vital. Growth hormone can be beneficial in reducing insulin resistance, building muscle, and promoting fat burning.

Remember, a high-carb diet can hinder fat burning. It's essential to look beyond just calories and focus on overall fat loss, which is 85% diet and only 15% exercise.

For maximum calorie burning, opt for high-intensity exercises that engage multiple muscle groups.

Let's get started on optimizing your calorie-burning potential!

## Is It Possible To Have Nutritional Deficiencies From Consuming Low Fat E84F70

# Is it possible to have nutritional deficiencies from consuming low fat protein?

## **Nutritional Deficiencies from Ultra-Low Fat Protein Sources**

If you're relying on ultra-low fat protein sources like certain whey protein powders, you may be putting yourself at risk for nutritional deficiencies. These protein sources often lack important vitamins and minerals that your body needs to function properly.

### **Insulin Response and Nutrient Absorption**

Another issue with ultra-low fat protein sources is that they can trigger an insulin response in your body. When you consume protein without enough fat, your body releases insulin to help process the protein.

Over time, this can lead to insulin resistance and other health problems. Additionally, consuming protein without fat can actually hinder your body's ability to absorb certain nutrients.

Fat-soluble vitamins like A, D, E, and K require fat to be properly absorbed by your body. Without enough fat in your diet, you may not be getting the full nutritional benefits of the foods you're eating.

## **The Importance of Fatty Acids in a Proper Diet**

So, what's the solution? It's simple: make sure you're getting enough healthy fats in your diet. Fatty acids, particularly unsaturated fats found in foods like fish and nuts, are essential for overall health and well-being.

![Human brain illustration](https://drberg-dam.imgix.net/others/human-brain-stimulation-activity-neuron-close.jpg?w=992&auto=compress,format)

### **Brain Function and Nervous System Health**

Did you know that your brain is made up of about 60% fat? It's true. Fatty acids play a crucial role in brain function and nervous system health. They help to build and maintain cell membranes, support the endocrine system, and even boost immune function.

[Omega-3 fatty acids](https://www.drberg.com/blog/basics-of-omega-3-fatty-acids), in particular, have been shown to have powerful brain-boosting benefits. These fatty acids are found in foods like salmon, sardines, and walnuts.

Incorporating these foods into your diet can help support healthy brain function and reduce your risk of cognitive decline.

### **Dietary Sources of Essential Fatty Acids**

So, where can you find healthy sources of fatty acids? Here are a few examples:

- Fatty fish like salmon, mackerel, and sardines

- Nuts and seeds like walnuts, chia seeds, and flaxseeds

- Avocados

- Olive oil

- Eggs

- Full-fat dairy products like yogurt and cheese

By incorporating these foods into your diet, you can ensure that you're getting the essential fatty acids your body needs to function properly. And trust me, your brain and nervous system will thank you.

In fact, many survival manuals advise against consuming rabbit meat if it's the only food available, due to its low fat content. Instead, they recommend seeking out fattier sources of protein to ensure your body gets the nutrients it needs.

The bottom line? Don't be afraid of fat. Embrace it as an essential part of a proper, healthy diet. Your body (and your taste buds) will thank you.

But what sets matcha apart? The secret lies in its shade-grown leaves ground into a fine powder. This process ensures that all those good-for-you elements are in your cup and not lost during brewing.

## **Matcha and Green Tea for Immunity**

Matcha and green tea are revered for their potential to boost immunity and promote overall health. Matcha, a finely ground powder made from green tea leaves, is particularly potent in antioxidants and nutrients, making it a powerhouse supporting the immune system.

Green tea, including matcha, contains high levels of catechins, which have been linked to enhanced immune function and reduced inflammation.

Additionally, while known for its benefits for skin health, including [combating oxidative stress](https://www.drberg.com/blog/oxidative-stress-immune-system-and-viral-infection) and promoting collagen production, [green tea benefits for skin](https://www.drberg.com/blog/drink-green-tea-for-your-skin) may indirectly contribute to immunity by maintaining the body's first line of defense against pathogens.

Incorporating matcha or green tea into your daily routine can be a flavorful and beneficial way to support your immune system while reaping these teas' skin-enhancing properties.

## How Can I Speed Up Muscle Growth

# How can I speed up muscle growth?

**Skeletal muscle is crucial for movement, posture, and metabolism. Building muscle requires a combination of high-intensity exercise and adequate protein intake. Aim for 0.8 to 1.5 grams of high-quality protein per kilogram of lean body mass (athletes may need up to 2 grams). To further optimize muscle growth, consider the following strategies:**

- **Creatine Supplementation:** Creatine boosts energy during intense exercise. Load with 20 grams for five days, then maintain with 3 grams daily in a cyclical pattern.

- **Cold Therapy:** Cold showers, immersion, or cryotherapy stimulate fat burning and muscle development by increasing muscle gene expression and reducing inflammation.

- **Intermittent Fasting:** Fasting boosts growth hormone for muscle growth and improves insulin sensitivity, aiding muscle recovery. Aim for two calorie-dense meals daily without snacking.

- **Arginine:** This amino acid promotes growth hormone production. Take 3-6 grams daily on an empty stomach, 30 minutes before workouts.

**Important Note:** Always consult a healthcare professional before starting any new supplement or dietary regimen.

## What Is Glycine And What Are Its Key Roles And Benefits In The Body Pa C64721

# What is glycine, and what are its key roles and benefits in the body, particularly for health, metabolism, and overall well-being?

**It's a very important amino acid: glycine.** Collagen is a main component of connective tissues, tendons, ligaments, and cartilage. About ⅓ of collagen is made by glycine. Your body can make glycine, but unfortunately, it doesn’t make very much. If you're not getting it from the diet, you could be deficient. Unless you’re eating the skin and cartilage from meat, you’re probably not getting enough glycine.

**Glycine** is needed to make the most important antioxidant for all of your cells, glutathione. Without enough glycine to make glutathione, you can’t detoxify your body. This can cause a buildup of toxicity, leading to inflammation. Glycine is a potent anti-inflammatory agent and is an essential building block for many enzymes and proteins.

**Here are some of the many important functions of glycine:**

• Makes heme in your blood

• Important for gum health

• Essential for DNA

• Building block for catalase

• Supports sleep

• Supports the liver

• Can help fix a leaky gut

• Detoxifies uric acid

• Supports blood sugar

• Helps with weight loss

• Reduces visceral fat

**Glycine can also turn into glucose to be used as fuel.** Certain parts of the body, especially the brain, need a certain amount of glucose. If you’re not consuming glucose, your body can make it. Glycine is a precursor for glucose, but don’t worry about it bumping you out of ketosis. Glycine stimulates the hormone glucagon, which opposes insulin.

**If you’re not eating animals nose-to-tail, if you’re under stress, taking medication, drinking alcohol, or exposed to toxins, you can become deficient in glycine.** You can increase your glycine intake by consuming gelatin! Try making your own gelatin using Knox Blox and using a natural sweetener like stevia. You can also take a glycine supplement. The average person needs about 4 to 10 grams of glycine per day.

**Bone broth and pork rinds can increase your glycine intake, but you need to consume a lot to get enough glycine.**

As we age, we need more glycine. Increasing glycine intake can potentially help people with osteoarthritis, osteoporosis, hair thinning, insomnia, gout, and kidney stones.

## What Is Protein Starvation On Low Fat Diet

# What is protein starvation on low-fat diet?

## **Understanding Protein Starvation on a Low-Fat Diet**

Have you ever heard of rabbit starvation? It occurs when you consume too much lean protein without enough fat in your diet. This can lead to protein starvation, which can have some pretty unpleasant side effects.

When you're on a [low-fat diet](https://www.drberg.com/blog/think-twice-before-you-start-a-low-fat-diet), it's easy to fall into the trap of relying too heavily on lean protein sources like chicken breast or egg whites. But here's the thing: your body needs fat to function properly.

Without enough fat, you can start to experience some serious health issues.

### **Symptoms and Side Effects of Protein Starvation**

So, what exactly happens when you're not getting enough fat in your diet? Well, for starters, you might start to feel pretty lousy. Common symptoms of protein starvation include:

- [Diarrhea](https://www.drberg.com/blog/diarrhea-on-the-ketogenic-diet)

- Headaches

- Fatigue

- Low blood pressure

- Slow pulse rate

- Insatiable hunger

These symptoms can be pretty debilitating, and they're a clear sign that your body isn't getting the nutrients it needs to function properly. If you're experiencing any of these symptoms on a low-fat diet, it's time to reevaluate your eating habits.

### **The Role of Fat in Preventing Protein Starvation**

So, how much fat do you need to prevent protein starvation? Well, it depends on a few factors, like your age, sex, and activity level. But experts generally recommend getting about 20-35% of your daily calories from fat.

To put that into perspective, let's take a look at rabbit meat. Rabbit is often touted as a lean, healthy protein source. But here's the thing: rabbit meat only has about 8% fat. That's not nearly enough to keep your body functioning properly.

In fact, there have been documented cases of people who have tried to survive solely on rabbit meat and ended up with severe protein starvation. Their bodies simply couldn't handle the lack of fat in their diets.

## The Keto Friendly Snack   Olives

# The Keto-Friendly Snack - Olives

The [ketogenic diet](https://www.drberg.com/blog/the-ketogenic-diet-plan-for-beginners) is a high-fat, low-carb eating plan that has gained popularity recently for its potential weight loss and health benefits. Olives fit perfectly into a ketogenic diet, as they are high in healthy fats and low in carbs.

Snacking on olives can help you stay in ketosis, a metabolic state in which your body burns fat for fuel instead of carbohydrates.

### **Fermentation's Role in Reducing Lectins**

Olives undergo a fermentation process that enhances their flavor and makes them more digestible by reducing harmful compounds called lectins.

Lectins are proteins found in many plant foods that can interfere with nutrient absorption and cause digestive issues in some people.

The fermentation process used to cure olives helps break down lectins, making the olives easier to digest and less likely to cause gastrointestinal discomfort. This is good news for people with sensitive digestive systems or those following lectin-free diets.

## What Are The Least Effective Fasting Patterns For Beginners

# What are the least effective fasting patterns for beginners?

## **The Least Effective Fasting Patterns for Beginners**

While intermittent fasting can be a game-changer for many people, not all fasting patterns are created equal. Some methods may be too extreme or unsustainable for beginners, leading to frustration and potential health risks.

Choosing a fasting pattern that aligns with your goals, lifestyle, and individual needs is important. Here are two fasting methods that may not be the best choice for those just starting out:

### **The Five and Two Diet's Limited Ketosis Impact**

The five-and-two diet, also known as the 5:2 diet, involves eating normally for five days a week and restricting calorie intake to 500-600 calories on the other two non-consecutive days.

While this method may lead to some weight loss, it has limitations when it comes to achieving ketosis, a metabolic state where your body burns fat for fuel.

To enter ketosis, you typically consume fewer than 50 grams of carbohydrates daily for several days. With the five-and-two diet, the fasting days may not be long enough or consistent enough to trigger this fat-burning state.

As a result, beginners may not experience the full range of benefits associated with intermittent fasting, such as increased energy and improved mental clarity.

### **Alternative Day Fasting's Sustainability Concerns**

Alternative day fasting (ADF) is another popular method that involves alternating between "fast" days, on which you consume only 25% of your normal calorie intake, and "feast" days, on which you eat without restriction.

While some studies have shown that ADF can lead to weight loss and improved health markers, it may not be the most sustainable approach for beginners.

The drastic calorie restriction on fasting days can be challenging to stick to long-term, leading to feelings of deprivation and even binge eating on feast days. This yo-yo effect can make establishing healthy eating habits difficult and may lead to weight regain over time.

Additionally, the constant fluctuation in calorie intake can be stressful on the body and may not be suitable for those with certain health conditions or a history of disordered eating.

For beginners, a more moderate and consistent approach to fasting may be a better choice for long-term success.

## **Recommended Fasting Patterns for Optimal Benefits**

Finding the right approach to intermittent fasting is key to unlocking its full potential. While some methods may be too extreme for beginners, several fasting patterns offer a more sustainable and effective way to reap the benefits of this lifestyle.

Here are three recommended fasting methods that have been shown to deliver optimal results:

### **The 18/6 Fasting Pattern**

The 18/6 fasting pattern, or the Leangains protocol, involves fasting for 18 hours and eating within a 6-hour window each day. For example, you might finish your last meal at 8 pm and not eat again until 2 pm the following day.

This method is popular among those looking to build muscle and lose fat, as it allows for more flexibility in meal timing and macronutrient intake.

Fasting for an extended period also gives your body ample time to enter a fat-burning state and experience the benefits of [increased growth hormone levels](https://www.drberg.com/blog/increase-growth-hormone-as-you-age) and [autophagy, a cellular cleanup process](https://www.drberg.com/blog/the-real-reason-why-autophagy-exists) that helps remove damaged proteins and organelles.

### **The 20/4 Fasting Strategy**

The 20/4 fasting strategy may be a good fit for those looking for a more aggressive approach. This method involves fasting for 20 hours and eating within a 4-hour window daily.

While this may sound intense, many people find that the longer fasting helps them feel more focused and energized throughout the day.

The 4-hour eating window also allows for larger, more satisfying meals, which can be especially appealing for those who enjoy the social aspect of dining.

Research has shown that the 20/4 method can be highly effective for weight loss and improving markers of metabolic health, such as insulin sensitivity and blood sugar control. It may also offer cognitive benefits, such as improved brain function and memory.

## What Is The Role Of Diet Plans

# What is the role of diet plans?

Adopting a specific diet plan can be a powerful tool in managing your child's sugar intake and improving their overall health and behavior. The **Healthy Keto diet**, which emphasizes whole, nutrient-dense foods while limiting sugar and processed carbohydrates, is one such plan. By focusing on healthy fats, proteins, and non-starchy vegetables, this diet can help stabilize blood sugar levels, reduce inflammation, and enhance brain function.

Many parents have observed significant improvements in their children's focus, calmness, and self-control after implementing the Healthy Keto diet. If your child struggles with mood issues related to high sugar intake, it’s advisable to check their blood sugar levels and consult with a healthcare professional to determine if this diet may be suitable.

**Managing Sugar-Related Mood Swings:**

Excessive sugar consumption is often linked to mood swings, irritability, and hyperactivity in children. Reducing sugar intake and incorporating healthier options can promote more stable moods.

For example, try a **keto pancakes recipe** as a nutritious and satisfying alternative to traditional high-sugar breakfast choices. By integrating such healthy options, you can support your child's mood stability and overall well-being.

## What Is The Role Of Carbohydrates In Cholesterol Production

# What is the role of carbohydrates in cholesterol production?

While it’s true that excessive saturated fat intake can elevate cholesterol levels, it’s equally important to recognize the significant role carbohydrates—especially sugars, bread, and pasta—play in fat and cholesterol production.

**Understanding De Novo Lipogenesis:**

\- **Carbohydrate Conversion:** When consumed in excess, carbohydrates are converted into fatty acids through a process called de novo lipogenesis. These fatty acids are stored as triglycerides and can increase LDL ("bad") cholesterol levels, contributing to plaque buildup in the arteries and raising the risk of heart disease.

**Impact of Processed Carbohydrates:**

\- **Insulin Resistance:** Processed carbohydrates, like those in white bread, pasta, and sugary snacks, cause rapid blood sugar spikes. Over time, this can lead to insulin resistance, a precursor to type 2 diabetes and heart disease.

\- **Cholesterol Production:** The liver converts excess glucose into very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL), which eventually becomes LDL cholesterol, further contributing to arterial plaque and cardiovascular risk.

By moderating carbohydrate intake, particularly processed carbs, you can better manage cholesterol levels and reduce the risk of heart disease.

## What Is Glycation

# What is Glycation?

### **What is Glycation?**

Glycation is a chemical reaction that occurs when sugars, such as glucose, fructose, or galactose, bond with proteins or lipids without the control of enzymes.

This process is also known as the Maillard reaction, named after the French chemist Louis Camille Maillard who first described it in the early 1900s.

During glycation, the sugar molecules attach to the free amino groups of proteins, forming unstable compounds called Schiff bases. These compounds then undergo further rearrangement to form more stable, but still reversible, structures known as Amadori products.

Over time, these Amadori products can undergo additional chemical reactions, leading to the formation of AGEs.

### **The Formation of AGEs**

AGEs can form both endogenously (within the body) and exogenously (from external sources). Endogenous AGEs are produced as a natural byproduct of metabolism, particularly when blood sugar levels are consistently high, as in the case of poorly managed diabetes.

Exogenous AGEs, on the other hand, are introduced into the body through dietary sources, particularly foods that are high in fat and protein and have been exposed to high temperatures during cooking.

[High-fat diets](https://www.drberg.com/blog/6-benefits-of-a-high-fat-diet) are particularly problematic when combined with sugar, as this combination accelerates the formation of AGEs.

When we consume foods that are high in both sugar and protein or fat, the glycation process is further promoted, leading to a more rapid accumulation of AGEs in our bodies.

## What Is A Good Alternative For Rice Cakes On Keto

# What is a good alternative for rice cakes on keto?

**Keto-Friendly Alternatives to Rice Cakes**

If you're on a ketogenic diet, try these low-carb snacks with similar textures:

**Low-Carb Melba Toast**: Only 3 grams of carbs per four slices.

**Low-Carb Chips**: Cheese crisps and nut-based crackers. Always check the labels for carb content.

**Cauliflower Rice**: A versatile low-carb substitute with only 5 grams of net carbs per cup.

**Ways to Use Cauliflower Rice**:

\- **Fried "Rice"**: Sauté with veggies, protein, soy sauce (or coconut aminos), ginger, garlic, and sesame oil.

\- **Risotto**: Mix with heavy cream or cream cheese and Parmesan cheese; add mushrooms or veggies.

\- **Pilaf**: Stir-fry with onions and spices like cumin seeds or cinnamon sticks.

\- **Stir-Fries**: Use as a base for dishes like beef and broccoli or shrimp stir-fry.

These alternatives help maintain ketosis and satisfy cravings for crunchy textures.

## What Is The Worst Protein In The World

# What is the worst protein in the world?

Ater having a horrible reaction to some “chicken wings” that I ate, I called to find out what was in them. It turns out they were plant-based chicken wings made with textured vegetable protein.

**Textured vegetable protein, or textured soy protein, is the worst protein in the world. Soy or cottonseed is used as the “vegetable” to make this protein.**

**Textured vegetable protein was invented in 1960 as a way to use the waste produced from seed oils. It has been used in veggie burgers, fake meat products, cereals, and many other food products. Textured vegetable protein is an ultra-processed ingredient. To make it, oil, nutrients, and fiber are removed from the soybean using heat and chemicals like hexane. There are no long-term safety studies or upper limit on hexane established by the FDA. Chronic hexane toxicity is a condition caused by inhaling hexane, so what happens when you ingest it?**

Over 95% of textured vegetable protein is GMO, and when consumed, it robs nutrients from your liver. It’s very similar to soy protein isolates. Any time you consume pure protein without fat, you are creating stress in your body, especially if the protein doesn't contain key nutrients like fat-soluble vitamins A, E, D, and K.

## What Strategies Can Be Employed To Address And Combat Glycine Deficiency

# What strategies can be employed to address and combat glycine deficiency?

Glycine, a key amino acid, is vital for various bodily functions. While the body can produce some glycine, stress, poor diet, and certain medications can lead to deficiencies. Ensuring adequate intake through diet and supplementation is essential for maintaining optimal levels.

High-Glycine Foods

For those seeking to boost glycine levels through diet, consider incorporating the following foods:

\- Bone Broth: Rich in glycine from collagen.

\- Gelatin: Another excellent source.

\- Animal Skins: Pork and chicken skin.

\- Seafood: Provides glycine.

\- Vegetables: Spinach, kale, cauliflower.

\- Fruits: Bananas, kiwi.

Supplementation

Hydrolyzed collagen supplements offer a concentrated source of glycine and are highly bioavailable due to their breakdown into smaller peptides. Daily doses typically range from 3 to 5 grams, with some suggesting up to 10 grams for optimal benefits.

Safety and Recommendations

Glycine is generally safe, even at higher doses. Consult a healthcare professional before starting any new supplement regimen, especially if you have underlying health conditions.

## **Healthy Keto® Diet: A Delicious Way to Better Oral Health**

[The Heathy Keto® diet](https://www.drberg.com/the-healthy-keto-diet-for-beginners) can be a tasty solution to dental problems. Replacing sugary foods with nutrient-dense alternatives can improve oral health and protect against tooth decay.

### **What Is A Healthy Keto Diet?**

A keto diet is a low-carb, high-fat [](https://www.drberg.com/the-healthy-keto-diet-for-beginners)diet that can help with weight loss, diabetes control, and heart health. Lowering carbs and augmenting healthy fats leads to your body entering a ketogenic state.

A [Healthy Keto diet](https://www.drberg.com/blog/healthy-keto-plan-start-here) emphasizes whole foods like vegetables, lean proteins, and healthy fats such as avocados and olive oil.

### **Benefits Of A Healthy Keto Diet For Your Teeth**

- **Sugar Reduction:** A keto diet is low in sugar, which can help prevent cavities and gum disease. Bacteria in your mouth feed off sugar, producing acids that erode enamel and cause decay.

- **Balancing Your pH:** Limiting carbs can maintain a balanced pH level in your mouth, preventing bacterial growth and promoting healthier teeth and gums.

- **Nutrient-Rich Foods:** A healthy keto diet includes nutrient-rich foods like leafy greens, which provide essential vitamins and minerals for strong teeth and gums.

Switching to a keto lifestyle can be intimidating, yet proper meal planning and new recipes may prove both tasty and satisfying. Plus, the benefits extend beyond your teeth - you may experience increased energy, improved mood, and better concentration.

While natural remedies like clove oil can provide temporary relief, they should not replace regular dental visits and proper hygiene practices. By making mindful food choices, you can dramatically improve your oral health and reduce the need for short-term solutions.

## What Does Dr. Berg Recommend For Someone With Egg Intolerance

# What does Dr. Berg recommend for someone with egg intolerance?

Dr. Berg suggests that egg intolerance or allergy may sometimes be linked to early vaccine exposure, which can introduce allergens like egg proteins or peanuts. If you have an egg intolerance, it’s advisable to avoid eggs initially and then gradually reintroduce them into your diet. Eggs are considered a highly nutritious food, so careful reintroduction may help you tolerate them better over time.

## What Is Dr. Bergs Opinion On Dairy

# What is Dr. Berg's opinion on dairy?

Dr. Berg has reservations about dairy, particularly due to the protein casein, which may have growth-promoting properties, especially if sourced from cows potentially treated with hormones. Similarly, whey protein, popular among bodybuilders, also has growth-promoting effects that could be a concern. However, Dr. Berg suggests that consuming moderate amounts of high-quality dairy, such as cheese from healthy, pasture-raised cows, can be acceptable. The key is to choose dairy from trusted sources and consume it in moderation.

## Should People On The Carnivore Diet Worry About Ketoacidosis Elevated  0De81C

# Should people on the carnivore diet worry about ketoacidosis, elevated ammonia, or elevated urea?

Well, you're not just eating all the protein to your eating a lot of fat. Okay, so you're eating fat which actually kind of offsets that and our bodies have an incredible ability to adapt to different diets. So some people have an issue.

Some people don't but the benefits of doing that, especially if you have gut inflammation, you just pretty much you're creating a healing response to your gut because in that situation your system is compromised where you can't tolerate these fibers or legumes or or anything other than some protein and so and fat. It seems to work, but I would recommend not just doing muscle protein. I would also recommend doing like the eggs, the fish, things like that.

But it's something to test the waters and then see how you do. Do I recommend it long term? It really depends on the severity of damage. But once your gut heals, maybe you want to start introducing things like sauerkraut or fermented vegetables in smaller amounts and gradually increase it after that.

## What Steps Can I Take To Address Elevated Alkaline Phosphatase Levels

# What steps can I take to address elevated alkaline phosphatase levels?

So one thing about the liver is it really doesn't give you any symptoms until later. It's kind of good that this showed up just so you can start working on your liver. The liver is the only organ that can completely 100% rejuvenate. It's rough, it's rugged. **So I would start taking milk thistle right away. That's one thing. And TUDCA, which will help to thin the bile because that liver enzyme is usually involved with a backup of more of the bile ducts and that which the Tudka is a natural way of thinning the bile, but then the milk thistle will actually protect the liver and bring down those enzymes.** And then of course, I'm assuming you're doing the healthy version of ketogenic diet with intermittent fasting. Hopefully you are and you can.

If you get on a ketogenic diet, you're going to find your liver enzymes probably will be much, much better in a couple of months because reducing the carbs is going to take a big stress off the inflammation in the liver. And one thing that's cool, if you do have any fat in the liver, which I don't know if you do, you have to do an ultrasound for that. You'll find that within even two weeks, you can reduce like 50% of the fat off the liver if you do the ketogenic diet correctly.

**There's a lot of things you can do for the liver, but I would stick with the TUDCA, the milk thistle, and I would do low carb and then get it retested. I think that enzyme will come down, but there's not a lot of things you can do medically to reverse liver disease because everything is involving toxicity. So really the natural way is the best way to approach this. And a lot of the foods that are good for the liver are like the persimmons, vegetables, microgreens, sprouts, and healthy proteins like eggs and things like that too. Eggs are really good for the liver. And so is grass-fed beef. That's really good for the liver too because it has the choline, which will protect the liver. Those are the things that I would suggest. And I think that can turn things around for you.**

Now, because the uricidal does water down the bile, should I stop that and just take the TUDCA? That's a really good question that I can't tell you not to take it, but I would just research the side effects from that and then research TUDCA. And then you make up your own mind based on the data because I think you'll be pleasantly surprised if you look at the wider viewpoint on this and side effects and benefits.

## What Should You Consume In The First Trimester If Youre Dealing With N Cdabe9

# What should you consume in the first trimester if you’re dealing with nausea and food aversions?

The most important thing is the diet. I would be careful about doing the rice.

I would go back to what I recommend is the basic keto plan and find out maybe instead of doing heavy fatty foods you do. You do like maybe less fatty foods, but you definitely need animal source nutrients for the best bioavailable source of amino acids and nutrition, because this is the time where that that baby is being fortified and developing. And so you don't want to have any deficiencies.

*\*Anything I say is not meant to diagnose or replace your medical care check with a doctor before implementing any of these suggestions.*

## You Best Strategy Against Cancer

# You Best Strategy Against Cancer

**Understanding Cancer and the Potential Benefits of Fasting**

**Key Differences Between Normal and Cancer Cells**

- **Origin:** Cancer cells develop from mutated normal cells.

- **Mitochondrial Damage:** Damage to cellular powerhouses (mitochondria) can trigger the transformation from normal to cancerous.

- **Fuel Preference:** Cancer thrives on sugar, while normal cells have more flexibility.

- **Lifespan:** Cancer cells can replicate indefinitely, unlike normal cells.

- **Growth Rate:** Cancer cells multiply much faster than normal cells.

**How Fasting May Combat Cancer: Key Mechanisms**

- **Mechanism 1: Fuel Starvation:** Fasting reduces glucose, the primary energy source for cancer cells.

- **Mechanism 2: Amino Acid Deprivation:** Fasting limits glutamine and arginine, alternative fuel sources for some cancers.

- **Mechanism 3: Autophagy:** Fasting triggers cellular cleanup, potentially shrinking tumors and hindering cancer growth.

- **Mechanism 4: Immune Boost:** Fasting strengthens your cancer-fighting immune system.

- **Mechanism 5: Hormone Reduction:** Fasting lowers IGF-1 (problematic in existing cancer), insulin, and estrogen, which may fuel cancer risk.

- **Mechanism 6: Inflammation Control:** Fasting helps reduce inflammation, a factor in cancer development.

- **Mechanism 7: Ketone Impact:** More research is needed, but some natural inhibitors (alpha-lipoic acid, garcinia, etc.) may block a process that benefits cancer cells.

**Fasting Protocols: Prevention vs. Active Cancer**

- **Prevention:** Aim for 16-hour fasts with an 8-hour eating window, plus a low-carb diet.

- **Active Cancer:** Consider 18-20 hour fasts, 48-hour fasts weekly, or extended fasts under medical supervision. Prioritize cruciferous vegetables, healthy proteins, and fats.

**Important Note:** Always consult your doctor before starting any fasting regimen, especially if you have cancer. This information is for educational purposes and not a substitute for medical advice.

## How Can I Help A Friend To Lose Weight

# How can I help a friend to lose weight?

The #1 thing to do is help educate them about these problems. I’m going to talk about these issues in detail. Take a look. 

**1\. Cutting Calories** 

The most common mistake people make with weight loss is cutting calories. It is true that you want to reduce the frequency of meals, but you don’t want to lower your calories. Calorie reductions can cause:

• Slow metabolism

• Constant hunger

• Nutrient deficiencies. 

**2\. Low Fat**

You need healthy fats in your diet. Many people try to cut back on fats like butter and animal fat, but this is a mistake. Low-fat protein is actually much higher on the glycemic index. What this means is that it will cause your insulin to spike. The more their food choices trigger insulin, the less weight they’re going to lose. Keep in mind that fat has the least effect on insulin.

**3\. High Carbs** 

In the presence of too much insulin, you cannot lose fat. Insulin is a fat-storing hormone. Carbs are very high on the glycemic index. If you are eating carbs, you don’t be able to lose weight, you will have frequent cravings, and you will likely gain even more weight. Cut out the carbs by going on a healthy keto diet.

**4\. Monitoring Steps + Drinking Lots of Water**

This happens a lot with people who try to lose weight. They count steps, hit the treadmill or stationary bike, and drink lots of water, but they still don’t see significant results. Why? Because these things are only effective if you first work on the diet. In fact, exercise only makes up about 15% of weight loss results. Put more energy into your diet, and you’ll see far more results. 

**5\. Weighing Daily**

As you’ve probably heard me say before, get healthy to lose weight—don’t lose weight to get healthy. If you put too much of your attention on losing weight, you’re doing things backward. The main thing you can do to get healthy is to work on fixing insulin resistance with healthy keto and intermittent fasting. This can take time, so be patient. 

**6\. Six Small Meals Per Day** 

Every time you eat, you trigger insulin. If you consume 6 small meals every day, you are spiking your insulin over and over. This makes weight loss very difficult. Instead, do intermittent fasting. This will help fight off cravings, fix insulin resistance, and burn fat. 

Educate your friends and family on these points. This will give them the basics to help them lose weight.

## How Can I Visualize My Plate Instead Of Counting Macros

# How can I visualize my plate instead of counting macros?

The three macronutrients are proteins, fats, and carbohydrates. Most foods are not 100% one macro—they often contain multiple macros.

Let’s start breaking down your meal plate.

**You want the majority of your carbohydrates to come from vegetables.** The average person needs at least 7 cups/servings of vegetables every day. One cup of vegetables is roughly a fist full of salad. If you’re consuming more dense vegetables—broccoli, cauliflower, bell peppers, carrots—then you only need about 3.5 cups/servings per day. You can also include a small number of berries in your diet, which count as carbohydrates.

**Olives, hummus, and avocados are a combination of carbohydrates and fats**. Fats and proteins are often combined. The fattiest proteins are the best to consume on a healthy keto diet. Avoid all low-fat proteins and do not trim the fat off of full-fat meats.

**3-5 oz of protein per meal is ideal.** For men, this is 1-2 pieces of protein that are about the size of the palm of your hand. For women, about 1 palm worth of protein. This would be similar to 2-4 eggs, one handful of nuts, 2 thumb-sized pieces of cheese, or 1-2 thumb-sized servings of nut butter.

## What Are The Reasons For High Creatine On Keto

# What are the reasons for high creatine on Keto?

First, what is creatinine? It’s a waste product from muscle metabolism. (Side note: a waste product from dietary protein is called urea.) Every day your body converts creatine to creatinine.

**The higher level of creatinine on keto isn’t pathological. Here are the five reasons why they are high:**

1\. Consuming way too much protein, especially cooked meat. Ideally, you want to eat three to six ounces of protein, or as much as seven, at a meal. If you’re a big person perhaps a little more.

2\. Taking too much creatine supplementation; try cutting back

3\. Exercising excessively especially if it’s intense, because of muscle physiology. Cut back and take longer to recover.

4\. Having an injury or inflammatory condition, which could itself be pathological

5\. Having a problem with your gallbladder or liver, which could also be pathological

## Does Skipping Meals Slow Metabolism

# Does skipping meals slow metabolism?

[See Video/Image/Document](https://hls-player.drberg.com/asset?path=migrated-assets/will-skipping-meals-increase-your-metabolism-drberg)

We have to differentiate between skipping a meal, otherwise known as infrequent meals or intermittent fasting, from just being on a low-calorie diet. They are two different things. When you decrease the frequency of your meals you’ll probably automatically reduce your calories. When you reduce your calories and the frequency of your meals you won’t feel too good. Here’s an example. I’ve done several cleanses in the past, I think it was the lemon water, cayenne pepper, and maple syrup one. I did it for ten days and it almost killed me!

The maple syrup was enough glucose to keep me out of ketosis and keep my blood sugar up and down while I was basically starving to death. I was so hungry it was torturous. I’ve done other cleanses and also felt terrible. So if someone brought up fasting, I’d reject it. But what I didn’t know then that I know now is that if you do keto (low carb) and infrequent meals and ease gradually into fasting, your hunger goes away. You adapt to burning your own fat.

**When you eat more frequently you can’t get into fat-burning mode.** **You’ll have a lot of blood sugar issues, but you won’t on keto and intermittent fasting. When you decrease meals you decrease insulin, which automatically increases your metabolic rate. You’ll feel really good because your brain loves ketones. If you do a search on how to increase your metabolism you’ll find suggestions like drink more water, eat more protein, eat spicy foods, and drink green tea. These are trivial.**

**These are the things that affect your metabolism:**

●Age, which you can’t do much about

●Dieting; go on keto and decrease the frequency of your meals

●Your diet as an infant or your mother’s diet when she was pregnant with you. If it was high carb and she developed insulin resistance you’re at higher risk of becoming prediabetic and having a slow metabolism.

●Insulin levels; decrease your meal frequency without cutting calories and see how much weight you lose

●Cortisol levels; decrease your stress

Skipping meals doesn’t slow your metabolism!

## What Are The Potential Reasons For Sugar Cravings And How Do Factors S Fc537C

# What are the potential reasons for sugar cravings, and how do factors such as hormonal fluctuations, emotional triggers, and dietary habits contribute to this desire?

Craving sugar is a very common problem, especially if you are trying to get onto a healthy diet. It can be caused by several underlying issues. Let’s break it down and look at some simple remedies to the problem.

**Cause #1: High-carb diet**

When you are on a high-carb diet your body will produce insulin (fat-storing hormone) to lower the blood sugar spikes. High blood sugar will make you feel satisfied after the high-sugar / high- carb meal. However, a few hours later, the insulin will drop the blood sugar too low, causing you to crave these foods again. The cycle repeats.

Additionally, consuming refined carbs and sugar increases the hormones and chemicals in the body that are related to pleasure, making you feel satisfied when you are consume them.

A high-carb diet is very addictive, with many side effects.

The solution is to get on the Healthy Keto® diet and intermittent fasting. When you start following them, in a few days your body will adapt to a new healthy type of fuel: ketones (instead of sugar).

Ketones are a byproduct of your body burning its own fat. If your body is adapted to ketones you will feel much more energetic, less stressed, healthier, and you will have no cravings or hunger whatsoever. As an additional reward, you will burn fat.

**Cause #2: Snacking**

Eating between meals, even if it’s not much food, will raise your level of insulin. This is because eating in general will raise insulin. Insulin in turn will lower your blood sugar levels, and shortly after your snack you will feel hunger and cravings again.

**Cause #3: Stress**

When you are undergoing stress, you may feel like eating sweets and carbohydrates. This usually has its roots in being accustomed to a high-carb diet. When you eat carbs out of stress, you may feel satisfied temporarily, because your blood sugar and dopamine (pleasure-related chemical produced by your body) go high. Shortly after, when they drop, you will feel stressed again and will crave carbs to feel better. The solution would be to get on the right diet and get your stress levels under control.

Additionally, if you constantly undergo stress, your stress hormone, called cortisol, is going to break down your body proteins and turn them into sugar. This will spike your blood sugar and make your body produce insulin to lower it. Once blood sugar is lowered below the normal level, you will crave sugar and carbs.

## Keto Is Beneficial For Athletic Performance

# Keto is Beneficial for Athletic Performance

In 2012 there was a study, which I linked to below this video, that keto doesn’t affect the strength performance in elite gymnasts. A 2018 study, also linked below, shows that keto reduces oxidative stress and inflammation in deep sea divers. When you run your body on ketones, you get less oxidative stress, meaning that your organs and tissues don’t break down as easily.

Yet another study of cyclists showed that keto didn’t compromise their endurance. Two of the top ultramarathon runners are both on keto. One of them, Zach Bitter, took the US record for a 100 mile event. It’s not carbs that build muscle, it’s protein. Strength training also builds muscle. While it’s true that insulin is anabolic, which helps your muscles grow, Two things stimulate insulin; one is carbs, the other is protein.

When you do the keto diet, you go low carb. When you go low carb, and combine it with intermittent fasting, you fix something called insulin resistance. Most of the population has this. Your cells need evermore insulin to offset the effect of eating too many carbs. When you fix insulin resistance, you increase the absorption of amino acids. Your body uses insulin more effectively. When you do a healthy keto plan, your body runs on ketones, fatty acids, and part of it still uses a little bit of glucose. Even though you’re not consuming glucose, your body has the ability to make its own in the liver, a process called gluconeogenesis.

When you start keto, you go through keto adaptation. You may experience fatigue. Increase your B vitamins and minerals. This is a temporary phase. Once you tap into your fat reserves, your performance will improve. You’ll have more endurance. Some athletes become fat burning machines. The truth is, when you eat high carb, you’ll feel more fatigued and your performance will suffer. You’ll have higher insulin along with blood sugar issues and more oxidative stress. Now you can see why the keto diet is actually beneficial for athletic performance.

## Dos And Donts Pre And Post Workout Meals

# Do's and Dont's Pre and Post Workout Meals

**Myth #1:** You have to replenish your glycogen reserve. You have a certain storage of sugar in your muscles and liver. After about a half hour of working out, you become tapped out of glycogen. After the glycogen stores are depleted, then you start burning fat. If your goal is to lose weight or get toned, then you want to deplete your glycogen stores. Replenishing them doesn’t make sense.

Additionally, every time you consume high-protein foods, like a protein bar or protein shake, it triggers insulin. Insulin stops the natural fat burning process.

**Myth #2:** You need to eat protein after a workout to build muscle. Anything you eat right before or after a workout will not immediately affect your muscle mass. It takes at least 24 hours for your digestive tract to break down protein into usable nutrients. The idea that a protein shake is immediately going to your muscles doesn’t add up.

You don’t really need protein around your workouts to build muscle mass. It’s the meal you ate yesterday that creates muscle today—keep that in mind. Additionally, if you consume too much protein, you will overload your liver, and it won’t end up as muscle.

What you really need to do is avoid things that spike your insulin levels around your workouts—this includes protein shakes and protein bars. You should also know that insulin nullifies growth hormone. When you work out, you induce a stress event that breaks down muscles. During the recovery process is when your body builds muscle. Growth hormone is instrumental—which means that spiking insulin is a huge problem.

**Tips for getting the most out of your workout:**

• Get good sleep

• Don’t eat anything before, during, or after your workout

• Avoid insulin-spiking foods

## Why Am I Experiencing Unintended Weight Loss On The Ketogenic Diet

# Why am I experiencing unintended weight loss on the ketogenic diet?

People often start keto for the weight loss benefits but want to continue for the health benefits, even after they’ve lost weight.

**If you find that you’re getting too skinny on keto, avoid unwanted weight loss with these 7 tips:**

1\. Try weight training to build muscle

2\. Add more fat to your diet

3\. Add MCT oil or butter to your coffee or teeccino(Bulletproof coffee)

4\. Try keto bombs!

5\. Add nuts and nut butters to your diet

6\. Increase carbs, but not above 50 grams per day

7\. Increase vegetable intake

You should only consume a moderate amount of protein, around 8 ounces per meal is sufficient. Two meals a day is ideal to prevent extra weight loss on keto.

## Does Fat Put Me In Ketosis On Keto

# Does fat put me in ketosis on keto?

Many people think it takes consuming more fat to put your body into the state of ketosis.

The truth is, you don’t necessarily need to consume more fat. Instead, you need to lower your carbohydrates. Carbs affect insulin, and insulin blocks ketosis. The key is to lower your carbs.

Ketosis is also not a high-protein diet. You want to consume only a moderate amount of protein. 3-8 oz of protein is fine. You also don’t want to consume lean protein—low-fat protein can exacerbate insulin spikes. Always consume full-fat foods.

## What Can Help To Relieve Seasonal Allergies

# What can help to relieve seasonal allergies?

Pollen is produced by flowers and is spread through the wind and by bees. If you have a pollen allergy, your body is rejecting pollen.

During this rejection process, your body goes through a series of immune reactions involving histamines. Histamines cause excess mucus production and fatigue. A good potential strategy is to gradually expose the body to pollen, starting with small amounts and increasing the amounts over time. This will cause the body to reject it less and less.

The best remedy for seasonal allergies to use as a part of this strategy is bee pollen. Local bee pollen contains a combination of many different types of pollen in your area.

**Bee pollen is also a powerful anti-inflammatory, has wound-healing effects, and is rich in:**

• Friendly microbes

• Amino acids

• Antioxidants

• Essential fatty acids

• Hormones

• Vitamins

• Minerals

You would want to start out with two to three grains of bee pollen per day and gradually increase the amount each day over at least one week. Eventually, you may want to try taking two to five teaspoons per day for an adult and one to two teaspoons per day for a child. You can chew the grains, grind them, or soak them in water and drink them.

It may be best to start this protocol in the winter before the spring. You could do this protocol two to three times per year. Other great natural remedies for allergies are quercetin, onions, or stinging nettle. It’s also important to support your liver if you’re experiencing allergies.

## Will Going Low Carb And Low Insulin Reduce My Muscle Mass And How Can  C28Ab0

# Will going low-carb and low-insulin reduce my muscle mass, and how can I maintain muscle while doing keto and intermittent fasting?

Maintaining muscle mass on a low-carb, low-insulin diet is possible if you follow these guidelines:

\- Keep your daily carb intake between 50-60 grams.

\- Consume 8-9 ounces of protein per meal.

\- Ensure you're not deficient in essential nutrients.

Insulin is an anabolic hormone that helps absorb amino acids, but consistently high insulin from carbs and sugar leads to insulin resistance, impairing amino acid absorption and causing muscle loss. Keto and intermittent fasting improve insulin sensitivity, enhancing amino acid and protein absorption.

For muscle maintenance and growth, incorporate weight training and increase protein intake. Aim for 8-9 ounces of high-quality protein per meal from sources like eggs, meat, and fish. Avoid high-carb foods to prevent insulin resistance.

Consider supplementing with complete amino acids for maximum efficiency in muscle building.

## What Are The Most Common Keto Mistakes That Slow Your Progress Down

# What are the most common Keto mistakes that slow your progress down?

Common mistakes on keto and how to address them:

1\. **Excessive Fat Consumption:** Focus on reducing carbs rather than adding more fat. Only increase fat intake if you're new to keto and need support during fasting.

2\. **Snacking:** Avoid keto snacks and stick to regular meals to minimize insulin spikes.

3\. **Hidden Carbs:** Check food labels for hidden carbs like maltodextrin. Avoid fruits, berries, and agave nectar.

4\. **Inadequate Protein Intake:** Ensure you're consuming enough quality protein to signal satiety to the brain and prevent deficiencies. Consider amino acid supplements if needed during fasting.

## What Strategies Can Be Employed To Alleviate Symptoms Of Seasonal Allergies

# What strategies can be employed to alleviate symptoms of seasonal allergies?

Pollen allergies trigger histamine-driven immune reactions, causing symptoms like mucus production and fatigue. Gradual pollen exposure can desensitize the body. Bee pollen, rich in nutrients and anti-inflammatory properties, includes various local pollens.

**Benefits of Bee Pollen:**

\- Anti-inflammatory and wound-healing effects

\- Contains friendly microbes, amino acids, antioxidants, essential fatty acids, hormones, vitamins, and minerals

**How to Use Bee Pollen:**

Start with 2-3 grains daily, increasing gradually over a week. Adults can eventually take 2-5 teaspoons daily, children 1-2 teaspoons. Chew, grind, or soak in water.

**Other Natural Allergy Remedies:**

Include quercetin, onions, and stinging nettle. Support liver health during allergy seasons.

Initiate the pollen exposure protocol before spring, repeating 2-3 times yearly for best results.

## What Are The Primary Causes Of Receding Gums And How Do These Factors  98C544

# What are the primary causes of receding gums, and how do these factors contribute to gum health and overall oral hygiene?

Receding gums could actually be caused by a vitamin C deficiency. Vitamin C has a lot to do with protein building, specifically collagen. When you lose collagen, your gums can start to recede. 

Some bacteria have a negative effect through enzymes that break down protein. But, vitamin C can counter the effect of these enzymes. Vitamin C can help reduce the toxic effect of bacteria.  If you brush your teeth and your gums bleed easily, this could be because of a vitamin C deficiency. 

**Vitamin C deficiency causes:**

• You could have high levels of insulin 

• You’re taking certain antibiotics 

• You’re not getting enough vitamin C from your diet

## What Is A Reactive Hypoglycemia

# What is a reactive hypoglycemia?

I explain what reactive hypoglycemia is and why you need to understand it. There’s a condition called postprandial hypoglycemia which is different; it’s the low blood sugar that happens anywhere from immediately to four hours after a meal, especially a high carb one.

Your body tries to keep your blood sugar tightly controlled; not too high, not too low. Insulin is the hormone that tries to reduce your blood sugar. There are other hormones releasing sugar back into your blood to ensure your blood glucose doesn’t go too low.

Too low and you could experience these symptoms: tiredness, brain fog, dizziness, craving sweets, or even a coma if it goes badly low. With hypoglycemia, the insulin overreacts and pushes the blood sugar down with too much force and/or not enough adrenal support so your cortisol is low.

If you have a liver problem and your body doesn’t have enough of the hormone called IGF to counter the insulin. Or there’s another hormone produced by the pancreas called glucagon which also counters insulin.

Sometimes the medical profession doesn’t acknowledge that hypoglycemia exists. There are levels of hypoglycemia. You can’t just test fasting glucose, you have to test blood sugar at one-hour intervals for four hours after a meal. I don’t even think the test is valid because you drink a glucose mixture. Ideally your blood sugar is below 70. But even if it’s 75 or 80 and you have hypoglycemia symptoms, you could have severe insulin resistance. Because insulin controls the input of glucose into your cells, your cells could be starving for glucose yet your blood sugar tests at a normal level.

I agree that the best diet for hypoglycemia emphasizes healthy fats and protein. But it’s really as simple as cutting out carbs. I guarantee if you stop eating carbs and adapt to fat burning your blood sugar will come out nicely and you won’t have hypoglycemic symptoms anymore. Our bodies aren’t designed to run off of high carbohydrate diets. Some experts advise frequent small meals to heal longstanding hypoglycemia. I disagree. Every time you eat you stimulate insulin. If you eat less frequently you’ll keep insulin low. Without high insulin your blood sugar will be level.

## What Are Amino Acids And What Is Their Significance In Biological Processes

# What are amino acids, and what is their significance in biological processes?

Amino acids are the building blocks of proteins. Amino acids come in chains, which make up different types of proteins.

When you consume protein, your body breaks it down using acid and enzymes. This turns them into small amino acid particles.

Once your digestive system has broken down the proteins into amino acids, your body uses them to create many types of structures, including:

• Genes

• Blood

• Tissue

• Muscles

• Collagen

• Neurotransmitters

• Hormones

• Skin

• Hair

• Organs

• Enzymes

• Antibodies

There are simple proteins that are made from a handful of amino acids, and there are complex proteins that are made up of thousands of amino acids. Certain genes will act as "instructions" for assembling these amino acids into various structures.

Amino acids are needed to make over 50,000 different combinations. Amino acids are different from proteins and fats because they have an extra nitrogen molecule connected to them. This allows them to build and repair tissue. When you’re under stress, you need more amino acids to repair stress-related damage., Amino acids control your hunger, mood, emotions, sleep quality, and much, much more. There are essential amino acids and non-essential amino acids. Essential amino acids are ones that your body can’t create on its own—you must get these from your diet.

Eggs are the best source of amino acids. 3 to 6 ounces of protein per meal is optimal for your amino acid intake.

## What Are The Underlying Causes Of Leaky Gut Syndrome

# What are the underlying causes of leaky gut syndrome?

Leaky gut is a digestive condition in which bacteria and toxins are able to “leak” through the intestinal wall. This condition can create food sensitivities and an immune system response, causing discomfort and inflammation. This is basically a scurvy in the colon.

**Symptoms:**

- Chronic diarrhea, constipation, or bloating

- Food sensitivities

- Scar tissue in the colon

- Nutritional deficiencies

- Fatigue

- Headaches

- Confusion

- Difficulty concentrating

- Skin problems

- Joint pain

- Widespread inflammation

**Cause #1: Vitamin C deficiency**

A lack of vitamin C can cause a loss of collagen in the lining of the intestines, opening gaps in the intestinal walls that allow undigested proteins or harmful bacteria to enter the intestinal cavity. So you have leaks that go into the blood vessels and that creates an immune reaction or food sensitivities.

**Remedies:**

- Take natural vitamin C complex (not ascorbic acid)

- Consume the following foods with bioflavonoid (the component of vitamin C that helps with leaky gut):

    - sprouted buckwheat

    - quercetin

    - parsley

    - onions

    - green tea

    - citrus

    - cruciferous vegetables

- Avoid things that will deplete you of vitamin C:

    - smoking

    - carbs and sweets

    - snacking

(Note: If you try the above remedies, consuming natural vitamin C complex and the foods above, and leaky gut does not resolve, the issue can be insulin resistance in the body. When you have insulin resistance, vitamin C is depleted by the high level of insulin produced in the body. In this case you should do a Healthy Keto® diet and intermittent fasting plan.)

**Other causes:**

- Insulin resistance

## I Cant Get My Ketone Levels High Enough  What Should I Do

# I can’t get my ketone levels high enough – what should I do?

Here are five things you need to know when increasing your ketone levels.

- It takes time – If you just started on keto, you will need to give it some time before you fully switch over to ketosis. Your mitochondria do not fully adapt to ketosis right away. It can take around one month to become fully keto-adapted.

- Use the right test – Testing your ketones can be a great way to figure out where you are in your keto-adaptation. First, you can use urine ketone tests. However, as your body adapts to ketosis, it will naturally become more efficient at burning ketones, leaving you with little to no ketones in your urine. At this point, you want to use a blood ketone test.

- Keep your protein intake in check – Having more than 8 oz of protein per meal may spike your insulin levels high enough to slow down ketosis. Make sure you increase your fat-to- protein ratio and have around 3 to 6 oz of protein per meal. Sausage, olives, olive oil, fatty fish, fatty cheese, pecans, macadamia nuts, butter, cod liver oil, stew and sardines are great foods for increasing your fat-to-protein ratio.

- Stress – High stress levels can have effects similar to sugar. Stress can trigger cortisol and lower your ketones.

- Lack of sleep – Not getting enough high-quality sleep can throw off your blood sugar levels and limit your ability to get into ketosis.

## What Is The Difference Between Keto And Atkins

# What is the difference between keto and Atkins?

Here are some of the characteristics of the Atkins diet:

1\. The Atkins diet only recommends 1 to 3 cups of vegetables per day. This is way too low; it can cause a fatty liver.

2\. If you are not hungry, add a protein snack – bad advice because this will stimulate insulin. Protein does increase insulin, which will then cause a lowering of the blood sugars, making you hungry again.

3\. Atkins recommends artificial sweeteners as okay – but most will trigger insulin.

4\. The Atkins diet gives the option of 5 small meals a day. These will trigger insulin release 5 times, knocking you out of fat burning.

5\. Atkins also recommends that you not skip a meal – bad advice because eating in general stimulates insulin. If you’re fasting and burning fat and not hungry why not skip a meal? Your body will then eat its own fat. What do you think you do when you eat breakfast? – You have been fasting all night and you break the fast by eating, hence the name “break-fast.”

6\. The Atkins diet does not put a limit on protein – another bad idea because excess protein blocks fat burning.

## What Is The Difference Between Ketogenic And Paleo Diets

# What is the difference between ketogenic and paleo diets?

A paleo diet is a dietary plan based on foods similar to what might have been eaten during the Paleolithic era, which dates from approximately 2.5 million to 10,000 years ago.

A paleo diet typically includes lean meats, fish, fruits, vegetables, nuts and seeds – foods that in the past could be obtained by hunting and gathering. A paleo diet limits foods that became common when farming emerged about 10,000 years ago. These foods include dairy products, legumes and grains.

Paleo, despite being healthy, allows more carbs from fruit and sweet potato or yams. Paleo also allows you to eat a greater percentage of protein compared to the ketogenic diet, where your only carb source is vegetables and you consume high amounts of fat and moderate amounts of protein.

## What Steps Can I Take To Successfully Return To A Ketogenic Diet

# What steps can I take to successfully return to a ketogenic diet?

To regain consistency on a ketogenic diet, consider the following strategies:

1\. **Maintain a Food Log**: Documenting your meals can help you stay accountable and understand your eating patterns.

2\. **Clarify Your Motivations**: Reflect on your reasons for adopting keto, emphasizing health benefits and the enjoyment of food, including keto-friendly desserts.

3\. **Avoid Cycles of Dietary Change**: Repeatedly switching between diets can confuse your metabolism. Commit to a consistent approach.

4\. **Follow Healthy Keto® Guidelines**: Focus on a diet with moderate protein intake, limit carbohydrates to 10 grams per day if necessary, and ensure a minimum of 75 grams of dietary fat.

5\. **Incorporate Intermittent Fasting**: This practice can enhance metabolic flexibility and support your ketogenic goals.

6\. **Prioritize Sleep**: Adequate rest is essential for metabolic stability.

7\. **Engage in Regular Exercise**: Physical activity contributes to overall health and can aid in maintaining ketosis.

8\. **Manage Stress Levels**: Stress can negatively impact metabolism, so find effective strategies to manage it.

By implementing these practices, you can effectively transition back to a ketogenic lifestyle and enhance your chances of long-term success.

## Will Bulletproof Coffee Block My Autophagy

# Will bulletproof coffee block my autophagy?

If you make bulletproof coffee with small amounts of additives, like 1 tablespoon of mct oil, 1 tablespoon of butter, this should be fine. It may inhibit the autophagy for a little bit, but it will kick back in shortly after.

Now, if you do half-and-half it may cause more difficulty due to some content of carbs and protein.

Autophagy is a state when you are in fasting mode and the body starts repairing and recycling its damaged proteins and microbes; in that state the need for vitamins and nutrients goes way down.

## What Is The Most Effective Diet For Reducing Belly Fat During Menopause

# What is the most effective diet for reducing belly fat during menopause?

The keto diet is the best diet for menopausal women.

During menopause, women experience a sudden loss of ovarian function. With that comes a spike in insulin, which causes belly fat.

When you go through menopause, your insulin is going to be higher and you’ll have insulin resistance. Here’s the Healthy Keto® way to handle it:

- Cut carbs down to 20 to 50 g per day (eat plenty of vegetables though)

- Moderate protein

- Don’t go low-fat

- Intermittent fasting: 3 meals with no snacks (and if you’re not hungry, don’t eat)

Is keto beneficial to menopausal women? Yes. You want to do keto and get into ketosis, especially if you’re going through menopause. Healthy Keto is the healthiest way, and the lowest- stress way, to lose belly fat.

## Why Might Keto Not Be Effective For Me

# Why might Keto not be effective for me?

Healthy Keto® emphasizes a balanced macronutrient approach paired with nutrient-dense foods to optimize various health indicators, including energy levels, skin health, weight loss, cognitive function, inflammation, mood, cravings, and hunger management.

To implement keto effectively, consider the following guidelines:

\- **Avoid Fruits and Snacking**: Minimize intake of high-carb fruits and refrain from snacking between meals.

\- **Eat Only When Hungry**: Focus on true hunger cues rather than eating out of habit.

\- **Prioritize Healthy Fats and Greens**: Ensure that the majority of your diet consists of higher-fat foods and leafy greens.

\- **Incorporate Apple Cider Vinegar**: This can aid digestion and support metabolic health.

Aim for a protein intake of 3 to 6 ounces per meal, with fat comprising approximately 70% of your total caloric intake, and carbohydrates limited to 20 to 50 grams per day. For optimal results, consider combining the ketogenic diet with intermittent fasting, which can further enhance metabolic flexibility and support weight loss goals.

## What Is A Lazy Keto

# What is a lazy keto?

Lazy keto is when you do not count calories or ketones. You primarily focus on counting carbohydrates–and keeping them below 50 grams per day. Lazy keto also involves consuming a moderate amount of protein (roughly 3 to 8 oz per meal) and consuming high amounts of fat (without focusing on the quality of fat).

## What Is Better On Keto Chicken Or Pork

# What is better on keto, chicken or pork?

You would want to consume fattier proteins on a ketogenic diet. If you compare pork and chicken, pork has a higher fat content. However, you can still consume chicken with the skin to supply yourself with healthy fats.

## Do Women Need More Carbs On Keto And Intermittent Fasting

# Do women need more carbs on Keto and Intermittent Fasting?

A lot of women ask because when they eat carbohydrates, they feel better. You might be one of them. So it seems logical to conclude you need carbs. When you’re intermittent fasting but not yet keto-adapted, and your blood sugar drops, your brain function takes a hit. You may feel moody, irritable, and have brain fog. Then you eat carbs, and you feel so much better.

But what’s really going on is that your body isn’t responding to insulin correctly. You have insulin resistance. In response, your pancreas makes several times more insulin than is healthy. The combination of high insulin and intermittent fasting crashes your blood sugar, and you feel terrible.

**The solution is to fix the insulin resistance and get your insulin levels normal, not eat more carbs. You heal insulin resistance by keeping carbs low, and by fasting. Once you fully adapt to fat for fuel, your brain will no longer need carbohydrates to function well.
**
It takes time to teach your body to burn fat and be in ketosis. Eating certain foods and easing into intermittent fasting will help you feel better. Give your brain time to adapt to fat burning. If you still get symptoms like brain fog and irritability, add more protein instead of carbohydrates.

**My answer is no, women don’t need more carbs on keto and intermittent fasting. You just need to fully understand what’s happening within your body. Then move gradually into the keto diet and intermittent fasting.**

## What Is The Fasting Mimicking Diet

# What is the fasting mimicking diet?

**FMD, developed by Valter Longo, is a diet where you basically consume 800 calories for five days and then go back to regular eating for the rest of the month. This will be done for 3 months. Problems with the Fasting Mimicking Diet program will also be tackled.**

**Fasting Mimicking Diet (FMD)**

Macros: • 9%

Protein • 44%

Fat • 47% Carbs

**Diet Foods:**

• Vegetables Soup

• Energy Drink

• Energy Bar

• Chip Snack

• Tea

• Supplement

**Problem with Fasting Mimicking Diet (FMD):**

1\. Overpriced

2\. Contains sugar – low-quality foods that stimulate insulin

3\. Low-calorie diet – It is not fasting but it is a fasting-mimicking program.

## Can Intermittent Fasting Reverse A Poor Age Related Memory Loss

# Can intermittent fasting reverse a poor age-related memory loss?

**Age-related memory loss is not normal.** You can improve memory loss, and if it’s not too far gone, you may even be able to reverse poor memory. The key to getting memory, focus, and concentration back is to understand the basic problem and the different factors that relate to it. 

Certain areas in the brain make insulin. These areas are also the same areas that are involved with memory problems that are related to diseases like Alzheimer’s. 

**Areas of the brain that make insulin:**

• Hippocampus – memory, and learning 

• Prefrontal Cortex — short term memory, planning, decision making, goals, differentiating good and bad, trivial vs. important, consequences, selective attention 

• Olfactory Bulb – Sense of smell

If there’s too much insulin, the body protects itself by developing insulin resistance around the blood-brain barrier. After that, the body may start to develop amyloid plaques. Amyloid plaque is a type of protein that sticks together, making the protein unusable and difficult to leave the body. 

**Fasting is one of the most powerful things you can do to avoid amyloid plaques. Starting at 16 hours of fasting, the body starts the process of autophagy (the body starts eating up damaged and misfolded proteins that turn into amyloid plaque).**  

**Action steps for those with Alzheimer’s disease or memory loss signs:**

• Get on healthy keto

• Start fasting

• Take MCT oil

• Take exogenous ketones

## What Are The Intermittent Fasting Patterns For Different Body Situations

# What are the intermittent fasting patterns for different body situations?

**1\. Growth hormone**

This is an anti-aging hormone that helps burn fat and preserve muscle. Fasting, exercise, and sleep can spike growth hormone.

• Increases at 12+ hrs.

**2\. Autophagy**

This is a condition where your body is recycling damaged proteins and clearing out microbes.

• Increases at 18+ hrs.

**3\. Inflammation**

You can really see a drop in inflammation when you do OMAD (one meal a day). This also applies to sickness and speeding up the recovery process.

• A drop in inflammation may happen at 23+ hrs.

**4\. Cancer**

With cancer, consider doing OMAD with periodic prolonged fasting. This helps lower glucose and glutamine. Also, when you do eat, consume a lot of cruciferous vegetables.

• These effects may happen after 23+ hrs.

**5\. Stem cell**

This is a cell that hasn’t turned into anything yet. When you do a periodic fast for 72 hours, you’re going to stimulate some stem cells. This can help build new tissue.

• These effects may happen after 72+ hrs.

**6\. Stubborn weight**

If you have a really stubborn weight situation, consider doing OMAD every other day. Make sure you’re getting your nutrients.

• For stubborn weight, try eating one meal every 48 hours.

**7\. Diabetes**

This is a problem with excess sugar. With diabetes, you can really help the blood sugar situation with fasting. The problem is that you must check your blood sugars routinely, and talk to your doctor about adjusting your medications. Check with your doctor and fast gradually.

## When Should I Exercise During Fasting

# When should I exercise during fasting?

Typically a big mistake people make is adding too many things like keto, intermittent fasting, and exercise too fast. Maybe they’re trying to go to two meals a day right away and are exercising on top of that. This could be too much too soon.

A good indicator to know if you’re ready for exercise is how you feel when you start to exercise.

You may not want to do things like cardio or interval training early in the morning if you’re fasting. You could deplete your glycogen reserve, and if you’re not adapted, you’re going to get really hungry. You may want to exercise just before your meal, in-between your first and second meal, or just after your last meal. Some people may benefit from adding more protein to their diet when they workout.

Some people may also need to add a meal when they work out if they are too hungry and haven’t fully adapted yet. Another thing that may help is creatine. Creatine could potentially help improve recovery and increase muscle mass. Creatine doesn’t have to be taken with a meal.

## What Are The Different Stages Of Fasting

# What are the different stages of fasting?

**Dr. Berg Nutritionals does not encourage prolonged fasting. We are not healthcare professionals equipped with the tests and facilities to perform the necessary monitoring during a prolonged fast, nor do we have an individual's medical health records. Dr. Berg Advisors provides this document based on Dr. Berg's education for informational purposes only to those already on a prolonged fast or independently choosing to do one.**

**Always consult with your healthcare provider before starting a prolonged fast. If you're considering prolonged fasting, discussing the benefits and risks with your healthcare provider is essential.**

The six stages of fasting:

Stage 1: 8-14 hours

• Stable blood sugar levels

• Using up stored sugar and sugar in the blood

• At 10 hours—the muscles use about 50% glucose and 50% fat (you’re starting to transition to fat-burning)

Stage 2: 14-24 hours

• Starting to get into ketosis

• Fewer cravings

• More energy

• Improved mood

• Improved cognitive function

Stage 3: 24-36 hours

• Full ketosis and fat burning

• The liver is making ketones

• Decreased appetite

• Decreased ghrelin

• Increased BDNF (new brain cells)

Stage 4: 36-48 hours

• Autophagy

• Kill cancer cells

• Decreased oxidative stress

• Decreased misfolded proteins

• Increased memory

Stage 5: 48-60 hours

• Insulin sensitivity super boost

• More autophagy

• Less inflammation

• Atrophy healing

• Protein sparing

Stage 6: 60-72 hours

• Immune system regeneration

• Spike in immune stem cells

• A 2014 study demonstrated that a 72 hour fast led to a complete rejuvenation of the immune system, and people on chemotherapy had less damage

## Im Losing Weight So Slowly   What Can I Do About It

# I'm losing weight so slowly - what can I do about it?

There’s a big difference between not losing any weight and losing weight slowly—and the actions you need to take for each will be entirely different. If you’re not experiencing any weight loss, you have to make a big change.

There’s something affecting your weight loss, and it could be related to your thyroid, adrenals, kidneys, and other parts of your body. To figure out what’s behind this issue, you have to dig deeper and do some testing. If you are experiencing some weight loss, you don’t want to make any huge changes. Instead, you want to strengthen your successful weight loss efforts.

Start by looking at the quality and quantity of your foods. Make sure you’re having moderate amounts of protein, plenty of healthy fats (avoid vegetable oils!), and very low amounts of carbohydrates and sugars (only get your carbs from low-carb vegetables). Avoid snacking. You should only eat 1-3 times a day. Intermittent fasting is a fantastic way to support a healthy body and avoid insulin spikes that block weight loss.

Problems with your sleep, digestion, or mensural cycle may also slow down weight loss. Insulin and Glucose Support is a great supplement for promoting weight loss if you have insulin issues.

## What Is The Difference Between Zero Carb And Low Carb Diets

# What is the difference between zero-carb and low-carb diets?

It is the carbohydrates that determine whether you would get into ketosis or not. The higher the carbs, the less the ketosis, and the lesser the carb, the deeper the ketosis and ketosis is fat burning. The insulin index is the scale of foods that are non-carbohydrates in nature (like fat and protein) that has the capacity to influence insulin. The glycemic index is the scale of carbohydrates that affect blood sugars.

**Zero Carbs Foods:**

• Meat

• Fish

• Sea Foods

• Sardines

• Butter

• Coconut Oil

• Olive oil

• Whole cream (Heavy)

• Coffee

• MCT oil

**Low Carbs Foods:**

• Egg

• Veggies

• Half and Half

• Hummus

• Berries

• Lemon Juice

• Nuts

• Seeds

• Sour Cream

• Whey Protein

• Olives

• Avocado

## Im Not Losing Weight On Keto What Am I Doing Wrong

# I'm not losing weight on Keto, what am I doing wrong?

\### Key Tips for Succeeding on the Keto Diet

1\. **Focus on Fat, Not Carbs**: Your body burns fat only when glucose is absent. Avoid hidden carbs like maltodextrin and tapioca starch. Aim for less than 10 grams of carbs per day.

2\. **Mind Your Eating Habits**: Eating too frequently, consuming sugar alcohols, certain nuts, cheese, or specific vegetables can cause bloating and constipation. Snacking spikes insulin, leading to belly fat. Consider intermittent fasting to reduce insulin spikes.

3\. **Adjust for Age and Metabolism**: People over 40 may benefit from eating one meal a day (OMAD) due to a slower metabolism.

4\. **Understand Menopause and Metabolism**: During menopause, cortisol spikes can cause muscle atrophy, which may appear as fat. Keto helps rebuild muscle and heal insulin resistance over time.

5\. **Moderate Protein Intake**: Too much protein can raise insulin levels. Aim for 3-6 ounces per meal, up to 8 ounces if very active.

6\. **Prioritize Health Over Weight Loss**: Focus on overall health improvements, like increased energy, better cognitive function, and improved sleep, to support weight loss and well-being.

By following these guidelines, you'll not only enhance your chances of weight loss but also enjoy various health benefits on the keto diet.

## What Do I Do If I Dont Feel Satisfied After Eating On Keto

# What do I do if I don't feel satisfied after eating on Keto?

There are usually two reasons. Either you’re still having a problem with insulin resistance, or you have a gallbladder issue and aren’t releasing enough bile. If it’s low bile, my gallbladder formula may help.

Typically, though, people have a problem with insulin resistance. With insulin resistance, insulin isn’t connecting to the cell, and you’re unable to absorb nutrients, amino acids, and fuel. You might have to give it more time, but let’s make sure you’re doing keto correctly. You need a lot of vegetables. You don’t want to add carbs, or too much protein, because otherwise, you’ll prolong the insulin resistance.

But you can increase your fat intake. I love pecans; they’re the fattiest nut. Take a handful, and another if you need to until you feel satisfied. Nut butters are great with celery or maybe even carrots. The cheese is good too. Brie is a fatty cheese that will help satisfy you.

Apple cider vinegar is good to consume with a meal. It will help with insulin resistance. I like to consume salad or vegetables first, then protein, then fat. Mainly, give keto and intermittent fasting more time. If you have had a big problem with insulin resistance, it will take a while to heal it. As you do keto correctly, and give it more time, you’re going to start feeling more satisfied. I know keto and intermittent fasting will help you, which is why I urge you to be patient in order to get the outcome you want.

## Whats The Difference Between Lazy And Dirty Keto

# What's the difference between lazy and dirty keto?

**Lazy keto** - Lazy keto is when you do not count calories or ketones. You primarily focus on counting carbohydrates—and keeping them below 50 grams per day. Lazy keto also involves consuming a moderate amount of protein (roughly 3-8 oz per meal) and consuming high amounts of fat (without focusing on the quality of fat).

**Dirty keto** \- Dirty keto completely ignores the quality of your nutrients. Those who do dirty keto often eat at fast-food restaurants and consume processed cheese and meats. Dirty keto may also include a lot of MSG, low-nutrient foods, non-organic ingredients, high amounts of omega-6 fatty acids, and trans fats. On dirty keto, you might consume a heavily-processed fast-food burger without the bun, which—although keto-friendly—contains a lot of unhealthy ingredients. Overall, the difference between lazy keto and dirty keto is that dirty keto doesn’t focus on the quality of food at all. Those on dirty keto may consume some very unhealthy foods.

## What Is The Main Cause Of High Blood Glucose Levels When I Am In Ketosis

# What is the main cause of high blood glucose levels when I am in ketosis?

When you do a healthy ketogenic plan and intermittent fasting, you are lowering insulin levels. Insulin suppresses blood sugars but insulin resistance ma still be an issue your body is dealing with. Lower amounts of insulin and insulin resistance cause the blood sugar to spike a little bit higher while you are still in ketosis. In addition, high blood sugar on keto can be caused by excessive protein, too many carbs, frequent meals, or high stress levels.

## Does Multi Collagen Peptide Supplement Have Daily Value Protein

# Does Multi Collagen Peptide supplement have daily value protein?

Multi Collagen Protein does not have a (%DV) daily value for protein for the following reasons:

- This is because collagen peptides do not have all the amino acids to create a complete protein. Therefore, we are not able to list a daily value.  Tryptophan is the missing amino acid from all collagen peptides, not just our product.

- The amino acid profile listed on the packaging is a General/Typical Amino Acid Profile.  Each batch will not have the exact amount of amino acids and will not be listed on a Certificate of Analysis.  These amounts have been tested from the initial batch, and subsequent batches will have a similar but not exact profile.

## What Brand Of L Lysine Does Dr. Berg Recommend

# What brand of L-Lysine does Dr. Berg recommend?

## L-Lysine: A Powerful Amino Acid for Viral Support and Hair Health

While Dr. Berg doesn't have a specific brand recommendation for **L-Lysine**, this essential amino acid is highly beneficial, especially for those managing **herpes (Type 1 or 2)** and **shingles viruses**, and even for **hair health**.

**L-Lysine for Viral Management:**

Herpes and shingles viruses often flare up after significant stress. These viruses rely on another amino acid, **arginine**, to reproduce. L-lysine works by **blocking arginine**, effectively stopping the replication of these viruses and potentially helping to put them into remission.

- **During an outbreak:** For intense conditions, a dosage of **3,000 mg of L-lysine** may be recommended.

- **For prevention:** A much smaller, preventative amount can be taken regularly.

- **Dietary considerations:** To further support your body, focus on consuming foods high in L-lysine while trying to limit foods high in arginine.

**L-Lysine for Hair Growth and Strength:**

Hair is primarily made of protein, which is composed of amino acids. L-lysine is a specific amino acid that can **significantly impact hair growth**, making it stronger and more elastic.

**Tips When Purchasing L-Lysine:**

When you're looking to buy an L-lysine supplement, here are a few tips to consider:

1. **Form:** Look for L-lysine in its free-form, which is easily absorbed by the body.

2. **Purity:** Choose products with minimal fillers and artificial ingredients. Reputable brands will often list their "other ingredients" clearly.

3. **Dosage:** Check the per-serving dosage to ensure it aligns with your needs (e.g., if you're aiming for 1000-3000mg, see how many capsules or tablets that requires).

4. **Certifications:** While not always necessary, third-party certifications can indicate quality and purity.

5. **Reviews:** Look at customer reviews from various sources to gauge product effectiveness and satisfaction.

6. **"L-" prefix:** Ensure it's specifically "L-Lysine" as this is the biologically active form the body uses.

## Can You Get A Significant Collagen Amount From Beef And Eggs

# Can you get a significant collagen amount from beef and eggs?

Many people mistakenly believe they get enough collagen from eating steak, meat, or eggs. The truth is, while collagen is a major protein in the body (about 30% of total protein), dietary sources are limited to things like bone broth, animal skins, pork rinds, and gelatin. Muscle meat alone doesn't provide it.

Collagen is essential for connective tissues – tendons, ligaments, muscles, and fascia – and contributes to skin structure (reducing sagging/wrinkles) and bone elasticity. It's key for healing and particularly important as we age.

Recognizing the difficulty in getting sufficient collagen from diet alone, we offer a collagen product called Multi Collagen Peptide. It features multiple types of collagen along with vital cofactors like natural Vitamin C, formulated to provide comprehensive support for your body's collagen needs.

## The Truth About This Healthy Food

# The Truth About This "Healthy" Food

It's true that gluten can be problematic, but it's not the only protein humans struggle to digest. And while excessive gluten intake can contribute to gut inflammation, it's important to remember that **"gluten-free" doesn't automatically equal "healthy."**

Many processed gluten-free foods are packed with refined sugars, starches, and unhealthy seed oils, which can be just as damaging to your gut as gluten. These ingredients feed harmful bacteria, leading to imbalances that can trigger inflammation throughout the body and contribute to issues like fatty liver and skin problems.

Furthermore, the process of removing gluten from grains often involves harsh chemicals and results in a highly refined product that lacks essential nutrients. This can lead to overeating, nutrient deficiencies, and further gut imbalances like SIBO (Small Intestinal Bacterial Overgrowth) and leaky gut.

Since gut health is closely linked to mental well-being, these issues can also manifest as mood swings, low energy, anxiety, and depression.

**Instead of relying on processed gluten-free products, prioritize whole foods like:**

- **Meat and poultry:** Excellent sources of protein and nutrients.

- **Vegetables:** Provide fiber and essential vitamins and minerals.

- **Healthy fats:** Avocado, olive oil, coconut oil, etc., support gut health.

**If you find that certain vegetables worsen your gut symptoms, you could explore approaches like the carnivore diet temporarily to help reduce inflammation and identify trigger foods.**

**Remember to always read ingredient labels carefully and choose whole, unprocessed foods whenever possible.**

## What Should I Do For Severe Gut Problems

# What should I do for severe gut problems?

I believe the best diet includes both meat and plants. But I understand that some people can't consume vegetables. Let's talk about how to support healthy digestion if you can't consume vegetable fiber. The worst type of diet is the one that many humans consume. This diet is technically an omnivore diet, but the plant products are really mostly grain products, and grain products can lead to gut damage. Gut damage can make it difficult to consume foods with fiber, like salad.

One of the benefits of fiber is that it feeds your microbiome. Your microbiome has many different functions, including fermentation. During the fermentation process, the microbes make small-chain fatty acids, vitamins, other acids, and secondary compounds that support the immune system.

But, if your microbes don't have access to fiber, they can consume other things. If someone is on a carnivore diet, their microbes can adapt to digest protein. You're not going to kill your microbes if you avoid plants. The important thing is to avoid grains. While some people have difficulty consuming any vegetables, other people may be able to consume fermented vegetables. This includes foods like sauerkraut, kimchi, and pickled vegetables.

Fermented vegetables have additional microbes that may help support your gut. They also have prebiotics, vitamins, and other health benefits.

**Tips to support your microbiome and overall gut health:**

1\. If you consume animal products, consume grass-fed, grass-finished animal products.

2\. If you are vegan or vegetarian, don't consume grains.

3\. If you have severe gut problems, try a carnivore diet with grass-fed, grass-finished animal products.

4\. If you have less severe problems with digestion, try consuming fermented vegetables along with grass-fed, grass-finished animal products.

5\. If you don't have any digestive problems, try consuming a combination of plants (not grains) and grass-fed, grass-finished animal products.

## Why Having Low Ldl Shouldnt Always Be A Goal When Losing Weight

# Why having low LDL shouldn't always be a goal when losing weight?

**LDL Cholesterol: The Misunderstood Superhero of Your Body**

LDL cholesterol, often labeled as "bad cholesterol," isn't as simple as it seems. It's a crucial lipoprotein that transports fats and vitamins throughout your bloodstream, acting as a delivery truck for essential nutrients. While it can become harmful when oxidized, its primary role is to aid in artery healing.

**The Role of Lipoproteins**

Lipoproteins like VLDL and LDL are protein shells that carry fats through your blood. VLDL delivers fats and vitamins, transforming into LDL as it unloads its cargo. LDL then continues the journey, transporting cholesterol to cells and aiding in repair processes.

**LDL's Healing Properties**

Contrary to popular belief, LDL cholesterol is instrumental in healing injured arteries. However, when there's an excess of LDL, this healing process can go into overdrive, leading to plaque formation.

**The Dangers of Oxidized LDL**

The real troublemaker is oxidized LDL, which occurs when LDL reacts with oxygen. This oxidized form triggers inflammation and contributes to artery-clogging plaques. Factors like high insulin levels, often caused by excessive sugar intake and insulin resistance, can promote LDL oxidation.

**Managing Cholesterol for Heart Health**

Maintaining healthy cholesterol levels involves a multifaceted approach:

- **Dietary Choices:** Focus on whole foods low in processed ingredients, high in fiber, healthy fats, and antioxidants. Examples include leafy greens, nuts, seeds, fatty fish, and whole grains.

- **Physical Activity:** Aim for at least 150 minutes of moderate aerobic exercise and incorporate strength training each week. Even small bursts of activity can benefit your heart health.

**Risk Factors for High LDL Cholesterol**

Several factors contribute to high LDL cholesterol levels:

- **Genetic Factors:** Conditions like familial hypercholesterolemia can cause high LDL from an early age.

- **Lifestyle Factors:** Unhealthy eating habits, lack of exercise, smoking, excessive alcohol consumption, and chronic stress can all elevate LDL levels.

**LDL and Metabolic Syndrome**

Understanding LDL's role in metabolic syndrome is crucial. This condition involves a cluster of risk factors, including high LDL, which increases the risk of heart disease, stroke, and diabetes. Managing LDL levels is vital for preventing and addressing metabolic syndrome.

**Conclusion**

LDL cholesterol is more complex than its "bad cholesterol" label suggests. By understanding its vital functions and the factors that contribute to its oxidation, you can make informed decisions to protect your heart health. Remember, maintaining a healthy lifestyle with a balanced diet and regular exercise is key to keeping your LDL levels in check and reducing the risk of cardiovascular problems.

## What Are The Most Effective Natural Strategies For Managing And Allevi 3A34B4

# What are the most effective natural strategies for managing and alleviating the symptoms associated with a hiatal hernia?

I think the hiatal hernia originally came from a weakness within some of the supporting connective tissue around in your abdomen. And so in that case there's a couple of things that I would look at. I would check your vitamin C because vitamin C deficiency can affect collagen support and strength of collagen itself and the fascia. And then also check the acid in the stomach because many people with hiatal hernia have a low stomach acid and they can't break down the amino acids. So you don't get the benefit of the complete amino acids into the tissues. Taking betaine hydrochloride, maybe five or six before you eat might just help you with that.

In the meantime, there's some great stretch type acupressure type treatments you can do for hiatal hernia. But you have to type in Dr. Berg hiatal hernia for many of the topics that you want to research, because unfortunately, they're ranking now more(22:49) medical sites than alternative sites.

## Whats A Hidden Source Of Heart Attacksstrokes

# What's a hidden source of heart attacks/strokes?

Dr. Thomas Levy's book "Hidden Epidemic" raises concerns about a possible connection between chronic dental infections and heart health. His research suggests a link between bacteria found in root canal-treated teeth and heart issues in some patients.

These types of infections (known as chronic apical periodontitis) don't always show obvious symptoms. They might contribute to inflammation in the body, potentially impacting the heart and other areas like joints.

It's important to note that routine dental X-rays may not always catch these infections. Checking C-reactive protein levels, a marker of inflammation, could provide additional information. Remember, infections can reside in the teeth, gums, jaw, or tonsils.

Oral bacteria can contribute to oxidative stress, which is a risk factor for various health issues. Dental health is crucial for supporting the immune system and overall health. Additionally, consider liposomal vitamin C, an antioxidant that may help lessen oxidative stress.

## Does My Lifestyle Affect Nutrient Absorption In The Body

# Does my lifestyle affect nutrient absorption in the body?

Nutrient absorption is a complex process influenced by diet, medications, supplements, and gut microbiota. Optimizing digestive health is crucial for ensuring your body effectively absorbs the nutrients necessary for well-being.

**Antibiotics and Gut Health:**

While antibiotics are essential for treating bacterial infections, they can disrupt gut microbiota, impairing nutrient absorption. This disruption may lead to digestive issues and nutrient deficiencies. To mitigate this, consider taking a high-quality probiotic supplement during and after antibiotic treatment to restore gut flora balance.

**Efficacy of Vitamin Supplements:**

Vitamin supplements can help address nutritional gaps but may not be as effective as nutrients from whole foods. The synergistic interactions of vitamins, minerals, and other compounds in food enhance their absorption and utilization. If supplements are needed, opt for high-quality, whole food-based options rather than synthetic versions for better absorption.

**Mineral Absorption:**

Mineral supplements are available in elemental and plant-based forms. Elemental minerals, isolated from natural sources, may not be as well absorbed. In contrast, plant-based minerals are naturally chelated to amino acids, enhancing their bioavailability. When choosing mineral supplements, prioritize plant-based options for optimal absorption.

## Is It Possible To Rehabilitate From Stroke

# Is it possible to rehabilitate from stroke?

## **Innovative Stroke Rehabilitation Strategies**

In addition to traditional rehabilitation techniques, some cutting-edge strategies show promise for enhancing stroke recovery. These approaches aim to harness the brain's natural ability to adapt and rewire itself, a process known as neuroplasticity.

### **Acute Intermittent Hypoxia for Brain Tissue Growth**

Acute intermittent hypoxia (AIH) is a novel therapy that involves brief, repeated exposures to low oxygen levels followed by periods of normal oxygen.

This cycle of hypoxia and reoxygenation has been shown to stimulate the release of growth factors in the brain, which can promote the formation of new neural connections.

While more research is needed to fully understand the potential benefits and risks of AIH, early studies suggest that it may be a promising adjunct therapy for stroke rehabilitation, particularly when combined with traditional physical therapy exercises.

### **Strengthening Blood Vessels with Vitamin C Complex**

Maintaining healthy blood vessels is crucial for preventing future strokes and supporting overall brain health. The whole vitamin C complex, which includes various bioflavonoids and co-factors in addition to ascorbic acid, plays a key role in blood vessel integrity.

Vitamin C helps synthesize collagen, a protein that provides structure and strength to blood vessel walls. It also acts as an antioxidant, protecting blood vessels from damage caused by free radicals.

Incorporating vitamin C-rich foods and supplements into your diet may help support healthy blood pressure levels and reduce the risk of recurrent strokes.

## Do Frozen Vegetables Have The Same Nutritional Content As Fresh Vegetables

# Do frozen vegetables have the same nutritional content as fresh vegetables?

Slightly lower but there's still a good amount of nutrition in frozen vegetables. So it's definitely better than heating the vegetables too much. When you do freeze drying you retain. And then you take out the water and they do it under low pressures. You preserve almost everything the enzymes, the vitamins, other proteins, and even the microbes that are in that vegetable.

## What Are The Most Effective Strategies And Practices For Supporting An 719518

# What are the most effective strategies and practices for supporting and enhancing the health of your microbiome and overall gut health?

One of the benefits of fiber is that it feeds your microbiome. Your microbiome has many different functions, including fermentation. During the fermentation process, the microbes make small-chain fatty acids, vitamins, other acids, and secondary compounds that support the immune system.

But, if your microbes don't have access to fiber, they can consume other things. If someone is on a carnivore diet, their microbes can adapt to digest protein. You're not going to kill your microbes if you avoid plants. The important thing is to avoid grains. While some people have difficulty consuming any vegetables, other people may be able to consume fermented vegetables. This includes foods like sauerkraut, kimchi, and pickled vegetables.

Fermented vegetables have additional microbes that may help support your gut. They also have prebiotics, vitamins, and other health benefits.

**Tips to support your microbiome and overall gut health:**

1\. If you consume animal products, consume grass-fed, grass-finished animal products.

2\. If you are vegan or vegetarian, don't consume grains.

3\. If you have severe gut problems, try a carnivore diet with grass-fed, grass-finished animal products.

4\. If you have less severe problems with digestion, try consuming fermented vegetables along with grass-fed, grass-finished animal products.

5\. If you don't have any digestive problems, try consuming a combination of plants (not grains) and grass-fed, grass-finished animal products.

## Is It Advisable To Include Olive Oil In My Diet And What Are The Speci 2Ab752

# Is it advisable to include olive oil in my diet, and what are the specific health benefits associated with its consumption?

**Olive oil is rich in antioxidants and has anti-inflammatory and anti-cancer effects. Olive oil also has incredible effects on certain parts of the body, including:**

• The cardiovascular system

• The nerves and brain

• The skin

• The eyes

Olive oil is a good source of healthy fats and contains vitamins E and K1. However, the real benefits of olive oil occur because of a group of plant chemicals called polyphenols. Polyphenols produce many amazing effects on the body, like helping to prevent complications from chronic disease and oxidative stress.
**It’s crucial to get real olive oil that’s organic.** This is because glyphosate (an herbicide) blocks a plant’s ability to produce amino acids and polyphenols. Glyphosate can also lead to a myriad of other health concerns.

Keep in mind that salads contain polyphenols and other phytonutrients. Plus, adding olive oil to salads helps increase the absorption of phytonutrients.

## Will Nutritional Yeast Break A Fast

# Will nutritional yeast break a fast?

Nutritional yeast will not break a fast as it contains minimal calories and no sugar. It provides amino acids, trace minerals, and B vitamins. In the morning, I often chew three or four nutritional yeast tablets, which, while not the easiest to chew, make me feel good. You can also use the powdered form on salads for a nutty flavor. Nutritional yeast is an excellent source of B vitamins and won't interfere with fasting.

## What Type Of Wheat Is Acceptable To Consume

# What type of wheat is acceptable to consume?

Typical wheat products like bread and pasta are made with the seed, or grain, of the wheat plant. Wheatgrass is the actual plant that the seed grows on. The type of wheatgrass used in wheatgrass juice is at an early stage—usually less than ten days old. I think how healthy wheatgrass is for you depends on what it’s grown on. Wheatgrass grown on soil may be more beneficial than wheatgrass grown in other ways.

**Wheatgrass juice powder may also be more beneficial than wheatgrass powder products. Wheatgrass juice powder is more concentrated because it doesn’t contain any fiber.** One of the advantages of wheatgrass juice powder over wheatgrass powder is that people can consume it even if they can’t consume fiber. Unlike grain, wheatgrass is gluten-free and is low in anti-nutrients, tannins, and oxalates. Wheatgrass juice powder grown on good soil is low-carb and rich in vitamins, minerals, trace minerals, and amino acids.

**However, I consume wheatgrass juice powder for two main reasons:**

1\. 70% of wheatgrass is chlorophyll

2\. It’s rich in phytonutrients

Both chlorophyll and phytonutrients have a wealth of beneficial properties. Research is also being done on using wheatgrass for a genetic type of anemia called thalassemia. Growing your own wheatgrass to make wheatgrass juice is inexpensive and pretty simple. Give it a try!

## Are Insects A Viable Source Of Protein

# Are insects a viable source of protein?

The idea of eating insects by 2050 due to population growth and sustainability concerns is debated. While insects are rich in protein, fat, and carbs, the quantity needed to meet dietary needs could be costly and less nutritious if feeding practices are compromised.

Comparatively, insects fall short of beef in protein and nutritional value. They also carry potential pathogens; studies show high rates of parasites and pathogenic bacteria among edible cricket farms. Additionally, those allergic to shellfish may react to insects due to similar proteins. Chitin in insect exoskeletons acts as an antinutrient, blocking absorption of vitamins A and E.

## What Are The Benefits Of Arginine Supplementation For Muscle Growth Pa Ca5F66

# What are the benefits of arginine supplementation for muscle growth, particularly regarding muscle protein synthesis and performance?

Introducing another powerful player in the muscle-building game – [Arginine](https://www.drberg.com/blog/10-benefits-of-l-arginine). This amino acid works its magic by boosting growth hormone production, a key factor in muscle repair and development.

It acts like taking the brakes off growth hormone, allowing it to surge through your system and exert its muscle-building effects.

Studies, even in children, have demonstrated the growth-promoting effects of Arginine. Some findings suggest that supplementing with arginine can help increase height.

This growth hormone boost isn't just limited to height; it can translate to increased muscle growth and strength as well.

Incorporating a higher amount of arginine, around 3 to 6 grams daily on an empty stomach, especially 30 minutes before your workout, could provide that extra edge you’ve been searching for.

Arginine is naturally found in foods like red meat, poultry, fish, and dairy products, so ensuring you're getting enough of these protein sources can contribute to your daily arginine intake.

## What Are Some Common Foods Or Habits That Can Unexpectedly Lead To Spi 12E5A4

# What are some common foods or habits that can unexpectedly lead to spikes in blood sugar levels, and how can individuals better manage their glucose response through dietary choices?

Justin Richard, motivated by a family history of type 2 diabetes, decided to take control of his health by exploring the impact of food on his blood sugar levels. Using a continuous glucose monitor (CGM), he discovered how different foods affected him, particularly noticing the energy dips he experienced in his late 40s after consuming certain meals.

Initially, Justin followed his regular diet, which included a lot of processed foods. To his surprise, the CGM revealed how these foods caused significant and prolonged spikes in his blood sugar levels.

Through his experiments, Justin discovered some unexpected truths. He learned that white flour, bread, and even whole wheat bread had similar effects on his blood sugar, with Ezekiel bread being the least impactful. Additionally, he noticed that stress and lack of sleep caused his fasting blood glucose to rise significantly.

To manage his blood sugar levels, Justin adopted several strategies. He began combining carbs with protein, fat, and fiber to slow down digestion and reduce blood sugar spikes. He also found that drinking apple cider vinegar mixed with water before meals had a similar effect.

Justin shares his top tips for making healthier food choices and breaking bad eating habits:

1. Avoid grocery shopping on an empty stomach.

2. Resist the temptation to buy junk food at the store.

3. Take a walk after a large meal.

4. Don't consume sweets after meals or upon waking.

Based on his positive experience, Justin highly recommends the Signos CGM device as a tool for anyone interested in understanding and managing their blood sugar levels.

## What Are The Various Benefits Associated With The Supplementation Of C C5E64F

# What are the various benefits associated with the supplementation of creatine powder, particularly in relation to athletic performance and overall health?

The benefits of creatine powder, as highlighted in the provided context, span across various aspects of health and fitness. Here's a detailed look at the key benefits:

1. **Enhanced Muscle Strength and Power**: Creatine is renowned for its ability to increase the body's capacity to perform high-intensity activities. This is achieved through the recycling of ATP (adenosine triphosphate), which is crucial for muscle contractions. This process supports sustained energy production within muscle cells during short bursts of intense exercise, thereby enhancing overall strength and power.

2. **Promotes Muscle Gain**: Creatine powder draws water into muscle cells, contributing to muscle growth and improved muscle volume. This effect not only aids in achieving a more muscular appearance but also supports the muscle-building process by enhancing the synthesis of proteins that form new muscle fibers.

3. **Faster Exercise Recovery**: Supplementing with creatine has been found to reduce muscle damage and inflammation following intense workouts. By replenishing ATP in muscle cells post-exercise, creatine facilitates more efficient muscle repair and growth. This quicker recovery allows for more frequent and intense training sessions, contributing to better performance and muscle gains over time.

4. **Neuroprotective Effects**: Beyond its muscle-enhancing properties, creatine has shown potential benefits for brain health. It may play a role in the treatment of neurological disorders and support cognitive function due to its ability to increase ATP concentrations in brain tissue. This increase in energy supply can aid in maintaining neuronal health and balanced neurotransmitter levels, which are essential for effective communication between brain cells.

5. **Supports Brain Function**: Creatine's ability to boost ATP production extends to the brain, where it can enhance cognitive function, particularly under conditions of stress or sleep deprivation. This makes creatine beneficial not only for physical performance but also for tasks requiring mental sharpness.

In summary, creatine powder offers a versatile range of benefits, from improving muscle strength and accelerating recovery to potentially supporting brain health. Its role in increasing ATP production is central to its effectiveness in both physical and cognitive domains.

## Are Ketones Toxic Byproducts Or Therapeutic Fuels And What Factors Aff D32011

# Are ketones toxic byproducts or therapeutic fuels, and what factors affect their role in metabolism and health?

A woman asked me how to respond to her doctor, who told her that being in ketosis is life-threatening. This is completely untrue - yet it’s a surprisingly common mistake that medical professionals make. They confuse nutritional ketosis with another condition called diabetic ketoacidosis, which is indeed life-threatening. It happens if you’re a type 1 diabetic who runs out of insulin, which allows your ketone levels to rise to dangerous amounts. But if you’re not a type 1 diabetic, you won’t run out of insulin, and you aren’t at risk for ketoacidosis.

By contrast, you get into ketosis by dropping your carbohydrate consumption. Your body turns its own fat, and the fat you eat, into ketones. Ketones are therapeutic for your body. They aren’t dangerous!

A lot of research is being done on the benefits of ketones for someone with a brain injury. Ketones are a more efficient fuel. They need less oxygen and produce less waste than glucose. They’re neuroprotective; they guard against nerve damage caused by high levels of glucose. When you switch to a ketogenic diet, you can actually recover damaged brain cells. Your energy goes up; your need for sleep decreases; you can actually decrease your blood flow by nearly forty percent.

Being in ketosis can help prevent protein from accumulating in the brain, preventing the amyloid plaques that lead to Alzheimer’s.

A real danger is high levels of glucose, which can cause substantial health problems, including:

• Brain Shrinkage

• Fluid retention

• Memory loss

• Mood disorders

• Oxidative damage

• Glycation

• Fatigue

• Lowered oxygen levels

• Amyloid plaques

See how therapeutic ketones truly are?

## Does Human Growth Hormone Hgh Help With Tightening Loose Skin And If S 704871

# Does Human Growth Hormone (HGH) help with tightening loose skin, and if so, how does it contribute to skin elasticity and firmness?

**HGH is considered the anti-aging hormone. One of its key functions is anything to do with protein: prevention of muscle mass loss, improvement of the collagen surrounding your joints, and providing a healthy glow to your skin.**

Some people actually get it injected, which I don’t recommend because of the side effects. And it’s expensive, about $1,500 per month. Don’t buy it! Your body makes it in the pituitary gland, and activates it through the liver.

**There are a number of things that will decrease your human growth hormone, including:**

● Stress, with its high levels of cortisol

● Sugar

● High levels of insulin, the result of frequent eating, excessive protein, being diabetic or pre-diabetic

● Overtraining, if you’re exercising too much without enough sleep

● Alcohol

**Now, I’ll explain what increases HGH. They include:**

● Exercise, which can trigger a 400 to 700 percent increase. The key is to do short bursts of high intensity training such as sprints or spin bike intervals.

● Intermittent fasting can increase HGH by up to 1,300 percent in women and 2,000 percent in men. It’s the most potent stimulator of human growth hormone.

● Going on keto, because you decrease insulin

● Getting better quality sleep

● Having a healthy liver. If your liver is fatty or you have cirrhosis, that inhibits the production of HGH.

When you take action to stimulate your own human growth hormone, you can help tighten your sagging skin.

## What Strategies Can Be Employed To Effectively Stimulate And Enhance T E5Ff91

# What strategies can be employed to effectively stimulate and enhance the process of autophagy for optimal cellular health and longevity?

Autophagy means “self-eat.” This is the state in which your body begins to recycle damaged proteins and pathogens.

When proteins become damaged, they can wreak havoc on your body. To prevent this harm, your body breaks down damaged proteins with enzymes and creates new healthy proteins.

There are several ways you can promote autophagy naturally:

1\. Fasting - Fasting is a fantastic way to induce autophagy. It’s my opinion that fasting for 16-18 hours is ideal for autophagy—although few studies show an exact length of time for peak autophagy.

2\. Exercise - Exercise is another excellent way to promote autophagy.

3\. Coffee - Drinking coffee may help induce autophagy to some degree. I don’t recommend having much more than one cup of coffee each day. Way too much caffeine will affect your sleep, which can actually reduce autophagy.

4\. Sulforaphane - This compound is a phytochemical that has health-protecting effects, including the ability to induce autophagy. You can get sulforaphane from fresh cruciferous vegetables or cruciferous supplements. You should be consuming plenty of vegetables (7-10 cups) every day.

5\. Green tea (EGCG) - EGCG, or epigallocatechin gallate, is a powerful autophagy-inducing compound found in green tea. Additionally, EGCG is great for reducing inflammation and fighting off cancer cells.

6\. Curcumin - Curcumin is a potent autophagy-promoting compound found in turmeric. Turmeric is often found in Indian foods like curry.

7\. Resveratrol - This compound is primarily found in the skin of black grapes and red wine. Resveratrol has antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and autophagy-promoting properties.

## How Does Cortisol Affect The Body Particularly In Terms Of Protein Met F5F634

# How does cortisol affect the body, particularly in terms of protein metabolism, and what mechanisms lead to protein breakdown and muscle loss during prolonged elevated levels?

High cortisol levels, triggered by stress, significantly impact the breakdown of proteins into amino acids. Cortisol induces a catabolic effect, breaking down muscle protein and diverting amino acids away from muscle absorption. Instead, these amino acids are processed in the liver through deamination, producing ammonia and carbon skeletons.

This process occurs as the body enters survival mode, converting proteins into sugar to meet immediate energy needs. Prolonged high cortisol levels are associated with conditions like autoimmune disease, where the immune system targets healthy tissues. Managing stress to lower cortisol levels is crucial for optimizing protein metabolism and maintaining overall health.

## Why Is Dietary Fat Important

# Why is dietary fat important?

There are several reasons why you need dietary fat for a keto diet.

- Fat helps you fast longer (lowers hunger and cravings)

- Fat supplies you with nutrients (essential fats and fat-soluble vitamins)

- Fat stimulates bile

- Fat triggers healthy hormones

- Fat supplies your body with healthy tissue

- Fat slows the absorption of protein

- Fat helps you maintain your weight

The truth is, you don’t necessarily need to consume more fat on keto. Most of all, you need to lower your carbohydrates. Carbs affect insulin, and insulin blocks ketosis. The key is to lower your carbs.

Ketosis is also not a high-protein diet. You want to consume only a moderate amount of protein: 3 to 8 oz is fine. You also don’t want to consume lean protein – low-fat protein can exacerbate insulin spikes. Always consume full-fat foods.

## What Are Some Examples Of Healthy Keto Meals

# What are some examples of healthy keto meals?

Dr. Eric Berg, the Knowledge DocTM shares with you his own keto eating and intermittent fasting routine. If you’re looking for a sample fasting and keto meal plan, or you’re wondering what to eat on keto, this keto-friendly plan is one that really works for him.

**Intermittent fasting routine:**

- I wake up at 5:00 am, and I go to bed at 10:30 p.m. (with intermittent fasting I need less sleep)

- I try to keep my meals within a 3 to 4 hour window so I have around 20 to 21 hours of fasting

- At 5 a.m. I have a small cup of organic coffee with grass-fed half-and-half or heavy cream and one packet of xylitol

- At 6 a.m. I’ll have around 12 to 16 ounces of water with 1 to 2 ounces of organic lemon juice, and take my vitamins

- I have my first meal between 1 and 3 p.m.

- I have my second meal between 5 and 6 p.m.

**Meal 1 example:**

- 4 pasture-raised organic eggs

- 4 oz of organic bacon

- 3 oz high-quality European organic grass-fed cheese (I like sheep cheese and goat cheese)

- 1⁄4 cup olives

- 1 tomato (in moderate amounts, tomatoes are OK on keto)

**Meal 2 example:**

- A big salad (7 to 10 cups): lettuce, bell pepper, tomato (moderate amounts), cabbage, kale, Parmesan cheese, olive oil, balsamic vinaigrette

- A protein (7 oz): sardines (with bones and skin), shrimp, grass-fed and grass-finished hot dogs, organic grass-fed and grass-finished burger, wild-caught salmon, or steak

- Nuts: pecans or pistachios

## Do I Need A Multivitamin Supplement On Intermittent Fasting

# Do I need a multivitamin supplement on Intermittent Fasting?

When you consume less frequent foods, growth hormone is elevated and this protects you from the loss of protein and helps you get into autophagy, which helps you recycle protein better.

Amino acids are easy to get even if you do one meal a day. Fatty acids are also easy to get on this plan, because your proteins normally already contain the fat. This will also supply the fat soluble vitamins (A,D,E,K) and then we get to vitamins. Vitamins come in two categories, fat-soluble and water-soluble.

The water-soluble vitamins like C and B complex can be gotten from your vegetables and nutritional yeast. Your minerals can also be gotten from your vegetables, but trace minerals are difficult to get. You may want to take some extra sea kelp or seafood to get these.

## Is It A Good Idea To Add Cheat Days Into My Diet Plan

# Is it a good idea to add cheat days into my diet plan?

Some weight loss plans have cheat days built into the program. But this isn’t a good idea because it can severely affect your results. Once you go off of a diet plan, it’s really hard to get back on it. That said, sometimes it can be encouraging to go off keto just to see how much better you feel when you’re on keto and doing it correctly.

The goal is to create enough health and discipline that you can go off of the keto plan very temporarily and then go right back on. The best way to tell if someone is cheating on keto or staying healthy is to look at their A1C. An A1C test measures how much glucose is stuck to the protein in your blood. The more sugar in your body, the higher percentage of your hemoglobin is affected by glucose. You would want your A1C percentage to be below 5.7.

The best way to know that the keto program is working and you’re in ketosis is a loss of appetite. But, all it takes is a very small amount of carbohydrates to take you out of ketosis for a couple of days—even half a glass of wine will have this effect. This means a cheat day will knock you out of the program for a good amount of time. If someone is cheating every other day or every third day, they're not going to make very good progress.

## What Exercises Can Help Me Lose Weight

# What exercises can help me lose weight?

The type of calories you burn depends on your diet and exercise habits. If you consume sugar, you’re going to burn sugar calories. If you consume fat without sugar, you’ll burn fat. Avoid overtraining, which increases cortisol and can deplete protein from your muscles.

Calorie burning largely depends on the health of your mitochondria. Your energy levels, recovery time, and endurance can indicate whether your mitochondria are healthy. Certain medications like statins weaken the mitochondria.

To increase and strengthen your mitochondria, do the following:

• Exercise with adequate rest

• Focus on thyroid health

• Increase muscle mass

• Intermittent fasting

• Cold therapy

• Consume meat

Metabolomics can examine mitochondria to determine whether they’re getting enough fuel. Insulin resistance can destroy mitochondria. Growth hormone can reduce insulin resistance, help you build more muscle, and burn more fat. If your diet is too high in carbs, you won’t be able to burn fat. This is why it’s essential to look beyond calorie burning. Fat burning is only 15% exercise and 85% diet. The type of exercise that will help you burn the most calories is something that is high-intensity and involves as many muscles as possible.

## Are Gluten Free Products Really Gluten Free

# Are gluten-free products really gluten-free?

Gluten is the only protein that humans can not digest. Over the years, we’ve added more and more gluten to the diet, which has increased gut inflammation. Just because a food is gluten-free does not make it healthy! Processed gluten-free foods are loaded with seed oils, sugars, and starches. Gluten can destroy the gut, but so can refined starches and sugars. Good bacteria prefer fiber, but bad bacteria thrive on sugar and starches. Consuming processed gluten-free foods can create an overgrowth of harmful bacteria.

When bad bacteria breaks down and dies, it releases a toxic byproduct that can lead to inflammation in the liver, a fatty liver, and skin issues like dermatitis. Chemicals, enzymes, and acids are used to remove the gluten from the grain in processed gluten-free foods, creating a more highly refined product.

Gluten-free foods are low in protein, which can lead to over-eating. They can also cause SIBO, inflammation, and leaky gut. Gut health directly contributes to your mental health, so this can lead to moodiness, lowered emotions, anxiety, and depression. Read the ingredients in gluten-free products or focus on consuming whole foods like meat and vegetables. If the fiber from vegetables makes things worse, try the carnivore diet for some time.

## Is There A Better Option For Ozempic

# Is there a better option for Ozempic?

Visceral fat surrounds the organs and keeps your body in a state of inflammation, preventing fat loss. Avoid these 6 foods that prevent fat loss.

1\. Low-fat yogurt

Low-fat yogurt is typically high in sugar and often contains industrial food starches like modified food starch, modified corn starch, or maltodextrin. Starch is not sweet, so people consume much more than sugar. It’s higher on the glycemic index than sugar and is used to add bulk to a product.

2\. Processed meat

Hot dogs contain industrial sugars such as corn syrup that will spike blood sugar. Adding sugar to meat creates advanced glycated proteins. Organic grass-fed beef hot dogs are a good option!

3\. Atkins products

These products are marketed as low-carb and keto-friendly but contain very low-quality ingredients such as soy protein isolates, seed oils, GMOs, and synthetic fibers. These can cause bloating and diarrhea and also prevent fat loss.

4\. Juice

Many products marketed as “juice” often only contain minimal amounts of fruit juice and have high amounts of sweeteners, such as high-fructose corn syrup. Juice from concentrate is devoid of nutrients. Fructose found in fruit juice can only be broken down by the liver, which can contribute more to a fatty liver than glucose.

5\. Agave nectar

This sweetener seems healthy but is very high in fructose, which is hard on the liver. Coconut sugar and honey are better options but should be avoided when focusing on fat loss.

6\. Mayonnaise

Processed mayo is mainly composed of soy oil. This type of fat is stored in the fat cells and isn’t burned by the body as quickly as saturated fat. Seed oils like soy oil may be at the root of chronic disease.

## How Breakfast Affects Your Day

# How breakfast affects your day?

What you eat for breakfast affects your ability to focus, your creative ability to solve problems, and how well you sleep at night. A carb-heavy breakfast promotes insulin resistance, which inhibits your ability to absorb fuel. The first place you’ll notice this is in your brain.

Ketones are a much better fuel for your brain than sugar. To make ketones, you need to lower your carbs and sugar. You can also produce ketones by fasting. While fasting, your body must convert to making ketones for energy. Carbohydrate breakfast foods leave you hungry within an hour-and-a-half of eating. Sugary cereal is a poor choice for breakfast. Magic Spoon or keto-friendly granola without added sugar is a better option.

Oatmeal is generally one of the most ultra-processed foods. If you want to eat oatmeal for breakfast, look for regular oatmeal without sugar. The best option for oatmeal is steel-cut oats, although they take longer to cook. Oatmeal and wheat are heavily sprayed with glyphosate, which has been shown to cause cancer and problems with your gut. Choose organic to avoid this problem.

Replacing your breakfast food with protein such as meat, bacon, and eggs can significantly change your energy levels and cognitive function. Eggs and bacon are the perfect healthy morning breakfast. You can also add avocado or cheese. Cheese is very nutritious, a good source of protein, and has good bacteria due to the fermentation process. Yogurt is a great breakfast option. Choose organic Greek or Bulgarian yogurt without added sugar, or make your own yogurt. Instead of giving your kids Wonder bread, try a sprouted bread like Ezekiel bread. Add peanut butter for extra protein. Red meat and pork sausage are also great breakfast foods.

It’s important to prioritize sleep! Losing just one hour of sleep can significantly affect your blood sugar and cognitive state.

## What Are The Physiological And Therapeutic Advantages Associated With  03E85F

# What are the physiological and therapeutic advantages associated with L-Carnitine supplementation?

L-carnitine is an amino acid that transports fat into the mitochondria. Mitochondrias are the energy factories in all of your cells. L-carnitine also handles some of the waste that’s generated from fat that’s being oxidized.

L-carnitine is not just for athletes or people who want to lose weight. The best way to use it is actually for your cardiovascular health. Essentially the heart loves fatty acids. It needs L-carnitine to transport fatty acids into the machinery to burn for its energy.

**Benefits**

- Supports weight loss

- Supports endurance

- Increases energy

- Improves recovery

**Where to get it**

You can get it at a health food or nutrition store, or order it online.

## How Can I Increase Nitric Oxide Levels

# How can I increase nitric oxide levels?

To increase nitric oxide levels, you can consider the following methods based on my knowledge base:

1. **Ginkgo Biloba**:

    - Ginkgo biloba can help improve circulation and blood flow by increasing nitric oxide levels. This allows more oxygen to reach various body parts which have poor circulation.

2. **Dietary Nitrates**:

    - Consuming foods high in nitrates can help boost nitric oxide levels. Some of these foods include:

        - Beets

        - Spinach

        - Kale

        - Other leafy greens

3. **L-Arginine**:

    - L-arginine is an amino acid that helps increase nitric oxide, may improve blood flow, and potentially support increased testosterone levels.

4. **Lifestyle Changes**:

    - Avoiding sugar is recommended as it can damage the inside of the arteries, negatively impacting nitric oxide levels.

5. **Regular Exercise:**

    - Regular physical activity, such as aerobic exercises, can enhance cardiovascular health, leading to better oxygen uptake by cells. This increased blood flow and oxygen delivery can help boost nitric oxide levels in the body.

        - **Aerobic Exercises**: Activities like jogging, cycling, and brisk walking can stimulate nitric oxide production.

        - **Cardiovascular Health**: Improved heart function and blood flow from regular exercise contribute to higher nitric oxide levels.

## How Can I End Seizures

# How can I end seizures?

**Common triggers of seizures:**

• Fever

• Head injury

• Brain infection

• Choking

• Alcohol

• Drug withdrawal

• Extremely low blood sugar

• Drugs

• Toxins

• Stress

• High blood pressure

Data shows that keto is effective in eliminating seizures by a factor of 50 to 70 percent. But it's important to be on the healthy version of the ketogenic diet. The keto diet for epilepsy also includes more fat than protein. Ketones are a byproduct of fat. Fat and ketones are the primary fuel source that our bodies should run on—not glucose. It's also the preferred fuel source of the brain.

**Top potential benefits of ketones for seizures:**

• They have anticonvulsant properties

• They stabilize the excitability of the neurons

• They modulate neurotransmitters

• They support the brain, including the hippocampus

• They increase the hippocampus's mitochondrial biogenesis

• They protect the brain and neurons against oxidative stress

• They increase the ATP in the neurons to allow them to function better

## What Are Some Tips For A Balanced And Nutrient Dense Diet

# What are some tips for a balanced and nutrient-dense diet?

1. Focus on [Nutrient-Dense Foods](https://www.drberg.com/blog/the-most-nutrient-dense-food-in-the-world): Fill your plate with whole, unprocessed foods like vegetables, fruits, healthy fats, and lean protein. These foods naturally provide a greater sense of fullness and support stable blood sugar levels.

2. Listen to Your Body's Signals: Learn to differentiate between true hunger cues and emotional eating. This will help you nourish your body when it genuinely needs it and break free from unhealthy eating patterns.

3. Experiment with [Intermittent Fasting](https://www.drberg.com/blog/intermittent-fasting): If appropriate for you, explore intermittent fasting. This can increase insulin sensitivity and give your digestive system a break, potentially making “moderation” with certain foods more manageable. This doesn't mean you can't enjoy a delicious meal once in a blue moon.

The journey to a healthy relationship with food looks different for everyone.

Incorporating more nutrient-dense whole foods while mindfully approaching those more likely to trigger cravings or blood sugar spikes can create lasting positive change without strict adherence to “everything in moderation."

Always consult a qualified healthcare professional to find a personalized approach that aligns with your unique health needs. Your healthcare provider may even suggest you cut sugar intake or get your sugar fix in a healthy way.

## What Dietary Choices Can Be Beneficial For Individuals With Parkinsons 1D7375

# What dietary choices can be beneficial for individuals with Parkinson’s disease?

There are proteins in the brain that can protect it against the oxidation that can lead to degenerative diseases. But there is also a protein in the brain that inhibits these protective proteins. Fortunately a compound called farnesol can deactivate the protein that inhibits the protective proteins. This allows the protective proteins to help prevent or slow down Parkinson’s disease and other degenerative diseases. Farnesol is in certain types of foods.

The best foods containing farnesol for Parkinson’s disease:

- Berries

- Vegetables (especially tomatoes, which are OK in moderate amounts on keto)

- Herbs (lemongrass, chamomile, rose and musk)

- Essential oils (citronella)

***Please keep in mind that the above information is not a medical advice. You should consult with your doctor first before making any dietary changes.***

## What Are The Most Famous Myths About Healthy Weight Loss

# What are the most famous myths about "healthy" weight loss?

Here are 7 lessons I learned from weight loss failures from my practice of 25 years and working with 40,000 people.

1\. Fruit – Don’t use fruit if you are trying to lose weight and someone who has a slow metabolism. Even small amounts of fruit can block a lot of fat burning.

2\. Snacks – Snacking increases insulin because every time you eat, you trigger insulin. Cutting out snacks creates huge benefits.

3\. 2 weeks – low protein (Liver enhancement) or no protein – would cause a lot of blood sugar issues because our bodies need amino acids to rebuild and repair. Cutting it too low or not enough will cause problems like hair loss, loss of muscle, etc.

4\. “Breakfast is the most important meal of the day” – It screws up and breaks the all-night fasting. Push yourself to eat closer to lunch and not eat until you’re hungry and eventually skip breakfast.

5\. Low Fat (Lean Protein) – Fat is very important to satisfy the appetite to go from one meal to another. It is the only macronutrient that doesn’t trigger insulin – the more pure the fat is, the lower the influence it has on insulin.

6\. History – Clue (Ignoring – Focusing more on diving into the process directly and not ignoring the clues.

7\. Omitting Getting Healthy First – It is not losing weight to get healthy, it is getting healthy first and then losing the weight. Focus on the health indicators: energy level, cravings are gone, stress level better.

## Does The Brain Only Run On Glucose

# Does the brain only run on glucose?

People often have an idea that your body — especially your brain — can only run on glucose. But that’s not true! You can run your body on ketones, which provide about forty to seventy percent of the energy you need. Of course, the question becomes, what kind of fuel makes up the difference?There will always be a small amount of glucose, but your body can run on fatty acids. Fat turns into ketones and fatty acids.

Your brain is a little different; it can use ketones for seventy percent of its fuel, with the rest coming from lactate or glucose. Where will you get the glucose if you don’t want to eat carbohydrates? Your body makes its own in a process called gluconeogenesis. Your body uses fat and protein to make glucose. Certain amino acids in protein turn into glucose, as does a component of fat which breaks down into glycerol, then converts to glucose. Your body can easily get the glucose it needs from fat and protein. You don’t need carbohydrates to supply glucose.

## What Preventive Measures Can Be Taken To Reduce The Risk Of Blood Clot 74D865

# What preventive measures can be taken to reduce the risk of blood clots, strokes, and heart attacks?

Your body constantly forms and dissolves clots as part of its healthy functioning. A clot, called a thrombus, is made up of 96 percent protein and only 4 percent cholesterol. Yet many people believe cholesterol is the culprit, even though consuming cholesterol won’t form clots leading to strokes and heart attacks.

A clot can become a problem when it doesn’t dissolve. Your body produces a compound that blocks your ability to dissolve clots — and when this compound is elevated so too is your risk of a thrombus. Keeping the compound low is key, and can be done by avoiding four specific triggers that elevate it: glucose, insulin, cortisol, and estrogen.

Estrogen as a trigger explains why women who take hormone replacement therapy are at increased risk of a stroke. If you believe saturated fats are the culprit in blood clots, you can be assured they’re not. Saturated fats aren’t one of the triggers of the compound that prevents your body from dissolving clots as it normally would. This is good news if you’re already on or considering going on the keto diet, and were hesitant because you wondered if eating saturated fats might increase your risk of heart attacks and strokes. It won’t.

## What Role Does The Liver Play In The Regulation Of Ldl Cholesterol Levels

# What role does the liver play in the regulation of LDL cholesterol levels?

The liver plays a crucial role in the production and regulation of cholesterol, including LDL (low-density lipoprotein). Here are the key points that explain the correlation between the liver and high LDL:

- **Cholesterol Production**: The liver is responsible for producing about 75% of the body's total cholesterol. This production is influenced by dietary intake, particularly the consumption of fats, especially saturated fats. When you consume more fats, the liver increases the production of LDL cholesterol.

- **Response to Diet**: The liver's production of cholesterol is not random; it responds to what you eat. Higher intake of saturated fats prompts the liver to produce more LDL cholesterol.

- **LDL's Role**: LDL, often labeled as 'bad cholesterol,' has essential functions, such as ferrying cholesterol to arteries for repair and defense against bacterial toxins. However, high levels of LDL can contribute to the buildup of plaques in arteries, leading to atherosclerosis and increasing the risk of cardiovascular diseases.

- **Bile Production**: The liver also produces bile, which is crucial for breaking down fats and managing cholesterol levels. Adequate bile production helps in the proper digestion of fats and prevents the unnecessary buildup of cholesterol.

In summary, the liver's role in cholesterol production and regulation is significant. Dietary choices and liver health directly impact LDL levels, highlighting the importance of maintaining a balanced diet and a healthy liver to manage cholesterol levels effectively.

## Can Following A Ketogenic Diet Lead To High Ldl Cholesterol Levels

# Can following a ketogenic diet lead to high LDL cholesterol levels?

LDL (low-density lipoprotein) serves as a transporter for cholesterol, delivering it where needed, while HDL (high-density lipoprotein) functions as a cholesterol scavenger, returning it to the liver. Cholesterol is essential for bodily functions. On keto, fat cells initially hold onto cholesterol, leading to a temporary spike in LDL. However, over time, stored cholesterol is released and processed. Increased dietary fat on keto can elevate cholesterol levels. LDL comes in two types: Type A (large and harmless) and Type B (small and inflammatory). Keto may promote more Type A LDL. To manage LDL, focus on fiber-rich veggies and moderate fat intake.

## What Foods Should I Avoid If I Have Herpes

# What foods should I avoid if I have herpes?

**Understanding Herpes and Your Diet**

Herpes (type 1 or 2) can be influenced by diet. The goal is to limit foods high in arginine (an amino acid the virus uses) and increase foods high in lysine (which may help suppress outbreaks).

**Foods to Limit or Avoid:**

- **Nuts & Seeds:** Almonds, peanuts, cashews, etc.

- **Berries:** Raspberries, blueberries, strawberries, etc.

- **Grains:** Wheat, oats, rice, etc.

- **Beans & Legumes**

- **Tofu**

- **Gelatin**

- **Eggs**

**Foods to Enjoy:**

- **Meat & Seafood:** Fish, chicken, beef, lamb, etc.

- **Cheese**

- **Vegetables**

- **Sprouts**

**Managing Outbreaks and Prevention:**

- **Take L-Lysine:** If you must eat high-arginine foods, consider taking L-lysine simultaneously. 3,000mg may be helpful during an intense outbreak, otherwise smaller doses for prevention.

- **Manage Other Triggers:** Stress, excessive sun exposure, and a weakened immune system can all contribute to outbreaks.

**Important Note:** Around 95% of adults carry the herpes virus. It can go in and out of remission. Dietary changes may help manage outbreaks, but it's important to understand the broader picture of this common virus.

## What Test Identifies Soft Plaque Ldl Cholesterol

# What test identifies soft plaque LDL cholesterol?

A CAC test gives you a score of how much plaque you have in your arteries. This test primarily detects calcified plaque, so the score usually won’t reflect soft plaque. The CAC paradox is a phenomenon that occurs after you clean up your diet and get healthy, but your CAC score rises. This doesn't mean your plaque is getting worse. It means that some of your soft plaque has stabilized and become hard plaque. Soft plaque is associated with glycation and more oxidation of the LDL. There are 2 types of LDL: small-dense pathogenic LDL and large-buoyant non-pathogenic LDL. **Myeloperoxidase and Lp-PLA2** both signify soft plaque on a blood test. An ultrasound can also detect soft plaque.

Here’s how to determine whether you have small dense LDL or large buoyant LDL. Divide the LDL by ApoB—the part of the lipoprotein that indicates the number of particles. You want your result to be greater than 1.2. This indicates large buoyant LDL.

## Triggers For Enhancing Fat Burning

# Triggers for Enhancing Fat Burning

Boosting Fat Burning: A Comprehensive Approach

**1\. Exercise and Adrenaline**

Intense exercise, especially high-intensity interval training (HIIT), stimulates adrenaline release, activating lipase to break down stored fat into free fatty acids for energy.

**2\. Intermittent Fasting**

Intermittent fasting lowers insulin levels, enhancing the activity of hormone-sensitive lipase and promoting fat breakdown. It also increases growth hormone levels, further supporting fat loss.

**3\. Dietary Impact**

Reducing refined carbohydrates and sugars helps keep insulin levels low, facilitating fat burning. Including protein and healthy fats supports this process. Foods like green tea extract can boost fat oxidation and thermogenesis.

**4\. Hormonal Triggers**

Growth hormone, thyroid hormones, and lipase are key to fat metabolism. Intense exercise, fasting, adequate sleep, and balanced nutrition help regulate these hormones for effective fat burning.

By aligning exercise, diet, and hormonal management, you can turn your body into an efficient fat-burning machine.

## Is The Regular Protein Powder Safe To Consume

# Is the regular protein powder safe to consume?

Maltodextrin, a common ingredient in many protein powders and processed foods, poses several health risks. It has been linked to acne, bloating, gut inflammation, irritability, anxiety, and insomnia due to its addictive nature and impact on dopamine levels.

Moreover, maltodextrin promotes tooth decay, spikes blood sugar more than sugar, and contributes to belly fat, high cholesterol, fatty liver, and other health issues with repeated consumption.

Derived from inedible dent corn through a chemical process, maltodextrin acts as a filler in various products. Classified as a carbohydrate, it functions as a sugar in the body, with a glycemic index exceeding that of glucose and table sugar.

Many protein powders contain a high proportion of maltodextrin compared to protein, leading to excessive carbohydrate intake and increased nutrient requirements.

Ultra-processed foods like maltodextrin trigger oxidation and inflammation, causing significant insulin and blood sugar spikes. This can result in fatigue, low blood sugar, and cravings, perpetuating a cycle that may lead to insulin resistance.

For optimal muscle building, focus on exercise and protein intake rather than consuming high amounts of refined sugar like maltodextrin.

## Does The Nutritional Yeast Flakes Supplement Contain Tyramine

# Does the Nutritional Yeast Flakes supplement contain tyramine?

From the Manufacturer: Nutritional yeast naturally contains the amino acid tyrosine, which can convert into tyramine. However, the level of conversion in our yeast is unknown and likely very low.

Tyramine levels generally increase with longer fermentation processes. Since our nutritional yeast flakes are primarily grown under controlled conditions, the risk of significant tyramine formation is minimal. Additionally, our testing on similar Brewer's yeast products showed either undetectable or very low tyramine levels (< 3 mcg/g).

## Whats The Difference Between Acute And Chronic Inflammation

# What's the difference between acute and chronic inflammation?

### **The Difference Between Acute and Chronic Inflammation**

Acute inflammation is a short-term response to injury or infection. It's a normal part of the healing process and typically lasts a few hours to a few days.

During acute inflammation, your body releases chemicals that cause redness, swelling, heat, and pain in the affected area. This helps protect the area from further damage and promotes healing.

On the other hand, [chronic inflammation](https://www.drberg.com/blog/the-10-root-causes-of-inflammation) is a prolonged inflammatory response that can last for several months to years. It occurs when your body's inflammatory response doesn't shut off, even when there's no injury or infection to fight.

Chronic inflammation can damage healthy cells, tissues, and organs over time. It's been linked to various health conditions, including heart disease, diabetes, cancer, and autoimmune disorders.

### **The Role of Cytokines in Inflammation**

Cytokines are small proteins that play a crucial role in regulating inflammation. They're produced by various cells in your body, including immune cells, and help coordinate the inflammatory response.

One type of cytokine particularly important in chronic inflammation is tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha). TNF-alpha is a pro-inflammatory cytokine that helps activate other immune cells and promotes inflammation.

In healthy individuals, TNF-alpha levels are carefully regulated to ensure inflammation occurs only when needed. However, in people with chronic inflammation, TNF-alpha levels may be persistently elevated, leading to ongoing inflammation and tissue damage.

Research has shown that chronic exposure to high levels of TNF-alpha can contribute to the development of various health problems, including:

- [Rheumatoid arthritis](https://www.drberg.com/blog/the-best-rheumatoid-arthritis-tip)

- [Inflammatory bowel disease](https://www.drberg.com/blog/the-most-common-nutrient-deficiency-in-ibd-inflammatory-bowel-disease)

- [Psoriasis](https://www.drberg.com/blog/a-great-psoriasis-remedy)

- [Cancer](https://www.drberg.com/blog/the-6-foods-that-can-cause-cancer)

- [Depression](https://www.drberg.com/blog/the-root-causes-of-depression)

Interestingly, studies have also found that high blood sugar levels can increase TNF-alpha production in the body. This may partly explain why people with diabetes are at increased risk for chronic inflammation and related health problems.

Managing chronic inflammation often involves targeting cytokines like TNF-alpha. Some medications, such as TNF inhibitors, work by blocking the activity of TNF-alpha and reducing inflammation in the body.

## Is There A Recommended Protocol Or Timeframe For Taking The Multi Coll 825B7A

# Is there a recommended protocol or timeframe for taking the Multi Collagen Peptides?

No, collagen peptides can be taken long-term as part of a healthy diet. They offer support for skin, joints, hair, nails, and the gut, as they provide structural proteins. However, it's important to remember that collagen is not a complete protein because it doesn't contain tryptophan. Therefore, you should also include other whole-food protein sources in your diet to ensure you're getting all essential amino acids.

## Should You Limit Glutamine When You Have Cancer

# Should you limit glutamine when you have cancer?

For Individuals with Cancer, Dr. Berg mentions that cancer cells can consume glutamine, suggesting that if you have cancer, you might need to consider strategies like using a glutamine inhibitor or adjusting your diet. He suggests that intermittent fasting for extended periods and reducing protein intake could be beneficial.

While glutamine is a necessary amino acid for various bodily functions, its consumption or supplementation should be carefully considered in the context of cancer. This implies that direct supplementation with glutamine might not be recommended for cancer patients without careful consideration of their overall dietary and treatment plan.

If you have cancer, **it's essential to consult with your healthcare provider before taking glutamine supplements or making significant changes to your diet, especially regarding glutamine intake**. Dr. Berg's advice highlights the complexity of glutamine's role in the body and the need for a tailored approach to nutrition and supplementation for cancer patients.

## Is Whey Protein Healthy To Consume

# Is whey protein healthy to consume?

Whey protein is a unique type of protein. It's one type of protein in the dairy. It's not casein. And a lot of people take it for bodybuilding and muscle repair and to replace the amino acids. If you look at the bioavailability, it's not on the top of the list. It's kind of lower. But it is very, very, very high on another scale called the insulin index. And those are all the – they don't look for foods that spike your blood sugars like the glycemic index. They're looking for foods that will spike the actual insulin.

And that's what we're trying to really ultimately keep down. On one note, you're going to get a spike of insulin when you take whey. And that may not be a bad thing if you are trying to gain muscle or weight because you also at the same time spike the opposing hormone called glucagon. So it kind of does help to neutralize it to some degree. It's not like eating sugar. But you just have to experiment and see how well your body handles the whey protein. Because it's very low fat, it's a lean protein, that's why it spikes insulin a little bit more than other things, actually a lot more. You may want to try a protein or amino acid that has more fat or add fat with it. Some people do really good on it. A lot of the powders out there, they don't just have the whey protein. They have maltodextrin too.

**Cortisol is a stress hormone that turns protein into sugar. It causes your liver to make new sugar out of non-carbohydrate sources, such as fat, ketones and protein. If your cortisol is really high, your body will make a lot of sugar. This increase in sugar will elevate insulin, and insulin makes belly fat. Consuming a high-carb diet and sugar, or eating too frequently can also cause your insulin to spike, leading to belly fat.** **You'll typically notice belly fat after the liver is already fatty because a lot of the visceral fat around the organs comes from a spill-off of fat from the liver.**

## Is There A Need For Increased Glycine Intake As One Ages And How Does  Fb89Bf

# Is there a need for increased glycine intake as one ages, and how does glycine's role in the body change with age?

**The Role of Glycine in Healthy Aging**

As we age, declining collagen levels contribute to joint pain, stiffness, and changes in skin elasticity. Glycine, a crucial amino acid in collagen production, offers potential benefits for mitigating these effects and supporting overall well-being.

**Supporting Joint Health**

Joint pain and stiffness, common with aging, often result from cartilage breakdown. Glycine supports collagen synthesis, crucial for maintaining the integrity of connective tissues. Research indicates that glycine supplementation may aid individuals with osteoarthritis by promoting cartilage repair and improving joint function.

**Enhancing Sleep Quality**

Older adults frequently face sleep disturbances. Glycine has been shown to enhance sleep quality by promoting deeper, restorative sleep. For those struggling with insomnia or sleep issues, glycine supplementation may offer a safe and effective solution to improve sleep and overall health.

## Can Apple Cider Vinegar Be Beneficial For Managing Symptoms Or Issues  99675D

# Can apple cider vinegar be beneficial for managing symptoms or issues associated with menopause?

Apple cider vinegar may offer some benefits, but its effects are relatively modest. During menopause, increased cortisol levels can lead to the mobilization of proteins and the conversion of these proteins into sugar, potentially contributing to atrophy and other issues. To address these challenges, it's essential to support the adrenal glands alongside maintaining a balanced diet. The adrenal glands take over hormone production once the ovaries cease functioning, so managing stress and supporting adrenal health are crucial for overall well-being during menopause.

## What Are The Most Effective Strategies For Managing And Reducing Alcoh Db599A

# What are the most effective strategies for managing and reducing alcohol cravings?

Glutamine is the most abundant amino acid in the body. Glutamine turns into glutamate, which is the most abundant neurotransmitter in the brain.  L-glutamine increases gluconeogenesis, which is the production of new sugar. This means that this amino acid can quickly turn to sugar and feed your brain cells, but it won’t spike your insulin. 

Both sugar and alcohol can provide a sense of relief to some people. L-glutamine may help provide fuel to the brain and reduce stress, anxiety, and pressure—this may help reduce the need for alcohol and sugar. L-glutamine has many other potential health benefits, as well.  Alcohol consumption can block glutamine and all of the beneficial effects that come with it. 

**Foods rich in glutamine:** 

• Beef 

• Chicken 

• Fish 

• Eggs 

• Dairy 

• Cabbage 

• Dark leafy green vegetables 

**Other things that may help get rid of cravings for alcohol and sugar:** 

• Regular exercise without overtraining 

• Getting enough sleep 

• Reducing stress

• Consuming less alcohol 

• Get on the keto diet and do intermittent fasting

## What Mechanisms Explain Why Fatty Foods May Trigger Diarrhea

# What mechanisms explain why fatty foods may trigger diarrhea?

Fatty foods can sometimes cause diarrhea due to several reasons. One possibility is that they stimulate the release of bile acids, which can speed up digestion and lead to loose stools. It may also be related to individual tolerance levels or specific types of fats. Experiment with different protein sources like shellfish or seafood, and consider adjusting fat intake to see what works best for you. Additionally, incorporating probiotics could help maintain optimal stool consistency over time. If symptoms persist, consulting a healthcare professional is advisable for further guidance.

## How Can I Maintain Weight Loss After Ozempic

# How can I maintain weight loss after Ozempic?

Understanding the benefits and drawbacks of Ozempic is crucial when considering how to manage your weight after stopping this medication.

As a GLP-1 Agonist, Ozempic mimics a hormone in your small intestine that helps regulate insulin levels, control appetite, and slow down gastric emptying. While this can aid in weight loss, it can also lead to adverse side effects.

**These side effects may include:**

• Nutrient deficiency

• Gastroparesis

• Constipation

• Gallbladder problems

• Thyroid tumors and cancer

**To help maintain your weight after Ozempic, it’s crucial to make certain lifestyle changes, such as:**

1\. Follow a ketogenic diet to keep insulin levels low and promote fat-burning.

2\. Do intermittent fasting to control appetite and improve hormone balance.

3\. Incorporate weight training to build and preserve muscle mass.

Additionally, ensuring adequate protein intake is crucial for maintaining muscle mass, especially for those who have already lost a significant amount of muscle while on Ozempic. This can be achieved through consuming bioavailable proteins such as red meat, eggs, and fish. Monitoring your hormone levels and ensuring proper cholesterol intake is also important, as cholesterol is a building block for many hormones, including testosterone and estrogen.

## What Types Of Protein Sources Are Least Likely To Trigger Gout Symptoms

# What types of protein sources are least likely to trigger gout symptoms?

Uric acid, a protein byproduct, can crystallize in joints, causing inflammation, notably in gout. Key points include:

1\. Majority of uric acid (over 60%) originates internally, not from dietary sources.

2\. In gout, the issue lies predominantly in inefficient uric acid elimination by the kidneys, affecting 90% of sufferers.

On ketogenic diets and intermittent fasting:

\- Temporary spikes in uric acid occur during initial adaptation but typically normalize as the body adjusts. Uric acid serves as a potent antioxidant aiding in body healing and cleanup processes.

## Does Looking At Sweets Spike Your Insulin

# Does looking at sweets spike your insulin?

**The answer is no – not in a fasting state.** Looking at sweets and carbs will not cause an insulin spike. The primary triggers of blood sugar are glucose and things that turn into glucose. But, anything you eat has the potential to trigger insulin just for the fact that you ate it. If it’s more carbohydrate, it will trigger your blood sugar more. If it’s less carbohydrate and more fat, it will trigger your blood sugar less.

**Chronic high insulin can lead to insulin resistance. Other triggers that can cause a blood sugar spike:**

• Cortisol – Stress

• GIP

• Protein – especially if it’s low fat

**Common symptoms of insulin resistance**

1\. Can’t go long without eating

2\. Not satisfied

3\. Cravings

4\. Need for snacks

## What Effective Strategies Can Be Employed To Preserve Muscle Mass As One Ages

# What effective strategies can be employed to preserve muscle mass as one ages?

Around age 50, women experience menopause, leading to hormonal shifts, while men undergo similar changes around age 60. These changes can contribute to sarcopenia, or muscle loss, affecting metabolic health.

Estrogen and progesterone decline in women with age, impacting muscle health. Cholesterol, essential for steroid hormone production like testosterone and estrogen, plays a crucial role in muscle maintenance. Low-cholesterol diets and statin drugs can contribute to muscle issues.

To support hormone balance and muscle preservation:

1. Use infrared light, such as sunlight or fire, to boost melatonin production.

2. Regular resistance exercises are vital for muscle maintenance.

3. Ensure adequate intake of animal protein.

4. Include cholesterol-rich foods like meat and dairy in your diet.

5. Consider pregnenolone supplements (30 mg/day for women, 100 mg/day for men).

6. Supplement with DHEA (25 mg/day for women, 100 mg/day for men) to support muscle-building hormones.

## What Are Some Bad Food Combinations

# What are some bad food combinations?

You’ve probably heard about food combining. It’s become popular in various diet programs.

**One combination you definitely want to avoid is protein plus sugar (refined carbohydrates), as well as fat plus sugar. When you combine these, especially when you heat them up, you develop something called AGEs.**

Now, what are AGEs? They are what’s called advanced glycation end products. AGEs plug up circulation in the back of your eyes and can cause macular degeneration. They’re also involved in brain chemistry, stopping the neurons from communicating and contributing to Alzheimer’s and Parkinson's.

AGEs are also involved in the beta cells of your pancreas as well as in diabetes.

In other words, these combinations are terrible! How does this relate to your foods? Let’s say, for example, you eat barbecued ribs. Or anything heated with fat and sugar. Like ice cream! Or anything deep-fried. You have fat with carbohydrates and likely wheat which has the protein called gluten.

All the health complications of diabetes, Alzheimer’s, and Parkinson's involve advanced glycation end products. AGEs create massive oxidation, which essentially is like your body rusting out its arteries, eyes, and kidneys. They age you quickly; your proteins become sticky and brittle.

**You can do these four things to counter the development of AGEs and halt rapid aging:**

1\. Avoid sugar

2\. Consume aged garlic; it’s far more powerful than fresh as an anti-glycation substance

3\. Take carnosine, a combination of two amino acids that’s effective at preventing cataracts

4\. Take benfotiamine, especially if you have diabetes complications such as peripheral neuropathy or impaired vision

## What Are Some Viable Alternatives To Melatonin For Enhancing Sleep Qua 173B47

# What are some viable alternatives to melatonin for enhancing sleep quality and regulating circadian rhythms?

Tryptophan is an amino acid that can help your mood and counter anxiety. Let’s look at the common benefits of consuming tryptophan.

**Benefits**

- Virtually no side effects

- Can act as a natural antidepressant

- Has anxiolytic properties (anti-anxiety)

- Can promote sleep

**How to consume it**

Follow the directions on the label for the proper dosage. However, if you’re on any psychiatric medications, talk to your doctor before substituting with tryptophan, as it has to be a very gradual process. You also don’t want to come off of medication too quickly or add something else to the mix that could create an imbalance.

When you take tryptophan, you always want to take it on an empty stomach. Tryptophan competes with other amino acids. Any time you take tryptophan with another protein, it won’t work.

**Where to get it**

You can get it at a health food store or order it online.

## Can The Brain Function Effectively Without Carbohydrates

# Can the brain function effectively without carbohydrates?

Dr. Berg talks about the fuel source of the brain. Your brain can run on alternative fuel sources and you do not have to consume carbs or glucose to get energy. It can run on ketones, which is the byproduct of fat. If it needs glucose, it can make it from protein (dietary) and fat.

## How Can I Burn More Calories Without Exercising And Eating Less

# How can I burn more calories without exercising and eating less?

I’ll show you how to burn more calories without exercising or eating less. Yes, it’s absolutely possible if you have the right information. Most people believe you have to exercise more and eat fewer calories because one pound of fat is 3,500 calories. So if it’s an average of 1800-2200 calories to run my body, and I eat fewer calories than that but exercise more, the problem is solved.

A UK website that gets over 43 million views per month says this: don’t skip your breakfast, eat regular meals, eat plenty of fruit and vegetables, walk more to get more steps, drink more water, consume higher fiber foods, use a smaller plate, and don’t ban any specific food. They say you must eat in moderation. But here’s the big problem. You have two types of stored fuel; glycogen (sugar) and fat. The average person has 1700 calories of stored glycogen but 100,000 calories of fat. So how do you burn more fat calories? Because the goal isn’t to just burn off sugar calories then get hungry for carbs.

**Doing everything in moderation will burn off glycogen but not fat. You have to treat types of calories differently. So, lower your carbs, eat moderate protein (the only time the advice to eat in moderation is accurate), and increase your fat consumption. Bring your carbs as close to zero as possible to maximize your fat burning.**

**As you feed your body fewer carbs your metabolism actually speeds up. You heal a condition called insulin resistance. Exercise is responsible for only about 15 percent of your weight loss. 85 percent is diet.**

This is how to burn more calories without exercising or eating less.

## Can I Drink Diet Coke Or Coke Zero On Keto

# Can I drink Diet Coke or Coke Zero on Keto?

Diet coke, coke zero and coke zero sugar have the same ingredients except for other sweeteners. It has aspartame which affects the gut, increase the risk for insulin resistance and diabetes. It also has caramel coloring where they heat sugar with an ammonia compound to produce an end product called AGE or Advanced Glycation Endproducts, which creates sticky proteins in the body.

## What Strategies Can I Implement To Avoid Weight Gain After Completing  4Df024

# What strategies can I implement to avoid weight gain after completing a ketogenic diet?

It is advisable to maintain carbohydrate intake at 50 grams or more per day, with protein consumption limited to a maximum of 8 ounces. For those practicing intermittent fasting, consuming two meals per day is recommended.

If there are no compelling reasons to discontinue the ketogenic diet, it may be beneficial to continue with it to reap its potential advantages.

## Are Cheat Days On A Diet Beneficial

# Are cheat days on a diet beneficial?

Some weight loss plans have cheat days built into the program. But this isn’t a good idea because it can severely affect your results. Once you go off of a diet plan, it’s really hard to get back on it.

That said, sometimes it can be encouraging to go off keto just to see how much better you feel when you’re on keto and doing it correctly. The goal is to create enough health and discipline that you can go off of the keto plan very temporarily and then go right back on. The best way to tell if someone is cheating on keto or staying healthy is to look at their A1C. An A1C test measures how much glucose is stuck to the protein in your blood.

The more sugar in your body, the higher percentage of your hemoglobin is affected by glucose. You would want your A1C percentage to be below 5.7. The best way to know that the keto program is working and you’re in ketosis is a loss of appetite. But, all it takes is a very small amount of carbohydrates to take you out of ketosis for a couple of days—even half a glass of wine will have this effect.

**This means a cheat day will knock you out of the program for a good amount of time. If someone is cheating every other day or every third day, they're not going to make very good progress.**

**How to support healthy blood sugar:**

1\. Consume nutrient-dense foods on keto (Healthy Keto®)

2\. Consume apple cider vinegar in water

3\. Consume berberine

## What Are Top Foods To Lose Belly Fat

# What are top foods to lose belly fat?

Cortisol, a stress hormone, converts protein into sugar, prompting the liver to produce sugar from non-carbohydrate sources like fat, ketones, and protein. High cortisol levels lead to increased sugar production, which elevates insulin, and in turn, contributes to belly fat. Consuming a high-carb diet, sugar, or eating frequently also spikes insulin, leading to belly fat.

Belly fat typically appears after the liver becomes fatty, as visceral fat around the organs often results from fat spill-off from the liver. Therefore, the best foods to reduce belly fat are those that lower insulin, decrease cortisol, or support liver health.

Ten foods that help reduce belly fat:

1\. Eggs

2\. Salmon

3\. Cod liver and cod liver oil

4\. Sauerkraut

5\. Cruciferous vegetables

6\. Hamburger

7\. Avocados

8\. Broccoli sprouts

9\. Asparagus

10\. Nutritional yeast (non-fortified)

## What Causes A Stinky Odor After Urination

# What causes a stinky odor after urination?

If you are not on a ketogenic diet and you’re not doing intermittent fasting, but you’re getting a stinky urine odor, it could be a urinary tract infection, liver damage, eating the wrong foods, or not having enough vegetables.

If you are on a keto diet, it could also be ketones that aren’t being burned. This often happens if you’re still adapting to keto. Keto adaptation can take several weeks. Over time, you will burn those ketones, and they won’t cause an odor.

If you have an ammonia smell, it could be that you’re consuming too much protein, or you have liver damage.

**Here’s what you can do for a strong urine odor:**

1\. Liver support - consume plenty of healthy vegetables (beet tops and dandelion greens)

2\. Fluids - drink plenty of water throughout the day

3\. Adjust proteins - lower your protein (3-6 oz is plenty)

4\. Chlorophyll - wheatgrass juice powder is a great source of chlorophyll

## What Are The Best Dietary Tips For Managing Hypothyroidism

# What are the best dietary tips for managing hypothyroidism?

Tip #1 - Don’t go on a low-calorie diet. Why? Because you also lower your nutrition, which starves the metabolism. Low-calorie diets end up slowing down your thyroid even more. You need plenty of nutrients, so don’t starve your body.

Tip #2 - Avoid pre-packaged foods. Most pre-packaged foods contain something called soy protein isolates. What are these? They are a very low-quality protein that interferes with the thyroid and the liver. These are not good for the body. Avoid soy at all costs

Tip #3 - Avoid stimulates. This includes things like phentermine and diet pills. When the thyroid is stimulated, you run the risk of burning it out down the road. Stay away from stimulates like these.

## How Does A Fatty Liver Contribute To The Onset Of Arthritis

# How does a fatty liver contribute to the onset of arthritis?

There are different stages of liver damage: fatty liver, fatty liver with inflammation, and cirrhosis. Arthritis is inflammation in your joints. How does the inflammation get from the liver to the joints?

There are several mechanisms in play here. Liver fat creates cytokines, which are proteins that cause inflammation. The particular cytokines that liver fat produces increases systemic inflammation—or inflammation throughout your body.

These cytokines released by liver fat are why you can get inflammation in your joints and arthritis when you have liver disease.

To make things worse, cytokines can worsen insulin resistance. Insulin resistance makes getting rid of fat very difficult and increases even more systemic inflammation. This is a feedback loop that gets worse and worse. When the liver is inflamed and filled with scar tissue, bile gets stuck. In turn, this can cause even more inflammation in the body and nutrient deficiencies.

## What Are The Common Causes Of Abdominal Distention

# What are the common causes of abdominal distention?

Abdominal distention, characterized by swelling and discomfort after meals, can stem from various causes:

1\. **Microbial Fermentation:**

\- Overload of carbohydrates and excessive fiber can lead to microbial fermentation in the gut, causing gas and distention.

\- Remedies include reducing carb and fiber intake, using apple cider vinegar or betaine hydrochloride before meals, and consuming ginger, fennel seeds (avoid during pregnancy), anise, peppermint, and cooked vegetables. Probiotics can also help.

2\. **Food Sensitivities and Intolerances:**

\- Intolerance to FODMAPs (fermentable oligo-, di-, monosaccharides and polyols), lectins, or specific allergens can cause inflammation and digestive issues.

\- Remedies involve avoiding high-FODMAP foods like certain fruits, dairy products, wheat, and legumes, and substituting with low-FODMAP alternatives. Avoiding high-lectin foods and allergens while maintaining a food diary can help identify triggers.

3\. **Gluten and Grains Consumption:**

\- Gluten and grains are common culprits for bloating. Avoiding these foods can alleviate symptoms.

\- Remedies include eliminating gluten-containing foods such as bread, pasta, and cereals, as well as other grain products, sugars, and alcoholic beverages.

Other Considerations:

\- Addressing factors like lack of bile, liver health, excessive fiber intake, large meal consumption, SIBO (Small Intestinal Bacterial Overgrowth), frequent eating, intolerance to lectins, fat intolerance, adrenal fatigue, and protein overload may also help manage abdominal distention.

Natural Remedies:

\- Acupressure techniques can potentially aid in alleviating symptoms of abdominal distention.

Consulting a healthcare provider for a thorough evaluation and personalized treatment plan is recommended for persistent abdominal discomfort.

## What Factors Contribute To The Presence Of An Ammonia Odor During Ketosis

# What factors contribute to the presence of an ammonia odor during ketosis?

Ammonia is a chemical byproduct of protein metabolism. When your digestive system functions normally, ammonia converts to less toxic byproducts. If you have excess ammonia levels, it means that something is not functioning right. As a result you may develop a strong ammonia body odor that comes out in your breath, urine, or sweat.

**Cause #1: Acidosis**

An ammonia odor can be caused by acidosis. Acidosis occurs when your body is too acidic. To alkalize the blood, your body can compensate with ammonia, which is highly alkaline. This situation may happen when you’re adapting to ketosis.

**Cause #3: Excess protein consumption**

Sometimes a strong ammonia odor can simply be due to consuming excess protein, because ammonia is a byproduct of protein. Consuming more moderate amounts of protein should help.

## What Yogurt Can I Eat On Keto

# What yogurt can I eat on keto?

One that’s recommended is a special type of yogurt called Trimona. A few reasons why Trimona is recommended:

- It’s grass-fed

- Its producers use milk from cows that generate A2 protein versus A1 (less allergies)

- It’s organic

- It’s whole fat

- It’s fermented for 30 hours

- It’s not strained

- There are no thickeners or additives

- It’s plain, so it has less sugar

- It’s non-GMO

A serving of Trimona contains:

- 10 g carbs

- 6 g sugar

- 8 g protein

- 8 g fat

Trimona also contains friendly bacteria, including lactobacillus bulgaricus. A few potential benefits of lactobacillus bulgaricus:

- Could help improve lactose intolerance

- Stimulates the immune system

- Supports the liver

- Could help decrease diarrhea

- Could help decrease inflammation in the gut

- Could help decrease constipation

## What Keto Ice Cream Can I Eat On Keto

# What keto ice cream can I eat on Keto?

Let’s look deeper at a few keto ice cream brands. Most of them contain sugar alcohol called erythritol.

- Enlightened – 7 g sugar alcohol (also has regular sugar)

- Keto – 8 g sugar alcohol / tapioca fiber (which is not keto-friendly)

- Rebel – 9 g sugar alcohol

- Halo – 10 g net carbs (contains wheat flour and sugar)

Most of these brands use a sugar alcohol called erythritol. What’s good about erythritol is that it’s zero on the glycemic index. What’s bad about it is that unless it’s non-GMO, it could be made from GMO ingredients. None of the major brands that advertise keto ice cream have stated that their product was non-GMO.

For something to be keto, it needs to be low-carb. But even that is a loose term with no legal definition.

Some of the other ingredients in keto ice cream:

- Dairy – Is it organic?

- Sugar – You don’t want any sugar

- Wheat – You don’t want any wheat

- Tapioca – You don’t want any tapioca

- Egg yolk – Is it organic?

The biggest problem with every single one of these so-called keto-friendly ice cream brands is an ingredient called MPC (milk protein concentrate). Another name for this would be milk protein isolates. MPC is a group of dehydrated proteins that come from milk. It is a combination of casein, whey protein and other proteins. These proteins have been linked to inflammation in the liver. Something many people don’t realize is that almost all milk-protein concentrates are imported from China and Mexico. These imported products are also not regulated.

You can consume keto ice cream, although it is not recommended to consume on a regular basis or in large amounts. Preferably find an organic one without any sugar (sugar alcohol is okay) and without tapioca, flour or MPC.

## Does Keto Make Your Pee Smell

# Does keto make your pee smell?

It can, during the keto adaptation period.

If you are on a keto diet, the smell usually comes from the ketones that aren’t being burned. This often happens if you’re still adapting to keto. Keto adaptation can take several weeks. Over time, you will burn those ketones and they won’t cause an odor.

If you are not on a ketogenic diet and you’re not doing intermittent fasting, but you’re getting a stinky urine odor, it could be a urinary tract infection, liver damage, eating the wrong foods, or not having enough vegetables.

Here’s what you can do for a strong urine odor:

- Liver support – consume plenty of healthy vegetables (like beet tops and dandelion greens)

- Fluids – drink plenty of water throughout the day

- Adjust proteins – lower your protein (3 to 6 oz is plenty)

- Chlorophyll – wheatgrass juice powder is a great source of it

## What Are The Best Snack Foods For Low Blood Sugar

# What are the best snack foods for low blood sugar?

A person with low blood sugar might be accustomed to snacks like protein bars and an apple with peanut butter. There is so much hidden sugar in these snacks that such snacks are nor recommended; with them, every time you snack you are worsening the problem of low blood sugar. You can become a real hypoglycemic which is almost a pre-diabetic situation. Normal blood sugars are between 80 to 90, but not over 100.

When you eat a snack, no matter what you snack on, you elevate your sugars. Once the sugar goes high it triggers the hormone insulin to drive the sugar down, so you end up with a low blood sugar situation. Snacking keeps the blood sugar levels going up and down, up and down, and perpetuates the problem.

The way out of this is to change what you eat at your meals. Watch Dr. Eric Berg’s videos about the Healthy Keto® and intermittent fasting plan; this diet will help you keep your blood sugars under control.

## Can I Do Keto Even If I Dont Like Vegetables

# Can I do keto even if I don’t like vegetables?

Not healthily, and here’s why.

The problem is that you will be burning a lot of fat, and you need to keep the fat going through the liver and gallbladder. Vegetables are going to provide you with needed nutrients and they are going to help organs like the liver to work better.

Dr. Berg recommends 7 to 10 cups of vegetables a day. Without vegetables it will be hard to flush out those organs.

If you aren’t in love with veggies you can try kale shakes with added berries to hide the taste, or take wheatgrass juice; you can use dips, fermented veggies, green powders, food concentrates, steamed spinach with protein, etc.

Health benefits from consuming a lot of vegetables will support your body while in ketosis and will prevent any potential keto side effects.

## Can I Drink Diet Or Zero Sugar Soda

# Can I drink diet or zero-sugar soda?

It’s not recommended because it doesn’t have high nutritional value and it usually contains poor-quality artificial sweeteners.

For example, Diet Coke, Coke Zero and Coke Zero Sugar have the same ingredients except for their sweeteners. Both have aspartame which affects the gut, increasing the risk for insulin resistance and diabetes. It also has caramel coloring created in a process where they heat sugar with an ammonia compound to produce an end product called AGE or Advanced Glycation Endproducts, which create sticky proteins in the body.

## How Does Fasting Influence Your Genes

# How does fasting influence your genes?

Your genes are your blueprints or your code for building proteins. These proteins are involved in all of the biochemistry in your body—from making hormones and neurotransmitters to releasing stored glucose for fuel.

You have millions upon millions of these proteins, but they have to be instructed on what to do. When someone does fasting, many interesting things happen to your genetics. Fasting is one very important part of your epigenetics.

**Epigenetics are things that influence your genes. Your genes are like a series of light switches—they can be turned on and turned off. Epigenetics has the ability to turn on and off each light switch.**

As an example, fasting positively influences the gene CFHR1, which regulates your cholesterol. It also influences the SIRT-3 gene, which has anti-aging potential. Fasting also down-regulates genes like the APP gene that helps lower amyloid plaque, which is seen in neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer’s. Fasting may also play a role in other genes that influence cancer risks.

**Fasting can help:**

• Lower inflammation

• Support your immune system

• Lower syndrome X

• Support healthy brain cells

• Promote a healthy mood and mind

## Why Do Low Blood Sugars Occur On Keto

# Why do low blood sugars occur on Keto?

**When I look deeper at this problem there are 3 things I see often:**

1\. Not doing it correctly not enough vegetables, proteins, or even fat.

2\. Not doing it consistently. Instead, they are "sort of" doing it.

3\. They do not do it long enough for it to work. This can create lots of mood issues - irritability and moody. In other words, you have to do it correctly, long enough to fully keto adapt.

## Is A Ketogenic Diet Too Extreme

# Is a Ketogenic Diet too extreme?

That belief comes from two different concepts. One is the sentiment, “Everything in moderation”. The other is, “There’s no good or bad food, just molecules. You just have to balance your foods”.

Let’s take a look at keto. You’ll eat moderate protein, higher fats, and low-carb foods. You need to lower your carbs to 20-50 grams per day. This is what people consider extreme.

But let’s compare keto to the standard American diet! It’s about 350 grams of carbs per day, which has become our new normal. But this is what’s extreme! Our society consumes pounds of sugar each year. Keto only sounds extreme if you don’t understand dietary sugar and blood sugar. When you get your blood glucose tested, you want it to be about 80 mg/dL. That equates to about one teaspoon of sugar in all of your blood. The average person consumes 28-30 teaspoons. That’s extreme!

What I consider extreme is the 4 billion prescriptions handed out each year in the US. The $3.4 trillion we spend on health care each year. And 60 percent of the US population is either pre-diabetic or diabetic. Keto is normal and reasonable and helps people get healthy.

## How To Choose Protein Correctly On Keto

# How to choose protein correctly on Keto?

In nature, protein never comes as a complete protein—it comes with fat. There is something called the insulin index, which looks at the protein effect on insulin. The leaner the protein, the higher the spike in insulin. You would want to consume fattier proteins and avoid lean proteins to get into deeper ketosis.

The calories in your keto diet should consist of about 10% carbs (5% of your carbs should be from vegetables), 20% protein, and 70% fat. This is about 3.5 times more fat than protein. But, really, we have to look at the weight because there is more condensed energy in fat than protein. Now, we’re looking at 1.56g of fat and 1g of protein. Having a higher fat to protein ratio can have many benefits.

**A closer look at fat to protein ratios:**

Egg: (add fat) Fat — 1 Protein — 1

Hamburger: Fat — 2 Protein — 1

Steak: (add fat) Fat — 1 Protein — 2

Chicken: (eat the skin on the chicken) Fat — 1 Protein — 2

Bacon: (add fat) Fat — 1 Protein — 1

Pecans: (a tiny bit of carbs) Fat — 7 Protein — 1

Peanuts: (a tiny bit of carbs) Fat — 2 Protein — 1

Cod liver: Fat — 5 Protein — 1

Summer sausage: Fat — 2 Protein — 1

Macadamia nuts: Fat — 11.5 Protein — 1

Sardines: Fat — 1 Protein — 2

Salmon: Fat — 1.5 Protein — 1

## Why Does Protein Help With Low Blood Sugar

# Why does protein help with low blood sugar?

With hypoglycemia, insulin lowers high blood sugar, often too much, resulting in low blood sugar. This happens because people with hypoglycemia have high insulin levels and lack counteracting hormones. While glucose, fat, and ketones are common fuels, protein can also be converted into glucose via gluconeogenesis, providing energy and helping stabilize blood sugar.

Consuming protein helps balance blood sugar by stimulating both insulin and glucagon, unlike carbohydrates, which can cause a temporary spike followed by a drop. We recommend adopting a Healthy Keto® diet and intermittent fasting for those with hypoglycemia.

## How Do I Prevent My Blood Sugar Levels From Crashing In The Afternoon

# How do I prevent my blood sugar levels from crashing in the afternoon?

To prevent blood sugar crashes later in the day, can take a few steps. The first is to add more fats to your meals. Making sure you are consuming adequate levels of protein can also help. Eating plenty of greens while avoiding carbs is very important if you want to prevent a crash. And finally, make sure to eliminate snacking from your dietary routine, as this causes regular insulin spikes and blood sugar crashes.

## What Are The Most Important Benefits Of Green Tea For Skin Health

# What are the most important benefits of green tea for skin health?

**Green tea is rich in polyphenols, which are phytonutrients. These are what give green tea its many benefits for reducing the signs of aging.**

1\. Green tea has powerful anti-photoaging properties, which means that it reduces the effects of UV light on skin aging.

2\. Green tea increases collagen and elastin fibers by suppressing enzymes that degrade collagen and elastin. This helps reduce the appearance of wrinkles and improve the overall health of your skin.

3\. Green tea has potent anti-inflammatory properties.

4\. Green tea has the ability to induce autophagy, which is the recycling of old, damaged proteins to use for new proteins.

5\. Green tea can promote ROS-scavenging enzymes, which help clean up free radicles that cause damage to your DNA. Green tea can also decrease the amount of hydrogen peroxide that the body creates, resulting in less oxidative stress.

6\. Green tea acts as a potent stress mediator, helping your body better resist the effects of stress.

7\. Green tea can potentially decrease both melanoma and non-melanoma skin cancer.

## How Can I Efficiently Speed Up Muscle Growth

# How can I efficiently speed up muscle growth?

High-intensity exercise and protein consumption build muscle. Aim to consume .8 to 1.5 grams of high-quality protein per kilogram of lean body mass. Athletes may need to consume up to 2 grams of protein per kilogram.

1\. Creatine

Creatine is found in foods, but if you want to grow your muscles quickly, take creatine as a supplement. Creatine acts as a substitute for energy, especially for short-duration high-intensity exercise. Try taking 20 grams of creatine for five days, then a maintenance dosage of 3 grams daily for the rest of the month, and then continue this cycle between the large and small amounts.

2\. Cold therapy

Cold showers, cold immersion, and cryotherapy require your body to generate a tremendous amount of energy to maintain its core temperature. To do this, your body generates a type of fat known as brown fat, which stimulates white fat. This burns a lot of calories! Cold therapy increases the expression of muscle genes in both rats and humans. It increases RNA, which makes the proteins you need to build muscle. Cold therapy also decreases inflammation.

3\. Intermittent fasting

Intermittent fasting stimulates growth hormone, which increases muscle growth. Aim for two meals daily without decreasing your caloric intake—and cut the snacks! Intermittent fasting helps improve insulin resistance, which gets more insulin to the muscle.

4\. Arginine Arginine also increases growth hormone by inhibiting a hormone called somatostatin. Arginine has even been used to increase growth in children. Try taking 3 to 6 grams daily on an empty stomach 30 minutes before you work out.

## Nutrition Strategies For Optimal Muscle Gain

# Nutrition Strategies for Optimal Muscle Gain

Macronutrient Balance: Achieving muscle growth requires a careful balance of protein, carbohydrates, and fats. Aim for approximately 1 gram of protein per pound of body weight to support muscle repair and growth. Include healthy fats—like those from avocados, nuts, seeds, and fatty fish—targeting around 0.5 grams per pound of body weight for hormone production and overall health.

Keto, Fasting, and Exercise: Combining ketogenic principles and intermittent fasting with strategic exercise routines enhances muscle development. Brined chicken thighs are a valuable addition, offering lean protein that supports muscle growth and aligns with both keto and fasting protocols.

## What If I Dont Consume Dairy On Keto   Do You Have Any Tips

# What If I don't consume dairy on Keto - do you have any tips?

I’m going to tell you how to do the keto diet while remaining dairy-free, for those of you who are lactose intolerant or have an allergy to the proteins in dairy. You may also be sensitive to the quality of the dairy since dairy products can contain hormones or come from animals fed with genetically-modified grains.

I personally do well with raw-milk cheese that’s grass-fed and organic. You may want to try dairy products that are grass-fed and organic to see if you tolerate them. Be sure to avoid processed cheese like Velveeta, which is filled with unhealthy ingredients.

If you truly need to adhere to dairy-free eating, there are several healthy alternatives that are totally acceptable on keto. They are coconut products, nuts, and nut butter, olive products and avocados, animal fat, and ghee.

I included ghee, also called clarified butter, even though strictly speaking it’s dairy. But ghee has the milk solids removed, leaving only the fat, which you may be able to eat. If you can’t, don’t worry about it. As you see, there are numerous alternatives.

If you’re sensitive to nuts in addition to adhering to dairy-free eating, that complicates things. You have to remove nuts and nut butter as healthy fats. And if you’re not eating dairy, can’t eat nuts, and are vegan, that really limits your options for healthy fat. However, there are always substitutes. You just have to get creative to be sure you get the correct amount of healthy fat when you’re on keto.

Don’t worry if you avoid dairy. You can be successful on the keto diet by using viable substitutes.

## Is Creatine An Effective Supplement For Weight Training

# Is creatine an effective supplement for weight training?

Creatine is a combination of three amino acids. These are arginine, glycine and methionine. In your muscles, creatine combines with phosphate to help you recycle ATP (the energy currency in the muscles). It helps you to recover energy and assists with muscle development.

**Benefits**

- Can help you tolerate heavy weight training

- Can help with the recovery of the muscle

- Can help with the strength of muscles

- Can help the size of the muscle

**How to consume it**

There are different types of creatine. Some people can actually be allergic to creatine as well. You may want to try a small amount first, to make sure you’re not allergic to it.

There are two versions of creatine that Dr. Berg recommends as better than others:

- Creatine ethyl ester

- Micronized creatine

Follow the manufacturer instructions for the right dosages.

**Where to get it**

You can get it at a health food or nutrition store, or order it online.

## How Much Protein Is Too Much On A Ketogenic Diet

# How much protein is too much on a ketogenic diet?

To manage insulin, aim for 3-6 oz of protein per meal, adjusting for fitness and metabolism. For regular workouts, up to 8 oz may be okay. For one meal a day, you might need more protein.

Dr. Berg suggests grass-fed beef, pasture-raised chicken (with skin), eggs, and wild-caught salmon. Fattier proteins help lower insulin levels.

Calculate your protein needs: body weight (lbs) x 0.4. Divide by your meals per day (2 or 3).

Example: At 172 lbs, you need 68.8g/day. For 2 meals, that's 34.4g/meal.

Adjust to find your ideal amount.

## What Are The Keto Food Ratios

# What are the keto food ratios?

The percent of carbs should be 5% of the calories in your diet (low)

Your protein should be roughly 20% (moderate) and

The percent of fat should be 75% (high).

Don’t count carbohydrates from vegetables in this equation since these carbs are mainly fiber and will not raise insulin too much.

Dr. Berg recommends consuming 7 to 10 cups of salad veggies (leafy greens) per day. If you are eating other vegetables like broccoli, Brussels sprouts, etc. you would need less (3.5 to 4 cups).

## How To Optimize Protein Intake During Intermittent Fasting

# How to optimize protein intake during intermittent fasting?

**Optimizing Fat Loss and Muscle Preservation with a Ketogenic Diet and Intermittent Fasting**

Combining a ketogenic diet with intermittent fasting is an effective strategy for enhancing fat loss while preserving muscle mass. To maximize benefits, strategically time your protein intake during your eating window.

**Adjusting Protein Intake**

Distribute your protein intake evenly across meals. Aim for 21 to 42 grams of high-quality protein per meal to support muscle protein synthesis and satiety.

**Fasting and Muscle Preservation**

Intermittent fasting helps preserve muscle mass during calorie restriction by increasing growth hormone release, which supports lean tissue maintenance and fat burning. Studies suggest that intermittent fasting may reduce the protein required for muscle maintenance, allowing for slightly lower protein intake while still benefiting from muscle preservation.

## Why Am I Losing Inches But Not Weight

# Why am I losing inches but not weight?

**There is nothing more frustrating than doing everything right with keto and intermittent fasting, and still not losing weight.** 

**Even if you're losing inches but not losing weight, the ketogenic diet is still working:**

• If you're losing inches

• If your hunger is going away

• If you're not craving anymore

• If you have more energy

A slow metabolism really is insulin resistance. Insulin is an anabolic hormone. If insulin is not working, you're not going to have the anabolic effect. As soon as you do keto and intermittent fasting, you're going to fix insulin resistance.  Once you fix insulin resistance, you're going to absorb more protein. Protein weighs more than fat per the same volume. This means, initially, you will lose inches but not weight. 

**This is because you're:**

• Absorbing protein

• Getting more muscle mass

• Fixing atrophy 

If you're not losing weight on keto, keep in mind that it is working. You're getting healthier. You have to get healthy to lose weight, not lose weight to get healthy.

## I Have No Appetite Should I Eat

# I have no appetite should I eat?

[See Video/Image/Document](https://hls-player.drberg.com/asset?path=migrated-assets/should-i-eat-if-i-am-not-hungry-no-appetite-drberg-on-loss-of-appetite)

**Food has two purposes, to provide the body with fuel and with nutrients. If you are nutritionally deficient, which most people are, you may have problems going longer than a day without food. Low blood pressure and fainting episodes are common in people who go too long without eating.**

Most people need to eat once a day, even if they have no appetite. If weight loss is not your goal, you should consume 2 meals per day, also if you don’t have an appetite. You don’t have to consume a large meal if you have no appetite. Try consuming a small salad with a small amount of protein and fat.

Your stomach will shrink when you’re doing intermittent fasting. Your requirement for food will be less, so you won't need as many calories. You won’t even need the same amount of nutrients in some cases. This may cause your appetite to decrease.

In the morning if you have no appetite, don’t eat! Go as long as you can, but try to eat at least once per day to ensure your body gets enough nutrients.

## How Can I Stop Overeating And Be Satisfied With Food

# How can I stop overeating and be satisfied with food?

**There are three things I’ve covered on this topic before:**

1\. Consume more fat

2\. Eat nutrient-dense foods

3\. Support healthy digestion

The above three things are important. But the best way to satisfy hunger and stop overeating is to consume the right amount of protein. One study found that certain insects will continue to eat until their protein requirements are met. If you put these insects on a low-protein diet, they will overeat. However, you don’t want to consume too much protein. Excess protein is not stored and will convert to sugar. The right amount of protein will give your body what it needs without converting to sugar or fat.

## How Can I Permanently Stick To A Weight Loss Plan

# How can I permanently stick to a weight loss plan?

**The biggest reasons people can’t stick to a diet are #1 hunger and #2 cravings.** 

**There are two main hormones involved in hunger and cravings:**

1\. Ghrelin — This hormone makes you hungry, so we want to decrease it. 

2\. Leptin — This hormone makes you feel satisfied, so we want to increase it. 

**The best ways to stick with your eating plan and lose weight:**

• Get more sleep 

• Decrease sugar 

• Consume an adequate amount of protein

• Get plenty of fiber 

• Decrease stress 

• Avoid alcohol and smoking 

• Keep caffeine consumption to a minimum 

• Consume healthy fats 

• Eat slowly 

• Decrease carbohydrates 

• Take l-tryptophan (for cravings during menstrual cycles)

• Consume nutrient-dense foods 

• Do intermittent fasting

Gastric bypass and certain medications can also increase hunger. 

One of the big tips for sticking to diets and losing weight is to eat frequent small meals. But, every time you eat, you increase insulin.  In the presence of insulin, you can’t burn fat, and if you can’t burn fat, then you can’t lose weight. This can also cause insulin resistance, which can lead to a myriad of health concerns.  Eating less frequently, also known as intermittent fasting, is one of the best things you can do to lose weight and support your overall health. 

To stay satisfied between meals without eating snacks, you need to feed the cells your body fat (burn fat). But, to burn fat, you have to lower your insulin by lowering your carbohydrates and eating less frequently.  Once your body has adapted to burning fat, not only will you be able to lose weight, you will finally get rid of hunger and cravings for good.

## If I Lose Weight On Keto Will I End Up With Loose Sagging Belly Skin

# If I lose weight on keto, will I end up with loose, sagging belly skin?

Following a Healthy Keto® diet and intermittent fasting can prevent loose skin after weight loss if done correctly. Your skin, the largest organ in the body, heals as you get healthier, improving collagen structure. Loose skin, or atrophy, often results from a protein deficiency worsened by insulin resistance, a common issue in weight gain.

The ketogenic diet addresses insulin resistance, enabling amino acids to enter cells and form proteins, which helps tighten the skin. During this process, you might experience a weight plateau as muscle, which is heavier than fat, rebuilds. However, you’ll notice your size shrinking and your waist getting smaller.

Combining keto with intermittent fasting spikes growth hormone levels up to 2000%, further preserving protein and supporting skin recovery.

## How Low Calorie Diets And Intermittent Fasting Affect Metabolism

# How low-calorie diets and intermittent fasting affect metabolism?

**Low-calorie diets:**

• Slow your metabolism 

• Raises your set point (you can’t lose weight once you hit a certain point that’s typically high)

• Decrease muscle

• Increase cravings and hunger

• Don’t put a person in fat-burning 

• Ignore how food triggers certain hormones 

• Ignore the nutrients in the calories 

**Intermittent fasting:**

• Speeds up metabolism 

• Lowers your set point (allows your weight to go down)

• Improves muscle by triggering growth hormone 

• Decreases cravings and hunger 

• Puts a person in fat-during 

• Considers the hormone aspects, especially insulin 

• Promotes eating nutrient-dense foods when eating

**Low-calorie diets focus on restricting calories, but intermittent fasting focuses on restricting the frequency of eating. Intermittent fasting doesn’t lower your calories when you do eat.** 

**With intermittent fasting, when you do eat a meal, you want it to have healthy fats, a moderate amount of protein, and nutrient-dense vegetables. Having a nice big meal will help you switch over to fat-burning when you’re fasting and help make it easier to fast. A great form of intermittent fasting is having two meals a day without snacks.**

## Im On The Weight Loss Journey   Can I Eat Healthy Snacks

# I'm on the weight loss journey - can I eat healthy snacks?

People will tell you that in order to lose weight, you need to snack before you get too hungry, or snack to trigger your metabolism or snack to prevent overeating. 

It's snacking camouflaged as "Healthy snacking". All these extra meals even if they are small and healthy create a spike in insulin - this adds up. 

Insulin is the FAT-MAKING hormone, AND IT PREVENTS FAT BURNING. We snack on liquids too. The grocery store is filled with all sorts of new snacks protein bars, jerky, drinks, and granola bars, with added buzz words like "gluten free" or "organic" or "natural", but it's still food. 

Even fruit between meals can block weight loss. I myself cut fruit out between meals and went from 211 pounds to 185 pounds in 6 weeks.

# Are Keto snacks safe to eat on a Ketogenic Diet?

**There are so many different kinds of keto snacks available now, like protein bars, keto bombs, and much more. But, these keto snacks can actually decrease your results significantly. You’re going to plateau.** 

The goal of keto is to decrease and normalize insulin. Every time you eat anything of significant calories, you will spike insulin. So, the more frequent the meals, the more insulin you’re going to have, and the less progress you’re going to make with weight loss and your overall health. 

Low-calorie foods like vegetables won’t spike insulin too much, especially if it’s filled with fiber, like leafy greens. So, this could be an exception. 

Let’s say you’re doing intermittent fasting, and your first meal is at 12 pm, and your next meal is at 7 pm. But, you have a snack in between because this time is technically your eating window. I don’t recommend doing this. I don’t recommend eating anything during the day except for during your first meal and second meal. So, after 7 pm, you would fast again until 12 pm the next day. To really see some significant changes, you may want to work up to an 18 hour fast. However, some people may need to go up to 20 hours or even 23 hours of fasting. 

A lot of keto snacks and keto bombs are okay to have, but you should only eat them with your meal.

## Can I Use Chick Peas To Make Natto

# Can I use chick peas to make Natto?

Yes, you can use chickpeas (garbanzos) to make natto! While traditionally made with soybeans, natto can be made with other beans, including chickpeas.

Here's why it works:

**Fermentation Process:** Natto relies on the bacteria *Bacillus subtilis* to ferment the beans. This bacteria isn't exclusive to soybeans and can ferment other legumes like chickpeas

**Similar Nutritional Profile:** Chickpeas offer a comparable nutritional profile to soybeans, providing a good source of protein and fiber.

However, there are a few things to keep in mind:

**Texture:** Chickpea natto might have a slightly different texture than traditional soybean natto. It may be a bit firmer and less sticky.

**Taste:** The flavor might also be subtly different, with a slightly nuttier taste from the chickpeas.

## Protein Bars Are Worse Than Candy Bars

# Protein Bars Are WORSE than Candy Bars!!!

Let's compare popular snack bars to see what they really offer.

**Snickers:**

- 50 grams, 30 grams carbs, 58% sugar.

**Protein Bars:**

- **CLIF Builder's:** 68 grams, 20 grams protein (low-quality soy), high sugar, ultra-processed.

- **CLIF Energy:** 68 grams, 55.88% sugar, provides a short energy spike followed by a crash.

- **KIND:** Claims like "low glycemic index" are misleading, contains glucose syrup and other sugars.

- **Quest Birthday Cake:** 9 grams sugar alcohol (can cause GI issues), 41% sugar, contains polydextrose (not well-studied in humans).

- **Pure Protein:** Claims 2 grams sugar, but has 14 grams of starches (equivalent to more sugar).

- **ONE:** 60 grams, 20 grams protein, but 25 grams carbs from starches and cellulose (essentially sawdust), contains maltitol (avoid).

- **MET-Rx Meal Replacement:** 48 grams carbs, contains rice starch, maltitol syrup, corn syrup, fructose, soy protein isolate.

**Other Bars:**

- **RXBAR:** 10 grams protein, oats, cashews, egg whites, honey, but misleadingly labeled as 52% of its ingredients are sugar.

In summary, while marketed as healthier options, many snack bars contain high amounts of sugar, low-quality protein, and other questionable ingredients. It's important to read labels carefully and consider whole food alternatives for sustained energy and nutrition.

## Are Avocados Safe For Everyone

# Are avocados safe for everyone?

Avocados are generally safe and cause few adverse health effects. Some people appear sensitive to avocados and may experience diarrhea if they consume too many. This is likely caused by the insoluble fiber, and moderating avocado intake resolves this issue.

Although rare, some individuals with latex allergies can also experience allergic reactions when consuming avocados. Avocados contain similar proteins to the ones found in latex from rubber trees.

## Does The Ketogenic Diet Result In A Loss Of Muscle Tone

# Does the ketogenic diet result in a loss of muscle tone?

If implemented correctly, the ketogenic diet should not result in a loss of muscle tone. However, muscle loss can occur if the diet is not followed properly, particularly in conjunction with inadequate nutrition. For instance, if one engages in prolonged fasting, such as eating only every third day, muscle mass may be affected unless sufficient amino acids are consumed over time.

The most significant factor in maintaining muscle mass is regular exercise, which serves as a potent stimulus for muscle growth. As long as you are consuming adequate amino acids, engaging in consistent physical activity, and ensuring a well-rounded intake of essential nutrients, you should not experience muscle loss. Conversely, adopting a "dirty keto" approach, combined with improper fasting and lack of exercise, can lead to muscle degradation. Therefore, it is crucial to follow a balanced diet and maintain an active lifestyle to preserve muscle tone while on a ketogenic diet.

## What Are Enzymes

# What are enzymes?

Enzymes are like tiny little worker bees in your body. They do the work of breaking down carbohydrates, fats, proteins and other raw nutrients.

When you have a meal, you trigger the release of enzymes. Your body tells your pancreas what types of enzymes to release based on the kinds of nutrients you have ingested. Specific enzymes break down specific nutrients.

## Whats The 1 Best Food For Brain

# What's the #1 best food for brain?

It’s a misconception that the brain can't regenerate—certain parts of the brain can regrow.

**The top foods to avoid to support a healthy brain are:**

1\. Omega-6 fatty acids (soy oil, corn oil, canola oil, and cottonseed oil)

2\. Sugar

3\. Refined carbs

The best food to support brain health is wild-caught salmon.

**Wild-caught salmon can help enhance the brain in many ways, including supporting:**

• Memory

• Focus

• Thinking

• Problem-solving

• Learning

It may also be beneficial for those with mood disorders or brain inflammation. Consuming more wild-caught salmon may even help reduce insulin resistance, which is at the core of many brain problems. The brain is the fattiest organ in the body. Omega-3 fatty acids are the healthy fats your brain needs. They’re the building blocks of your brain. Wild-caught salmon is rich in omega-3 fatty acids.

Wild-caught salmon is keto-friendly. It’s low-carb and has a good amount of protein and nutrients. But, to get these incredible benefits for the brain, be sure the salmon you choose is wild-caught and not farm-raised. Try having your salmon with a kale salad topped with olive oil and unfortified nutritional yeast to take your brain health to the next level.

## What Are Some Effective Dietary Sources For Increasing Glucose Levels

# What are some effective dietary sources for increasing glucose levels?

People often have an idea that your body — especially your brain — can only run on glucose. But that’s not true! You can run your body on ketones, which provide about forty to seventy percent of the energy you need. Of course, the question becomes, what kind of fuel makes up the difference? There will always be a small amount of glucose, but your body can run on fatty acids. Fat turns into ketones and fatty acids.

Your brain is a little different; it can use ketones for seventy percent of its fuel, with the rest coming from lactate or glucose. Where will you get the glucose if you don’t want to eat carbohydrates? Your body makes its own, in a process called gluconeogenesis. Your body uses fat and protein to make glucose. Certain amino acids in protein turn into glucose, as does a component of fat which breaks down into glycerol, then converts to glucose. Your body can easily get the glucose it needs from fat and protein. You don’t need carbohydrates to supply glucose.

## Why Am I Losing Muscle On Keto

# Why am I losing muscle on keto?

This could be due to low protein in your diet and a lack of exercise.

When you don’t want to lose muscle mass while doing intermittent fasting, add strength training as a part of your workout, loading up muscle to recruit as many muscle fibers as you can.

- Go heavy weight with a lower number of reps

- Go moderate amount of weight to failure

    Or you can do a combination of both the above. These two actions can create a hypertrophic effect on the muscles which can keep them bigger and prevent them from shrinking when you are doing keto and intermittent fasting.

## Why Do We Only Need A Moderate Amount Of Protein On Keto

# Why do we only need a moderate amount of protein on keto?

This is because 3 oz to 6 oz of protein per meal won’t spike your insulin levels. (This amount may vary depending on your fitness level, metabolism and ability to digest protein.)

You also want to consider your fasting schedule. If you are only eating one meal a day, you may want to add a little more protein to your meal.

Consume grass-fed, grass-finished beef, pasture-raised chicken (with the skin) and eggs as well as wild-caught salmon as good protein sources. Always go for the fattier proteins as that will contribute to lower insulin levels.

## Why Do I Have A Bad Breath On Keto

# Why do I have a bad breath on Keto?

When the body releases ketones, you could have a higher amount of acetones being released from the body. This could smell like a nail varnish remover. In this case, consume more vegetables.

If you are consuming more protein, you would get a spike in ammonia, which could smell a bit like urine, you need to reduce your protein. If you have an odor that is like sulfur (eggs), then you need to take something called EM - effective microbes: [https://bit.ly/2Dx2b9l](https://bit.ly/2Dx2b9l) and [https://amzn.to/2CFiU8D](https://amzn.to/2CFiU8D)

## Do I Really Need Carbs For Healthy Living

# Do I really need carbs for healthy living?

All your life you've been told that you need carbohydrates for energy or that your brain can only run on glucose made from carbs, a type of sugar. That is a myth, as evidenced by the countless healthy, happy individuals on low-sugar or low-carbohydrate diets. Instead, you can run your body on other fuel sources, such as fatty acids and ketones produced by fat-burning. While your body does need a very tiny amount of glucose (sugar) to function, it can produce all the glucose it needs internally from fat or protein, not carbs.
