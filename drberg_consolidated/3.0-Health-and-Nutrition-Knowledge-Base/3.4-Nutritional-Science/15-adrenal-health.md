## Are There Any Diagnostic Tests For Adrenal Fatigue

# Are there any diagnostic tests for adrenal fatigue?

## **Diagnostic Tests for Adrenal Dysfunction**

When it comes to adrenal dysfunction, early detection is crucial. Let's explore a few ways to identify this disorder.

### **Raglan's Test**

The Raglan's test gauges blood pressure variations when transitioning from lying down to standing up. In healthy individuals, the systolic (upper) number usually rises slightly.

If your [systolic pressure](https://www.drberg.com/blog/why-is-my-systolic-blood-pressure-high) does not increase or decrease, it could indicate adrenal fatigue. This quick and easy home test provides valuable insights, but remember - it shouldn’t replace professional medical advice.

### **CO2 Tolerance Test**

This one measures how long you can exhale after a deep breath – like blowing out birthday candles, except these won't get you any gifts. Check out more on CO2 tolerance testing here.

A shorter exhalation time could indicate low carbon dioxide levels in your body - another possible sign of adrenal dysfunction. But don't worry. If the results seem off, there are ways to fix this.

To assess recovery without advanced tests, monitor indicators such as heart rate variability, sleep quality, blood pressure trends, and stress resilience. Adequate sleep is crucial for adrenal health and overall recovery. Embrace hormetic stressors like intermittent fasting, exercise, temperature variations, oxygen exposure, light exposure, and phytonutrient-rich foods to enhance adaptation and recovery.
