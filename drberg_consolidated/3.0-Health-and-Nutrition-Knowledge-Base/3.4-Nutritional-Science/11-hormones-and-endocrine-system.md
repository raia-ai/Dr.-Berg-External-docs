## What Is L. Reuteri

# What is L. reuteri?

Rats given L. reuteri stayed young, active, and slender, and their fur remained thick and healthy as they aged. Their immune systems were amplified, and wound healing time was cut in half. Increased testosterone and growth hormone were observed in elderly mice, and the thymus was restored to its original size. Dr. Davis has seen all of these amazing benefits in humans! Many people are missing this microbe! L. reuteri, like other Lactobacillus species, are very susceptible to antibiotics. Dr. Davis estimates that 96% of the population is missing L. reuteri, a major factor in the SIBO epidemic.

L. reuteri is a keystone microbe, which is important for the entire body’s ecosystem. It’s been found to increase the hormone oxytocin, traditionally regarded as the hormone of love and empathy. Oxytocin also influences body composition.

Many people experience increased muscle mass after consuming L. reuteri, which can be very beneficial in combating age-related muscle loss and many other side effects of aging. You can make your own L. reuteri “yogurt” for its amazing benefits! This description contains affiliate links, which pay commissions at no extra cost to you.

## What Is The Top Remedy For Dementia That Could Be A Game Changer In Ma Db5D37

# What is the top remedy for dementia that could be a game changer in managing the condition?

**Promising Research: Natural Ways to Potentially Slow Dementia**

New research suggests a surprising connection between hormones and dementia. The drug Lupron, used to suppress certain cancers, has shown potential in reducing dementia symptoms. Here's why:

- **The Hormone Connection:** Lupron works by lowering luteinizing hormone (LH), which naturally increases with age. Alzheimer's patients often have unusually high LH.

- **Progesterone's Power:** High LH can decrease progesterone, a crucial brain-protective hormone. Progesterone minimizes inflammation, supports neurons, and may even lessen brain injury severity.

- **Boosting Progesterone Naturally:** Melatonin, exercise, DHEA, and pregnenolone may help suppress LH, indirectly raising progesterone.

- **More about Melatonin:** To get a therapeutic melatonin dose, you may need a supplement. Natural ways to increase melatonin include low-light evenings, sunlight exposure, or even sitting by a campfire.

## How Do I Keep My Immune System In Check

# How do I keep my immune system in check?

## **The Immune System: Our Body's Defense Force**

Your immune system is like a highly trained military force, working tirelessly to defend your body against invading pathogens.

It's a complex network of cells, tissues, and organs that join forces to identify and neutralize harmful substances like bacteria, viruses, and toxins.

Think of your immune system as having two main branches: the innate immune system and the adaptive immune system. They work together to keep you healthy but have different roles and strategies.

### **Understanding Innate vs. Adaptive Immunity**

Your innate immune system is your first line of defense. It includes physical barriers like your skin and mucous membranes and general immune responses like [inflammation](https://www.drberg.com/blog/the-3-hidden-causes-of-inflammation-you-havent-heard-about) and phagocytosis (where immune cells engulf and destroy invaders).

The innate immune system is non-specific - it attacks anything it recognizes as foreign.

In contrast, the adaptive immune system is more targeted. It develops specific antibodies and immune cells tailored to fight off particular pathogens that you've been exposed to before.

This is why you typically only get diseases like chickenpox once - your adaptive immunity remembers the virus and is ready to fight it off if it ever tries to invade again.

### **The Role of the Thymus Gland in Immune Training**

The [thymus gland](https://www.drberg.com/blog/why-does-our-thymus-shrink-to-nothing-as-we-age) in your chest is like a boot camp for T-cells - a critical part of your adaptive immune system. Immature T-cells are "trained" in the thymus to recognize the difference between your body's own cells and foreign invaders.

This training process is rigorous—only about 30% of T-cells make it through. The rest are eliminated to prevent autoimmune reactions, in which the immune system attacks the body's own tissues.

The thymus is most active during childhood and starts to shrink after puberty, but it continues to play a role in immune regulation throughout life.

Did you know that the internal skin of the body covers an area of about 400 square meters? That's a lot of territory for your immune system to patrol. Beneath the surface of your skin, billions of immune cells are constantly on the lookout for any signs of trouble.

## What Approaches Can Be Considered For Managing Alzheimers Disease When A3D2B5

# What approaches can be considered for managing Alzheimer's disease when conventional treatments have proven ineffective?

Interestingly, smoking cigarettes and ibuprofen reduce LH and Alzheimer's risk. Now, I'm definitely not saying you should start taking ibuprofen and smoking cigarettes to prevent AD.

The drug Lupron—which is used for endometriosis, fibroids, prostate cancer, and breast cancer—also decreases the risk of Alzheimer's. Lupron also happens to lower LH. However, Lupron has numerous adverse side effects.

There is one drug without side effects that can also decrease LH: melatonin. Melatonin is stimulated by darkness, and it helps you get into a deep sleep. It also helps stimulate your immune system and offers powerful antioxidant properties.

Melatonin has significant effects when it comes to reducing Alzheimer's risk in women. Men can also see some benefits when taking much larger amounts of melatonin.

**Here is what the book recommends for reducing Alzheimer's risk.**

\- Females: 75mg of melatonin per day

\- Males: 120 mg of melatonin per day

\- 300mg pregnenolone

\- 3tsp MCT oil

\- Regular exercise

\- Fasting

Always check with your doctor before applying any of this information. This is just to educate you on these interesting links between hormones and Alzheimer's disease.

***We recommend consulting with your doctor before making any dietary changes or before you start taking any new supplements, especially if you have any existing health conditions.***

## What Natural Remedies Can Effectively Support The Management Of Erecti 2F2821

# What natural remedies can effectively support the management of erectile dysfunction?

In many cases, people with erectile dysfunction have normal hormone levels. But, they also typically have high blood pressure, obesity, diabetes, or are smokers.

Erectile dysfunction is one of the earliest signs of peripheral artery disease.

**Other symptoms of peripheral artery disease can include:**

• Cold feet

• Painful legs

• Cramping in the lower legs

• Color changes in the lower legs

• Slow healing

• Loss of hair on the lower legs

It’s crucial to fix the root cause of erectile dysfunction by healing the endothelial layer. Getting on the keto diet is one of the best things you can do to start addressing this issue.

In the meantime, several natural remedies for erectile dysfunction can be combined into one simple drink.

**Ingredients:**

• 1 cup of juice from watermelon rinds

• The juice of one medium beet (or two tsp. beet powder with eight oz. of water)

• 1 cup celery juice

**Optional ingredient:**

• Dark, leafy green vegetables

Blend the above ingredients and drink one glass of this remedy every morning for four to six weeks. Nose breathing and exercise may also be beneficial to help with erectile dysfunction. It’s also important to note that viewing porn may lead to porn-induced erectile dysfunction.

## What Is The Difference Between The Traditional Keto Diet Plan And Heal B771A7

# What is the difference between the traditional keto diet plan and Healthy Keto?

Any type of ketogenic diet, by limiting net carbs, also reduces your fat-storing hormone. To distinguish my keto program from others, I coined the term “Healthy Ketosis.” It’s based on a guiding principle of mine: It’s not “Lose weight to get healthy,” it's “Get healthy to lose weight!” Healthy Keto is groundbreaking because it emphasizes obtaining your required nutrients from high-quality foods such as organic vegetables, full-fat organic dairy, and wild-caught, grass-fed, pasture-raised meat, fish, fowl, and eggs—with the goal to get you healthy to lose weight rather than lose weight to get healthy.

## What Is The Most Effective Way To Lose Weight

# What is the most effective way to lose weight?

## **A Better Strategy for Weight Loss**

Strategy is a higher level thing you do to get an advantage over things. Belly fat is not a weight problem; it is a high cortisol problem.

Diets don’t help with this. ***Diets don’t lower cortisol; they lower calories*** so they create stress and belly fat is held there for survival mechanism**.**

> One of the ***purposes of  the body is holding fat in your belly which protects you against*** ***starvation***. 

What’s starvation? That’s a diet.

Every time you deprive yourself of food and you lower your calories too much, it won’t help the cortisol. The other thing you need to ***be careful with is  to do too much exercise.*** You may want to do long walks instead. Exercise is a type of stress that can aggravate the belly.

---

## **What to do?**

Cortisol is a hormone from the adrenal that is jacked up way too high. It is an overactive gland.

We have to realize that the gland is triggered by all stresses. The biggest stressor are other people. Avoid stressful people. They will aggravate the adrenals. 

> ***Try to minimize the amount of exposure*** *you have to stressful personalities.*

If you are in a relationship or have an aggravating boss, I know it’s difficult so you have to counteract by doing things that are anti-stress like sleeping longer.

If you have sleep problems, you can use acupressure or my "***Adrenal Fatigue Formula".*** There are no side effects.

Acupressure will literally ***pull stress out of your body and help you sleep***. You can have it done right here in my office or do it yourself.

## Is Ketogenic Diet Safe For Thyroid

# Is Ketogenic diet safe for thyroid?

**What is the thyroid?** The thyroid is in the base of the neck, and it’s controlled by the pituitary. The thyroid makes T4, but T4 is inactive. T4 has to be converted to the active form, which is T3. 80% of the conversion happens through the liver, and 20 % happens through the kidney.

**How does keto affect thyroid function?** When you go on a ketogenic diet, T4 will decrease up to 40%.

But let’s look at the big picture. There are no studies out there that show any negative effects on the thyroid when you go on a keto or low-carb diet. Also, despite the 40% drop, there is no drop in metabolism. T3 is becoming more sensitive and more effective.  I believe that high carb diets increase the need for more thyroid hormone, so T3 is higher. With a keto diet, T3 goes down, but I think that’s not actually abnormal. I believe that number is normal for what our bodies are designed to use. 

**So, is keto safe for thyroid function?** Yes. When you’re on the ketogenic diet, you’re actually improving the efficiency of the thyroid.

## What Is The Best Adrenal Glands Support

# What is the best adrenal glands support?

The purpose of the adrenal glands is to adapt your body to physical and mental stress. Out of all of the vitamins and minerals, the adrenal gland has the highest concentration of vitamin C. Vitamin C is crucial to the healthy function of the adrenal cortex and medulla.

Vitamin C is a co-factor or helper nutrient for catecholamines—which are the neurotransmitters inside the adrenals (like serotonin, dopamine, and adrenaline).

Vitamin C is also a co-factor for the steroid hormones outside of the gland (like cortisol, aldosterone, and androgens). Additionally, vitamin C acts as an antioxidant in the adrenal glands.

## What Single Food Has Been Identified As Particularly Effective In Alle 3892C8

# What single food has been identified as particularly effective in alleviating a wide range of menopausal symptoms?

Menopausal symptoms like hot flashes, night sweats, low libido, and depression are often linked to reduced estrogen and progesterone due to ovarian decline. While many healthcare providers suggest hormone replacement therapy (HRT), it’s important to recognize the role of the adrenal glands, which produce hormones that can compensate for lost ovarian function.

These steroid hormones are derived from cholesterol, primarily sourced from animal products. Incorporating cholesterol-rich foods such as grass-fed butter, egg yolks, shrimp, seafood, and organ meats into your diet can support hormone production and alleviate menopausal symptoms. Unlike plant sources, animal products provide the necessary precursors for synthesizing these hormones effectively.

## Which Supplements Are Considered Most Effective For Providing Optimal  E656E0

# Which supplements are considered most effective for providing optimal support for overall health and well-being?

**Boosting Progesterone with Supplements**

Beyond melatonin, **DHEA** and **pregnenolone** can support progesterone levels. DHEA, a key precursor hormone, enhances cognitive function and mood, as shown in a study from *Journal of Steroid Biochemistry and Molecular Biology*. Pregnenolone, also a precursor, helps reduce neuroinflammation and support brain health, according to research in the *Journal of Neuroinflammation*.

Combining these with melatonin and healthy habits can effectively support hormone balance and cognitive function.

## What Are The Potential Underlying Factors That Could Contribute To The 97Dc00

# What are the potential underlying factors that could contribute to the cessation of my menstrual cycle?

The term you're looking for is "metabolomics," which allows for an in-depth analysis of your biochemical processes, providing a wealth of information beyond what standard blood tests can offer. If you're considering a hormone test, it might help identify any imbalances that could be affecting your menstrual cycle. If you’re following a healthy ketogenic diet and ensuring you’re getting all the necessary nutrients, you shouldn't experience such issues. However, it's crucial to evaluate the specific foods in your diet to ensure they are nutrient-dense. A more comprehensive understanding of your eating habits would be necessary for a thorough assessment.

## What Are The Potential Benefits Of Incorporating Rebounding Exercises  C01Dab

# What are the potential benefits of incorporating rebounding exercises into a fitness routine?

**Rebounding exercise is essentially jumping on a trampoline. There are quite a few benefits that come from it.**

NASA has done a lot of research on rebounding exercise. When you’re in space without gravity, you begin to lose your bone tissue and muscle tissue. Rebounding exercise is designed to counter these problems.

**A big benefit of rebounding is its ability to stimulate the lymphatic system.** Some of the plasma in your blood leaks out of your tissues and goes into the lymphatic system. This means that the lymph in your lymphatic system is made up of plasma along with other substances. The plasma eventually returns to the bloodstream. Interestingly, your lymphatic system doesn’t have a pump as the vascular system does. This means that you have to move your body for your lymph to circulate through your body.

**Aside from transporting plasma, the lymphatic system has two other significant roles: to support the immune system and to transport fat throughout the body.** When you consume dietary fat, it goes through the lymphatic system. Since fat and water do not mix, your body has to package the fat—using something called chylomicrons—so it can be transported easily in the lymph fluid. By the lymph fluid, the fat is carried throughout the body to be used for energy and the creation of hormones, cells and bile.

Many people have found that rebounding exercise has restored their energy. This is the true benefit of rebound exercise.

**Benefits**

- It is convenient

- Helps mobility

- Helps posture

- Helps balance

- Helps with fear of falling

- Reduces risk of osteoporosis

- Stimulates the thyroid and lymphatic system

## What Are The Side Effects Of Long Term Usage Of Synthroid

# What are the side effects of long term usage of Synthroid?

A potential side effect of taking Synthroid long-term, especially if a person is post-menopausal, is an increased risk of bone loss. The thyroid produces more than one hormone, but people are typically treated with only one hormone. So, what about the other hormones? You need these hormones—they are important for a healthy body. A lack of these essential hormones can lead to various symptoms, like bone loss. You may want to talk to your doctor about Armour® Thyroid. Armour Thyroid comes from a natural source and contains more than one thyroid hormone.

## What Does Progesterone Do For Men

# What does progesterone do for men?

Progesterone is a precursor for testosterone and helps maintain healthy testosterone levels. Potential progesterone benefits for men include the following:

•Anti-inflammatory

•Decreases inflammation in the brain

•Increases neurogenesis

•Protects against dementia, Parkinson's, and Alzheimer's

•Anti-depressant effects

•Helps increase the production of sperm

•Helps maintain muscle mass

•Supports the immune system

•Prevents the enlargement of the prostate

•Helps reduce the risk of breast tissue in men

Cholesterol is the raw material for all steroid hormones in the body. Statins block cholesterol and can inhibit your ability to make important hormones, leading to hormonal imbalance. Sardines, organ meats, fatty meat, and whole milk cheese are the best sources of cholesterol. Cholesterol is turned into pregnenolone, a “happy” hormone that helps increase other hormones. Pregnenolone is the precursor to progesterone.

## What Additional Treatments Or Lifestyle Changes Can Help Manage And Im 3F4D1C

# What additional treatments or lifestyle changes can help manage and improve sleep apnea, aside from conventional methods?

**Taking/eating garlic before bed is great for sleep apnea. Garlic in a pill form is a good idea, so you don’t experience indigestion.**

**Here are 7 reasons why garlic can benefit your sleep.**

1\. Garlic helps regular your blood pressure. By taking garlic, you can help lower high blood pressure levels. In turn, this may help you sleep much better.

2\. Garlic is a natural analgesic. Analgesics are things that help relieve pain.

3\. Garlic is naturally anti-fungal. Fungi can live in your sinuses, causing irritation and inflammation. In turn, this restricts your ability to breathe. Consuming garlic may help fight off inflammation-causing fungi.

4\. Garlic can help your lungs. If you have difficulty breathing, taking garlic may help support healthy breathing.

5\. Garlic is a natural anti-microbial. This means it can help fight off bacteria and other microbes that cause inflammation in your lungs and sinuses. Inflammation can restrict your breathing, which may contribute to sleep apnea.

6\. Fewer microbes also means less cortisol. Cortisol—also known as the “stress hormone”—is not good for quality sleep.

7\. Garlic helps improve your circulation. In turn, this promotes a relaxed state, which is better for sleep.

## Why Is Hormonal Acne So Hard To Treat

# Why is hormonal acne so hard to treat?

Hormonal acne is challenging to treat because it stems from hormone fluctuations during menstruation or conditions like polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS).

These underlying causes make traditional topical treatments less effective on their own; therefore, addressing external symptoms and internal imbalances through dietary and lifestyle changes is crucial in effectively treating this type of acne.

## What Are The Most Effective Strategies Or Therapeutic Interventions Fo Acdd03

# What are the most effective strategies or therapeutic interventions for managing and alleviating the symptoms of benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH)?

One theory is that too much testosterone can cause an enlarged prostate. This is false. In fact, your risk of an enlarged prostate increases with age, and you also have less testosterone (DHT) as you age. High estrogen is the real cause of an enlarged prostate.

Testosterone and estrogen oppose each other. So when you have high estrogen, your testosterone levels lower.

The most common reasons for high estrogen are consuming foods high in estrogen, adrenal fatigue, and having too much body fat.

**The best ways to reduce estrogen are:**

• Get on healthy keto to reduce your body fat

• Consume cruciferous vegetables

• Avoid estrogenic foods (GMOs, foods with added hormones, soy, etc.)

• Sea kelp

• Stinging nettle root (to reduce aromatase, which converts testosterone into estrogen)

## What Are The Potential Reasons For Waking Up Feeling Exhausted

# What are the potential reasons for waking up feeling exhausted?

Waking up exhausted in the morning can cause you to be less efficient during the day. There are several causes that could be behind this problem. True remedies should improve your sleep quality, making you feel more energetic when you wake up.

**Cause 1: Lights before going to bed**

Being exposed to light will reduce the production of melatonin (sleep hormone). If you have lights on around you before going to bed this effect can keep you awake.

**Cause 2: Chronic stress**

When you are undergoing constant stress it can cause difficulty sleeping, including not being able to rest fully at night. This is because your stress-regulating glands (adrenals) are worn out.

**Cause 3: Electromagnetic fields**

Electronic devices generate electronic waves around them if the device is plugged in, even if it is turned off. If you sit in front of the computer all day this can badly affect your sleep at night. The electronic waves decrease the production of melatonin (a sleep hormone) in your body.

**Cause 4: Caffeine**

Caffeine is a stimulant which can keep you up at night and cause you to have poor sleep. It takes time for the liver to detoxify such stimulants. Too much caffeine from coffee and tea will prevent your body from fully relaxing.

**Cause 5: Nutritional deficiency**

Not having enough nutrients can cause inefficient rest during sleep hours. There are several nutrients that are needed for good rest at night while sleeping. These nutrients have to do with keeping your nervous system and sleep hormones working properly to result in good sleep.

**Cause 6: Altered pH (too-acid or too-alkaline body)**

Your body may be too alkaline or too acidic. Let’s look at the symptoms of being too alkaline (alkalosis) or being too acidic (acidosis) because both of them can potentially cause sleep problems.

Alkalosis: If you’re too alkaline, your muscles are going to be tense and tight, which can cause cramping at night and in general.

## What Are The Common Symptoms Associated With Estrogen Dominance

# What are the common symptoms associated with estrogen dominance?

Estrogen is a hormone vital for women’s health and it is needed in smaller amounts for men. However, having too much estrogen can cause a lot of side effects.

**Symptoms:**

- Anxiety

- Irritability

- Breast tenderness

- Weepiness

- Cravings for chocolate

- Joint pain

- Acne

- Weight in hips and thighs

- Low libido

- Fibroids

**Cause #1: Consuming foods high in estrogen**

Consuming foods with high amounts of estrogen can cause estrogen dominance. The solution would be to consume foods that are natural estrogen blockers like cruciferous vegetables, while avoiding foods that have high amounts of this hormone.

**Cause #2: High percentage of body fat**

If you have a high percentage of body fat this can cause estrogen dominance. This is because your body fat produces estrogen itself. The less body fat you have the less estrogen will be produced by your own body.

## Can Elevated Estrogen Levels Contribute To The Development Of Acne

# Can elevated estrogen levels contribute to the development of acne?

Estrogen is a vital hormone that has many different functions in the body. However, if your body has excess estrogen it can be the reason for acne, especially if intermittent fasting and the Healthy Keto® diet have not resolved your skin problems.

## What Type Of Exercise Will Burn Fat

# What type of exercise will burn fat?

Short-duration, high-intensity interval training (HIIT) is effective for heart health and weight loss. Examples include spin biking, slamball, plyometrics, and sprinting. HIIT can boost VO2 max, growth hormone, and testosterone levels. The key is to alternate brief, intense exercise intervals with adequate recovery periods to stimulate the parasympathetic nervous system. A recommended HIIT routine involves 20-second intense workouts followed by 2 to 4 minutes of rest, repeated for 3 to 7 sets. Incorporating HIIT into your routine for 20 to 40 minutes can yield fat-burning effects lasting up to 48 hours post-workout.

## Why Does Fasting Lower Your Thyroid Hormone T3 A Little Bit

# Why does fasting lower your thyroid hormone T3 a little bit?

Sometimes, going on a fast can lower a thyroid hormone called T3. This is the active form of the thyroid hormone. 

The pituitary communicates to the thyroid through a hormone called the thyroid stimulating hormone. One of the main ways hypothyroidism is diagnosed is by looking at the thyroid stimulating hormone. When you’re fasting and doing the healthy keto diet, you won’t see a change in the thyroid stimulating hormone. So, you are not going to have a true hypothyroid condition. 

The thyroid releases T4, which is the inactive form of the thyroid hormone. To become activated, it has to work through the liver and into the kidney. It converts from T4 to T3 (the active form). There is also something called reverse T3, which is the inactive version of T3. What determines the rate and ratio of this conversion of T4 to T3 or reverse T3 is the metabolic need. 

When you do a fast, you may see a slight decrease in T3. But, you will see an increase in the reverse T3. You’re body is becoming more efficient with its fuel, so the need for the active form of the thyroid hormone is going to be slightly less. The body will then put some of that hormone into a reserve until you need it. 

**Situations where you could see higher amounts of reverse T3:**

**1\. When you’re doing fasting**

**2\. When you’re recovering from:**

• A stroke 

• An injury 

• Overtraining 

• An illness 

• A surgery 

**3\. When you’ve just lost a good amount of weight**

With menopause, you experience a drop in both hormones. But because of the ratio of the two, it appears as though you have estrogen dominance when, in fact, you have an estrogen deficiency along with a progesterone deficiency. It’s just that progesterone has dropped more than estrogen.

Some of the symptoms you may experience before and after menopause are hot flashes, breast atrophy, vaginal dryness, and no periods (amenorrhea). Of course, menopause is that life stage during which your periods naturally stop, usually around age 52. But your periods may stop before that because of a drop in estrogen.

Regardless of what age you are, if you have any of these symptoms it could be because of a drop in estrogen or progesterone

## Do Meat Products Contain Estrogen

# Do meat products contain estrogen?

## **Understanding Estrogen in Meat Products**

When it comes to estrogen in meat products, there's a lot of confusion and misinformation out there. Let's dive into the specifics of estrogen levels found in beef and other meats to clarify some common misconceptions about their impact on human health.

It's important to understand that all animal products contain some level of naturally occurring hormones, including estrogen. However, the amounts found in meat are generally quite low compared to what our own bodies produce.

### **Estrogen Levels in Beef vs. Human Production**

To put things into perspective, let's compare the natural estrogen production in humans with the amount found in beef. A young boy produces about 100 micrograms of estrogen daily, while one kilogram of beef contains less than 0.02 micrograms of estrogen.

That means a young boy's daily estrogen production is equivalent to the amount found in over 5,000 kg of beef. So, the idea that consuming meat will significantly increase your estrogen levels is simply not supported by the facts.

### **The Feasibility of Estrogen Intake from Meat**

Given the low levels of estrogen in beef, it's practically impossible to consume enough to significantly affect your body's estrogen levels. You'd have to eat an unrealistic amount of meat daily to even come close to impacting your hormonal balance.

Current research findings support this conclusion. Studies have shown that the estrogen content in beef is so minimal that it's unlikely to have any measurable effect on human health, even with regular consumption.

So, while it's true that meat products contain some estrogen, the amounts are negligible compared to what our bodies naturally produce.

Focusing on a proper diet and healthy lifestyle choices is far more important for maintaining optimal hormone levels than worrying about the trace amounts of estrogen in your steak.

## Does Fasting Affect Growth Hormone

# Does fasting affect growth hormone?

Growth hormone is naturally produced in the body and has many benefits, including boosting fat-burning, preserving and increasing muscle mass, boosting collagen (anti-aging), and increasing bone density. As you age, your body begins to produce less growth hormone.

Fasting can boost the production of growth hormone in your body, with a 2-day fast increasing levels by as much as 200% in the body. Adopting intermittent fasting will also boost growth hormone on a smaller scale, helping you preserve muscle mass better than a low-calorie diet can. The anti-aging effects of increasing growth hormone are a great reason to adopt intermittent fasting as an eating pattern.

## What Are The Most Effective Ways To Lose Belly Fat

# What are the most effective ways to lose belly fat?

Diets don’t work for belly fat. Why? Because it’s not a weight problem, it’s actually a hormone problem. It’s a cortisol problem. Diets don’t lower cortisol, they lower calories.  You also do not want to overtrain.

Exercise is a type of stress that can aggravate the belly. Instead of intense exercise, try going on long walks. 

Cortisol is a hormone from the adrenals. It’s triggered by all kinds of stress. 

**How to lose belly fat fast:**

• Minimize stress

• Sleep (Take Adrenal & Cortisol Support, try acupressure)

## Can I Consume American Cheeses On Keto

# Can I consume American cheeses on keto?

Many people prefer European cheeses over American cheeses.

The cheeses that contain the most probiotics are aged cheeses that aren’t heated. Keep an eye out for raw milk cheeses – these are the ones that you want.

Make sure the cheese you buy is organic and from grass-fed cows. Soft cheese has more friendly bacteria than hard cheese.
Here are some cheeses you should try:

- Cheddar

- Parmesan

## Does Fasting Help With Fear Related Disorders

# Does fasting help with fear-related disorders?

**Fear is an emotion that helps us survive, but it’s not good when the body is in a chronic state of fear.** 

**I believe one of the most powerful things you can do is fasting. There are many different things fasting can do for the brain, immune system, and mood. It can potentially elevate your mood from a chronic state of anxiety or fear to a much higher state.** 

Fasting is a survival mechanism that helps you survive in times of danger and tends to counter the fear emotion. It supports the adrenal glands, a structure in the brain called the amygdala, and the sympathetic nervous system. 

The amygdala has a lot to do with fear. The sympathetic nervous system (fight or flight) is located inside the adrenal glands and mid-back nerves. Some studies show that fasting may help the adrenal glands, amygdala, and sympathetic nervous system. 

**Potential benefits of fasting for fear-related disorders:**

• It may help improve a person’s mood 

• It increases GABA

• It increases dopamine 

• It reduces cortisol 

• It reduces the fight or flight mechanism by improving sympathetic nervous system dominance 

**How to do fasting for fear-related disorders:**

• Don’t eat if you’re not hungry, especially in the morning 

• Do two meals a day (lunch and dinner) with zero snacking 

Step 1. Do intermittent fasting without changing your diet 

Step 2. Do intermittent fasting with the healthy keto diet
