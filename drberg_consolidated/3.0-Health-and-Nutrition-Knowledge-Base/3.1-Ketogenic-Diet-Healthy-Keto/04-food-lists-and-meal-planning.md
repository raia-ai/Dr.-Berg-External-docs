## How Can I Do Keto On A Budget

# How can I do keto on a budget?

Is it expensive, doc? Not if you add intermittent fasting and you can keep the same quality of you can increase the quality because you're not eating as frequent. You're going to save money.

An average person who does one meal a day or two meals a day would save between, you know, two or three to $400 a month. So I think you can reinvest that in increasing more quality, but, um, you know, people think that junk foods or less healthy foods are cheaper. Not necessarily.

You could go, you can get healthier foods. And I just don't, I look at the grocery store and it's, I mean, even going to a fast food restaurant, it'sreally expensive. But being a college student at one time, I would live on like two burgers for a buck. And yes, there are different ways you can cheap out, but you know, you're going to have to maybe do dirty keto if you do that. But I think I would just do intermittent fasting and then keep the quality higher as you find a better job so you can afford more food.

## What Are The Health Benefits Of Paprika Including Its Effects On Metab 95D1Ed

# What are the health benefits of paprika, including its effects on metabolism, inflammation, and overall nutrition?

Paprika is made from dried and ground red peppers. Hungary is a major source of paprika. The spice became popular in the 19th century. When we talk about the health benefits of spices, we’re primarily talking about the phytonutrients in the spice. These phytonutrients are often related to the color of the pigments in it.

In paprika, there are various colors—yellow, orange and red. The yellow and orange pigments are alpha-carotene and beta-carotene.

Zeaxanthin, lutein, and B-cryptoxanthin are also yellow and orange pigments contained in paprika. These are great for your eyes. Red pigments include capsanthin and capsorubin. Together, these phytonutrients create some amazing health benefits. Take a look:

## What Are The Most Important Benefits Of Erythritol

# What are the most important benefits of erythritol?

Erythritol is a sugar alcohol but it doesn’t have alcohol in it. It is an alternative sweetener. It has a cooling factor and zero glycemic index: it does not increase the blood sugars.

In your body erythritol is absorbed in the small intestine, it gets into the blood, but it is excreted by the kidney unchanged. The microbes don’t like to eat it. There aren’t many side effects of erythritol. It has zero impact on insulin because it doesn’t affect the blood sugars.

**Benefits**

- Good sugar substitute on keto

- Has a cooling factor

- Zero glycemic index

**Dangers of erythritol in high doses (greater than 50 grams)**

- Gas

- Bloating

- Stomach noise

- Laxative effect

**How to consume it**

Use it as a keto-friendly sugar alternative.

**Where to get it**

## What Are The Nutritional Benefits Of The Bone Broth

# What are the nutritional benefits of the bone broth?

Bone broth, sometimes called stock, is a liquid made from boiling animal bones and connective tissue. It’s actually a really good thing to consume because you are getting a lot of electrolytes and nutrition without a lot of calories.

People usually eat a lot of muscle from an animal, but not the rest of the animal. They eat a lot of meat from chicken, beef, lamb, and pork. The problem with this is that muscle is very high in methionine, an amino acid, whereas bone broth provides glycine with a different amino acid profile.

Bone broth is actually a really good thing to consume because you are getting a lot of electrolytes and nutrition without a lot of calories.

**Benefits:**

1. Can help with sleep

2. Can help lower blood sugars

3. Can help build up neurotransmitters in the body

4. Supports your gut

5. Supports your joints

**Simple bone broth recipe**

1\. Get three pounds of bones, preferably from a farmer’s market.

2\. Put two gallons of water in a pot, then add the bones.

3\. Add two tablespoons of apple cider vinegar and let everything sit for 30 minutes so the acid can help break down the minerals in the bones.

4\. You can add herbs, spices, vegetables and sea salt.

5\. Bring to a boil, then lower the heat and simmer for 12 to 24 hours.

6\. The longer the broth simmers, the more nutrients are extracted. Your goal is to extract minerals, nutrients, collagen and amino acids from the bones.

7\. Let it all cool, then strain the solids from the liquid broth. Store the broth in glass jars.Use it in soups and stews.

**Where to get it**

You can also buy pre-made bone broth in a grocery store or order it online, for example the broth from a company called Kettle and Fire. They use animals that are grass-fed, pasture-raised and organic. They offer several flavors with excellent ingredients and no sugar or fillers. Their products are very keto-friendly.

## Healthiest Keto Cookies

# Healthiest Keto Cookies

The recipe for the healthiest cookies in the world:

**Ingredients**:

8 ounces (2 sticks) of butter (Organic -- or my favorite; Kerrygold Irish Butter)

4 Tbs. of xylitol (sweetener) (get on amazon.com or at the health food store)

2 cups of almond flour

2 cups of crushed pecans

1 chocolate bar (3.5 ounces) -- must be diabetic chocolate (I like Simply Lite® -- from Trader Joes)

1 pinch of sea salt

2 tsp. of vanilla extract

**Where to get:**

**Kerrygold butter:** most grocery stores, but Trader Joes, BJs, and health food stores have it. But any European butter or organic butter will work.

**Almond Flour:** most health food stores or on amazon.com

**Pecans:** you can find them at any grocery store, but on amazon.com they are less expensive.

**Xylitol:** you can find it at the health food store or amazon.com

**Simply Lite Chocolate:** Trader Joes or online.

**Directions:**

- Preheat oven at 325. Leave butter out of the refrigerator overnight -- must be soft. Mix the butter (8 ounces) with the xylitol (4 Tbs) with a mixer (or by hand) until very smooth. For time sake, mix with fork until a smooth consistency.

- Crush the pecans (in grinder, food processor or in a bag with a rolling pin). Make sure it's 2 cups after crushing.

- Breakdown (or grind) the chocolate bar (3.5 ounces) in a food processor or other means.

- Mix thoroughly the now sweetened butter, almond flour (2 cups), crushed pecans (2 cups), crushed chocolate bar, pinch of sea salt, 2 Tsp of vanilla extract in a bowl. You could, as an option, have your food processor mix it instead.

- Form little balls with your hands and roll them in some almond flour (to coat them), putting them on a cookie sheet with parchment paper.

- Cook for 13 minutes at 325 degrees, then let them sit out of the oven for 10 minutes.

- Transfer to the freezer until frozen. Then store them in the refrigerator.

Enjoy!!!!!!!!

**Mistakes:** 

1\. Let them completely cool down or they will crumble and disintegrate when you try to pick one up. I also put them in the freezer, make them solid and we're good to go. Consuming them cold and slightly frozen is much tastier than consuming them warm.

2\. I also found that using the "no sugar added" diabetic chocolate works better with milk chocolate, not dark chocolate.  

3\. Almond flour works better than almond meal.

4\. I also found that if you substitute crushed pecans with crushed macadamia nuts or crushed cashews (same amounts), it will add a different flavor, be very rich, and also crazy delicious. If you do this, make sure you do not add that pinch of salt, because macadamia nuts and cashews may already come with salt.

5\. Using vanilla extract.

6\. Leave the butter out of the refrigerator overnight.
