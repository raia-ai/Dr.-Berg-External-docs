- **[00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEELE4sv2Ts&t=0s)** — Let's talk about the seven foods that have the potential to increase longevity.
- **[00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEELE4sv2Ts&t=6s)** — Now, the majority of illnesses and chronic disease
- **[00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEELE4sv2Ts&t=9s)** — relates to the mitochondria at the cellular level.
- **[00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEELE4sv2Ts&t=14s)** — Anything that can help support or maintain or improve the mitochondria
- **[00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEELE4sv2Ts&t=20s)** — can potentially help you live longer.
- **[00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEELE4sv2Ts&t=22s)** — Anything that destroys the mitochondria, you're not going to live as long.
- **[00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEELE4sv2Ts&t=25s)** — And at the very top of the list, there's one molecule that's very, very powerful.
- **[00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEELE4sv2Ts&t=30s)** — It's called PQQ.
- **[00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEELE4sv2Ts&t=32s)** — What it does is it increases the number of mitochondria.
- **[00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEELE4sv2Ts&t=36s)** — And it is also involved in the continuous recharging and discharging
- **[00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEELE4sv2Ts&t=41s)** — of electrons in the battery in your mitochondria.
- **[00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEELE4sv2Ts&t=45s)** — Then you get into what's called physics, which involves electrons.
- **[00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEELE4sv2Ts&t=49s)** — So we're dealing with the creation of a battery.
- **[00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEELE4sv2Ts&t=52s)** — So the mitochondria has a very important function of creating ATP,
- **[00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEELE4sv2Ts&t=56s)** — which are mini little batteries.
- **[00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEELE4sv2Ts&t=58s)** — And this molecule, PQQ, can actually do both.
- **[01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEELE4sv2Ts&t=62s)** — It can help discharge and release energy and help recharge energy as well.
- **[01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEELE4sv2Ts&t=68s)** — It increases the number of mitochondria.
- **[01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEELE4sv2Ts&t=70s)** — It's very important in your brain, in your cognitive function.
- **[01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEELE4sv2Ts&t=73s)** — And if you're missing this molecule in your food, you have a lot of problems.
- **[01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEELE4sv2Ts&t=77s)** — And it's ten times stronger than resveratrol.
- **[01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEELE4sv2Ts&t=80s)** — And out of all the foods that have the most PQQ, it's the cacao.
- **[01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEELE4sv2Ts&t=86s)** — That is kind of the precursor to cocoa or chocolate.
- **[01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEELE4sv2Ts&t=89s)** — Then you have cocoa, which is heated, and chocolate is more processed.
- **[01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEELE4sv2Ts&t=93s)** — But even chocolate as a finished product, even though it's heated,
- **[01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEELE4sv2Ts&t=97s)** — has a large amount of this PQQ.
- **[01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEELE4sv2Ts&t=99s)** — Now, the negative part of chocolate usually comes in sugar.
- **[01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEELE4sv2Ts&t=104s)** — But if you were to get the, let's say, the 85% or maybe even 90%,
- **[01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEELE4sv2Ts&t=110s)** — you'd get just a very tiny bit of sugar.
- **[01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEELE4sv2Ts&t=112s)** — And the other negative part is that cacao is very high in oxalates.
- **[01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEELE4sv2Ts&t=117s)** — So if you're prone to kidney stones, probably not a good idea.
- **[02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEELE4sv2Ts&t=120s)** — But even in general, if you just have a small piece,
- **[02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEELE4sv2Ts&t=123s)** — you're getting a smaller amount of these oxalates,
- **[02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEELE4sv2Ts&t=126s)** — and it's probably not going to be a big problem.
- **[02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEELE4sv2Ts&t=128s)** — But just to make sure as an extra precaution,
- **[02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEELE4sv2Ts&t=131s)** — if you were to have this, you know, little bit of chocolate
- **[02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEELE4sv2Ts&t=135s)** — right after your lunch, and you had some cheese,
- **[02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEELE4sv2Ts&t=138s)** — that extra calcium will help reduce the oxalates being absorbed.
- **[02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEELE4sv2Ts&t=143s)** — But cacao or chocolate also has polyphenols.
- **[02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEELE4sv2Ts&t=147s)** — It's very, very high in magnesium.
- **[02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEELE4sv2Ts&t=149s)** — But polyphenols are also in berries, grass-fed meat,
- **[02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEELE4sv2Ts&t=154s)** — they're in grass-fed cheese.
- **[02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEELE4sv2Ts&t=156s)** — In fact, I submitted some of our cattle meat into a research project,
- **[02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEELE4sv2Ts&t=161s)** — and I got the results back, and there was like super high amounts
- **[02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEELE4sv2Ts&t=164s)** — of polyphenols in the meat, the animal meat.
- **[02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEELE4sv2Ts&t=167s)** — So when the animals eat the plants that have the polyphenols,
- **[02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEELE4sv2Ts&t=171s)** — you're going to get that indirectly.
- **[02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEELE4sv2Ts&t=173s)** — So polyphenols are another thing that increases the number of mitochondria.
- **[02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEELE4sv2Ts&t=178s)** — Polyphenols also increase SOD,
- **[03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEELE4sv2Ts&t=181s)** — which is something that helps to reduce oxidation, free radical damage.
- **[03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEELE4sv2Ts&t=187s)** — It also is an enzyme that reduces hydrogen peroxide in the cells.
- **[03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEELE4sv2Ts&t=190s)** — It has the potential to decrease inflammation.
- **[03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEELE4sv2Ts&t=193s)** — If your gut microbiome is not very good,
- **[03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEELE4sv2Ts&t=196s)** — if you have a lot of digestive issues, you might not benefit from polyphenols.
- **[03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEELE4sv2Ts&t=200s)** — But if you have a good gut microbiome,
- **[03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEELE4sv2Ts&t=204s)** — your microbes will help you absorb these polyphenols.
- **[03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEELE4sv2Ts&t=207s)** — And if the polyphenols are in the animal meat or the goat's cheese,
- **[03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEELE4sv2Ts&t=213s)** — that's probably a lot more bioavailable than consuming them straight from plants.
- **[03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEELE4sv2Ts&t=218s)** — Alright, coenzyme Q10 is also used in our mitochondria,
- **[03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEELE4sv2Ts&t=222s)** — especially the part where you're dealing with electrons.
- **[03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEELE4sv2Ts&t=224s)** — That's the last part of that whole cycle.
- **[03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEELE4sv2Ts&t=227s)** — So this coenzyme Q10 allows for these electrons to travel through
- **[03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEELE4sv2Ts&t=231s)** — and allows you to make ATP.
- **[03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEELE4sv2Ts&t=233s)** — Statins block an enzyme that also is involved in this coenzyme Q10.
- **[03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEELE4sv2Ts&t=239s)** — And so if you're on a statin, you better be taking coenzyme Q10,
- **[04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEELE4sv2Ts&t=242s)** — or else you're going to have a lot of muscle side effects.
- **[04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEELE4sv2Ts&t=246s)** — It increases the antioxidant capacity in your body.
- **[04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEELE4sv2Ts&t=249s)** — It's even a therapy for mitochondrial diseases.
- **[04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEELE4sv2Ts&t=252s)** — But it's also in liver, it's in red meat, it's also in fatty fish.
- **[04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEELE4sv2Ts&t=256s)** — Alright, next one is L-carnitine.
- **[04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEELE4sv2Ts&t=258s)** — It basically helps you burn the fat, okay?
- **[04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEELE4sv2Ts&t=261s)** — When you exercise, L-carnitine helps preserve muscle protein.
- **[04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEELE4sv2Ts&t=266s)** — L-carnitine helps you recover from exercise as well.
- **[04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEELE4sv2Ts&t=269s)** — Take a wild guess where you're going to get most of the L-carnitine.
- **[04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEELE4sv2Ts&t=272s)** — It's very high in red meat, the exact food that they tell you not to eat.
- **[04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEELE4sv2Ts&t=277s)** — So the next molecule is carnosine.
- **[04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEELE4sv2Ts&t=279s)** — This molecule greatly restores mitochondrial damage.
- **[04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEELE4sv2Ts&t=284s)** — It helps buffer the pH, it helps decrease inflammation,
- **[04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEELE4sv2Ts&t=287s)** — it gets rid of oxidative stress,
- **[04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEELE4sv2Ts&t=290s)** — it even decreases something called glycation, which occurs in diabetics,
- **[04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEELE4sv2Ts&t=295s)** — and it occurs when you're eating sugar.
- **[04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEELE4sv2Ts&t=297s)** — A lot of people who consume either sugar and protein or sugar and fat
- **[05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEELE4sv2Ts&t=300s)** — end up having this glycation which kind of binds up the protein.
- **[05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEELE4sv2Ts&t=303s)** — Well guess what?
- **[05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEELE4sv2Ts&t=305s)** — Carnosine will help get rid of that.
- **[05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEELE4sv2Ts&t=307s)** — And also carnosine delays aging.
- **[05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEELE4sv2Ts&t=310s)** — And take a wild guess what food you're going to find carnosine in?
- **[05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEELE4sv2Ts&t=313s)** — Red meat.
- **[05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEELE4sv2Ts&t=315s)** — Okay, the next molecule I want to talk about is called phycocyanin.
- **[05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEELE4sv2Ts&t=320s)** — Phycocyanin. This is in spirulina.
- **[05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEELE4sv2Ts&t=323s)** — This is not an animal product. It's an algae.
- **[05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEELE4sv2Ts&t=327s)** — That molecule not only improves oxidative stress,
- **[05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEELE4sv2Ts&t=330s)** — but also it can increase mitochondrial biogenesis.
- **[05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEELE4sv2Ts&t=333s)** — It can increase the number of mitochondria.
- **[05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEELE4sv2Ts&t=336s)** — It helps protect the DNA. It helps repair DNA.
- **[05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEELE4sv2Ts&t=341s)** — Number seven, EPA and DHA.
- **[05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEELE4sv2Ts&t=345s)** — These fatty acids both directly improve mitochondrial function.
- **[05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEELE4sv2Ts&t=349s)** — They decrease oxidative stress.
- **[05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEELE4sv2Ts&t=352s)** — They improve insulin sensitivity. They reduce inflammation.
- **[05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEELE4sv2Ts&t=356s)** — And you can find these omega-3s in salmon, sardines.
- **[06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEELE4sv2Ts&t=360s)** — You're going to find probably the most in cod liver and cod liver oil.
- **[06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEELE4sv2Ts&t=367s)** — Now, since we talked about the foods that extend your life,
- **[06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEELE4sv2Ts&t=369s)** — let's talk about the most dangerous food that could shorten your lifespan.
- **[06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEELE4sv2Ts&t=374s)** — And I put that up right here. Check it out.

- **[00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_Uro77TvvQ&t=0s)** — And there's something I recently learned that it's almost embarrassing to say that I should have
- **[00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_Uro77TvvQ&t=5s)** — known this long ago. And it relates to GROSS, which stands for Generally Recognized as Safe.
- **[00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_Uro77TvvQ&t=12s)** — And this designation goes along with certain chemicals that are put out in our environment
- **[00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_Uro77TvvQ&t=18s)** — in food, implying that it probably went through a lot of different safety studies, right? And
- **[00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_Uro77TvvQ&t=23s)** — it's regulated by the FDA. But apparently what I just learned about this is that the FDA allows
- **[00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_Uro77TvvQ&t=29s)** — companies to self-certify their poisons... I'm sorry, chemicals as being safe. And I mean,
- **[00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_Uro77TvvQ&t=37s)** — think about this. We have like 10,000 chemicals in our food supply and 99% of them have not
- **[00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_Uro77TvvQ&t=45s)** — really been reviewed for safety. And so this leads me to a new definition that I want to
- **[00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_Uro77TvvQ&t=51s)** — share with you. It's called a loophole. And relating to this topic, a loophole is something
- **[00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_Uro77TvvQ&t=56s)** — that a company can use to avoid certain restrictions. And that's exactly what this
- **[01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_Uro77TvvQ&t=64s)** — GROSS is. It's a big fat loophole that companies use to imply that their chemicals are safe,
- **[01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_Uro77TvvQ&t=70s)** — despite other testing done by other facilities, which is quite fascinating because
- **[01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_Uro77TvvQ&t=75s)** — many chemicals that are allowed in the U.S. are not allowed in Europe. Yeah, and today
- **[01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_Uro77TvvQ&t=80s)** — I'm just going to talk about six of these poisons. I mean, chemicals that are generally
- **[01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_Uro77TvvQ&t=87s)** — considered as safe. I like how they use the word generally, so they don't have to be that
- **[01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_Uro77TvvQ&t=92s)** — specific about it. So the first one on the list is nitrates. Nitrates are those things that
- **[01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_Uro77TvvQ&t=97s)** — they use to preserve meat. It's in like bacon, processed meats, things like that, to keep
- **[01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_Uro77TvvQ&t=105s)** — that meat from turning gray. So it keeps it red. It increases the shelf life, but it does
- **[01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_Uro77TvvQ&t=111s)** — increase the risk of cancer. It also could be in your drinking water. Now, here's the thing.
- **[01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_Uro77TvvQ&t=117s)** — When you see on the label that the nitrates are coming from something like celery juice,
- **[02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_Uro77TvvQ&t=122s)** — that's a completely different type of nitrate. I'm talking about things like sodium nitrate,
- **[02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_Uro77TvvQ&t=127s)** — things like that. Alright, number two, BHA. Okay, this is a preservative. This increases
- **[02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_Uro77TvvQ&t=133s)** — shelf life, but it's a known endocrine disruptor. It messes with your endocrine
- **[02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_Uro77TvvQ&t=138s)** — system and hormones. It's also been linked to cancer. It's considered our carcinogen.
- **[02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_Uro77TvvQ&t=144s)** — And if you ask someone about what causes cancer, you know, people will say certain
- **[02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_Uro77TvvQ&t=150s)** — toxins and chemicals in the environment. There's a whole classification of these toxins called
- **[02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_Uro77TvvQ&t=155s)** — carcinogens, right? And the accumulation of carcinogens could definitely increase your
- **[02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_Uro77TvvQ&t=160s)** — risk of getting a cancer. So that's BHA. There's another one called BHT, which is
- **[02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_Uro77TvvQ&t=166s)** — another preservative. And you see it in a lot of different foods. It too is an endocrine
- **[02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_Uro77TvvQ&t=170s)** — disruptor. It messes with your kidney, your liver, and it also increases cancer risk.
- **[02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_Uro77TvvQ&t=177s)** — So you just really need to read the labels and watch for these chemicals. And there's a
- **[03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_Uro77TvvQ&t=182s)** — lot of them too. Alright, next one on the list is called potassium bromide. This is a dough
- **[03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_Uro77TvvQ&t=188s)** — conditioner. I'm talking about the dough that you would use to make bread. It's used in a
- **[03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_Uro77TvvQ&t=193s)** — lot of flour products and it gives that product a certain texture, potassium bromide. Now potassium
- **[03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_Uro77TvvQ&t=199s)** — bromide is a carcinogen, okay? It causes cancer and it can definitely mess with the
- **[03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_Uro77TvvQ&t=204s)** — thyroid and it can inhibit iodine. And so the antidote or remedy or thing that you
- **[03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_Uro77TvvQ&t=210s)** — can use to counter bromide in the body is iodine, whether it's in sea kelp or when you
- **[03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_Uro77TvvQ&t=223s)** — Now this is a flavor stabilizer. Usually in beverages, especially citrus sodas,
- **[03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_Uro77TvvQ&t=231s)** — things like that, and it keeps the flavoring kind of constant so it doesn't fluctuate.
- **[03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_Uro77TvvQ&t=236s)** — But it's also a flame retardant. It affects your nervous system, which can affect your
- **[04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_Uro77TvvQ&t=242s)** — brain, which can affect your memory. This chemical can also interfere with iodine.
- **[04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_Uro77TvvQ&t=247s)** — And so iodine would be like the antidote or something to kind of counter the effects of
- **[04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_Uro77TvvQ&t=251s)** — But of course the best option is to just avoid the food that they put these chemicals in.
- **[04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_Uro77TvvQ&t=256s)** — Now the last one, titanium dioxide. This heavy metal gives candy kind of a smooth texture.
- **[04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_Uro77TvvQ&t=266s)** — Kind of like that surface area that's really shiny and bright because it also gives a
- **[04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_Uro77TvvQ&t=271s)** — white color. And if you actually have different colorings, as in food colorings,
- **[04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_Uro77TvvQ&t=276s)** — it can make those colors pop really bright and brilliant. And unfortunately a lot of these
- **[04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_Uro77TvvQ&t=281s)** — chemicals are in the foods that kids eat. And at that age they just don't have the judgment
- **[04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_Uro77TvvQ&t=285s)** — to be able to determine these chemicals yet. But it's up to the parent's judgment
- **[04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_Uro77TvvQ&t=290s)** — if the parent is aware of these chemicals. There's one little tiny problem with this
- **[04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_Uro77TvvQ&t=295s)** — heavy metal. It causes DNA breaks, damage with your chromosomes, which can link to an increased
- **[05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_Uro77TvvQ&t=303s)** — risk of cancer. And the kind of the antidote or remedy for that is a volcanic ash mineral
- **[05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_Uro77TvvQ&t=308s)** — called zeolite, as well as infrared sauna. But I think the best thing to do is just to avoid it.
- **[05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_Uro77TvvQ&t=315s)** — But typically we have in our bodies, especially in the liver, the ability to get rid of a lot
- **[05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_Uro77TvvQ&t=322s)** — of these poisons if we don't consume too many. However, when I'm doing this recent deep dive
- **[05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_Uro77TvvQ&t=328s)** — in DNA, I found quite a few people who have a problem with their detoxification genes. And so
- **[05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_Uro77TvvQ&t=336s)** — they have a lessened ability to get rid of these poisons, which means they need to avoid them
- **[05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_Uro77TvvQ&t=341s)** — as well as consume foods that help the detoxification process like
- **[05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_Uro77TvvQ&t=345s)** — cruciferous vegetables, which have certain phytonutrients that help stimulate this
- **[05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_Uro77TvvQ&t=350s)** — detoxification process. Now I have a really good video describing that phenomena right here. Check it out.

- **[00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kn_PpwqcQ-I&t=0s)** — Today I'm going to talk about seven strange signs that your body is begging for iodine.
- **[00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kn_PpwqcQ-I&t=6s)** — And the last one, number seven, is going to be the most important and the most interesting.
- **[00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kn_PpwqcQ-I&t=11s)** — The iodine in our soils have been depleted over the years. Iodine is not in the soil,
- **[00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kn_PpwqcQ-I&t=16s)** — it's not going to end up in the grass. If it's not in the grass, it's not going to be in the
- **[00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kn_PpwqcQ-I&t=20s)** — animal. And if it's not going to be in the animal, that's going to create a deficiency in
- **[00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kn_PpwqcQ-I&t=23s)** — you. Back in the 40s, there was a huge problem with goiters, where you have this enlarged
- **[00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kn_PpwqcQ-I&t=28s)** — thyroid and that was an iodine deficiency in certain parts of the country. This is when they
- **[00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kn_PpwqcQ-I&t=32s)** — introduced iodized salt. But then in the 70s, you know, this whole iodized salt kind of
- **[00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kn_PpwqcQ-I&t=37s)** — disappeared and it was replaced with sea salt. The problem is there's not a lot of iodine in
- **[00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kn_PpwqcQ-I&t=43s)** — sea salt. The combination of not getting enough iodine from our foods, and on top of that,
- **[00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kn_PpwqcQ-I&t=48s)** — there's certain things that will deplete iodine, like the fluoride in your water,
- **[00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kn_PpwqcQ-I&t=52s)** — the chlorine in the water. Especially if someone is a vegan, they're not consuming foods high
- **[00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kn_PpwqcQ-I&t=57s)** — in iodine. The more someone goes more vegetarian or vegan, the less they're going to start
- **[01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kn_PpwqcQ-I&t=62s)** — consuming shellfish, dairy, eggs, seafood that normally contain iodine. Let's go through this
- **[01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kn_PpwqcQ-I&t=68s)** — list right now. Number one, if someone starts losing the outer one third of their eyebrows,
- **[01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kn_PpwqcQ-I&t=73s)** — you can see I'm not losing my eyebrows. They're quite bushy. But if you start losing
- **[01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kn_PpwqcQ-I&t=78s)** — this part right here, suspect you are iodine deficient. Number two, hair loss. Iodine is
- **[01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kn_PpwqcQ-I&t=85s)** — crucial in making sure you have enough thyroid hormones that support your hair. And one of
- **[01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kn_PpwqcQ-I&t=90s)** — the biggest symptoms of a hypo low thyroid situation is hair loss. Number three,
- **[01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kn_PpwqcQ-I&t=97s)** — hoarseness. Almost like there's a lump in your throat, and that is because the thyroid is
- **[01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kn_PpwqcQ-I&t=101s)** — enlarging because it's trying to reach out and grab on to some iodine. That puts pressure
- **[01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kn_PpwqcQ-I&t=106s)** — on your vocal cords, which can not only affect your voice, but it can affect other
- **[01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kn_PpwqcQ-I&t=111s)** — areas as well. Number four is an enlarged tongue. Your tongue starts to get bigger.
- **[01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kn_PpwqcQ-I&t=116s)** — And the way that you're going to know that it's enlarged is you're going to look on the outer
- **[02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kn_PpwqcQ-I&t=120s)** — part of the tongue and you'll see these little indentations. Suspect you are deficient
- **[02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kn_PpwqcQ-I&t=124s)** — in iodine. Number five, unexplained weight gain. For no reason, you're just gaining more
- **[02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kn_PpwqcQ-I&t=129s)** — weight. You're not doing anything out of the usual. You just find your metabolism is
- **[02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kn_PpwqcQ-I&t=133s)** — super slow. Suspect an iodine deficiency because the iodine is not supporting the master
- **[02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kn_PpwqcQ-I&t=140s)** — metabolism gland in the body called the thyroid gland. You're going to notice that
- **[02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kn_PpwqcQ-I&t=144s)** — you're going to gain weight all over equally, not necessarily in one place. Number six,
- **[02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kn_PpwqcQ-I&t=151s)** — your estrogen is going to go up. That can show up as a heavy period or heavy cramping
- **[02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kn_PpwqcQ-I&t=157s)** — or headaches that time of the month, even waking in your hips. But then on the flip side,
- **[02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kn_PpwqcQ-I&t=163s)** — you might find that your testosterone is low, not just in men, but in women as well.
- **[02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kn_PpwqcQ-I&t=168s)** — Without a fully functioning thyroid, your estrogen is going to be high and your testosterone
- **[02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kn_PpwqcQ-I&t=174s)** — is going to be low. So many men are deficient in iodine. They can't make enough testosterone.
- **[03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kn_PpwqcQ-I&t=180s)** — The testosterone is not activated. A lot of men define that just when they reintroduce iodine
- **[03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kn_PpwqcQ-I&t=185s)** — into their diet, that handles their low testosterone route. The testosterone is not
- **[03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kn_PpwqcQ-I&t=189s)** — just about libido. Testosterone is a very potent anti-inflammatory. It helps certain things
- **[03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kn_PpwqcQ-I&t=194s)** — in your immune system reduce inflammation. Testosterone is all about preventing the loss
- **[03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kn_PpwqcQ-I&t=200s)** — of muscle, both in men and women. Testosterone also supports your bone health. So if you're
- **[03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kn_PpwqcQ-I&t=205s)** — deficient in testosterone, you may find that you're getting osteoporosis or even osteopenia.
- **[03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kn_PpwqcQ-I&t=210s)** — Number seven is the most interesting and most important about iodine. When you are
- **[03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kn_PpwqcQ-I&t=215s)** — deficient in iodine, your IQ will be lower. This is not just in small children. It's in
- **[03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kn_PpwqcQ-I&t=223s)** — at any age. Iodine affects your cognitive function from different angles. Number one,
- **[03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kn_PpwqcQ-I&t=229s)** — the thyroid directly affects the brain. There's two parts of the brain that have a lot of
- **[03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kn_PpwqcQ-I&t=234s)** — concentrated receptors for thyroid hormones. One is something called a hippocampus, which
- **[04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kn_PpwqcQ-I&t=240s)** — is all about executive function, making decisions, problem solving, giving you enough
- **[04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kn_PpwqcQ-I&t=246s)** — attention and focus. Certain people are more susceptible to this problem. If the child is
- **[04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kn_PpwqcQ-I&t=251s)** — one, two, three years old in the development, it's very important for them to get enough
- **[04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kn_PpwqcQ-I&t=256s)** — iodine. If you're deficient in iodine, you're going to have problems with your cerebral
- **[04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kn_PpwqcQ-I&t=260s)** — cortex, as well as your hippocampus. And this is going to show up in the inability
- **[04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kn_PpwqcQ-I&t=265s)** — to remember certain things, have a strong amount of attention and focus on certain
- **[04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kn_PpwqcQ-I&t=269s)** — things, problem solving functions, overall creativity will be diminished. The interesting
- **[04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kn_PpwqcQ-I&t=274s)** — thing about the IQ is that, yes, it's true that over the last 40 years IQ has been
- **[04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kn_PpwqcQ-I&t=280s)** — decreasing, but it's very difficult to measure the actual IQ over time, because there's not
- **[04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kn_PpwqcQ-I&t=286s)** — just one standard test that everyone does. Over the years, this test has been altered
- **[04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kn_PpwqcQ-I&t=291s)** — and changed. The way that we deliver this test has been changed. If we measured the IQ
- **[04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kn_PpwqcQ-I&t=296s)** — from someone in the 50s versus now, it's like apples and oranges. The glitch in this whole IQ
- **[05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kn_PpwqcQ-I&t=302s)** — test is we're not comparing your IQ with someone from 1950 with the same test. No,
- **[05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kn_PpwqcQ-I&t=308s)** — we're comparing your IQ to the average IQ from a random sampling. The IQ has been dropping,
- **[05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kn_PpwqcQ-I&t=315s)** — but you're not going to necessarily see it because we keep readjusting the normal. It's
- **[05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kn_PpwqcQ-I&t=321s)** — very similar to when you test testosterone. Now we know in 1950, testosterone for someone
- **[05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kn_PpwqcQ-I&t=329s)** — at 50 years old was a certain amount. And now it's a lot less. But if you look at
- **[05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kn_PpwqcQ-I&t=334s)** — those normal ranges are based on the average of the population. Basically comparing you to a bunch
- **[05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kn_PpwqcQ-I&t=341s)** — of unhealthy people. Yes, there are other factors. The school system, the way we're
- **[05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kn_PpwqcQ-I&t=345s)** — taught, the screen time, overall nutrition, but we can't forget about iodine. On just some
- **[05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kn_PpwqcQ-I&t=351s)** — random assessments, looking at urine iodine levels from 1990 to present time, we're at a
- **[05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kn_PpwqcQ-I&t=358s)** — 50% less iodine level. The most important thing about iodine is to provide the thyroid
- **[06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kn_PpwqcQ-I&t=363s)** — enough of its trace minerals for these thyroid hormones to work. Thyroid hormones go into every
- **[06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kn_PpwqcQ-I&t=370s)** — part of the body. They affect both the ovaries and the testicles. They help regulate or modulate
- **[06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kn_PpwqcQ-I&t=375s)** — or control estrogen dominance. Thyroid hormones directly help cognitive function as well as your
- **[06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kn_PpwqcQ-I&t=381s)** — mood. People with low thyroid are usually depressed. And if we're just talking about
- **[06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kn_PpwqcQ-I&t=385s)** — low thyroid, we're describing a hypothyroid condition. And by the way, hypothyroidism is
- **[06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kn_PpwqcQ-I&t=391s)** — one of the most common health problems worldwide. There's another partner trace
- **[06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kn_PpwqcQ-I&t=396s)** — mineral that's really important in Hashimoto's, which is the autoimmune hypothyroid condition.
- **[06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kn_PpwqcQ-I&t=402s)** — And that partner trace mineral is selenium. Instead of waiting until you get one of these
- **[06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kn_PpwqcQ-I&t=406s)** — symptoms, I suggest you just prevent an iodine deficiency by starting to consume foods
- **[06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kn_PpwqcQ-I&t=412s)** — in your diet that have enough iodine. And sea salt is not going to cut it. Here are the
- **[07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kn_PpwqcQ-I&t=421s)** — fish and fish from the ocean. Now you will get iodine from eggs and dairy, but only if that
- **[07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kn_PpwqcQ-I&t=427s)** — chicken or cow has enough iodine in their diet. Last important point about this topic, get a
- **[07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kn_PpwqcQ-I&t=432s)** — filter that filters out chlorine and fluoride to make sure both of those do not interfere
- **[07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kn_PpwqcQ-I&t=438s)** — with your thyroid. Also be careful of the toothpaste that is filled with fluoride, as
- **[07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kn_PpwqcQ-I&t=443s)** — well as getting fluoride treatments at the dentist. That can affect your thyroid as well,
- **[07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kn_PpwqcQ-I&t=448s)** — because it blocks iodine. Thanks for watching and I will see you in the next video.

*Click any timestamp to jump to that moment in the video*

- **[00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCWeTFsI2Lc&t=0s)** — Yeah, I want to bring up some really underappreciated factors in the relationship to treating the
- **[00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCWeTFsI2Lc&t=7s)** — thyroid, especially hypothyroidism with Synthroid or some other synthetic hormones. You know,
- **[00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCWeTFsI2Lc&t=14s)** — unfortunately, this is not a short-term treatment. It's a long-term treatment. And so, you're taking
- **[00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCWeTFsI2Lc&t=21s)** — this hormone like what are the side effects? Are there any side effects other than the total
- **[00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCWeTFsI2Lc&t=25s)** — dependency on this hormone that you're taking? But there's another side effect that I want to
- **[00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCWeTFsI2Lc&t=29s)** — talk about that you probably are not aware of. When someone takes Synthroid over a period of time,
- **[00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCWeTFsI2Lc&t=35s)** — especially if it's post-menopausal, there's a higher risk of getting bone loss or osteoporosis
- **[00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCWeTFsI2Lc&t=41s)** — or even osteopenia. So the question is why and how that relates to maybe a better option. So
- **[00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCWeTFsI2Lc&t=49s)** — this video mainly relates to those people who want to continue to do conventional care. They
- **[00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCWeTFsI2Lc&t=55s)** — don't want to do alternative care and or they're already on Synthroid. This is a really important
- **[01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCWeTFsI2Lc&t=61s)** — video for those people. You know, a lot of times when you get hormone therapy, whether it's
- **[01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCWeTFsI2Lc&t=65s)** — estrogen therapy or even thyroid therapy, you're given this one hormone. But I have an
- **[01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCWeTFsI2Lc&t=71s)** — interesting question. If you're getting treatment for the thyroid with one hormone
- **[01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCWeTFsI2Lc&t=76s)** — and the thyroid produces more than one hormone, what's happening with these other hormones? Or
- **[01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCWeTFsI2Lc&t=83s)** — say for example, you get a thyroidectomy, the complete thyroid removed, right? And then they
- **[01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCWeTFsI2Lc&t=89s)** — treat it with one hormone, which is T4. So what about the other hormones? What about T3? What
- **[01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCWeTFsI2Lc&t=96s)** — about T2? What about T1? That's right. And what about calcitonin? Calcitonin is another
- **[01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCWeTFsI2Lc&t=104s)** — hormone in your body and guess what? It's produced by the thyroid gland. So if you had
- **[01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCWeTFsI2Lc&t=109s)** — thyroid removed or you have hypothyroidism, what's happening with that hormone? Where is it coming
- **[01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCWeTFsI2Lc&t=116s)** — from? And why isn't your doctor giving it to you? Well, they might say, well, we don't really
- **[02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCWeTFsI2Lc&t=122s)** — understand that hormone. It doesn't seem to be a problem. But let's just take a look at what
- **[02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCWeTFsI2Lc&t=128s)** — it does. Okay, so you can understand that it does create problems if you're not taking it.
- **[02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCWeTFsI2Lc&t=134s)** — So calcitonin has everything to do with regulating calcium. It works with another gland
- **[02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCWeTFsI2Lc&t=141s)** — called the parathyroid hormone produced by the parathyroid, which is connected to the
- **[02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCWeTFsI2Lc&t=146s)** — thyroid. You have four of them, two in the top, two in the bottom. So both the thyroid
- **[02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCWeTFsI2Lc&t=150s)** — and the parathyroid work together to help balance mainly calcium, but also other things
- **[02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCWeTFsI2Lc&t=157s)** — like phosphorus and even to a lesser degree magnesium. So what calcitonin does is it
- **[02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCWeTFsI2Lc&t=164s)** — inhibits the breakdown of bone. Okay, there's certain cells in the bone that are called
- **[02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCWeTFsI2Lc&t=170s)** — osteoclasts and they break down bone to release calcium into the bloodstream. Whereas the
- **[02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCWeTFsI2Lc&t=176s)** — parathyroid hormone will increase calcium. It helps to mobilize calcium from the bone. So you
- **[03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCWeTFsI2Lc&t=182s)** — can see this teeter-totter effect between these two glands. Well, what happens when you have your
- **[03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCWeTFsI2Lc&t=188s)** — thyroid removed or your parathyroid removed? Either one. And here's the problem. When they
- **[03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCWeTFsI2Lc&t=193s)** — take out the thyroid, how do you preserve the parathyroid without damaging them? You
- **[03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCWeTFsI2Lc&t=198s)** — must have to either leave some pieces in there or sometimes maybe just remove the whole
- **[03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCWeTFsI2Lc&t=202s)** — thing. I don't know. But these parathyroid glands are very delicate and they're connected
- **[03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCWeTFsI2Lc&t=207s)** — to the thyroid. So many times when you remove one thing, the other is affected. Anyhow,
- **[03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCWeTFsI2Lc&t=212s)** — if you have your thyroid extracted or the parathyroid, you're now at risk for bone loss.
- **[03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCWeTFsI2Lc&t=218s)** — Okay, whether it's osteopenia, osteoporosis. And now you know why. Because you just removed
- **[03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCWeTFsI2Lc&t=224s)** — the two key hormones that help regulate calcium. Now there's another kind of ignored
- **[03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCWeTFsI2Lc&t=231s)** — syndrome that there's not a lot of information about but it's called hungry bone syndrome.
- **[03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCWeTFsI2Lc&t=238s)** — Where the bone just starts absorbing all this calcium, leaving the blood extremely low in
- **[04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCWeTFsI2Lc&t=244s)** — calcium. And this occurs when you either have your thyroid removed or especially when you
- **[04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCWeTFsI2Lc&t=249s)** — have your parathyroid removed. So now we have this other problem. We have low calcium in the
- **[04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCWeTFsI2Lc&t=254s)** — blood. Okay, here are the symptoms. And you should just know this. If you have these symptoms,
- **[04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCWeTFsI2Lc&t=259s)** — this could be why. You know, you just don't have enough of these hormones that regulate
- **[04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCWeTFsI2Lc&t=263s)** — calcium. So you might have numbness around the mouth or even in the extremities, hands and feet.
- **[04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCWeTFsI2Lc&t=269s)** — Also muscle spasms. You have tetany twitching in your muscles and various cramps maybe that
- **[04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCWeTFsI2Lc&t=276s)** — wake you up in the middle of the night. And you have certain bleeding or bruising because
- **[04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCWeTFsI2Lc&t=280s)** — calcium is also involved in the clotting factors. And without enough calcium,
- **[04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCWeTFsI2Lc&t=284s)** — it's hard to clot. But also realize you might be low in phosphorus which affects your
- **[04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCWeTFsI2Lc&t=289s)** — ability to make ATP, which is the energy reserve in the body, as well as a lowered amount of
- **[04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCWeTFsI2Lc&t=295s)** — magnesium. So these are just things that you should know about going into a surgery for your
- **[05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCWeTFsI2Lc&t=301s)** — thyroid or if you have hypothyroidism and you're getting treated or you're on
- **[05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCWeTFsI2Lc&t=306s)** — synthroid. They even have a treatment. It's giving someone calcitonin from salmon for
- **[05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCWeTFsI2Lc&t=314s)** — osteoporosis. Too much calcium in the blood. It's called hypercalciumium
- **[05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCWeTFsI2Lc&t=318s)** — because calcitonin helps lower calcium. And it's even used as a treatment for spinal stenosis,
- **[05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCWeTFsI2Lc&t=324s)** — which happens to be like a buildup of calcium in the spinal cord causing pain. Things like that.
- **[05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCWeTFsI2Lc&t=329s)** — So I think it's really important to understand that these glands make more than one hormone.
- **[05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCWeTFsI2Lc&t=335s)** — And if you're going to get treated with synthroid for some reason, I would bring up
- **[05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCWeTFsI2Lc&t=341s)** — the argument for taking armor thyroid. It comes from a natural source, an animal source,
- **[05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCWeTFsI2Lc&t=347s)** — but at least armor has T4, T3, T2, T1 and calcitonin. It was what they used before they
- **[05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCWeTFsI2Lc&t=357s)** — developed synthroid. It might be more difficult for the doctor to regulate,
- **[06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCWeTFsI2Lc&t=363s)** — but it contains all these hormones. So why wouldn't you want to take that or at least
- **[06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCWeTFsI2Lc&t=367s)** — maybe take both? I don't know, but you can work that out with your doctor. But the point
- **[06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCWeTFsI2Lc&t=371s)** — is when someone says that, well, we don't do that anymore, you better have a good reason for
- **[06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCWeTFsI2Lc&t=378s)** — it. For example, it's not going to create any problems. Well, show them the references
- **[06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCWeTFsI2Lc&t=382s)** — down in the description of this video of the higher risk for getting osteoporosis. Maybe
- **[06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCWeTFsI2Lc&t=388s)** — they're just not aware of it. I just wanted to put this information on your radar. And I
- **[06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCWeTFsI2Lc&t=392s)** — think it's really relevant to talk about the deeper causes of the thyroid as well. And I put
- **[06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCWeTFsI2Lc&t=397s)** — that information in this video right here.

## Video 5: How to Increase Blood Oxygen Levels: Breathing Hack

**Watch on YouTube:** [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HfknEr2ctRI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HfknEr2ctRI)

## Full Transcript with Timestamps

*Click any timestamp to jump to that moment in the video*

- **[00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HfknEr2ctRI&t=0s)** — I'm going to show you how to increase your oxygen with a simple breathing technique.
- **[00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HfknEr2ctRI&t=6s)** — There is a lot of confusion on this oxygen topic.
- **[00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HfknEr2ctRI&t=10s)** — And one of the big ones is if you deep breathe, you're going to get more oxygen.
- **[00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HfknEr2ctRI&t=14s)** — That is absolutely not true. In fact, if you want to prove it to yourself,
- **[00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HfknEr2ctRI&t=19s)** — just start deep breathing right now and see how long it takes before you end up passing out.
- **[00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HfknEr2ctRI&t=24s)** — You're going to start feeling dizzy. You're going to feel tired.
- **[00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HfknEr2ctRI&t=28s)** — So yes, when you're deep breathing, you're getting more air, but you're not getting more oxygen.
- **[00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HfknEr2ctRI&t=34s)** — You know, we have this false idea that oxygen is good and CO2 is bad. It's a waste product.
- **[00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HfknEr2ctRI&t=41s)** — But if we take a look at what's in air, there's a lot of oxygen. There's not a lot of CO2.
- **[00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HfknEr2ctRI&t=47s)** — If we do a comparison between oxygen and CO2 in units, it'd be like 160 units of oxygen per given amount of air.
- **[00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HfknEr2ctRI&t=57s)** — To one third of one percent, that's point three. Okay. CO2.
- **[01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HfknEr2ctRI&t=64s)** — So the question is, where is the CO2 coming from when we exhale? It's coming from our cells.
- **[01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HfknEr2ctRI&t=71s)** — The mitochondria takes in oxygen, burns stuff and releases CO2. So our bodies are CO2 machines.
- **[01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HfknEr2ctRI&t=80s)** — Of course, with plants, it's just the opposite. They eat CO2 and they put out oxygen.
- **[01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HfknEr2ctRI&t=87s)** — But I want you to understand something about CO2 and oxygen.
- **[01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HfknEr2ctRI&t=92s)** — There's something called the Bohr Effect. That's B-O-H-R. And the Bohr Effect kind of goes like this.
- **[01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HfknEr2ctRI&t=99s)** — The oxygen will not be released from your red blood cells unless you have enough CO2.
- **[01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HfknEr2ctRI&t=109s)** — The amount of oxygen that's released from your blood into your cells is dependent on CO2.
- **[01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HfknEr2ctRI&t=114s)** — If you're breathing a lot, right, and you're not able to have enough CO2 in there, you're going to get too much oxygen.
- **[02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HfknEr2ctRI&t=123s)** — Too much oxygen is very damaging to the body. If you gave a baby pure oxygen, you can actually cause blindness.
- **[02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HfknEr2ctRI&t=130s)** — You can cause an epileptic seizure. You could cause that baby to go in a coma.
- **[02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HfknEr2ctRI&t=136s)** — There's a lot of oxidation that happens with too much oxygen.
- **[02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HfknEr2ctRI&t=140s)** — And this is why deep breathing is not the best way to get a lot of oxygen and relaxation.
- **[02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HfknEr2ctRI&t=146s)** — Anyone that's in a panic state is going to be hyperventilating. They're going to be breathing excessively, trying to get more air.
- **[02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HfknEr2ctRI&t=152s)** — And it's very counterintuitive because they're going to get less air.
- **[02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HfknEr2ctRI&t=155s)** — You have something called acute hyperventilation and chronic hyperventilation, where a lot of people are in this chronic phase.
- **[02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HfknEr2ctRI&t=165s)** — We know about the acute hyperventilation when you're in a panic attack and you're breathing excessively and you don't feel very good.
- **[02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HfknEr2ctRI&t=172s)** — I want to increase your awareness on another condition called chronic hyperventilation.
- **[02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HfknEr2ctRI&t=177s)** — Another name for that is called carbon dioxide syndrome. This is a really interesting book I'm reading and I'm sharing some data from this book.
- **[03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HfknEr2ctRI&t=186s)** — So the carbon dioxide syndrome is basically a lack of carbon dioxide because the person is consuming too much air.
- **[03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HfknEr2ctRI&t=193s)** — And basically, I think a lot of this is triggered by stress and the stress is constantly keeping us trying to breathe more through our mouths.
- **[03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HfknEr2ctRI&t=203s)** — And this depletes the CO2 and now we can't absorb oxygen into the cells.
- **[03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HfknEr2ctRI&t=210s)** — And this causes problems with the heart, heart stress. It creates a condition of hypoxia, which is a lack of oxygen.
- **[03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HfknEr2ctRI&t=216s)** — It creates fatigue, insomnia, muscle twitching. And this other symptom, which is an increased histamine, which is fascinating,
- **[03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HfknEr2ctRI&t=226s)** — that a low amount of CO2 will increase histamines, which is going to cause a stuffy nose.
- **[03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HfknEr2ctRI&t=233s)** — Also, this lack of CO2 will create less carbonic acid and the blood becomes more alkaline.
- **[04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HfknEr2ctRI&t=240s)** — And then we have a big problem removing calcium from the cells.
- **[04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HfknEr2ctRI&t=243s)** — Calcium starts to accumulate because you have this chronic hyperventilation and a lack of CO2 is actually another reason why you would build up calcium in the tissues.
- **[04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HfknEr2ctRI&t=254s)** — And then the nerves don't work. You feel tingling. You probably notice that when you blow up a balloon or something, you might see stars or feel tingling throughout your body.
- **[04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HfknEr2ctRI&t=265s)** — Well, that's what's happening. The pH of your blood is changing.
- **[04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HfknEr2ctRI&t=268s)** — So just as a smoker has a lack of oxygen in their cells, when you get too much air, you also have a lack of oxygen deeper in the cells.
- **[04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HfknEr2ctRI&t=279s)** — Now, there's enough oxygen that's stuck in your blood cells, but it's not being released, which is going to cause you to try to breathe more.
- **[04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HfknEr2ctRI&t=286s)** — And the whole cycle starts going around and around.
- **[04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HfknEr2ctRI&t=288s)** — Now, there's a very simple solution to fix this problem and train your body to breathe in a certain way to get oxygen deep into the cells,
- **[04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HfknEr2ctRI&t=299s)** — to resolve a lot of health problems that you might not even be connecting to this problem of lack of CO2.
- **[05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HfknEr2ctRI&t=306s)** — So number one, relax breathing. OK, you want to breathe very soft and gentle.
- **[05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HfknEr2ctRI&t=312s)** — You want to breathe through your diaphragm and your stomach, not your upper chest.
- **[05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HfknEr2ctRI&t=319s)** — So you want to breathe in slowly for five seconds and then exhale for five seconds and then do that consistently in a gentle way without strain,
- **[05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HfknEr2ctRI&t=329s)** — especially before you go to sleep at night, especially when you're driving in traffic or watching TV.
- **[05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HfknEr2ctRI&t=335s)** — And then finally, you can start to train your body to breathe correctly because when someone's under stress, they kind of like...
- **[05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HfknEr2ctRI&t=342s)** — So this breathing method is one thing that you can control and change your entire physiology.
- **[05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HfknEr2ctRI&t=350s)** — You can pull yourself out of a sympathetic, fight or flight stress mode.
- **[05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HfknEr2ctRI&t=356s)** — And just so you know, I do this before I go to bed every single night.
- **[06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HfknEr2ctRI&t=360s)** — You can even get a free app that helps you time your breathing.
- **[06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HfknEr2ctRI&t=364s)** — So you can actually visualize like a ball expanding and contracting or some type of sound mechanism or some timing mechanism to practice this breathing in and breathing out frequency.
- **[06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HfknEr2ctRI&t=378s)** — All right, number two, you want to breathe through your nose, not your mouth. OK, the nose will condition the air, humidify it, cleans it.
- **[06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HfknEr2ctRI&t=386s)** — It filters out things every hour you're consuming about 500 liters of air.
- **[06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HfknEr2ctRI&t=393s)** — And if you go through your nose, you'll actually have way better quality air than if you go through your mouth, because first of all, you don't filter any microbes out or any particulates.
- **[06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HfknEr2ctRI&t=404s)** — They all just go right into the lungs.
- **[06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HfknEr2ctRI&t=406s)** — Whereas breathing through your nose, you have a chance to have a good immune filtering mechanism.
- **[06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HfknEr2ctRI&t=412s)** — You also have restriction of air, which, by the way, will increase your oxygen by 20 percent just by breathing through your nose.
- **[07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HfknEr2ctRI&t=424s)** — It's going to feel like your air is restrictive, but you're going to get more oxygen.
- **[07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HfknEr2ctRI&t=429s)** — And three and four involve sleeping at night. You can get those nose strips, those nasal strips.
- **[07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HfknEr2ctRI&t=435s)** — They go right across here, opens up the top of your sinuses.
- **[07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HfknEr2ctRI&t=439s)** — You can breathe a little bit better, especially if you have a stuffy nose.
- **[07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HfknEr2ctRI&t=442s)** — And then you can get some mouth tape, OK, that you just put a little piece of tape right here when you're sleeping at night to train you to breathe through your sinuses.
- **[07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HfknEr2ctRI&t=453s)** — So you can filter the air all night long. You can get more oxygen. You'll have better sleep.
- **[07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HfknEr2ctRI&t=460s)** — You won't wake up with a dry mouth. You probably won't be snoring anymore. And you'll wake up feeling refreshed.
- **[07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HfknEr2ctRI&t=468s)** — There's some additional information on drinking carbonated water, which is basically CO2 and water that I think you'll find very fascinating.
- **[07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HfknEr2ctRI&t=478s)** — I am way more hydrated when I consume carbonated water than if I just drank plain water.
- **[08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HfknEr2ctRI&t=483s)** — And for that information, I put this video up right here. Check it out.

- **[00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kEs2epLMq4Y&t=0s)** — Did you realize that raw milk and cheese cause 840 times more illness than pasteurized milk and cheese?
- **[00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kEs2epLMq4Y&t=11s)** — I mean, this is like really scary, if it was true. It was being advertised by a media company.
- **[00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kEs2epLMq4Y&t=18s)** — I mean, why would a media company pay for an ad to scare people against raw milk?
- **[00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kEs2epLMq4Y&t=23s)** — So today we're going to talk about is raw milk and raw cheese really that much more dangerous
- **[00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kEs2epLMq4Y&t=28s)** — than pasteurized milk or cheese? You know, they say that raw milk is the number one cause of pathogens in dairy.
- **[00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kEs2epLMq4Y&t=36s)** — And I question that, like, is it really the raw milk that's causing the problem? Or is it the contaminated milk?
- **[00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kEs2epLMq4Y&t=43s)** — I mean, just because something is pasteurized does not automatically make it safe.
- **[00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kEs2epLMq4Y&t=48s)** — And of course, they're going to talk about, oh, there's like high amounts of E. coli in raw milk.
- **[00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kEs2epLMq4Y&t=52s)** — Well, first of all, E. coli is not only in raw milk, it's also in pasteurized milk.
- **[00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kEs2epLMq4Y&t=58s)** — In fact, in your body right now, you have E. coli. E. coli is part of the friendly bacteria that we have in our gut.
- **[01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kEs2epLMq4Y&t=67s)** — In fact, E. coli helps us digest. But there's a point where E. coli can become pathogenic
- **[01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kEs2epLMq4Y&t=73s)** — in the right environment. But it's not necessarily just because something is raw.
- **[01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kEs2epLMq4Y&t=78s)** — So it's my opinion that the problems that come along with raw milk really have to do with farms that are not clean.
- **[01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kEs2epLMq4Y&t=85s)** — And this is why it's so important to really know where you're getting your milk.
- **[01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kEs2epLMq4Y&t=89s)** — And this goes for cheese as well. I mean, if you take raw cheese versus pasteurized cheese,
- **[01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kEs2epLMq4Y&t=94s)** — there's a big, big difference. First of all, the way they test to make sure that something is
- **[01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kEs2epLMq4Y&t=100s)** — thoroughly pasteurized is they measure how much activity that this certain enzyme has.
- **[01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kEs2epLMq4Y&t=106s)** — So if this enzyme is inactive, then it's pasteurized. And so when they pasteurize and get
- **[01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kEs2epLMq4Y&t=111s)** — rid of that enzyme, the question is, do you really get the benefits of building bone,
- **[01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kEs2epLMq4Y&t=117s)** — making calcium and phosphorus very bioavailable? And then we get another enzyme that gets
- **[02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kEs2epLMq4Y&t=122s)** — destroyed when you pasteurize the milk. And that is called lactase. Lactase is an enzyme
- **[02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kEs2epLMq4Y&t=128s)** — to help break down milk sugar lactose. But when I do raw milk, and especially raw milk
- **[02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kEs2epLMq4Y&t=134s)** — that has that enzyme in it, lactase, I don't have any digestive problems at all. So only the raw
- **[02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kEs2epLMq4Y&t=140s)** — dairy has that enzyme to help break down milk sugar. There's been some research done to show
- **[02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kEs2epLMq4Y&t=144s)** — that children that consume raw milk versus pasteurized milk have lower incidence of asthma,
- **[02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kEs2epLMq4Y&t=151s)** — allergies, decreased incidence of ear infections, and eczema, and even less respiratory
- **[02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kEs2epLMq4Y&t=157s)** — infection. You're going to get a lot of support for the immune system. There are a lot
- **[02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kEs2epLMq4Y&t=161s)** — different immune factors that get destroyed with the pasteurization. Then you get the
- **[02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kEs2epLMq4Y&t=166s)** — other benefit of raw milk and raw milk cheese with probiotics. So what are probiotics? Those
- **[02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kEs2epLMq4Y&t=173s)** — are friendly bacteria. When you consume things like cheese or kefir, you're getting not only
- **[03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kEs2epLMq4Y&t=180s)** — a good probiotic, but a probiotic that can actually reseed your gut. I mean, I think people
- **[03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kEs2epLMq4Y&t=185s)** — think about yogurt and kefir as a probiotic, but they don't think about raw cheese as a
- **[03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kEs2epLMq4Y&t=190s)** — probiotic as well. However, in America, if a cheese is fermented over 60 days, it can be
- **[03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kEs2epLMq4Y&t=198s)** — considered raw. So recently I was in Bethesda shopping at this boutique specialty store,
- **[03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kEs2epLMq4Y&t=204s)** — and I was trying to find some European cheeses, and I found a bunch of them and some
- **[03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kEs2epLMq4Y&t=210s)** — American cheeses that said that they're raw. So they were fermented over 60 days. And I
- **[03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kEs2epLMq4Y&t=215s)** — went home and I was consuming these cheeses, and I found one that was really delicious.
- **[03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kEs2epLMq4Y&t=219s)** — It was actually from America called Meadow Creek Dairy Cheese. I got the package after
- **[03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kEs2epLMq4Y&t=226s)** — consuming all the cheese and I said, I gotta find out where to get more of this, right?
- **[03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kEs2epLMq4Y&t=231s)** — I found out it's about 40 minutes away from my farm in southern Virginia. And then after
- **[03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kEs2epLMq4Y&t=236s)** — studying their website, I realized why it was so good. And apparently they bred, not only was
- **[04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kEs2epLMq4Y&t=240s)** — it raw, but the farm is super clean, French cows with certain American cows, and they just
- **[04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kEs2epLMq4Y&t=248s)** — spend the time to do it right. There are a lot of different options with cheeses, but
- **[04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kEs2epLMq4Y&t=251s)** — this one's a good one. I'll put the link down below. I like the Mountaineer hard cheese
- **[04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kEs2epLMq4Y&t=256s)** — from that company. Now there's probably not a difference in nutrients between raw cheese
- **[04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kEs2epLMq4Y&t=261s)** — and pasteurized cheese, but the bioavailability of calcium, phosphorus, magnesium, and other
- **[04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kEs2epLMq4Y&t=267s)** — minerals are probably a lot better from raw cheese just because it's raw and it has more
- **[04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kEs2epLMq4Y&t=271s)** — enzymes. And of course, I always want to get the raw cheese that's from grass-fed cows.
- **[04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kEs2epLMq4Y&t=276s)** — And that way I'll have the right omega-6, omega-3 ratios. And also there's another great
- **[04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kEs2epLMq4Y&t=282s)** — compound called CLA, which helps you lose weight. It's good for energy. It's anti-inflammatory.
- **[04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kEs2epLMq4Y&t=289s)** — So in summary, do I think raw milk is safe? Absolutely. If it is purchased from a farm
- **[04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kEs2epLMq4Y&t=295s)** — that is clean, so you need to study up on the farm that you buy your raw milk from,
- **[04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kEs2epLMq4Y&t=299s)** — or raw milk cheese, and then make your own decisions.

## Video 7: The #1 Most Important Nutrient for Hypothyroidism

- **[00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ykJdD-W_n8&t=0s)** — There's one really important nutrient involved with hypothyroidism that you need to know about.
- **[00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ykJdD-W_n8&t=7s)** — Now this also relates to a hyperthyroidism too. So if you have any problems with your thyroid,
- **[00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ykJdD-W_n8&t=12s)** — this video is going to be very, very important. Now the first thing to know is that 90%
- **[00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ykJdD-W_n8&t=18s)** — of all hypothyroid problems is an autoimmune disease called Hashimoto's. In most cases of
- **[00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ykJdD-W_n8&t=25s)** — hypothyroidism is also an autoimmune condition. What is an autoimmune condition? It's a situation
- **[00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ykJdD-W_n8&t=31s)** — where you have cells made by your own body. They're very specific types of antibodies
- **[00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ykJdD-W_n8&t=40s)** — against the body, little cells, that actually attack your thyroid. So you have these cells
- **[00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ykJdD-W_n8&t=47s)** — that are programmed to think that your thyroid is like a pathogen. So these antibodies attack
- **[00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ykJdD-W_n8&t=53s)** — your thyroid and prevent it from functioning. And they create a constant inflammatory condition
- **[00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ykJdD-W_n8&t=58s)** — as well. And 90% of all hypothyroid cases are autoimmune. Now let's talk about this one
- **[01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ykJdD-W_n8&t=64s)** — nutrient that's really important. You probably thought it would be iodine. It's not. Iodine is
- **[01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ykJdD-W_n8&t=69s)** — very, very important because without iodine you can't make thyroid hormones. But selenium is
- **[01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ykJdD-W_n8&t=76s)** — really important and you're going to understand why in a minute. Because most of the selenium
- **[01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ykJdD-W_n8&t=82s)** — in your body is mostly concentrated in your thyroid if you go by the weight of that tissue.
- **[01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ykJdD-W_n8&t=87s)** — And if you have a hypothyroid condition, chances are you're probably deficient in selenium. It's
- **[01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ykJdD-W_n8&t=93s)** — very, very common to have a deficiency. And when you get diagnosed with this autoimmune disease,
- **[01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ykJdD-W_n8&t=99s)** — the three main antibodies that they find a problem with involves one that's called
- **[01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ykJdD-W_n8&t=106s)** — thyroid peroxidase. So these antibodies to thyroid peroxidase really inhibits your ability
- **[01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ykJdD-W_n8&t=113s)** — to make thyroid hormones. Because one of the functions of thyroid peroxidase is the production,
- **[01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ykJdD-W_n8&t=119s)** — the synthesis of thyroid hormones. And so you can just imagine by blocking that, you're not
- **[02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ykJdD-W_n8&t=124s)** — going to make enough thyroid hormones. Thus having a lowered amount of thyroid hormones.
- **[02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ykJdD-W_n8&t=129s)** — That's called hypothyroidism. And then there's another one, okay, that involves the receptor
- **[02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ykJdD-W_n8&t=135s)** — for thyroid stimulating hormone. That's that hormone from the pituitary that's sent down to
- **[02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ykJdD-W_n8&t=140s)** — the blood that connects to the thyroid and tells the thyroid to make thyroid hormones.
- **[02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ykJdD-W_n8&t=145s)** — And that receptor is called thyroglobulin receptor. So if you have antibodies against
- **[02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ykJdD-W_n8&t=150s)** — that receptor, you're not able to receive the message that tells the thyroid to make
- **[02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ykJdD-W_n8&t=156s)** — thyroid hormones. So you can imagine what kind of problems you're going to have if you have
- **[02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ykJdD-W_n8&t=165s)** — can help significantly reduce these antibodies. And it's something natural that you can take,
- **[02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ykJdD-W_n8&t=173s)** — and it's in your food, but you can take it in small amounts to help you. Also selenium
- **[02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ykJdD-W_n8&t=178s)** — improves the thyroid as a whole. Okay, so that's another benefit. Selenium also helps you
- **[03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ykJdD-W_n8&t=187s)** — T4 to T3. T3 is the active form. T4 is not. So T4 really doesn't do much in your body unless
- **[03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ykJdD-W_n8&t=196s)** — it's converted with the help of selenium. I mean, think about this. Let's say, for example,
- **[03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ykJdD-W_n8&t=203s)** — you don't have enough selenium and you're taking Synthroid, for example, which is T4,
- **[03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ykJdD-W_n8&t=208s)** — synthetic T4. And your problem is you can't convert it to the active form. You're not
- **[03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ykJdD-W_n8&t=214s)** — see much change. You might have normal T4 in your blood, but what about the T3? You really need to
- **[03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ykJdD-W_n8&t=219s)** — look at that to make sure that is insufficient amounts. And so the point is, where's the real
- **[03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ykJdD-W_n8&t=225s)** — problem? Is it in the conversion? Is it in the production? Selenium has also been known
- **[03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ykJdD-W_n8&t=230s)** — to decrease mixed edema, which is a big problem for hypothyroid situations. It looks like that,
- **[03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ykJdD-W_n8&t=236s)** — but it's not fat. It's like the puffiness that is throughout the body that makes you look
- **[04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ykJdD-W_n8&t=241s)** — fat, but it's not an actual fat. Now selenium also decreases inflammation. Why? Because it's
- **[04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ykJdD-W_n8&t=248s)** — involved in making glutathione one of the most powerful antioxidants in the body. And this is
- **[04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ykJdD-W_n8&t=256s)** — why selenium is so important with your liver as well. And that's a whole different topic,
- **[04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ykJdD-W_n8&t=261s)** — but selenium can help prevent a fatty liver. It can help prevent inflammation in the liver.
- **[04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ykJdD-W_n8&t=266s)** — It can help prevent fibrosis in your liver. It can decrease your liver enzymes. It can even
- **[04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ykJdD-W_n8&t=273s)** — decrease the risk of liver cancer. Now selenium is also high in certain types of fish. And so
- **[04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ykJdD-W_n8&t=281s)** — if you're concerned about getting mercury from certain fish, fish also has selenium,
- **[04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ykJdD-W_n8&t=286s)** — which makes this protein that helps get rid of mercury in cadmium. Now mercury has been linked
- **[04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ykJdD-W_n8&t=294s)** — to autoimmune conditions of your thyroid. And cadmium by itself directly inhibits the
- **[05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ykJdD-W_n8&t=301s)** — production of thyroid hormones. So here's yet another reason why selenium is so important
- **[05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ykJdD-W_n8&t=307s)** — for these conditions. Selenium even decreased the risk of getting an autoimmune condition.
- **[05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ykJdD-W_n8&t=313s)** — Because apparently when you're low in selenium, there's a higher level of initiation of
- **[05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ykJdD-W_n8&t=320s)** — autoimmune problems. It's kind of like the match that triggers the fire. And also as a by-product
- **[05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ykJdD-W_n8&t=326s)** — of thyroid metabolism, you have this hydrogen peroxide. So selenium helps you make glutathione
- **[05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ykJdD-W_n8&t=332s)** — that helps you deal with this hydrogen peroxide, which is... can create a toxicity
- **[05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ykJdD-W_n8&t=337s)** — in your thyroid. Also when you get Graves' disease, which is a hyper thyroid problem,
- **[05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ykJdD-W_n8&t=343s)** — a lot of times you get these bulging eyes. Well selenium helps reduce that symptom too.
- **[05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ykJdD-W_n8&t=348s)** — Now where do you get selenium? Well it's in meat, it's in fish, it's in eggs, it's in dairy,
- **[05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ykJdD-W_n8&t=353s)** — cruciferous vegetables like cabbage and broccoli, it's in nuts, it's in onions,
- **[05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ykJdD-W_n8&t=358s)** — it's in garlic, and it's definitely in organ meats. Selenium can also help decrease
- **[06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ykJdD-W_n8&t=364s)** — the risk of getting those thyroid nodules. And it can even help prevent the enlargement of
- **[06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ykJdD-W_n8&t=370s)** — your thyroid. And your thyroid has other mechanisms of accumulating selenium, helping
- **[06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ykJdD-W_n8&t=375s)** — recycling it, and making sure that you're not ending up in a low selenium situation.
- **[06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ykJdD-W_n8&t=382s)** — I hope you now know the importance of selenium as it relates to the thyroid. As far as doses
- **[06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ykJdD-W_n8&t=387s)** — go of selenium, of course I would always recommend eating foods high in selenium,
- **[06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ykJdD-W_n8&t=392s)** — but I would recommend 200 micrograms of selenium each day in a nice base of other trace
- **[06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ykJdD-W_n8&t=399s)** — minerals just to make sure you're not creating an imbalance. And if it is true that you
- **[06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ykJdD-W_n8&t=403s)** — have these antibodies, you have this autoimmune condition, whether it's Graves or Hashimoto's,
- **[06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ykJdD-W_n8&t=410s)** — I also recommend another product. I don't sell it. I'm not affiliated with the company that
- **[06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ykJdD-W_n8&t=414s)** — does, but it's called Thytrophin PMG. It's from a product developed by Standard Process.
- **[07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ykJdD-W_n8&t=420s)** — Okay, so you can look that up. You would take one before bed. And that works a little
- **[07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ykJdD-W_n8&t=424s)** — bit differently, but I think the combination of both of these would be very, very important
- **[07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ykJdD-W_n8&t=428s)** — in helping you recover. And for more information about that,
- **[07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ykJdD-W_n8&t=432s)** — I included that in this video right here. You should check it out.

- **[00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiVFIRyXhIw&t=0s)** — The 10 dangerous foods, RFK, is in the process of banning.
- **[00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiVFIRyXhIw&t=3s)** — These things that we're going to talk about don't even remotely come close to being food.
- **[00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiVFIRyXhIw&t=7s)** — The amount of money, big corporations, big pharma, big food, the chemical companies,
- **[00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiVFIRyXhIw&t=12s)** — the amount of pushback that he's getting internally and externally is off the charts.
- **[00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiVFIRyXhIw&t=18s)** — Today we're going to talk about all the good things that he's doing, starting with number
- **[00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiVFIRyXhIw&t=21s)** — one, getting rid of the food dyes. There's absolutely no benefit to having these toxic
- **[00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiVFIRyXhIw&t=26s)** — colorings in our foods. What's really interesting about the link of cancer is there's this thing
- **[00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiVFIRyXhIw&t=31s)** — called the Delaney Clause. This was something that was passed that prohibits food ingredients
- **[00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiVFIRyXhIw&t=38s)** — found to cause cancer in either humans or animals to not be put in our food supply.
- **[00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiVFIRyXhIw&t=43s)** — Of course, in 1996, there was another thing that was passed called the Food Quality
- **[00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiVFIRyXhIw&t=48s)** — Protection Act, allowing these chemicals to be put back into the food supply.
- **[00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiVFIRyXhIw&t=52s)** — Thus, the many different things in our food supply that do cause cancer.
- **[00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiVFIRyXhIw&t=56s)** — Moving on to number two, the SNAP program. This is the food stamp program. RFK is actively
- **[01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiVFIRyXhIw&t=62s)** — and aggressively working on getting rid of the junk from that program. In other words,
- **[01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiVFIRyXhIw&t=67s)** — not allowing you to use food stamps to buy soda with high-fructose corn syrup. There's a
- **[01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiVFIRyXhIw&t=72s)** — lot of pushback on this, including the American Heart Association, funded by the junk food
- **[01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiVFIRyXhIw&t=77s)** — industry and Big Pharma. Just so happens, their messaging aligns with those two very closely.
- **[01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiVFIRyXhIw&t=84s)** — In a recent debate involving this bill that they were supposed to be approving to not include
- **[01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiVFIRyXhIw&t=89s)** — junk foods in the SNAP program, guess who showed up? A representative from the American
- **[01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiVFIRyXhIw&t=94s)** — Heart Association pushing back on that. You have to realize that the taxpayers pay for the
- **[01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiVFIRyXhIw&t=99s)** — SNAP program. What is wrong with this picture? Well, you are paying for this problem three
- **[01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiVFIRyXhIw&t=104s)** — times. You are paying for the raw material to be sold very cheaply. And then you are actually
- **[01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiVFIRyXhIw&t=109s)** — paying a second time, paying people to buy those exact products. And when they get a
- **[01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiVFIRyXhIw&t=113s)** — chronic disease, you pay a third time funding the Medicaid program. So I totally back up
- **[01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiVFIRyXhIw&t=119s)** — RFK for getting the junk out of the SNAP program. Number three, titanium dioxide.
- **[02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiVFIRyXhIw&t=124s)** — They put in food to make the food look more pure or healthier in some way. In France,
- **[02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiVFIRyXhIw&t=130s)** — they banned it because they found it caused DNA damage. It has the ability to get into the brain.
- **[02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiVFIRyXhIw&t=136s)** — It is also considered carcinogen. That is an ingredient that RFK is working on getting out
- **[02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiVFIRyXhIw&t=142s)** — of our food supply. Number four, brominated vegetable oil. You have to realize it has
- **[02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiVFIRyXhIw&t=148s)** — nothing to do with actual vegetables. It is actually a flame retardant. Use it in soft
- **[02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiVFIRyXhIw&t=153s)** — drinks. That is right, soda. It is considered safe. It is also banned in Europe, Japan,
- **[02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiVFIRyXhIw&t=158s)** — and India. But of course, it is allowed in the U.S. Number five, potassium bromate. RFK is also
- **[02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiVFIRyXhIw&t=165s)** — trying to get rid of this, especially with children's lunches. It allows the dough to be
- **[02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiVFIRyXhIw&t=170s)** — fluffy and has the right texture. It is also a possible carcinogen to humans. Also, as another
- **[02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiVFIRyXhIw&t=176s)** — side note, it has been banned in 30 countries, except the U.S. Some people think that RFK has
- **[03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiVFIRyXhIw&t=183s)** — the ability in HHS to just press a ban button and ban it like that. No. And I am even shocked
- **[03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiVFIRyXhIw&t=189s)** — how much he is getting done because he is up against a lot of resistance. Number six,
- **[03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiVFIRyXhIw&t=196s)** — high fructose corn syrup. Most people know this is really bad. RFK will definitely lead to
- **[03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiVFIRyXhIw&t=202s)** — liver damage, fatty liver, type 2 diabetes, heart disease. I know a lot of activists have
- **[03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiVFIRyXhIw&t=207s)** — tried to get this banned or at least limited within the children's school system. With not
- **[03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiVFIRyXhIw&t=215s)** — too much luck, high fructose corn syrup is one out of 4,000 different products that they extract
- **[03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiVFIRyXhIw&t=222s)** — from corn. It has been highly changed from the original corn. It is genetically modified.
- **[03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiVFIRyXhIw&t=228s)** — And we subsidize it, which means you as a taxpayer pay for a lot of it. Number seven,
- **[03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiVFIRyXhIw&t=233s)** — seed oils. An average person consumes 25 to 30 percent of all their calories being these seed
- **[04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiVFIRyXhIw&t=240s)** — oils. These seed oils incorporate themselves into our membranes around our cells, around our
- **[04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiVFIRyXhIw&t=246s)** — brain, around our tissues. They go in but they don't come out very easily. If you stop
- **[04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiVFIRyXhIw&t=250s)** — eating them today, it is going to take over a year to get them out of the system. They
- **[04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiVFIRyXhIw&t=255s)** — keep the body inflamed and they create all sorts of serious toxic side effects. Number eight,
- **[04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiVFIRyXhIw&t=262s)** — ultra processed foods. If we go deeper into this ultra processed food, we are really only
- **[04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiVFIRyXhIw&t=266s)** — talking mainly about three different things. Synthetic sugar, synthetic starch, and seed oils.
- **[04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiVFIRyXhIw&t=272s)** — All three of these ingredients are subsidized. That means you are paying for most of it. The
- **[04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiVFIRyXhIw&t=276s)** — intention of RMK is to remove most of this ultra processed food from the children's lunches,
- **[04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiVFIRyXhIw&t=283s)** — hospitals, from the senior assisted living homes. As in Arizona, they are working towards
- **[04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiVFIRyXhIw&t=288s)** — getting rid of the ultra processed food calories from the school system by year
- **[04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiVFIRyXhIw&t=293s)** — two thousand and twenty six, which is exciting. Before we get into number nine, I need to share
- **[04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiVFIRyXhIw&t=298s)** — with you a very powerful free app that I created right here called Dr. Berg junk food
- **[05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiVFIRyXhIw&t=304s)** — meter that allows you to quickly scan for these three ingredients in your pantry,
- **[05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiVFIRyXhIw&t=309s)** — refrigerator, or even at the grocery store. You can start really finding out how much of
- **[05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiVFIRyXhIw&t=313s)** — these three things are in your food. All you have to do is download it. It's free. Pull up
- **[05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiVFIRyXhIw&t=318s)** — food, hover over the barcode and start scanning. And it quickly scans and shows you how much
- **[05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiVFIRyXhIw&t=324s)** — starch, seed oil, and sugar. You can see in this one, there's 19 grams of sugar in this yogurt.
- **[05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiVFIRyXhIw&t=329s)** — Crazy amounts. And there's some starch as well. Let's pick another food. Pop tart.
- **[05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiVFIRyXhIw&t=333s)** — Holy mackerel. Look at you have starch, 39 grams, got some seed oils in there,
- **[05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiVFIRyXhIw&t=338s)** — and you got sugar in there. You can see the junk food score at the top is a 10,
- **[05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiVFIRyXhIw&t=343s)** — which means it's really, really bad. It tells you what kind of ingredients that we're reading.
- **[05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiVFIRyXhIw&t=349s)** — Let's do another food. Hot dog. This one has starch. So there's hidden starch. What kind of
- **[05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiVFIRyXhIw&t=354s)** — starch? They're putting corn syrup in there and modified food starch. Not too healthy.
- **[05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiVFIRyXhIw&t=359s)** — At the end of this video, I put a link down below for you to download the free app.
- **[06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiVFIRyXhIw&t=363s)** — Check it out. Use it to improve your health. Number nine, artificial sweeteners. The
- **[06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiVFIRyXhIw&t=368s)** — difference between artificial sweeteners and sugar alcohols. With sugar alcohols,
- **[06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiVFIRyXhIw&t=373s)** — those are made by fermenting actual natural ingredients. Artificial sweeteners use chemicals
- **[06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiVFIRyXhIw&t=380s)** — like petroleum. They create a lot more damage like altering your gut microbes. When you consume
- **[06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiVFIRyXhIw&t=387s)** — these artificial sweeteners, it is very addicting. Once you start, you can't stop,
- **[06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiVFIRyXhIw&t=391s)** — but it can cause cancer. Number 10, this is another thing that RFK is working on,
- **[06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiVFIRyXhIw&t=396s)** — which I'm really excited about. Getting rid of this loophole. Gross. Generally recognized
- **[06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiVFIRyXhIw&t=402s)** — as safe. This FDA rule that was passed allows industry to do their own testing to regulate
- **[06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiVFIRyXhIw&t=409s)** — whether it's safe or not. What do you think the odds of a company to do safety studies
- **[06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiVFIRyXhIw&t=414s)** — on their own products are going to say, oh, no, it's not safe. We can't put it out.
- **[07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiVFIRyXhIw&t=420s)** — Well, I'm going to tell you right now, if you leave it up to the industry to determine
- **[07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiVFIRyXhIw&t=422s)** — if it's safe or not, it's always going to be safe. With no independent third party, credible
- **[07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiVFIRyXhIw&t=428s)** — safety studies without even telling the FDA. I mean, think about it. Trans fats were considered
- **[07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiVFIRyXhIw&t=434s)** — to be safe. Trans fats, the stuff that causes heart disease, that was considered to be safe
- **[07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiVFIRyXhIw&t=439s)** — in the media, in the news. What you're hearing now is... There's no real evidence to show that
- **[07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiVFIRyXhIw&t=445s)** — junk food and chemicals are that bad as long as it's done in moderation. Well, have you ever
- **[07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiVFIRyXhIw&t=449s)** — tried to eat junk food in balance or moderation? The chemicals in there make it super addicting.
- **[07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiVFIRyXhIw&t=455s)** — You can't just have one. The American Heart Association was pushing for,
- **[07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiVFIRyXhIw&t=460s)** — we don't need more regulation. We should just educate people. In order to educate people,
- **[07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiVFIRyXhIw&t=465s)** — you have to have the correct information to educate them on. With all the bias and conflicts
- **[07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiVFIRyXhIw&t=470s)** — of interest, what are you going to educate them on? That junk food is okay? On top of the
- **[07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiVFIRyXhIw&t=475s)** — billion dollar marketing budgets that these companies have, putting out in the media to
- **[07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiVFIRyXhIw&t=479s)** — counter this education and don't have ultra processed foods in the dietary food guidelines.
- **[08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiVFIRyXhIw&t=484s)** — Because that pushes it into the hospitals, the assisted living programs, the school system,
- **[08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiVFIRyXhIw&t=490s)** — the military, etc. Last point about this topic, about the arguments that they use. Well,
- **[08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiVFIRyXhIw&t=496s)** — everything is processed. No, that's not true. They're similar, but they're not the same.
- **[08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiVFIRyXhIw&t=501s)** — There's degree of processing. And when we're talking about ultra process, just think about
- **[08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiVFIRyXhIw&t=507s)** — the word ultra. Ultra means extreme, way above minimal processing. I just got done talking
- **[08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiVFIRyXhIw&t=515s)** — about a lot of bad foods. I want to shift gears and talk about the top foods that you
- **[08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiVFIRyXhIw&t=522s)** — should be eating right now, that should be on your plate, that are nutrient dense, that are
- **[08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiVFIRyXhIw&t=526s)** — whole, that will make you super, super healthy. Please watch that video right now. I put the

- **[00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QyyaAek4jjU&t=0s)** — Boy, if you have blood pressure problems, you're going to be pretty happy you watched this video.
- **[00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QyyaAek4jjU&t=4s)** — I'm going to talk about why people have hypertension. The number one mineral deficiency behind this whole thing.
- **[00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QyyaAek4jjU&t=11s)** — 90% of all hypertension is essential hypertension. What does that mean? It means unknown cause.
- **[00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QyyaAek4jjU&t=19s)** — Which is very convenient for a drug company who sells medications for blood pressure.
- **[00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QyyaAek4jjU&t=24s)** — Anti-hypertensive medication is right at the top of the list as far as most prescribed medications in the world.
- **[00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QyyaAek4jjU&t=32s)** — First of all, what is hypertension? What is blood pressure? This top number, which is systolic,
- **[00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QyyaAek4jjU&t=37s)** — and the bottom number, which is diastolic. Normally it should be 120 over 80. And what
- **[00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QyyaAek4jjU&t=42s)** — this number represents is the contraction of the heart muscle that pushes the blood
- **[00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QyyaAek4jjU&t=49s)** — throughout the whole body down to the little capillaries where it then goes through veins
- **[00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QyyaAek4jjU&t=54s)** — and eventually ends up into the lungs where it gets re-oxygenated. So the top number is the
- **[00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QyyaAek4jjU&t=59s)** — contraction of the heart and the bottom number is the relaxation of the heart muscle.
- **[01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QyyaAek4jjU&t=65s)** — Collectively together, this systolic and diastolic is a heartbeat. And when you have
- **[01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QyyaAek4jjU&t=71s)** — high blood pressure, there's some type of a resistance going on. It could be a blockage,
- **[01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QyyaAek4jjU&t=75s)** — could be a lot of things. But the point is that when you have any type of blood pressure issue,
- **[01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QyyaAek4jjU&t=80s)** — it puts more stress on the heart. There's a lot of research in the relationship between
- **[01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QyyaAek4jjU&t=85s)** — a potassium deficiency. Personally, I think a potassium deficiency is behind a good majority
- **[01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QyyaAek4jjU&t=92s)** — of this essential hypertension. Why do I say that? Well, number one, most people are
- **[01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QyyaAek4jjU&t=98s)** — deficient in potassium. Why are they deficient? Because it's a bit hard to get potassium
- **[01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QyyaAek4jjU&t=102s)** — since the requirements are so high. Out of all the nutrients, potassium is the largest
- **[01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QyyaAek4jjU&t=109s)** — amount of nutrient that we need. We need 4,700 milligrams and an average person does not get that
- **[01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QyyaAek4jjU&t=117s)** — much. And the other interesting thing about medicine is that the whole focus is to reduce
- **[02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QyyaAek4jjU&t=122s)** — sodium for hypertension, right? But what about enhancing potassium? They don't really talk about
- **[02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QyyaAek4jjU&t=127s)** — what does lowering sodium do? Well, it indirectly increases potassium. We need about half the
- **[02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QyyaAek4jjU&t=135s)** — amount of sodium to potassium. And I think these ratios are more important than the amounts.
- **[02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QyyaAek4jjU&t=141s)** — Many people are very heavy in the sodium, very low in the potassium to the point where
- **[02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QyyaAek4jjU&t=146s)** — they're like three times as much sodium to potassium. But what does potassium actually do
- **[02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QyyaAek4jjU&t=152s)** — to your blood vessels and your heart? Number one, it directly controls the tone of the
- **[02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QyyaAek4jjU&t=158s)** — vascular system, which is the neurotransmitter for the autonomic nervous system, which is
- **[02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QyyaAek4jjU&t=163s)** — directly connected to a high blood pressure situation because when you're running up a
- **[02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QyyaAek4jjU&t=168s)** — hill, you have adrenaline that kicks in to raise the blood pressure. Well, potassium lowers
- **[02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QyyaAek4jjU&t=173s)** — adrenaline. Potassium helps support the layer of the inside of the artery called the endothelial
- **[03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QyyaAek4jjU&t=182s)** — layer. And potassium also helps improve insulin resistance. It makes insulin more sensitive.
- **[03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QyyaAek4jjU&t=189s)** — And what's wild is that when you go buy a potassium supplement, it usually comes like no
- **[03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QyyaAek4jjU&t=194s)** — more than 99 milligrams per tablet. How many tablets would you have to take to achieve 4,700?
- **[03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QyyaAek4jjU&t=201s)** — Now, there are electrolyte powders that have more than that. The other consideration that
- **[03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QyyaAek4jjU&t=206s)** — people have about potassium is that, oh, potassium is bad for the kidneys. That is
- **[03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QyyaAek4jjU&t=210s)** — completely false. Potassium is very, very healthy to the kidneys. It's protective of
- **[03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QyyaAek4jjU&t=216s)** — the kidneys. When you have advanced kidney disease, like a stage four, stage five,
- **[03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QyyaAek4jjU&t=220s)** — that's when potassium can be dangerous. Now, this next thing I'm going to tell you is
- **[03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QyyaAek4jjU&t=225s)** — more interesting because if you look at the top medications for blood pressure, they all retain
- **[03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QyyaAek4jjU&t=234s)** — potassium. Interesting. Could it be that some of the positive effects of these blood pressure
- **[04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QyyaAek4jjU&t=240s)** — lowering medications could be because of the potassium effect? Now, where do we get our
- **[04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QyyaAek4jjU&t=245s)** — potassium from? Well, you can get it from salads, but you'd have to consume at least
- **[04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QyyaAek4jjU&t=250s)** — to make a dent into this potassium requirement. And the average person only consumes like a cup
- **[04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QyyaAek4jjU&t=256s)** — and a half. And also these leafy greens contain magnesium too. So the combination of both
- **[04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QyyaAek4jjU&t=263s)** — potassium and magnesium will greatly help the blood pressure. There's also data that in the
- **[04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QyyaAek4jjU&t=269s)** — prehistoric Paleolithic times, there's estimations that we consumed like 11,000 to
- **[04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QyyaAek4jjU&t=274s)** — 15,000 milligrams of potassium. Now, there's no way to know this for sure. It's just a good
- **[04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QyyaAek4jjU&t=281s)** — guess. But if you think about what we used to eat way back in the day, we pretty much ate
- **[04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QyyaAek4jjU&t=288s)** — whatever we could find. If we could catch an animal, we would eat it. If we couldn't catch
- **[04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QyyaAek4jjU&t=293s)** — an animal, I'm sure that we would eat vegetation or anything laying on the ground,
- **[04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QyyaAek4jjU&t=297s)** — like an acorn or anything. But when we consume refined foods, especially refined sugar,
- **[05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QyyaAek4jjU&t=302s)** — we lose potassium. When we increase adrenaline or cortisol, we lose potassium. So I have a
- **[05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QyyaAek4jjU&t=310s)** — challenge for you. I would recommend that you start to beef up your potassium consumption
- **[05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QyyaAek4jjU&t=317s)** — through salad. Just try it for one week and see what happens to your blood pressure.
- **[05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QyyaAek4jjU&t=321s)** — If you can't seem to manage that much salad, then find a good electrolyte powder high in
- **[05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QyyaAek4jjU&t=326s)** — potassium. I think you might be pleasantly surprised of all the amazing benefits. Now,
- **[05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QyyaAek4jjU&t=331s)** — just to give you some visual on how much salad you should consume,
- **[05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QyyaAek4jjU&t=336s)** — I put that in this video right here. Check it out.

- **[00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhUgmTCJyiE&t=0s)** — There's some fascinating information I want to share with you regarding iodine that goes way beyond the thyroid.
- **[00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhUgmTCJyiE&t=6s)** — So it is true that the lion's share of iodine is stored inside your thyroid.
- **[00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhUgmTCJyiE&t=11s)** — But there's also iodine in the breast tissue, in the uterus, in the ovaries, in the prostate.
- **[00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhUgmTCJyiE&t=18s)** — And I'm going to tell you why. In the sperm, in the stomach, in your lungs, and especially in your brain.
- **[00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhUgmTCJyiE&t=25s)** — The front part of your brain that involve cognition, focus, memory, concentration.
- **[00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhUgmTCJyiE&t=32s)** — And this is why if an infant is deficient in iodine at birth, they're going to have some problems with their IQ.
- **[00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhUgmTCJyiE&t=39s)** — They're going to have decreased intellectual capacity.
- **[00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhUgmTCJyiE&t=43s)** — And so iodine is important, and not just for your thyroid, for other things as well.
- **[00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhUgmTCJyiE&t=46s)** — Now the other interesting thing about iodine is the requirements for iodine, the RDAs.
- **[00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhUgmTCJyiE&t=52s)** — It's roughly in America, it's about 150 micrograms. Not milligrams, but micrograms.
- **[00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhUgmTCJyiE&t=59s)** — But what's interesting about that is if you take a look at Japan, they consume on average per day
- **[01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhUgmTCJyiE&t=65s)** — between a thousand to three thousand micrograms of iodine.
- **[01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhUgmTCJyiE&t=71s)** — And they don't have nearly the problem with breast cancer, with female reproductive issues,
- **[01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhUgmTCJyiE&t=77s)** — and many of the other iodine deficiency problems that we have in the U.S.
- **[01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhUgmTCJyiE&t=81s)** — There just is no agreement in the scientific community on how much iodine we really need
- **[01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhUgmTCJyiE&t=88s)** — as far as a therapeutic dose. They do state that the upper limits should be no more than a
- **[01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhUgmTCJyiE&t=93s)** — thousand micrograms, but that's kind of an arbitrary number because people have taken a lot
- **[01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhUgmTCJyiE&t=98s)** — more without any problems. In fact, if you have way too much iodine and create the same
- **[01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhUgmTCJyiE&t=103s)** — exact symptoms as a deficiency in iodine. Now there's two general types of iodine. The type
- **[01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhUgmTCJyiE&t=108s)** — should be used topically in the body, not internally. Like povidone iodine. That's great
- **[01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhUgmTCJyiE&t=114s)** — for fungal infections on your toes or even a skin tag or a wart, but you shouldn't take that
- **[01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhUgmTCJyiE&t=119s)** — orally. There are other types of iodine that you can take orally, but I would recommend taking
- **[02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhUgmTCJyiE&t=124s)** — it as a food base, whether it comes from actual food like shellfish or even better yet,
- **[02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhUgmTCJyiE&t=129s)** — sea kelp, which is seaweed. It comes in a package from nature that has all the other trace
- **[02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhUgmTCJyiE&t=135s)** — minerals and things that are connected with it. Because anytime you take one of anything in the
- **[02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhUgmTCJyiE&t=141s)** — body, you have to realize that you could throw off other things as well, especially when we're
- **[02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhUgmTCJyiE&t=145s)** — getting into the trace minerals, but you're more protected and you can tolerate it more if
- **[02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhUgmTCJyiE&t=150s)** — you take it from a food source like sea kelp. Of course, the key about sea kelp is making
- **[02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhUgmTCJyiE&t=155s)** — sure it's high quality. It comes from an ocean that is very, very pristine and healthy
- **[02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhUgmTCJyiE&t=161s)** — without heavy metals because you don't want contaminated toxic heavy metals in your
- **[02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhUgmTCJyiE&t=167s)** — sea kelp. Now there's some fascinating applications of using iodine to help with
- **[02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhUgmTCJyiE&t=173s)** — various body conditions. And one of the big things that iodine does is it helps to regulate
- **[03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhUgmTCJyiE&t=180s)** — estrogen, especially if there's too much estrogen in the body, as in estrogen dominance.
- **[03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhUgmTCJyiE&t=186s)** — So what does that mean? It means it can help you with heavy periods, periods that go on for
- **[03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhUgmTCJyiE&t=190s)** — too long. It can help with something called fibrocystic breasts. In fact, relating to that
- **[03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhUgmTCJyiE&t=196s)** — topic, one of the best ways to identify an iodine deficiency is through just the symptom of
- **[03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhUgmTCJyiE&t=202s)** — having breast tenderness. Most of the time when a woman experiences tenderness of the breast,
- **[03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhUgmTCJyiE&t=208s)** — they're really just experiencing an iodine deficiency. So you can use iodine on fibrocystic
- **[03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhUgmTCJyiE&t=213s)** — breasts, ovarian cysts, endometriosis, fibroids, because you have high levels of iodine in the
- **[03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhUgmTCJyiE&t=221s)** — ovary, in the breast tissue, in the uterus. Also iodine can be used for a prostate enlargement.
- **[03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhUgmTCJyiE&t=228s)** — Why? Because as men get older, their testosterone goes down and the relative ratios of estrogen
- **[03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhUgmTCJyiE&t=235s)** — goes up. So iodine is known to help a prostatic enlargement. But iodine is also good for
- **[04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhUgmTCJyiE&t=242s)** — other things like PCOS, polycystic ovarian syndrome. It's good for cystic acne. It's good
- **[04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhUgmTCJyiE&t=249s)** — for TB, upper respiratory infections, because you have iodine in your lungs. Probably to act
- **[04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhUgmTCJyiE&t=255s)** — as an antimicrobial because it's good as a defense mechanism for your immune system.
- **[04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhUgmTCJyiE&t=260s)** — Iodine is also good for something called croup, which is kind of this wheezing in the upper
- **[04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhUgmTCJyiE&t=265s)** — respiratory tract where you get this high pitched sound when you're breathing in. Usually you
- **[04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhUgmTCJyiE&t=271s)** — see this in infants or even this excessive weird cough which actually sounds like a dog barking.
- **[04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhUgmTCJyiE&t=278s)** — As well as asthma. I already mentioned toenail fungus. It's a good remedy for that because
- **[04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhUgmTCJyiE&t=283s)** — it's anti-viral, anti-bacterial, anti-fungal, and anti-candida. I've done a video on how you
- **[04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhUgmTCJyiE&t=291s)** — can use iodine to help remove a wart as well as a skin tag. I'll put that link down below.
- **[04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhUgmTCJyiE&t=296s)** — And let's not forget in the importance of the thyroid. So having enough iodine can actually
- **[05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhUgmTCJyiE&t=303s)** — help you to lose more weight. It can help you with brain fog. It can help you when you're
- **[05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhUgmTCJyiE&t=309s)** — excessively cold and have dry hair and dry skin and even constipation because it supports
- **[05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhUgmTCJyiE&t=316s)** — the thyroid gland and even depression as well. But unless you consume food, okay, that is
- **[05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhUgmTCJyiE&t=324s)** — either from the sea or from vegetables that are grown on the coastline, chances are you're
- **[05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhUgmTCJyiE&t=330s)** — not going to get a lot of iodine in your foods because if it's not in the soil,
- **[05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhUgmTCJyiE&t=335s)** — it's not going to be in the plant. And so there's always going to be a very, very tiny
- **[05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhUgmTCJyiE&t=339s)** — amount of iodine in the soil. But in certain areas of the country, you could have literally
- **[05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhUgmTCJyiE&t=344s)** — a hundred times less iodine in those vegetables than vegetables that are grown by the coast,
- **[05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhUgmTCJyiE&t=350s)** — close to the ocean. There is a bit of iodine in eggs, dairy, as well as iodized salt and even
- **[05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhUgmTCJyiE&t=358s)** — sea salt. But with sea salt, there's going to be just small, small amounts. Now, another thing
- **[06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhUgmTCJyiE&t=363s)** — I want to mention is that you can't actually have an allergy to iodine. Okay, so some people
- **[06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhUgmTCJyiE&t=368s)** — have an allergy to shellfish, for example, that has iodine. You might need to get your
- **[06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhUgmTCJyiE&t=373s)** — iodine from just straight iodine. If someone is deficient in iodine, the body is going to
- **[06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhUgmTCJyiE&t=379s)** — allocate or recruit iodine and make sure you have enough for the thyroid. So it'll pull from
- **[06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhUgmTCJyiE&t=386s)** — different tissues, and that can keep you deficient in certain parts of your body and
- **[06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhUgmTCJyiE&t=391s)** — sufficient other parts. One of the most accurate ways to measure iodine, because the
- **[06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhUgmTCJyiE&t=397s)** — problem is if you get a urine sample or even a blood sample in the morning, you can have a
- **[06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhUgmTCJyiE&t=402s)** — false positive because you have the lowest amounts of iodine in the morning. So the best
- **[06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhUgmTCJyiE&t=408s)** — way to assess iodine is a 24-hour urine iodine test. Another simple test would be just to basically
- **[06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhUgmTCJyiE&t=415s)** — take a little drop of povidone iodine, put it on your skin, okay, maybe on the inside of your
- **[07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhUgmTCJyiE&t=421s)** — arm or your leg or your thigh, and then just cover an area like maybe an inch by an inch,
- **[07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhUgmTCJyiE&t=426s)** — and then see what happens within one hour. You can put maybe like a little patch over it
- **[07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhUgmTCJyiE&t=431s)** — or a band-aid, and if it disappears in one hour, chances are you are deficient in iodine.
- **[07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhUgmTCJyiE&t=436s)** — You need more because your body is sucking it up. But if it's still there after an hour,
- **[07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhUgmTCJyiE&t=441s)** — chances are you probably have enough. Now, of course, that's a crude way of measuring it, but
- **[07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhUgmTCJyiE&t=445s)** — it's just one indication. And like I said before, breast tenderness is another
- **[07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhUgmTCJyiE&t=451s)** — classic symptom of a deficiency of iodine. A couple other ways that people are deficient
- **[07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhUgmTCJyiE&t=455s)** — is consuming maybe excessive amounts of raw cruciferous vegetables because there's certain
- **[07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhUgmTCJyiE&t=462s)** — compounds in the cruciferous vegetables that tend to bind up that iodine. Also, if you consume
- **[07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhUgmTCJyiE&t=467s)** — millet, soy, sweet potato, you can also have the same problem. People that are vegan,
- **[07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhUgmTCJyiE&t=474s)** — plant-based, have to be very careful because they're usually eating plants that are
- **[08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhUgmTCJyiE&t=480s)** — deficient in iodine, and they don't consume shellfish. But on the other hand, if they
- **[08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhUgmTCJyiE&t=484s)** — have sea kelp, they're going to be okay. If a woman is pregnant or lactating, the demand
- **[08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhUgmTCJyiE&t=491s)** — for iodine goes up, so they should make sure that they take a little bit more. Other things
- **[08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhUgmTCJyiE&t=496s)** — compete for iodine like fluoride and bromide. If someone is on a low-salt diet because they
- **[08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhUgmTCJyiE&t=505s)** — have high blood pressure because the doctor told them to get out the salt, they can also
- **[08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhUgmTCJyiE&t=509s)** — be deficient in iodine just for not having enough of the iodine in the salt. But of course,
- **[08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhUgmTCJyiE&t=514s)** — that would have to be either iodized salt or sea salt. There's some other chemicals that
- **[08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhUgmTCJyiE&t=520s)** — commonly create problems for iodine. Perchlorate. That's like a chemical waste product from
- **[08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhUgmTCJyiE&t=526s)** — fertilizers that they put in the land, and then the runoff goes into the water supply, and then
- **[08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhUgmTCJyiE&t=530s)** — it ends up in your water. So perchlorate blocks iodine as well as nitrates, which is another
- **[08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhUgmTCJyiE&t=538s)** — waste product from fertilizers. So the absolute best way to get your iodine is through a little
- **[09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhUgmTCJyiE&t=543s)** — sea kelp. You can take some on a regular basis. Just take whatever is recommended in the
- **[09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhUgmTCJyiE&t=548s)** — label, but also start consuming more shellfish to make sure you have enough as well. Now I created
- **[09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhUgmTCJyiE&t=554s)** — another video that has gotten millions of views, and this relates to using iodine to get rid of
- **[09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhUgmTCJyiE&t=560s)** — skin tags in warts. If you haven't seen that video, check it out. I put it up right here.

- **[00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wafi94q8gPg&t=0s)** — You know, the worst food for your teeth is not sugar. Now it is true that sugar does increase
- **[00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wafi94q8gPg&t=6s)** — bacteria that make more acids that can erode your teeth, but there's a much worse type of acid
- **[00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wafi94q8gPg&t=12s)** — that will severely erode your teeth and it doesn't have anything to do with sugar. Of course,
- **[00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wafi94q8gPg&t=19s)** — if we talk about fruit juice, like apple juice or orange juice is five times worse than soda
- **[00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wafi94q8gPg&t=27s)** — Yeah, interesting. And I'm going to explain why that is in just a minute.
- **[00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wafi94q8gPg&t=31s)** — Diet soda compared to regular soda. Can you take a guess what's worse for your teeth?
- **[00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wafi94q8gPg&t=37s)** — Believe it or not, diet soda might be worse. And I'm going to explain why that is as well.
- **[00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wafi94q8gPg&t=43s)** — Number two, candy. The stuff that you suck on, like a lollipop, for example,
- **[00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wafi94q8gPg&t=47s)** — you're constantly exposing your teeth to a lot of sugar and that can definitely create microbes
- **[00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wafi94q8gPg&t=52s)** — that make more acid. Number three, powdered starches. Starches can act just like a sugar
- **[00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wafi94q8gPg&t=59s)** — and feed these microbes and create the acids. And that would be like modified food
- **[01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wafi94q8gPg&t=64s)** — starch or modified cornstarch or maltodextrin, which is in pretty much most junk foods.
- **[01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wafi94q8gPg&t=70s)** — And then we just get liquid sugar, as in high fructose corn syrup drinks, right?
- **[01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wafi94q8gPg&t=75s)** — And I'm talking about the ones that you have added sugar. In this case, you're not chewing,
- **[01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wafi94q8gPg&t=80s)** — you're just bathing the teeth in just pure sugar. And just if we differentiate between natural
- **[01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wafi94q8gPg&t=86s)** — sugars, like if you eat fruit versus drink the juice from fruit, especially if it's
- **[01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wafi94q8gPg&t=92s)** — pasteurized, there's a big difference. And then number five, we get into actual sodas
- **[01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wafi94q8gPg&t=97s)** — with phosphoric acid. And believe it or not, phosphoric acid is not the worst acid for your
- **[01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wafi94q8gPg&t=103s)** — teeth. There's another one that's actually way more dangerous, but phosphoric acid is not
- **[01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wafi94q8gPg&t=108s)** — good. It's going to leach the calcium out of your teeth. So here you have a soda with not
- **[01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wafi94q8gPg&t=113s)** — just liquid candy syrup, like high fructose corn syrup, but also the phosphoric acid.
- **[02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wafi94q8gPg&t=120s)** — But there's something else in there, which I'm getting to very shortly. Number six is like
- **[02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wafi94q8gPg&t=125s)** — the gummy bears. It sticks to your teeth. So now we have the situation where we take the sugar
- **[02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wafi94q8gPg&t=132s)** — and we stick it to the teeth and we keep the exposure there longer, which is going to
- **[02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wafi94q8gPg&t=137s)** — increase more bacterial fermentation and more acid. And you also have the caramel too,
- **[02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wafi94q8gPg&t=143s)** — and different candies that are sticky, but the gummy bears are at the top of the list.
- **[02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wafi94q8gPg&t=147s)** — Now there's other things too that people will talk about, like acid reflux coming up and
- **[02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wafi94q8gPg&t=152s)** — ending up on your teeth. Of course, that's still not the acid that I'm going to talk
- **[02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wafi94q8gPg&t=157s)** — about. The acid that is the worst for your teeth... and I'm going to just read this off
- **[02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wafi94q8gPg&t=164s)** — some of this sugar water right here and see if I could see this right here. It says water,
- **[02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wafi94q8gPg&t=170s)** — sugar, dextrose, and citric acid. That is the worst thing for your teeth. Citric acid.
- **[02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wafi94q8gPg&t=178s)** — Now, citric acid, isn't that a natural thing? Yeah, it's in lemons and limes and things
- **[03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wafi94q8gPg&t=184s)** — like that, but they also make it synthetically. And apparently what's unique about citric acid
- **[03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wafi94q8gPg&t=189s)** — is that it's a very powerful chelator for calcium. If you saw my video on kidney stones,
- **[03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wafi94q8gPg&t=196s)** — you take lemon juice. Why? Because the citric acid binds with the calcium. So it's a super
- **[03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wafi94q8gPg&t=203s)** — strong chelator, which means to claw and bind, okay, into the mineral calcium. And so if
- **[03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wafi94q8gPg&t=210s)** — you're consuming this in certain amounts, you're basically eroding your teeth and you're
- **[03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wafi94q8gPg&t=215s)** — pulling this calcium out of the teeth. And what's interesting is that the pH is not even
- **[03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wafi94q8gPg&t=220s)** — that acid. This is like going beyond just the acid problem. And if you ever read the
- **[03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wafi94q8gPg&t=226s)** — label on a juice bottle, guess what they add in there? Citric acid. What do they put in
- **[03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wafi94q8gPg&t=232s)** — diet sodas? Citric acid. And of all the citrates, it's the trisodium citrate that's
- **[03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wafi94q8gPg&t=238s)** — the worst. And it's usually labeled as sodium citrate. So citrate is citric acid. Same thing.
- **[04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wafi94q8gPg&t=246s)** — And that is the worst acid for erosion of your teeth. Normally, like your pH should be
- **[04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wafi94q8gPg&t=253s)** — slightly neutral or alkaline, okay, which is basically just slightly above seven. If the pH

- **[04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wafi94q8gPg&t=266s)** — minerals, not just calcium, you basically get de-mineralization of your teeth. So what does
- **[04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wafi94q8gPg&t=272s)** — this mean in practical terms? It means that if you consume anything, you should probably take
- **[04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wafi94q8gPg&t=278s)** — some water, gargle with it and swish it in your mouth and spit it out just so you can
- **[04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wafi94q8gPg&t=283s)** — clean your teeth of anything, whether it's sugar or citric acid. I think that would be
- **[04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wafi94q8gPg&t=288s)** — a smart thing to do. And also other acids, I would highly recommend that you, you know,
- **[04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wafi94q8gPg&t=292s)** — use the same process of washing your teeth out with water after you consume apple cider vinegar.
- **[04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wafi94q8gPg&t=298s)** — And of course, start reading labels to make sure you're not consuming so much
- **[05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wafi94q8gPg&t=302s)** — citrate in these products. Now, if you're consuming like a potassium citrate or magnesium
- **[05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wafi94q8gPg&t=307s)** — citrate, that's a different situation. That's actually bound with a mineral and you're not
- **[05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wafi94q8gPg&t=313s)** — going to leach out your teeth. It's going to go into your digestive system and it's not
- **[05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wafi94q8gPg&t=316s)** — going to be a problem. But anything that actually exposes the citrate to your teeth for
- **[05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wafi94q8gPg&t=322s)** — you have to really watch out for. Now, since we're on the topic of teeth, I think it'd be
- **[05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wafi94q8gPg&t=326s)** — a really good idea for you to have a good recipe to make your own toothpaste. And if

- **[00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBw0va7ut8c&t=0s)** — There's a dark side of zinc relating to your hair that we need to talk about.
- **[00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBw0va7ut8c&t=5s)** — Now since zinc is probably one of the most important trace minerals for your hair,
- **[00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBw0va7ut8c&t=9s)** — you need to know that too much zinc can cause the same exact problem with your hair as not enough zinc.
- **[00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBw0va7ut8c&t=17s)** — So zinc being a trace mineral is involved in over 300 different enzymes relating to your immune system,
- **[00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBw0va7ut8c&t=23s)** — testosterone, sense of smell, taste, vision, reproduction, skin health. I mean it's involved
- **[00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBw0va7ut8c&t=31s)** — in almost every part of your immune system. But I want to touch on the relationship between zinc
- **[00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBw0va7ut8c&t=35s)** — and your hair because a lot of people are taking way too much zinc and that could be the reason
- **[00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBw0va7ut8c&t=41s)** — why things get worse. So the reason why you might lose your hair when you don't have enough
- **[00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBw0va7ut8c&t=47s)** — zinc is that zinc is needed to support the growth of the hair follicle. Now what is the hair
- **[00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBw0va7ut8c&t=55s)** — follicle? It's not the actual hair. It's the pore or shaft that the hair grows out of and
- **[01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBw0va7ut8c&t=63s)** — it's just beneath your scalp. And so the growth of that follicle is dependent on zinc.
- **[01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBw0va7ut8c&t=69s)** — And if you don't have zinc, you're not going to have follicles for the hair to grow out of.
- **[01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBw0va7ut8c&t=74s)** — Zinc is also needed for collagen and keratin. Two types of protein
- **[01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBw0va7ut8c&t=81s)** — that allows the hair to be strong and elastic. So if you're deficient in zinc, you're going to
- **[01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBw0va7ut8c&t=88s)** — have thin hair and brittle hair because it's not going to be elastic. And also zinc is
- **[01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBw0va7ut8c&t=94s)** — needed to make this enzyme ALP. I'm not going to get into the name of it. It's not important.
- **[01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBw0va7ut8c&t=99s)** — But ALP is involved in three different pathways that control the different phases of hair growth.
- **[01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBw0va7ut8c&t=107s)** — So for example, if you have one of the phases of hair being a little too short
- **[01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBw0va7ut8c&t=110s)** — or not even existing at all because you don't have enough zinc, you're going to have hair
- **[01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBw0va7ut8c&t=115s)** — loss just from that enzyme. And on top of that, that enzyme is also responsible for
- **[02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBw0va7ut8c&t=121s)** — feeding the hair follicle energy so it can actually work correctly. And so as you can see,
- **[02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBw0va7ut8c&t=127s)** — zinc is really, really important. Your hair depends on it. Okay, and I'm going to talk about
- **[02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBw0va7ut8c&t=131s)** — the amounts of zinc that you need. But let's just first talk about what happens when you get
- **[02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBw0va7ut8c&t=136s)** — too much zinc and what those numbers are. When you get too much zinc, you actually create
- **[02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBw0va7ut8c&t=141s)** — a copper deficiency in the body because zinc and copper work together like a teeter-totter,
- **[02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBw0va7ut8c&t=147s)** — just like in calcium and magnesium. But the more zinc that you take, the more copper you're
- **[02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBw0va7ut8c&t=152s)** — going to need. And if you're taking zinc without copper, that's when you can create problems.
- **[02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBw0va7ut8c&t=159s)** — But copper itself is involved in hair growth as well. Copper maintains the color of your hair.
- **[02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBw0va7ut8c&t=165s)** — So if you have to color your hair very often, chances are you could be missing copper.
- **[02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBw0va7ut8c&t=170s)** — Copper also helps the structural integrity of the hair. And so this could actually show up
- **[02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBw0va7ut8c&t=174s)** — as a thinning hair, brittle hair, or even hair loss. Copper is the co-factor or helper molecule
- **[03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBw0va7ut8c&t=183s)** — in different enzymes that relate to the growth of hair as well as the maintenance of your hair.
- **[03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBw0va7ut8c&t=188s)** — So copper will help prevent the hair loss, prevent hair thinning, and it will support
- **[03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBw0va7ut8c&t=193s)** — the follicle, that shaft of the hair. So when you think of zinc toxicity, think of a copper
- **[03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBw0va7ut8c&t=199s)** — So here's the important part. The upper tolerance, the amount of zinc that you can take without any
- **[03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBw0va7ut8c&t=207s)** — side effects, is roughly about 40 milligrams per day. And this is for adults. And you're not
- **[03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBw0va7ut8c&t=213s)** — going to have any bad effects from that. And just so you know, the bad effects would be
- **[03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBw0va7ut8c&t=217s)** — feeling nauseous, you might have vomiting, decreased appetite, abdominal cramps, diarrhea,
- **[03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBw0va7ut8c&t=222s)** — and headaches. But here's the thing you need to know. In certain circumstances, you need to take
- **[03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBw0va7ut8c&t=228s)** — high amounts of zinc. Like if you have an autoimmune disease, or you get an infection,
- **[03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBw0va7ut8c&t=236s)** — or you have inflammation of the gut, which prevents the absorption of zinc. Because most of
- **[04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBw0va7ut8c&t=240s)** — the absorption happens in the small intestine. And just so you know, when you eat food that's
- **[04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBw0va7ut8c&t=245s)** — high in zinc, like whether you're eating oysters, any meats, shellfish, seaweed, or cheese,
- **[04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBw0va7ut8c&t=251s)** — you only absorb 20 to 40 percent of the zinc from those foods. But if you have inflammation
- **[04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBw0va7ut8c&t=259s)** — in your gut, it's going to be less than that. Now on top of that, there's other things that
- **[04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBw0va7ut8c&t=264s)** — decrease the absorption of zinc. Like stress, like a high carb diet, like phytic acid. Now
- **[04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBw0va7ut8c&t=272s)** — what is phytic acid? That's an anti-nutrient in grains that prevents the absorption of zinc
- **[04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBw0va7ut8c&t=278s)** — and other minerals. And then another thing is if you're estrogen dominant, let's say you're taking
- **[04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBw0va7ut8c&t=282s)** — birth control pills or hormone replacement therapy, estrogen or progesterone, you can block the
- **[04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBw0va7ut8c&t=288s)** — absorption of zinc. And then you also have your stomach acid. If your stomach acid is not strong
- **[04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBw0va7ut8c&t=293s)** — enough, you're not going to absorb zinc. So in those situations, you have to take more. And in
- **[04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBw0va7ut8c&t=298s)** — some videos, I even recommend taking 200 or even 250 milligrams of zinc short term to overcome
- **[05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBw0va7ut8c&t=306s)** — a certain health problem, whether it's autoimmune or inflammation or whatever. But the key is
- **[05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBw0va7ut8c&t=313s)** — making sure you take enough copper to prevent any side effects at all. And so roughly the
- **[05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBw0va7ut8c&t=320s)** — ratio of zinc to copper that I would recommend is like 10 to 1. 10 times more zinc than
- **[05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBw0va7ut8c&t=327s)** — copper. So let's say, for example, you don't have an autoimmune disease, you're not going
- **[05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBw0va7ut8c&t=331s)** — through an infection, you don't have any problems with your small intestine. I would
- **[05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBw0va7ut8c&t=335s)** — take the upper limit dose of 40 milligrams of zinc per day, and then I would roughly take like
- **[05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBw0va7ut8c&t=342s)** — one milligram of copper. Now, these numbers are arbitrary, they're not exact, so it can be around
- **[05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBw0va7ut8c&t=348s)** — that. But generally speaking, if you do like a 10 to 1 ratio of zinc to copper, you're not
- **[05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBw0va7ut8c&t=354s)** — going to experience symptoms. But some people actually like to start off small and just do like
- **[05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBw0va7ut8c&t=359s)** — 10 milligrams of zinc and maybe see how that does maybe work up. But so many people are
- **[06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBw0va7ut8c&t=365s)** — deficient in zinc. 1.1 billion people on this planet are deficient in zinc. And what the body
- **[06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBw0va7ut8c&t=371s)** — will do, it'll allocate that zinc to the most important functions of the body, and not to
- **[06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBw0va7ut8c&t=379s)** — everything. So the body tends to ration out or use the zinc in the most important parts.
- **[06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBw0va7ut8c&t=384s)** — That would probably be related to reproduction, sperm count, things like that. But your hair
- **[06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBw0va7ut8c&t=390s)** — probably is not at the top of the list for survival as a priority. I mean, you can survive
- **[06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBw0va7ut8c&t=395s)** — without your hair just fine. But as a species, we can't survive without reproducing. So you
- **[06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBw0va7ut8c&t=400s)** — have a couple options with zinc. Make sure that you're avoiding things that prevent the
- **[06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBw0va7ut8c&t=405s)** — absorption. But also you might want to be taking some zinc. In addition to that, eating
- **[06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBw0va7ut8c&t=410s)** — foods high in zinc. Now, there's a lot more to know about zinc. It's a fascinating mineral.

- **[00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCjQAQuWiYc&t=0s)** — Today we have an extremely important topic that revolves around the most important
- **[00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCjQAQuWiYc&t=6s)** — microbe in our body. And today I brought on one of the top experts, Dr. William Davis. So welcome,
- **[00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCjQAQuWiYc&t=12s)** — Doc. Thanks for being on here. Thank you, Dr. Burton. Thanks for the invitation.
- **[00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCjQAQuWiYc&t=15s)** — Yeah. So you wrote a whole book primarily revolves around this one microbe. And I want to just
- **[00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCjQAQuWiYc&t=22s)** — dive right in. Your book is called Supergut, which is a fascinating read. This microbe is
- **[00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCjQAQuWiYc&t=26s)** — called El Ruderai. Out of all the thousands of microbes in our gut, what makes this
- **[00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCjQAQuWiYc&t=31s)** — stand out as more important than the other ones? It's been around for 60 years. It's not like it
- **[00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCjQAQuWiYc&t=38s)** — was discovered last Tuesday, but it was not recognized just how powerful this microbe was.
- **[00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCjQAQuWiYc&t=43s)** — In fact, the first 40 years of research around this microbe centered mostly around what it did
- **[00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCjQAQuWiYc&t=48s)** — for babies. Well, that's important. But it was shown to reduce, for instance, regurgitation
- **[00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCjQAQuWiYc&t=54s)** — of breast milk or formula, reduce colic and that kind of fussy restlessness and crying that
- **[01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCjQAQuWiYc&t=60s)** — babies get. And that's about where it ended. Maybe it abbreviated the diarrhea after an
- **[01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCjQAQuWiYc&t=65s)** — antibiotic, but it really didn't go much farther than that. Until this group in Boston, MIT,
- **[01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCjQAQuWiYc&t=72s)** — stumbled upon some unusual effects because there had been some very preliminary cell culture
- **[01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCjQAQuWiYc&t=78s)** — type evidence. So very preliminary stuff that showed that ruderai might have anti-cancer
- **[01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCjQAQuWiYc&t=83s)** — effects, particularly in colon cancer. So this group, very smart, very excellent research,
- **[01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCjQAQuWiYc&t=90s)** — was exploring that question. And they started to see all these unexpected effects that they
- **[01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCjQAQuWiYc&t=96s)** — were like, what is going on here? They saw that the animals stayed young. They didn't get
- **[01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCjQAQuWiYc&t=102s)** — fat and lose their hair and stop making... They played with each other. They groomed each
- **[01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCjQAQuWiYc&t=107s)** — other. They stayed slender with thick, rich fur. They saw that if they inflicted wounds,
- **[01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCjQAQuWiYc&t=112s)** — this is animals. This sounds awful, but when they inflicted wounds, healing time was cut
- **[01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCjQAQuWiYc&t=117s)** — in half. They showed that there was a dramatic rise in testosterone in elderly mice, a marked
- **[02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCjQAQuWiYc&t=123s)** — increase in growth hormone, an amplification of the immune response. So much so, as you recall,
- **[02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCjQAQuWiYc&t=130s)** — as you and I age, the thymus gland right here beneath the sternum shrinks, starting at age 15.
- **[02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCjQAQuWiYc&t=139s)** — And by age 70, it's almost gone. It's about 10% of its original volume and capacity to produce
- **[02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCjQAQuWiYc&t=146s)** — T cells that protect us from viruses and bacteria. And that's why older people can
- **[02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCjQAQuWiYc&t=151s)** — succumb to flu or pneumococcal pneumonia, but 18 year olds typically don't.
- **[02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCjQAQuWiYc&t=156s)** — And that's differentiated between... it's not the thyroid, it's the thymus, which is a
- **[02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCjQAQuWiYc&t=160s)** — little lower. It's on top of the heart. Exactly. It's the thymus gland, the seat of T cell
- **[02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCjQAQuWiYc&t=165s)** — immune response. Well, that's restored and it's restored back to its original size in mice.
- **[02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCjQAQuWiYc&t=172s)** — Wow. No one's done that in a human study yet. So all these extraordinary observations in mice.
- **[02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCjQAQuWiYc&t=177s)** — And so I decided to get this microbe and play with it. But it was commercially available as
- **[03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCjQAQuWiYc&t=183s)** — tablets for infants. So the dosage for infants is very small. So I just simply reasoned,
- **[03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCjQAQuWiYc&t=189s)** — how do I increase it? Well, you take a hundred tablets of the product, but it's a
- **[03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCjQAQuWiYc&t=194s)** — sugary product, so it's not very good. So I just simply amplified counts by making it as a yogurt.
- **[03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCjQAQuWiYc&t=200s)** — It's not yogurt, of course. It looks and smells like yogurt, kind of. But it's a way to
- **[03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCjQAQuWiYc&t=205s)** — amplify bacterial counts. In this case, a thousand fold. And that's when I saw everything.
- **[03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCjQAQuWiYc&t=209s)** — This usually doesn't happen, as you know. If you see something in mice, it often doesn't
- **[03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCjQAQuWiYc&t=213s)** — translate to a human experience. But in this case, everything seen in mice, everything,
- **[03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCjQAQuWiYc&t=219s)** — every last observation seen in mice, I've been seeing in humans.
- **[03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCjQAQuWiYc&t=225s)** — Wow. And as far as what percentage is this microbe in the Western world? I mean,
- **[03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCjQAQuWiYc&t=231s)** — it's kind of absent, right? In a great majority of the population.
- **[03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCjQAQuWiYc&t=235s)** — Yes. So Dr. Gerhard Reuter, he's the German microbiologist who first isolated it in 1962
- **[04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCjQAQuWiYc&t=242s)** — from the breast milk of a German breastfeeding mother. He said back then,
- **[04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCjQAQuWiYc&t=247s)** — it's easy to find. It's ubiquitous. It's in breast milk. It's in stool. It's easy to find.
- **[04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCjQAQuWiYc&t=254s)** — With his 40-year academic career, he made a number of comments that he's finding
- **[04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCjQAQuWiYc&t=259s)** — increasingly difficult to find, such that by the 2000s, he could barely find it at all.
- **[04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCjQAQuWiYc&t=265s)** — That's been corroborated several times by others. We have a clinical study I'm proposing
- **[04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCjQAQuWiYc&t=268s)** — where we do several hundred people and see how many will corroborate that and also
- **[04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCjQAQuWiYc&t=274s)** — other biomarkers because it's so crucial for overall health and youthfulness.
- **[04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCjQAQuWiYc&t=279s)** — But it's presumptively because lactobacillus reuteri, as well as other lactobacillus species,
- **[04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCjQAQuWiYc&t=285s)** — there's many of them, of course, are uniquely susceptible to common antibiotics. All it
- **[04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCjQAQuWiYc&t=291s)** — takes is a round of penicillin or ampicillin or amoxicillin that you may have taken years
- **[04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCjQAQuWiYc&t=296s)** — and years ago, and you've wiped out all the reuteri and thereby lost all its huge advantages.
- **[05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCjQAQuWiYc&t=301s)** — Wow, I think you mentioned, I'm not sure if it was in your book, but it's like, was it 96% of the
- **[05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCjQAQuWiYc&t=307s)** — population doesn't really have very many left or?
- **[05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCjQAQuWiYc&t=311s)** — Exactly right. The best estimates we have from recent evidence is about 4% of people,
- **[05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCjQAQuWiYc&t=316s)** — 1 in 25 people still have it. And so that means 24 out of 25 don't have it, have losses.
- **[05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCjQAQuWiYc&t=324s)** — As you recall, one of the great effects of this microbe, you know, most microbes in the
- **[05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCjQAQuWiYc&t=329s)** — intestine microbiome colonize the colon way, way down, 24 feet down from the mouth.
- **[05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCjQAQuWiYc&t=335s)** — And that's where they're supposed to be. But reuteri is unique in that it has the unique
- **[05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCjQAQuWiYc&t=339s)** — capacity to colonize the small intestine. And that's where it takes up residence and
- **[05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCjQAQuWiYc&t=344s)** — produce natural antibiotics. And these natural antibiotics are effective in killing
- **[05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCjQAQuWiYc&t=349s)** — fecal microbes, which as you know, is a huge problem now. This notion of small,
- **[05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCjQAQuWiYc&t=356s)** — intestinal bacterial overgrowth, but we say SIBO, S-I-P-O, that is fecal microbes like E. coli,
- **[06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCjQAQuWiYc&t=363s)** — etc. have colonized the small intestine where they don't belong. And they're very
- **[06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCjQAQuWiYc&t=367s)** — destructive when they do that. Well, is the loss of reuteri and maybe some related species
- **[06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCjQAQuWiYc&t=372s)** — that have this unique ability to colonize the small intestine produce antibiotics of their own?
- **[06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCjQAQuWiYc&t=378s)** — And these are different than the antibiotics you get from the hospital, from the doctor.
- **[06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCjQAQuWiYc&t=382s)** — These are very selective antibiotics, unlike the stuff you get in the hospital, which tends to be
- **[06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCjQAQuWiYc&t=388s)** — broad-spectrum, wipes out everything, it's an atomic bomb for your GI tract. And so is the loss
- **[06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCjQAQuWiYc&t=394s)** — of reuteri part of the reason why this has become an epidemic? That is because it explains
- **[06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCjQAQuWiYc&t=399s)** — why SIBO has become an epidemic. I believe it is. Yeah, because now we have no protection
- **[06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCjQAQuWiYc&t=404s)** — against these other microbes. So I guess it's called what's called a keystone microbe,
- **[06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCjQAQuWiYc&t=408s)** — which is kind of a, it does more than just one thing. It kind of helps the whole ecosystem in
- **[06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCjQAQuWiYc&t=415s)** — that area, right? It kind of helps balance everything. Yeah. Isn't that wonderful?
- **[06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCjQAQuWiYc&t=419s)** — So if I had SIBO and I took an antibiotic like Zyfaxone, it just kills a bunch of stuff.
- **[07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCjQAQuWiYc&t=424s)** — But it doesn't start the process of restoration. So exactly right. You restore
- **[07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCjQAQuWiYc&t=429s)** — reuteri, maybe some other microbes, and it begins the process. Microbes are kind of like
- **[07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCjQAQuWiYc&t=434s)** — live in isolation. We have partners and families and friends and neighbors and co-workers and
- **[07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCjQAQuWiYc&t=440s)** — communities. Microbes are the same way. So restorative reuteri is that first step,
- **[07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCjQAQuWiYc&t=446s)** — not just in restoring reuteri, but in cultivating a healthy community of microbes.
- **[07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCjQAQuWiYc&t=451s)** — And then now let's just dive right into one of the huge effects that I'm very excited about.
- **[07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCjQAQuWiYc&t=456s)** — It causes the body to increase that hormone oxytocin, which is kind of a hormone that
- **[07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCjQAQuWiYc&t=462s)** — people know about. You're bonding with your mother as a baby, but it does a little more than
- **[07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCjQAQuWiYc&t=467s)** — that, right? Oxytocin does a lot more. And of course, as we age, oxytocin goes down. But
- **[07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCjQAQuWiYc&t=472s)** — tell us a little bit about this oxytocin, what that does. So it's a brain hormone from the
- **[07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCjQAQuWiYc&t=477s)** — hypothalamus that is released by when you restore reuteri. If we believe the animal evidence
- **[08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCjQAQuWiYc&t=483s)** — is about three fold, 300% or more, we've tried to corroborate that in humans. We're
- **[08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCjQAQuWiYc&t=492s)** — regarded as the hormone of love and empathy. It is that. You get this surgeon oxytocin,
- **[08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCjQAQuWiYc&t=497s)** — you'll see this play out in people who either get reuteri by some means, like a probiotic
- **[08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCjQAQuWiYc&t=502s)** — preparation, or as the yogurt to higher counts. And people will say, you know, I like my spouse
- **[08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCjQAQuWiYc&t=508s)** — better. I get along with my family better. Their foibles and quirks don't irritate me as
- **[08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCjQAQuWiYc&t=513s)** — much. I like my co-workers better. My favorite. I accept the opinions of other people more
- **[08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCjQAQuWiYc&t=520s)** — readily. I love that. But I also call oxytocin the hormone of shape and body composition.
- **[08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCjQAQuWiYc&t=529s)** — It determines where your muscle is, and how much you have. It also determines where fat
- **[08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCjQAQuWiYc&t=534s)** — is located. So it has a huge effect on your shape. You know, shape is a big thing. People
- **[09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCjQAQuWiYc&t=541s)** — say weight loss. But I'd like to tell people, let's go a step further than weight loss,
- **[09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCjQAQuWiYc&t=546s)** — the GLP agonist world is highlighted what a flawed area that is. You lose fat. And by the way,
- **[09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCjQAQuWiYc&t=553s)** — with the GLP agonist, you lose subcutaneous. You talk about ozendic, right? Like ozendic,
- **[09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCjQAQuWiYc&t=557s)** — all those things. Those are selective for fat beneath the skin, not the fat in your abdomen.
- **[09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCjQAQuWiYc&t=563s)** — And that's a problem. Because the most problematic form of fat, as you know, is the
- **[09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCjQAQuWiYc&t=567s)** — abdominal fat. And of course, GLP-1 agonists lead to loss of muscle, huge losses of muscle.
- **[09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCjQAQuWiYc&t=573s)** — We know, we know with excellent long term evidence, when you lose muscle, you die younger,
- **[09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCjQAQuWiYc&t=582s)** — several years typically, as well as your last years tend to be characterized by frailty,
- **[09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCjQAQuWiYc&t=588s)** — falls, fractures, dementia, etc. So the loss of muscle is critical. Yet the FDA approved a
- **[09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCjQAQuWiYc&t=594s)** — class of drugs that permits huge loss of muscle. So preserving muscle during any effort
- **[10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCjQAQuWiYc&t=600s)** — is absolutely critical. So you don't experience those awful effects, including early mortality.
- **[10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCjQAQuWiYc&t=608s)** — And oxytocin determines how much muscle you have. You know, personally,
- **[10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCjQAQuWiYc&t=612s)** — so I'm in my late 60s. When I was in my early 60s, when I started doing these things,
- **[10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCjQAQuWiYc&t=617s)** — specifically Rhetoride, I gained 13 pounds of muscle. And my strength increased by 50%
- **[10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCjQAQuWiYc&t=623s)** — over three weeks. I don't know about you, Dr. Berg, I hate the gym. I can't stand going
- **[10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCjQAQuWiYc&t=628s)** — in. So I go once a week for 15 minutes, get the heck out of there. Yeah, despite that meager
- **[10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCjQAQuWiYc&t=635s)** — effort, I gained 13 pounds and 50% I was doing lat pull downs, for instance, 10 repetitions,
- **[10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCjQAQuWiYc&t=642s)** — at 130 pounds over three weeks, 15 minutes a week, I was doing 200 pounds. So and that's
- **[10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCjQAQuWiYc&t=651s)** — been borne out also by the animal experimental data. And what I see in real life is this
- **[10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCjQAQuWiYc&t=657s)** — now here's a quirky thing, though, those of us who had more muscle in our youth tend to regain
- **[11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCjQAQuWiYc&t=661s)** — more muscle. So if you're a long distance runner, had skinny, you won't gain as much say as
- **[11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCjQAQuWiYc&t=666s)** — somebody who was a wrestler, or a weightlifter or a shot put through, you know, that kind
- **[11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCjQAQuWiYc&t=669s)** — of thing. And when you first told me that I was like, is that actually true? So I have
- **[11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCjQAQuWiYc&t=675s)** — not changed my workout. When I started this probably was it been about six weeks, maybe two
- **[11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCjQAQuWiYc&t=680s)** — months ago, I went from 185 to 192 or 193 and not fat, I'm definitely gaining muscle, which I'm like,
- **[11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCjQAQuWiYc&t=689s)** — wow, it's just as wild because it's like I'm not adding more workouts or anything. So this is a
- **[11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCjQAQuWiYc&t=694s)** — game changer. In fact, I even told my parents, my father lost a lot of muscle mass. So he's
- **[11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCjQAQuWiYc&t=698s)** — doing it. First of all, his hair is coming back, he's gaining more weight. And this is
- **[11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCjQAQuWiYc&t=702s)** — like a game changer, especially with age related muscle loss. But also, it keeps you
- **[11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCjQAQuWiYc&t=707s)** — independent. You're more likely to be able to bound upstairs, get in and out of your car with
- **[11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCjQAQuWiYc&t=712s)** — ease, go for long walks, ride your bike, and not succumb to loss of independence and end up in
- **[11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCjQAQuWiYc&t=718s)** — an assisted living center. So preserving muscle is a huge event. And in guys,
- **[12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCjQAQuWiYc&t=723s)** — of course, there's a marked increase in testosterone just from that. And ladies experience
- **[12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCjQAQuWiYc&t=727s)** — a preservation or increase in bone density. So it's part of the formula for combating all
- **[12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCjQAQuWiYc&t=733s)** — the effects of aging. Yeah, huge. I want to go back to this empathy word for because this I
- **[12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCjQAQuWiYc&t=738s)** — want really I want people understand what that word means, because I looked it up,
- **[12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCjQAQuWiYc&t=743s)** — and got a little more data and looked at the derivation of it. And it really boils down to
- **[12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCjQAQuWiYc&t=749s)** — being able to the ability to see someone's viewpoint, which is like, wow, if someone could
- **[12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCjQAQuWiYc&t=755s)** — do that, they're not going to get in an argument with their spouse. Because that's
- **[12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCjQAQuWiYc&t=760s)** — the anatomy of an argument. The person's unwilling to see someone's viewpoint,
- **[12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCjQAQuWiYc&t=765s)** — even in social reactions, if you can't see the viewpoint, you're just going to go back and forth.
- **[12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCjQAQuWiYc&t=770s)** — This is huge. And so what I just want to tell you what happened to me.
- **[12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCjQAQuWiYc&t=775s)** — I didn't really expect too much. But I would say a week after taking this,
- **[13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCjQAQuWiYc&t=780s)** — and we'll just call it maybe a cultured probiotic, not a yogurt, because it's a
- **[13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCjQAQuWiYc&t=785s)** — little bit different. And we're going to talk about how to make it in a second. But
- **[13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCjQAQuWiYc&t=790s)** — I didn't really notice anything except my wife says, what has gotten into you? I said,
- **[13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCjQAQuWiYc&t=795s)** — what do you mean? She goes, you want to hug me like five times a day and you want to snuggle.
- **[13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCjQAQuWiYc&t=798s)** — And I'm like, I know, it's weird. I don't know what's gotten over me. She goes,
- **[13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCjQAQuWiYc&t=803s)** — keep eating that yogurt. Right? So I mean, that's it's just really interesting. And I just
- **[13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCjQAQuWiYc&t=809s)** — had another response with one of my staff members. And she said, I said, because she's
- **[13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCjQAQuWiYc&t=820s)** — other people are nicer to me. I said, are you sure it's other people? Maybe it's just
- **[13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCjQAQuWiYc&t=826s)** — your viewpoint of other people. She goes, you know, it could be because like everywhere
- **[13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCjQAQuWiYc&t=829s)** — she goes, like she's just like very interested in the other person. I mean, that's like,
- **[13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCjQAQuWiYc&t=835s)** — nowadays, this is so such an important thing. I mean, could you imagine if more
- **[13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCjQAQuWiYc&t=839s)** — people had that ability? What's really bizarre about this is that I think that having this
- **[14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCjQAQuWiYc&t=844s)** — full microbiome creates a natural amount of oxytocin. This is not something new. It's
- **[14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCjQAQuWiYc&t=850s)** — something we had at one time and I think we had lost. Right? So it's not something that
- **[14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCjQAQuWiYc&t=854s)** — we're adding to the human race. It's just something that's lost along the way from these
- **[14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCjQAQuWiYc&t=858s)** — antibiotics and other things. You know, I think about that a lot, Dr. Berg, because
- **[14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCjQAQuWiYc&t=864s)** — I remind myself that we live in a time of record social isolation, yes, pandemic,
- **[14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCjQAQuWiYc&t=869s)** — but even pre pandemic record suicide. Likewise, pre pandemic, there was a 35% increase in suicide.
- **[14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCjQAQuWiYc&t=877s)** — Of course, half of all marriages ended in divorce. And the psychology community has
- **[14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCjQAQuWiYc&t=882s)** — been tabulating measuring and tabulating measures of narcissistic behavior since 1963.
- **[14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCjQAQuWiYc&t=887s)** — And the increase has been dramatic. So, you know, there's lots of things at work here,
- **[14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCjQAQuWiYc&t=892s)** — social media, other things, you and I don't have much control. Your listeners don't have
- **[14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCjQAQuWiYc&t=897s)** — control over that perhaps. But we do have control over this microbe and thereby the
- **[15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCjQAQuWiYc&t=902s)** — capacity to boost oxytocin. And I'm seeing exactly what you're describing. People like
- **[15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCjQAQuWiYc&t=906s)** — other people, but they get along better. You know, Dr. Paul Zach is a he calls himself a
- **[15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCjQAQuWiYc&t=912s)** — neuro economist in LA. And he did something crazy. He went to the jungles of New Guinea,
- **[15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCjQAQuWiYc&t=918s)** — and found a tribe who had never seen Western people before. So painted two generations
- **[15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCjQAQuWiYc&t=924s)** — away from cannibalism. Wow. And he says the first thing you encounter when you enter their
- **[15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCjQAQuWiYc&t=929s)** — campus is stink of unwashed humans because there's no running water. But they were
- **[15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCjQAQuWiYc&t=934s)** — friendly and embracing and they welcomed them. What he wanted to do was check the oxytocin
- **[15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCjQAQuWiYc&t=939s)** — blood levels before and after this ritual dance they do. Well, he did and he showed no
- **[15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCjQAQuWiYc&t=946s)** — rise. So he never published the data. But he mentioned in a book about oxytocin. So I
- **[15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCjQAQuWiYc&t=953s)** — shared it with me. He very generously did. And I compared those levels. This is a group of people
- **[15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCjQAQuWiYc&t=959s)** — and exposed to antibiotics, glyphosate, herbus, all that stuff. And I have data of my own
- **[16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCjQAQuWiYc&t=965s)** — compared. It's hard to compare, but you can get a crude sense. And it was clear that
- **[16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCjQAQuWiYc&t=970s)** — primitive people have much higher levels of oxytocin because they still have rhodorite.
- **[16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCjQAQuWiYc&t=975s)** — And they've been a study for the presence of rhodorite. They all have it, as do wild
- **[16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCjQAQuWiYc&t=979s)** — animals. We've lost it. And so we see lower levels in humans, modern humans.
- **[16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCjQAQuWiYc&t=987s)** — And I think we get it from our mother with breast milk. And how many kids don't get breast
- **[16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCjQAQuWiYc&t=993s)** — milk anymore? That could be a big problem too, right? There's that mom got antibiotics
- **[16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCjQAQuWiYc&t=999s)** — at time of delivery. She probably got it many times over her lifetime. Probably couldn't give
- **[16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCjQAQuWiYc&t=1004s)** — to the child. And the child gets antibiotics at delivery and gets antibiotics, thousands of
- **[16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCjQAQuWiYc&t=1011s)** — antibiotic prescriptions for every thousand children every year. And so we've wiped out
- **[16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCjQAQuWiYc&t=1016s)** — rhodorite and other microbes because antibiotics are kind of stupid. They're necessary,
- **[17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCjQAQuWiYc&t=1021s)** — but it's like an atom bomb. If we drop a nuclear bomb on a population, it doesn't only
- **[17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCjQAQuWiYc&t=1026s)** — pick the bad people. It picks out the children, the women, college professors,
- **[17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCjQAQuWiYc&t=1031s)** — the social workers. It kills everybody. Yeah. And I think the myth is that people think,
- **[17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCjQAQuWiYc&t=1038s)** — oh, if you take antibiotics, it all comes back for a couple of weeks. Yeah. You're going to
- **[17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCjQAQuWiYc&t=1041s)** — be back to where you were a couple of weeks later, right? I don't think that's true.
- **[17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCjQAQuWiYc&t=1046s)** — Absolutely not. It's quite clear. Now, the tough question is how much can we restore?
- **[17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCjQAQuWiYc&t=1051s)** — That's a work in progress. And that's why I think this idea of restoring these, what you're
- **[17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCjQAQuWiYc&t=1056s)** — saying is keystone microbes is so important as compared to say an antibiotic. You know,
- **[17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCjQAQuWiYc&t=1061s)** — antibiotics got us here. How can another round of antibiotics be part of the solution? And of
- **[17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCjQAQuWiYc&t=1067s)** — course, the use of fermented foods like kimchi, sauerkraut, veggies you ferment on your kitchen
- **[17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCjQAQuWiYc&t=1074s)** — counter like cucumbers, another spectacular way. Though the crazy thing about that is
- **[18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCjQAQuWiYc&t=1080s)** — those microbes in fermented foods are not the ones that colonize the GI tract. They somehow
- **[18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCjQAQuWiYc&t=1086s)** — cross feed, they provide nutrients to beneficial microbes and they bloom. So you get a bloom in
- **[18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCjQAQuWiYc&t=1092s)** — all the beneficial species, particularly ones that produce the fatty acid butyrate that
- **[18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCjQAQuWiYc&t=1096s)** — yield such effects as healing of the intestinal lining, reduction in blood sugar, blood pressure,
- **[18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCjQAQuWiYc&t=1102s)** — depression, anxiety, deeper sleep, a restoration of youthful childlike dreams. Oh, yeah.
- **[18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCjQAQuWiYc&t=1109s)** — Flying, showing up at the school playing your underwear, not knowing your lines.
- **[18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCjQAQuWiYc&t=1116s)** — How did you know I had that dream? All that stuff comes back.
- **[18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCjQAQuWiYc&t=1121s)** — Wow. Yeah, talk about vivid dreams. That's one thing that stands out and definitely my
- **[18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCjQAQuWiYc&t=1126s)** — sleep is much better. You know, you have a lot of people that have either rosacea or a
- **[18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCjQAQuWiYc&t=1133s)** — lot of skin issues and I know that's gut related. And I know there's some technical
- **[18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCjQAQuWiYc&t=1138s)** — parts of that like there's, you know, I guess byproducts of bacteria dying, which I don't want
- **[19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCjQAQuWiYc&t=1142s)** — to get too tactical, but just in a simple way, how do you explain what's happening
- **[19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCjQAQuWiYc&t=1146s)** — between your gut and your skin? Well, that wisdom is unfolding. I break down skin rashes
- **[19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCjQAQuWiYc&t=1153s)** — into two categories. The simple skin rashes that is due to a disruption of the skin
- **[19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCjQAQuWiYc&t=1158s)** — microbiome. Acne would be a good example of that. But then the more complex conditions like
- **[19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCjQAQuWiYc&t=1163s)** — rosacea and psoriasis tend to start in the gut. So in other words, if I give somebody a drug
- **[19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCjQAQuWiYc&t=1169s)** — that blocks some pathway, like an inflammatory marker, all you do is block the inflammatory
- **[19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCjQAQuWiYc&t=1176s)** — mark and get partial response. But that person still has SIBO and CFO and is thereby subject
- **[19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCjQAQuWiYc&t=1181s)** — to long-term consequences like colon cancer, ulcerative colitis, diverticular disease,
- **[19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCjQAQuWiYc&t=1188s)** — weight gain, obesity, so the pharmaceutical model is so deeply flawed, but it's so deeply ingrained
- **[19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCjQAQuWiYc&t=1197s)** — into common practice. This is what they do in common practice. They give you a blocker of
- **[20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCjQAQuWiYc&t=1201s)** — some pathway. That all said, it's not entirely clear what the path is to restore a healthy
- **[20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCjQAQuWiYc&t=1206s)** — microbiome, say in somebody with rosacea. But I'm seeing it happen. That is, do these
- **[20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCjQAQuWiYc&t=1211s)** — basic things. What I love about the microbiome things we're doing is that we're getting
- **[20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCjQAQuWiYc&t=1215s)** — away from the pharmaceutical model, which is if you have pneumococcal pneumonia, kill it.
- **[20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCjQAQuWiYc&t=1221s)** — If you have a staphylococcal abscess, kill it. Well, there's nothing specific for those
- **[20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCjQAQuWiYc&t=1226s)** — pathogens. So let's instead, the microbiome has a great amount of wisdom built into it,
- **[20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCjQAQuWiYc&t=1231s)** — as you know. So if we restore those keystone microbes that help us, they take care of it
- **[20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCjQAQuWiYc&t=1237s)** — for you. You just have to provide the basic building blocks for them to do that.
- **[20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCjQAQuWiYc&t=1242s)** — Do you believe from your experience, like these people that have these food allergies
- **[20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCjQAQuWiYc&t=1248s)** — and sensitivities, they can improve that by restoring the microbes in the gut?
- **[20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCjQAQuWiYc&t=1254s)** — Yeah, isn't that wonderful? I see it over and over and over again. People say,
- **[20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCjQAQuWiYc&t=1257s)** — I can't eat FODMAPs or legumes or nightshades or histamine-containing foods or fructose.
- **[21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCjQAQuWiYc&t=1264s)** — I only can eat seven foods. Right. Or they had IgG testing, food intolerance testing.
- **[21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCjQAQuWiYc&t=1271s)** — I can only eat... I can't eat these 43 foods. And I see all this go away. And the science is
- **[21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCjQAQuWiYc&t=1279s)** — evolving. This is SIBO. It's fecal microbes living in the small intestine. Small intestine
- **[21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCjQAQuWiYc&t=1284s)** — is very permeable by design. Very thin mucus barrier, single layer, very thin intestinal
- **[21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCjQAQuWiYc&t=1290s)** — lining. And it's permeable. That's where we're supposed to absorb all our nutrients.
- **[21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCjQAQuWiYc&t=1293s)** — But when fecal microbes invade that small intestine, 24 feet, trillions of microbes
- **[21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCjQAQuWiYc&t=1299s)** — that live and die rapidly, it inflames the intestinal wall. And it makes it even more
- **[21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCjQAQuWiYc&t=1304s)** — permeable and lets all kinds of stuff through, including bacterial breakdown products. This
- **[21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCjQAQuWiYc&t=1309s)** — process of small intestinal bacterial overgrowth and consumption of wheat,
- **[21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCjQAQuWiYc&t=1316s)** — the gliadin protein wheat, is a lethal combination that essentially guarantees you're
- **[22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCjQAQuWiYc&t=1321s)** — going to get fat, diabetic, experience dementia, and have all kinds of other conditions.
- **[22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCjQAQuWiYc&t=1327s)** — The neglect of this issue in conventional care, the haphazard administration of antibiotics,
- **[22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCjQAQuWiYc&t=1333s)** — and the awful, awful advice to cut your cholesterol, saturated fat, eat more healthy
- **[22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCjQAQuWiYc&t=1338s)** — whole grains, and everything in moderation is a recipe for absolute disaster. That's
- **[22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCjQAQuWiYc&t=1343s)** — what we're seeing, of course, playing out around. And that's why you and I have
- **[22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCjQAQuWiYc&t=1346s)** — so much to do every day. It's incredible. I mean, if you just take a look at a
- **[22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCjQAQuWiYc&t=1353s)** — typical, conventional GI doctor, right, you go to the doctor, and you have bloating.
- **[22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCjQAQuWiYc&t=1358s)** — Wow, they're going to go through their evaluation, and you're going to end up with
- **[22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCjQAQuWiYc&t=1362s)** — some medication that is just going to manage it to somewhat, but then it gets worse. I
- **[22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCjQAQuWiYc&t=1366s)** — mean, like, could you imagine if they just had some awareness of what's happening in the
- **[22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCjQAQuWiYc&t=1372s)** — gut and actually restore more of the root cause? I mean, it just, it's obvious to me, but I
- **[22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCjQAQuWiYc&t=1377s)** — think it's just about getting more awareness out there. It's honest, I don't know how much
- **[23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCjQAQuWiYc&t=1381s)** — we can change the medical profession, but we can actually educate the person on the
- **[23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCjQAQuWiYc&t=1385s)** — street so they can make their own choices. What you did is you had this wild idea. I'm
- **[23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCjQAQuWiYc&t=1390s)** — going to turn this into a yogurt. You took it and you mixed it with a fiber.
- **[23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCjQAQuWiYc&t=1395s)** — Kind of just describe what you did to grow this. As I mentioned, I got the original
- **[23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCjQAQuWiYc&t=1400s)** — microbe and Lactobacillus rhodorite, but it was present at such low count. It was 100 million
- **[23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCjQAQuWiYc&t=1405s)** — of two strains, which sounds like a lot if it was money, but in microbes, it's relatively
- **[23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCjQAQuWiYc&t=1412s)** — trivial. So I reasoned, how could I increase it without having to take 100 tablets,
- **[23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCjQAQuWiYc&t=1416s)** — which would be absurd. So I simply fermented it. Of course, microbes don't have sex.
- **[23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCjQAQuWiYc&t=1421s)** — There's no male and female microbes. They just double themselves. Well, Lactobacillus
- **[23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCjQAQuWiYc&t=1426s)** — rhodorite doubles every three hours or so at human body temperature. So I simply fermented it
- **[23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCjQAQuWiYc&t=1431s)** — for 36 hours, 12 doublings. I also added pre-biotic fiber. It's kind of like adding
- **[23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCjQAQuWiYc&t=1438s)** — cow manure to your garden. You know this on your farm. If you add cow manure or other
- **[24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCjQAQuWiYc&t=1442s)** — fertilizer, you get bigger tomatoes and cucumbers. So I did the same kind of thing.
- **[24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCjQAQuWiYc&t=1447s)** — And we did quantify. We quantified number of microbes at 12 hours, 24 hours, 36 hours,
- **[24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCjQAQuWiYc&t=1452s)** — and by sheer dumb luck, I happened to pick the magic number, the best number, which is 36 hours.
- **[24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCjQAQuWiYc&t=1459s)** — When you go longer than 36 hours, you start to get more death of microbes.
- **[24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCjQAQuWiYc&t=1463s)** — Dead microbes are still beneficial, but not as beneficial as live microbes. And so you get this
- **[24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCjQAQuWiYc&t=1469s)** — big ramp up in counts. We get somewhere around 300 billion. So we start with millions,
- **[24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCjQAQuWiYc&t=1474s)** — hundreds of millions. Now we get hundreds of billions. We get a thousand fold increase
- **[24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCjQAQuWiYc&t=1479s)** — over the original number. We did this using something called flow cytometry.
- **[24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCjQAQuWiYc&t=1483s)** — And we count the microbes. And so that was the key, I believe. Now if we had done it as a
- **[24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCjQAQuWiYc&t=1490s)** — probiotic, you know, one of the difficulties with probiotics, I formulate probiotics,
- **[24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCjQAQuWiYc&t=1493s)** — is they're very expensive if you want to put a whole bunch into a capsule, say. So in other
- **[24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCjQAQuWiYc&t=1499s)** — words, if you want to put 300 billion lactobacillus rudder into a capsule, it costs and
- **[25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCjQAQuWiYc&t=1506s)** — month. It'd be ridiculous. No one wants to do that. So you can buy the capsules at lower counts
- **[25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCjQAQuWiYc&t=1512s)** — at an affordable cost. You amplify the counts through fermentation like the yogurt. And by the
- **[25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCjQAQuWiYc&t=1518s)** — way, it doesn't have to be dairy. It can be coconut milk. It can be salsa. It can be hummus.
- **[25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCjQAQuWiYc&t=1525s)** — Yeah. Pica de gallo. Wow. And but dairy is so forgiving and so available and so familiar to
- **[25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCjQAQuWiYc&t=1534s)** — many people. It's easy to do. But we do that. We get 300 billion counts per half cup or 120
- **[25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCjQAQuWiYc&t=1540s)** — milliliters serving. And I think that's why we saw such extravagant effects in pushing back
- **[25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCjQAQuWiYc&t=1547s)** — SIBO. Because we're coming at this with very high counts sufficient to overcome the trillions
- **[25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCjQAQuWiYc&t=1552s)** — of fecal microbes of SIBO. Yeah. You also shared with me another idea, which I think is
- **[26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCjQAQuWiYc&t=1561s)** — brilliant. There's a certain microbe. You can get this probiotic at Walmart, the drugstore,
- **[26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCjQAQuWiYc&t=1566s)** — and then you could take a capsule of it. There's a very specific, very well researched
- **[26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCjQAQuWiYc&t=1570s)** — microbe in there that you could, I guess you mix it with fruit juice for 72 hours. You put
- **[26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCjQAQuWiYc&t=1575s)** — it outside, right? And then you maybe put some top on it. You don't want to tighten it up
- **[26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCjQAQuWiYc&t=1579s)** — because it will explode. But then you're basically making your own soda because the
- **[26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCjQAQuWiYc&t=1582s)** — microbe will eat a lot of the sugar. And that's a brilliant idea. I mean, like,
- **[26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCjQAQuWiYc&t=1588s)** — what a great drink. It's kind of like kombucha, but it actually has microbes in it.
- **[26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCjQAQuWiYc&t=1594s)** — You know, many of us miss juice. It was nice to have mango juice and cherry juice and all the
- **[26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCjQAQuWiYc&t=1600s)** — pomegranate juice, but they're so high in sugar that they're awful for you.
- **[26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCjQAQuWiYc&t=1605s)** — Well, here's a way to have the microbe consume the sugar and you can consume it down to zero.
- **[26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCjQAQuWiYc&t=1610s)** — So the final product is no longer sweet, but it's effervescent. So this microbe is a...
- **[26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCjQAQuWiYc&t=1616s)** — we make wine and beer, for instance, with Saccharomyces cerevisiae.
- **[27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCjQAQuWiYc&t=1621s)** — That's in here, the microbe.
- **[27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCjQAQuWiYc&t=1623s)** — It's saccharomyces boulardii.
- **[27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCjQAQuWiYc&t=1625s)** — Sorry, this is a similar cousin.
- **[27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCjQAQuWiYc&t=1630s)** — And it is a spectacular fermenter. If you put it into juice, so what I do is a capsule
- **[27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCjQAQuWiYc&t=1636s)** — into juice, any volume of juice, but you have to be careful. The juice can't contain
- **[27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCjQAQuWiYc&t=1640s)** — potassium sorbate or sodium benzoate or other preservative. And then as you say, cap it
- **[27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCjQAQuWiYc&t=1645s)** — too tightly because you'll see it 24 hours. It's bubbling like a cauldron because we're
- **[27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCjQAQuWiYc&t=1650s)** — producing carbon dioxide. And if you cap it too tightly, you'll literally have a mess in your
- **[27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCjQAQuWiYc&t=1654s)** — kitchen. So we keep it light. You can vent it. You can even go to these beer brewing
- **[27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCjQAQuWiYc&t=1660s)** — stores and they have venting caps for like $3. You can do that too. But you leave it on
- **[27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCjQAQuWiYc&t=1664s)** — your kitchen counter for at least four to eight hours. Test it. We have this wonderful
- **[27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCjQAQuWiYc&t=1669s)** — sugar-sensing device in our mouth called a tongue. We can taste it. And if it's sweet,
- **[27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCjQAQuWiYc&t=1673s)** — let it go another 12-24 hours. You want it not sweet. You and I don't want sugar. Your
- **[27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCjQAQuWiYc&t=1678s)** — listeners don't want sugars. But you drink this. It's probably one of the most important
- **[28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCjQAQuWiYc&t=1683s)** — things people can do. If you need a course of antibiotics, let's say one of your listeners
- **[28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCjQAQuWiYc&t=1687s)** — says, well, they're going to put an implant in my mouth. They're going to use prophylactic
- **[28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCjQAQuWiYc&t=1691s)** — antibiotics or had I had a terrible skin infection, whatever. And you have to have
- **[28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCjQAQuWiYc&t=1696s)** — an antibiotic. Well, you can drink this juice like a quarter half cup, couple three
- **[28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCjQAQuWiYc&t=1701s)** — times a day. And it's the most important thing you can do to at least partially protect
- **[28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCjQAQuWiYc&t=1706s)** — the integrity of your gastrointestinal microbiome. Nothing is fully protective
- **[28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCjQAQuWiYc&t=1710s)** — against antibiotics, but it's the best we have. If you haven't bought that book, super
- **[28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCjQAQuWiYc&t=1715s)** — get that book right now. You also on your website, you have a really great ongoing
- **[28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCjQAQuWiYc&t=1719s)** — program that people can participate in. You coach them and things like that. I'm going to
- **[28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCjQAQuWiYc&t=1722s)** — put your link down below so people can know about that. But I just wanted to have you on
- **[28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCjQAQuWiYc&t=1726s)** — to really talk about this one microbe that's so important. And then and I appreciate you
- **[28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCjQAQuWiYc&t=1732s)** — coming on. And then what I want to do is roll right into kind of a video of how a
- **[28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCjQAQuWiYc&t=1736s)** — person could make this microbe. And I will so don't click off yet. You can just watch
- **[29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCjQAQuWiYc&t=1741s)** — that and you can make notes and I'm going to put your stuff in a description. But
- **[29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCjQAQuWiYc&t=1745s)** — thank you so much for coming on, doc. I really appreciate it. Oh, my pleasure,
- **[29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCjQAQuWiYc&t=1749s)** — Dr. Burke. Always. So this is very simple how we make this. We're going to take the
- **[29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCjQAQuWiYc&t=1754s)** — probiotic, one capsule, and then we will open it up. And then we're going to take
- **[29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCjQAQuWiYc&t=1760s)** — inulin. This is a tablespoon. Take organic half and half. Just to make a paste. Mix it up
- **[29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCjQAQuWiYc&t=1772s)** — really good. Don't put too much of that half and half in there right off the bat.
- **[29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCjQAQuWiYc&t=1777s)** — Just about two tablespoons. And then we can pour the rest of this half and half in there.
- **[29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCjQAQuWiYc&t=1784s)** — One quart. We're going to mix this up really good. Take a container, two containers.
- **[29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCjQAQuWiYc&t=1791s)** — We'll pour some of this in here. Even it out pretty good.
- **[29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCjQAQuWiYc&t=1799s)** — Okay, we're putting this mixture into the yogurt maker. We have two of them, right?
- **[30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCjQAQuWiYc&t=1804s)** — Very carefully. Okay, now we have to add water to it. So we got water right here.
- **[30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCjQAQuWiYc&t=1813s)** — So I'm going to pour the water like so.
- **[30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCjQAQuWiYc&t=1819s)** — And I want that level to be at the same level as the mixture inside the containers.
- **[30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCjQAQuWiYc&t=1828s)** — So I'm looking to see if it's the same mixture. And yes, it is. So we now have
- **[30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCjQAQuWiYc&t=1835s)** — the water at the level of a little bit more than I wanted. So that's fine.
- **[30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCjQAQuWiYc&t=1841s)** — Okay, here's the next part. And of course, if you have a different machine, you're going to have to
- **[30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCjQAQuWiYc&t=1845s)** — just do the same type of thing. On the left, we have temperature and time. So we can press this
- **[30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCjQAQuWiYc&t=1850s)** — once. Okay, and then we want this at 99 degrees Fahrenheit. So we're going to bring this down.
- **[30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCjQAQuWiYc&t=1858s)** — Okay, and then press start on that. And then now what we're going to do, we have eight hours.
- **[31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCjQAQuWiYc&t=1864s)** — We're going to go up to 36 hours. Okay, and then we press start again. And guess what,
- **[31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCjQAQuWiYc&t=1871s)** — we're done. We're going to put the top on it. And then we're going to wait for 36 hours.
- **[31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCjQAQuWiYc&t=1877s)** — And then after that's done, we are going to then put it in the refrigerator for storage.
- **[31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCjQAQuWiYc&t=1885s)** — Okay, we're pulling out the refrigerator after 36 hours and leaving in the fridge for a couple
- **[31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCjQAQuWiYc&t=1890s)** — hours to cool down. And now we're going to consume a half of a cup of this
- **[31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCjQAQuWiYc&t=1897s)** — every single day. I like to have mine before that. It's amazing. It's rich. It's delicious.
- **[31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCjQAQuWiYc&t=1903s)** — You can add berries to it. If you need to add a sweetener, go ahead. But I think you'll
- **[31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCjQAQuWiYc&t=1910s)** — find it quite delicious. A half a cup a day.

- **[00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rx03S_u50mo&t=0s)** — The health benefits of certain mushrooms are quite mind-blowing. So today I'm going to take
- **[00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rx03S_u50mo&t=7s)** — some of the confusions that people have about mushrooms and just make it really, really simple.
- **[00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rx03S_u50mo&t=12s)** — So if you have a very specific health problem, you'll know exactly what to take. Now I'm going
- **[00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rx03S_u50mo&t=18s)** — to primarily focus on four different types of mushrooms, okay? But they're in the family of
- **[00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rx03S_u50mo&t=24s)** — okay, or fungi. And fungi is very interesting because there is more related DNA-wise to a fungus
- **[00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rx03S_u50mo&t=32s)** — than there is to plants. In other words, like plants have photosynthesis, so they actually
- **[00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rx03S_u50mo&t=38s)** — breathe in CO2 and they make oxygen. Well, mushrooms, which is a type of fungus, don't do
- **[00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rx03S_u50mo&t=44s)** — that. They breathe in oxygen and release CO2, very similar to humans. They actually share
- **[00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rx03S_u50mo&t=51s)** — 50% of their DNA, which basically means they have certain blueprints that make certain
- **[00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rx03S_u50mo&t=58s)** — chemicals that we can use for the benefit of our own health. Fungi is the largest and oldest
- **[01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rx03S_u50mo&t=67s)** — organism on planet Earth. In fact, in just one handful of soil from the forest, you have
- **[01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rx03S_u50mo&t=74s)** — literally 26 miles of a certain type of fungi called mycelium. So there is a tremendous amount
- **[01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rx03S_u50mo&t=82s)** — of fungus working in the soil with the roots of plants, exchanging different nutrients to make
- **[01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rx03S_u50mo&t=87s)** — sure that plant has the nutrients that it needs and getting certain sugars from the plants
- **[01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rx03S_u50mo&t=92s)** — as their food. And so really it's a fungus that mobilize the minerals in the soil. And so
- **[01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rx03S_u50mo&t=98s)** — without this fungus, the plant really has a hard time getting nutrition. Fungus is also
- **[01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rx03S_u50mo&t=101s)** — responsible for breaking things down like organic matter, trees, wood, leaves, etc. So they are the
- **[01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rx03S_u50mo&t=109s)** — great recyclers. But today we're going to talk about four key mushrooms that you need to know
- **[01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rx03S_u50mo&t=114s)** — about. I want to make it really, really simple for you. The first one is the reishi mushroom.
- **[01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rx03S_u50mo&t=119s)** — Okay, this mushroom could be thought of as a natural Xanax. Now, of course, I'm not promoting
- **[02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rx03S_u50mo&t=125s)** — medication, but this is the natural version without the side effects. And what does that
- **[02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rx03S_u50mo&t=129s)** — medication do? It's purported to help you with anxiety and helping you calm down. Therefore,
- **[02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rx03S_u50mo&t=135s)** — it's also good for sleep. If you want to increase your tolerance to stress, if you want to
- **[02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rx03S_u50mo&t=139s)** — counter stress and cortisol, this mushroom might be a good one to add to your diet.
- **[02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rx03S_u50mo&t=145s)** — The next one is lion's mane. Okay, because it looks like a lion's mane. This one could be
- **[02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rx03S_u50mo&t=150s)** — considered like a natural Adderall, but without the side effects. What is that drug? Well,
- **[02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rx03S_u50mo&t=155s)** — it's used for people with cognitive problems, attention deficit issues. A lot of college
- **[02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rx03S_u50mo&t=162s)** — students take it to increase their learning abilities because it kind of speeds up the
- **[02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rx03S_u50mo&t=168s)** — central nervous system to a certain degree. Of course, it has a lot of side effects.
- **[02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rx03S_u50mo&t=173s)** — But lion's mane is specifically good for cognitive function, improving focus, concentration,
- **[03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rx03S_u50mo&t=182s)** — memory. A lot of people take it as a coffee replacement in the morning. But it has some
- **[03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rx03S_u50mo&t=189s)** — really interesting benefits in repairing and regenerating nerve tissue and myelin sheath
- **[03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rx03S_u50mo&t=195s)** — around the nerve. It has something called the neurotrophic factor, which just helps support
- **[03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rx03S_u50mo&t=201s)** — nerve growth in general, specifically in the area of the brain called the hippocampus, which
- **[03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rx03S_u50mo&t=206s)** — is involved with cognitive function to a certain degree. This mushroom also has been known to
- **[03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rx03S_u50mo&t=212s)** — increase something called BDNF, brain derived neurotrophic factor. That's kind of like miracle
- **[03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rx03S_u50mo&t=219s)** — grow, but for your brain. So it helps the nerves grow. So when you think about lion's mane,
- **[03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rx03S_u50mo&t=224s)** — think cognitive improvements and anything related to a breakdown in your brain,
- **[03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rx03S_u50mo&t=231s)** — like neurodegenerative conditions like Alzheimer's, Parkinson's,
- **[03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rx03S_u50mo&t=236s)** — dementia. Then we have the shiitake mushroom. That mushroom is good for blood pressure. It's
- **[04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rx03S_u50mo&t=243s)** — really beneficial for your gut microbiome. A good portion of our immune system is in the gut.
- **[04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rx03S_u50mo&t=249s)** — And shiitake mushroom can actually increase the killer T cells, which are responsible for
- **[04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rx03S_u50mo&t=255s)** — killing viruses. And the last one, which I think is the most interesting, is the turkey
- **[04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rx03S_u50mo&t=259s)** — mushroom. This one has been researched the most. When you think of turkey tail, you want to think
- **[04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rx03S_u50mo&t=265s)** — of anti-cancer properties. But as far as turkey tail goes, I would recommend anyone who has
- **[04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rx03S_u50mo&t=272s)** — cancer to start taking it immediately. It has a non-specific immune modulating action, which
- **[04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rx03S_u50mo&t=279s)** — basically strengthen the immune system overall. So if someone is on chemo or radiation,
- **[04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rx03S_u50mo&t=286s)** — turkey tail is great to take against cancer. The white blood cells actually eat certain
- **[04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rx03S_u50mo&t=292s)** — compounds in this mushroom, like beta-glucans, and consume it, carry it into the lymphatic system
- **[04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rx03S_u50mo&t=299s)** — to help cause the cancer cell to commit suicide. That's called apoptosis. A normal cell would
- **[05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rx03S_u50mo&t=305s)** — basically kill itself as a kind of a greater good for the body. But a cancer cell basically
- **[05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rx03S_u50mo&t=312s)** — lives forever. Now, turkey tail also reduces inflammation in your gut, which is also related
- **[05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rx03S_u50mo&t=318s)** — to your immune system as well. Because if you think about cancer, cancer tends to spread into
- **[05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rx03S_u50mo&t=323s)** — areas of inflammation. All right, so reishi is good as a natural xanax for calming down
- **[05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rx03S_u50mo&t=328s)** — the fight or fight mechanism or cortisol. Then we have lion's mane, which is everything to do
- **[05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rx03S_u50mo&t=333s)** — with cognitive function, helping you concentrate, helping you focus. Then we have shiitake,
- **[05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rx03S_u50mo&t=339s)** — which is three things, cholesterol, blood pressure, and your immune system. And then we
- **[05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rx03S_u50mo&t=344s)** — have turkey tail, which it has a potent anti-cancer effect. All right, so I hope I gave you some
- **[05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rx03S_u50mo&t=350s)** — clarity on what these mushrooms are good for. And so the next time you have a certain problem,
- **[05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rx03S_u50mo&t=355s)** — you'll know exactly what mushroom to take or eat. Since I mentioned cancer and a good remedy
- **[06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rx03S_u50mo&t=361s)** — for that, if you have not seen this video on cancer, it would be very, very smart to watch it.
- **[06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rx03S_u50mo&t=368s)** — I put that video up right here.

- **[00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QX6gCRJZ0dk&t=0s)** — Today I'm going to share some very important information about zinc.
- **[00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QX6gCRJZ0dk&t=3s)** — And the reason I'm talking about zinc is that zinc is involved in so many different things.
- **[00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QX6gCRJZ0dk&t=9s)** — It's involved in 300 different enzymes and over a thousand different factors related to your DNA.
- **[00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QX6gCRJZ0dk&t=16s)** — Its functions are very wide and helping certain enzymes, not just for digestion,
- **[00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QX6gCRJZ0dk&t=23s)** — but for a lot of other things. And if you can identify early signs of a zinc deficiency,
- **[00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QX6gCRJZ0dk&t=27s)** — sometimes they call it a subclinical deficiency, then you can prevent advanced problems related to
- **[00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QX6gCRJZ0dk&t=34s)** — zinc. And that could include a complete loss of appetite and then you end up having anorexia,
- **[00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QX6gCRJZ0dk&t=40s)** — necrosis because the tissue is not healing. And so zinc actually helps with wound healing.
- **[00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QX6gCRJZ0dk&t=46s)** — And if you're deficient in zinc, you can develop ulcers externally or internally on your
- **[00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QX6gCRJZ0dk&t=51s)** — body. Even ulcers in your mouth. And even some elderly that have these ulcers because
- **[00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QX6gCRJZ0dk&t=56s)** — they're in this bed and they're unhealing ulcers or wounds, they need zinc big time.
- **[01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QX6gCRJZ0dk&t=63s)** — Another advanced problem with zinc is hypogonadism where your testicles actually
- **[01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QX6gCRJZ0dk&t=68s)** — atrophy or shrink. So you're obviously going to have low testosterone. That could be an
- **[01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QX6gCRJZ0dk&t=74s)** — advanced zinc deficiency. And I'm going to put all this research down below in the description.
- **[01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QX6gCRJZ0dk&t=79s)** — Another interesting advanced problem would be thymus atrophy. The thymus gland is on top
- **[01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QX6gCRJZ0dk&t=84s)** — of the heart and that has a huge influence of making certain T cells that are involved with
- **[01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QX6gCRJZ0dk&t=90s)** — the immune system. It's like a training camp for your immune system. And if you have atrophy
- **[01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QX6gCRJZ0dk&t=94s)** — of the thymus gland, can you imagine what's going to happen to your immune system? You're
- **[01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QX6gCRJZ0dk&t=98s)** — not going to have an immune system. Then we have the adrenal hormone called cortisol. Your
- **[01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QX6gCRJZ0dk&t=103s)** — cortisol can greatly go up if you're deficient in zinc. Which could be the reason why it
- **[01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QX6gCRJZ0dk&t=108s)** — affects the thymus, the immune system. Because when you have high cortisol, that can paralyze
- **[01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QX6gCRJZ0dk&t=113s)** — the immune system in the white blood cell. You also have muscle loss because of the involvement
- **[01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QX6gCRJZ0dk&t=118s)** — with zinc. In fact, one of the best sources of zinc is in animal meat. Because we need that
- **[02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QX6gCRJZ0dk&t=124s)** — zinc in our muscles to create antioxidants to counter all the oxidative damage that occurs,
- **[02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QX6gCRJZ0dk&t=129s)** — especially with exercise. So if you can identify early signs of a zinc deficiency,
- **[02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QX6gCRJZ0dk&t=135s)** — you can head off or prevent bigger problems. And I want to show you one of my favorite
- **[02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QX6gCRJZ0dk&t=140s)** — books. It's called The Technology of War by Sun Tzu. You probably heard of The Art of War,
- **[02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QX6gCRJZ0dk&t=146s)** — right? But this book is a lot different. If you take a look at some of the books on Art of War,
- **[02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QX6gCRJZ0dk&t=150s)** — there's like 45 different versions. A lot of them are altered from the original translation.
- **[02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QX6gCRJZ0dk&t=156s)** — This book is an exact duplication of the original text that Sun Tzu wrote in Chinese.
- **[02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QX6gCRJZ0dk&t=163s)** — In this section, he's talking about supreme skill is not 100 victories in 100 battles.
- **[02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QX6gCRJZ0dk&t=168s)** — Supreme skill is subduing the enemy's operations and its forces without battle. And if we can
- **[02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QX6gCRJZ0dk&t=175s)** — relate this to this topic on your body, which I do all the time, you don't want to wait until
- **[02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QX6gCRJZ0dk&t=179s)** — you have an advanced disease before you do something about it. If you understand the early
- **[03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QX6gCRJZ0dk&t=184s)** — signs or the symptoms of something, you can easily prevent it because you have the knowledge.
- **[03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QX6gCRJZ0dk&t=189s)** — And so that way, understanding your body's early signs for something is extremely valuable.
- **[03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QX6gCRJZ0dk&t=195s)** — I have a lot of videos on that. So let's talk about the most common early sign of a zinc
- **[03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QX6gCRJZ0dk&t=200s)** — deficiency. Well, first of all, you have to have the intelligence or understanding of
- **[03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QX6gCRJZ0dk&t=205s)** — where zinc tends to affect certain organs more than others. And it just so happens
- **[03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QX6gCRJZ0dk&t=209s)** — that the organ that is most affected by a zinc deficiency is the pancreas. Okay? Now
- **[03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QX6gCRJZ0dk&t=216s)** — there's two parts of the pancreas. You have one that controls your blood sugars,
- **[03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QX6gCRJZ0dk&t=219s)** — which has to do with insulin, which zinc has a lot to do with. But also the other
- **[03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QX6gCRJZ0dk&t=223s)** — is called the extracrine part of the gland, which has to do with enzymes. Okay? And so this is the
- **[03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QX6gCRJZ0dk&t=230s)** — symptom. Are you ready for this? Foul smelling stool that floats. Yeah, that's right. You
- **[03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QX6gCRJZ0dk&t=236s)** — might have some cramping. You might have a little diarrhea. You might have abdominal pain.
- **[04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QX6gCRJZ0dk&t=241s)** — You might even have bloating. Okay? But this is a very easy thing to identify. And yes,
- **[04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QX6gCRJZ0dk&t=246s)** — it could come from other things too. It could come from what you just ate, but it can also
- **[04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QX6gCRJZ0dk&t=251s)** — zinc deficiency. And just as a side note, I did another video about this, I think four years ago,
- **[04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QX6gCRJZ0dk&t=256s)** — and there is another common first symptom, which is shortness of breath upon exertion,
- **[04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QX6gCRJZ0dk&t=263s)** — which is another indicator, which is good to know because sometimes people think, well,
- **[04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QX6gCRJZ0dk&t=266s)** — I'm just out of shape. Well, it could be a zinc deficiency. So we need to look at the
- **[04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QX6gCRJZ0dk&t=271s)** — diet. Are you eating enough zinc? Or maybe it's coming from what's called gut malabsorption.
- **[04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QX6gCRJZ0dk&t=278s)** — Maybe you have inflammation in your gut. That's a big cause of a zinc deficiency. Another cause
- **[04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QX6gCRJZ0dk&t=284s)** — of a zinc deficiency is consuming something with something called phytates, okay? Or phytic acid,
- **[04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QX6gCRJZ0dk&t=289s)** — which is in grains. If you are a cereal eater, if you eat a lot of refined carbs,
- **[04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QX6gCRJZ0dk&t=295s)** — you're going to get phytic acid, and that is going to potentially create a zinc deficiency.
- **[05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QX6gCRJZ0dk&t=301s)** — There's millions of children that have a zinc deficiency around the world that are consuming
- **[05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QX6gCRJZ0dk&t=307s)** — a lot of cereal. They don't consume a lot of meats, especially red meat. And then they end
- **[05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QX6gCRJZ0dk&t=313s)** — up with this diarrhea, which is very, very dangerous. And out of all the foods that are
- **[05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QX6gCRJZ0dk&t=318s)** — the highest in zinc, it's oysters. Okay. And then you have crab, other shellfish, meats,
- **[05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QX6gCRJZ0dk&t=325s)** — fish. And then you might have some zinc in cashews and peanuts, but you want to just look
- **[05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QX6gCRJZ0dk&t=330s)** — at the whole situation to see, could this situation be coming from my diet? Is it coming
- **[05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QX6gCRJZ0dk&t=335s)** — from something that I'm eating that's creating this deficiency? Because also sugar or even being a
- **[05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QX6gCRJZ0dk&t=341s)** — diabetic can create a deficiency. Too much stress can create a deficiency in zinc. Or let's say,
- **[05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QX6gCRJZ0dk&t=347s)** — for example, you drink alcohol on a regular basis, that could create a zinc deficiency.
- **[05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QX6gCRJZ0dk&t=351s)** — Okay. Having an infection can create a deficiency of zinc. So I think it's very
- **[05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QX6gCRJZ0dk&t=356s)** — important to use principles like this to be able to predict. And to be able to predict,
- **[06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QX6gCRJZ0dk&t=361s)** — you have to have the right information. You have to have all of the information to be able
- **[06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QX6gCRJZ0dk&t=365s)** — to understand the consequences or the early signs of something that can lead into something
- **[06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QX6gCRJZ0dk&t=370s)** — bigger. Because typically what would you do if you have a symptom like a digestive issue? You
- **[06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QX6gCRJZ0dk&t=374s)** — might go to the doctor, he gives you a pill, it masks the symptom. Your symptom is better.
- **[06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QX6gCRJZ0dk&t=381s)** — The problem is still there. And then it kind of goes downhill from there. And just to give
- **[06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QX6gCRJZ0dk&t=385s)** — you a little more intel or information on zinc, zinc is very much involved with your sleep
- **[06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QX6gCRJZ0dk&t=393s)** — If you have sleep problems, let's say you don't get enough of the last part of your sleep,
- **[06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QX6gCRJZ0dk&t=397s)** — zinc could be something you might want to take right before bed. Zinc is also heavily involved
- **[06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QX6gCRJZ0dk&t=402s)** — in a part of your brain called the hippocampus, which is kind of like the relay part for
- **[06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QX6gCRJZ0dk&t=409s)** — memory and learning and cognitive function. Zinc is also, like I said before, involved with
- **[06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QX6gCRJZ0dk&t=415s)** — insulin. Okay. If you don't have enough zinc, it can put you at risk for becoming a
- **[07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QX6gCRJZ0dk&t=421s)** — Zinc is also involved in making neurotransmitters like serotonin and dopamine, which can affect
- **[07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QX6gCRJZ0dk&t=427s)** — your mood. And zinc also makes up a very important group of antioxidants involved with
- **[07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QX6gCRJZ0dk&t=435s)** — your brain, your heart, and your muscles. The three parts of your body that use a lot of
- **[07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QX6gCRJZ0dk&t=442s)** — oxygen. And if you look a little bit deeper, zinc helps with this oxidative stress that's
- **[07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QX6gCRJZ0dk&t=448s)** — involved with your mitochondria, the energy factory of all these tissues. So I want you to
- **[07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QX6gCRJZ0dk&t=453s)** — start looking at these symptoms a little bit differently. Instead of just jumping and treating
- **[07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QX6gCRJZ0dk&t=457s)** — them, try to understand what your body is telling you. Realize that a lot of these
- **[07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QX6gCRJZ0dk&t=462s)** — problems could be related to a nutritional deficiency that could be related to your diet.
- **[07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QX6gCRJZ0dk&t=466s)** — And use these indicators or little red flags as something that you can have advanced knowledge
- **[07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QX6gCRJZ0dk&t=471s)** — or prediction to then prevent something. But unfortunately, this idea of prevention,
- **[07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QX6gCRJZ0dk&t=477s)** — you can't really talk too much about it because even like on the bottles of different nutrients,
- **[08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QX6gCRJZ0dk&t=483s)** — you'll see there's a mandatory label. It says this product is not intended to diagnose,
- **[08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QX6gCRJZ0dk&t=488s)** — treat, cure, or prevent any disease. So it's illegal to even prevent a disease. So what I
- **[08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QX6gCRJZ0dk&t=495s)** — try to do in my videos is to give you the knowledge of what you could end up with. So then
- **[08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QX6gCRJZ0dk&t=500s)** — that way you don't have to end up with a situation where you're battling it, which is
- **[08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QX6gCRJZ0dk&t=505s)** — so much easier to win the war by doing something like this than going into battle with a health
- **[08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QX6gCRJZ0dk&t=511s)** — condition. Now if you haven't seen my recent video on the dark side of zinc, I put it up
- **[08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QX6gCRJZ0dk&t=516s)** — right here. Check it out.

## Video 16: The ONE FOOD That Shrinks an Enlarged Prostate

- **[00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx42_D5bTas&t=0s)** — So, there's one food that you want to eat if you want to shrink an enlarged prostate. Prostate is a gland
- **[00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx42_D5bTas&t=8s)** — that wraps around this little tube underneath your bladder. And when it gets bigger, normally it
- **[00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx42_D5bTas&t=14s)** — should be like the size of a walnut, when it enlarges, it kind of interferes with the urine
- **[00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx42_D5bTas&t=19s)** — flow and that can keep you up at night. And an enlarged prostate can also turn into a cancer
- **[00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx42_D5bTas&t=26s)** — and the name that they use for this enlarged prostate is called benign prostatic hyperplasia.
- **[00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx42_D5bTas&t=33s)** — What's involved here? Well, this is kind of what the theory is. In order for the prostate to enlarge,
- **[00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx42_D5bTas&t=38s)** — you have to have certain type of hormones that activate it. Okay, and one is called testosterone
- **[00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx42_D5bTas&t=45s)** — because testosterone is a anabolic hormone that, you know, helps your muscles grow. So,
- **[00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx42_D5bTas&t=52s)** — testosterone, through the help of a certain enzyme, will convert into DHT, which is a more
- **[00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx42_D5bTas&t=57s)** — powerful form of testosterone. And apparently this DHT is involved in the enlargement of
- **[01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx42_D5bTas&t=63s)** — the prostate. And so the mechanism of one of the top-selling drugs for this condition
- **[01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx42_D5bTas&t=67s)** — inhibits that enzyme to reduce DHT. As we age, testosterone goes down. DHT also goes down.
- **[01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx42_D5bTas&t=77s)** — And also as men age, the prostate enlarges. So how can that be a solution since DHT
- **[01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx42_D5bTas&t=85s)** — is normally lower as we get older? It's very confusing. So in other words, apparently the real
- **[01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx42_D5bTas&t=90s)** — problem is that as we age, that enzyme increases in its activity, thereby giving you
- **[01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx42_D5bTas&t=98s)** — more DHT and creating a more profound effect over the prostate. As far as the top medication,
- **[01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx42_D5bTas&t=106s)** — they found that by taking the medication, you can decrease the enlargement of your prostate by
- **[01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx42_D5bTas&t=110s)** — about 23%. But there's some slight minor complications, side effects. Decreased libido,
- **[01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx42_D5bTas&t=119s)** — increased risk of prostate cancer, as well as a syndrome that can occur when you stop taking
- **[02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx42_D5bTas&t=125s)** — the medication. And that syndrome has other side effects, like signs of suicidal impulses,
- **[02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx42_D5bTas&t=130s)** — atrophy of the penis, and the development of breast tissue. But other than that,
- **[02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx42_D5bTas&t=136s)** — it's totally fine. The question is there a natural inhibitor of this enzyme? The answer is
- **[02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx42_D5bTas&t=141s)** — yes. In one study, it showed that it can decrease the risk of a prostate enlargement
- **[02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx42_D5bTas&t=146s)** — by 21% and prostate cancer. This natural enzyme inhibitor also decreases inflammation. It has a
- **[02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx42_D5bTas&t=160s)** — Now lycopene is called a carotenoid, which is a kind of a category of a lot of different plant
- **[02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx42_D5bTas&t=166s)** — based compounds. And lycopene is in watermelon, it's in carrot, and it's even in grapefruit.
- **[02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx42_D5bTas&t=173s)** — But if you want to get a large amount of lycopene, you want to get it from
- **[02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx42_D5bTas&t=177s)** — tomatoes. If you can get them from your garden or the farmers market, that would be great.
- **[03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx42_D5bTas&t=181s)** — You can get them as canned tomatoes, or tomato sauce, or tomato paste. Because apparently,
- **[03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx42_D5bTas&t=188s)** — the lycopene in tomatoes becomes more bioavailable when you heat the tomato. Of course,
- **[03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx42_D5bTas&t=196s)** — don't get the tomato sauce that has the sugar added. Get the one that is as natural as
- **[03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx42_D5bTas&t=200s)** — possible. Now the other interesting thing about lycopene is it's a fat soluble compound. Which
- **[03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx42_D5bTas&t=206s)** — means that if you're cooking with tomatoes, you want to add a little olive oil with it.
- **[03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx42_D5bTas&t=211s)** — Because the extra fat with heat will help extract more of that lycopene from it.
- **[03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx42_D5bTas&t=215s)** — If you just include maybe twice a week some type of tomato dish, whether these tomatoes are on
- **[03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx42_D5bTas&t=222s)** — your salad or in some type of dish, that would be a really great thing for your prostate.
- **[03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx42_D5bTas&t=228s)** — So there are other things you can take to help your prostate. Zinc is at the top of the
- **[03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx42_D5bTas&t=232s)** — list. Rosveratrol is another compound that they used with lycopene. Now as a side note,
- **[03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx42_D5bTas&t=238s)** — probably the worst thing for the prostate is milk. Because there's certain growth hormones
- **[04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx42_D5bTas&t=245s)** — in milk that can enlarge the prostate as well. And even when I was in practice, I remember several
- **[04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx42_D5bTas&t=250s)** — older men coming in and explaining that every time they consume some dairy, when they would wake
- **[04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx42_D5bTas&t=256s)** — up the next morning, they had a much worse time urinating. Probably because of the enlargement
- **[04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx42_D5bTas&t=261s)** — of the prostate. So dairy is something you would want to avoid. Now that you know the best food
- **[04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx42_D5bTas&t=265s)** — for the prostate, the next thing you need to know is what to avoid. There are four things
- **[04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx42_D5bTas&t=270s)** — to avoid to prevent an enlarged prostate. And I put that in this video right here. Check it out.

## Video 17: THIS Increases Heart Attack Risk over 2000%

**Watch on YouTube:** [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=18ZKgshcwi4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=18ZKgshcwi4)

*Click any timestamp to jump to that moment in the video*

- **[00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=18ZKgshcwi4&t=0s)** — This can increase the risk of a heart attack over 2000% within the first 24 hours.
- **[00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=18ZKgshcwi4&t=7s)** — Now you're probably wondering what am I talking about? What increases the risk of heart attacks by that much?
- **[00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=18ZKgshcwi4&t=12s)** — Could it be bad diet? No. Could it be smoking? No. What about alcohol? No.
- **[00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=18ZKgshcwi4&t=18s)** — This trigger that I'm about to talk about also increases the risk of getting viral infections and autoimmune diseases.
- **[00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=18ZKgshcwi4&t=26s)** — So what is this trigger? It's actually stress. But the type of stress that increases heart attacks the most is losses.
- **[00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=18ZKgshcwi4&t=33s)** — A loss of a significant person in your life. And they actually have a name for it. It's called a broken heart syndrome.
- **[00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=18ZKgshcwi4&t=39s)** — What they found was that when you go through a loss, your risk for heart attack within the first 24 hours goes up significantly.
- **[00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=18ZKgshcwi4&t=45s)** — Within the first week, your risk for heart attacks are 6x. That's 600%.
- **[00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=18ZKgshcwi4&t=50s)** — So this got me thinking into other types of stresses like post-traumatic stress disorder and the risk of developing autoimmune diseases by 46%.
- **[01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=18ZKgshcwi4&t=61s)** — And I'm also going to talk about a lot of stress that people have nowadays is actually manufactured.
- **[01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=18ZKgshcwi4&t=66s)** — Stress can be physical, it can be mental, it can be real or imagined.
- **[01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=18ZKgshcwi4&t=72s)** — Even thinking about a stressful state can affect your body physically.
- **[01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=18ZKgshcwi4&t=77s)** — You're not in that stressful environment, but just thinking about it, your blood pressure will start to increase.
- **[01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=18ZKgshcwi4&t=82s)** — When I first met my wife, we went to this fair and they had a roller coaster. She loves roller coasters.
- **[01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=18ZKgshcwi4&t=88s)** — She thrives on roller coasters. She can do the most intense roller coaster that you can possibly imagine.
- **[01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=18ZKgshcwi4&t=93s)** — I can't even do the small baby ones, right? I'm a wimp and of course I didn't want to look like a wimp.
- **[01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=18ZKgshcwi4&t=99s)** — So I got on the roller coaster with her. I remember getting into the cart and they put this thing over you and they lock you in.
- **[01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=18ZKgshcwi4&t=105s)** — My pulse rate started beating. And as we're going up this slow hill and I see on the other end it's like a drop off.
- **[01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=18ZKgshcwi4&t=113s)** — My blood pressure, my adrenaline starts kicking in more and more.
- **[01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=18ZKgshcwi4&t=118s)** — And I started holding on really, really tight to the point I was shaking.
- **[02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=18ZKgshcwi4&t=122s)** — My wife's looking over at me going, oh my gosh, what's happening here?
- **[02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=18ZKgshcwi4&t=127s)** — And I was literally in pure terror. We get up to the top, you can't even see where you're going, right?
- **[02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=18ZKgshcwi4&t=133s)** — And my wife said your face was white as a ghost.
- **[02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=18ZKgshcwi4&t=136s)** — What that means when your face is that pale is you've lost all your blood flow.
- **[02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=18ZKgshcwi4&t=141s)** — All the blood is in the bottom of your feet.
- **[02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=18ZKgshcwi4&t=143s)** — So as we went over the roller coaster going down, I think I passed out.
- **[02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=18ZKgshcwi4&t=148s)** — I mean there was tears coming down from my eye. My wife said I'm so sorry.
- **[02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=18ZKgshcwi4&t=152s)** — I will never do that again. I will never force you to get on the roller coaster.
- **[02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=18ZKgshcwi4&t=155s)** — And I've never been on a roller coaster ever since that.
- **[02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=18ZKgshcwi4&t=158s)** — I also had a severe fear of public speaking. Devastating.
- **[02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=18ZKgshcwi4&t=163s)** — There's certain types of stresses that people actually can tolerate. Other people can't.
- **[02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=18ZKgshcwi4&t=168s)** — So there's two main types of stress.
- **[02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=18ZKgshcwi4&t=171s)** — There's the type of stress that's acute or sudden.
- **[02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=18ZKgshcwi4&t=174s)** — And then there's the chronic stress that happens over a period of time.
- **[02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=18ZKgshcwi4&t=177s)** — But both of them can create similar problems.
- **[02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=18ZKgshcwi4&t=179s)** — And what happens when you actually experience stress, you have two things going on.
- **[03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=18ZKgshcwi4&t=183s)** — You have a higher level of adrenaline which then activates something else called cortisol.
- **[03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=18ZKgshcwi4&t=187s)** — So cortisol is a hormone. Adrenaline is a neurotransmitter.
- **[03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=18ZKgshcwi4&t=191s)** — Adrenaline works very quickly.
- **[03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=18ZKgshcwi4&t=194s)** — Cortisol takes some time. It starts mobilizing the sugar for quick energy.
- **[03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=18ZKgshcwi4&t=199s)** — Whereas adrenaline mainly works on the heart rate, sweating, blood pressure,
- **[03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=18ZKgshcwi4&t=204s)** — and also constriction of blood in certain places.
- **[03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=18ZKgshcwi4&t=207s)** — Because we need to put the blood into the heart and the lungs.
- **[03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=18ZKgshcwi4&t=210s)** — And this is why even when someone has a heart attack, right, when their arteries are clamping down,
- **[03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=18ZKgshcwi4&t=214s)** — they can inject the heart with adrenaline and it's a vasodilator. It opens it up.
- **[03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=18ZKgshcwi4&t=219s)** — The same thing with someone having an asthma attack.
- **[03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=18ZKgshcwi4&t=221s)** — They'll take a cortisol inhaler and that will vasodilate the lungs.
- **[03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=18ZKgshcwi4&t=226s)** — But what happens in chronic stress is you start getting this high level of cortisol.
- **[03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=18ZKgshcwi4&t=232s)** — Cortisol is a natural suppressant of your immune system.
- **[03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=18ZKgshcwi4&t=237s)** — And this leaves you wide open for getting infections.
- **[04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=18ZKgshcwi4&t=241s)** — Because you just now lost the barrier.
- **[04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=18ZKgshcwi4&t=244s)** — This is why stress lowers your defenses and allows the virus to invade the body.
- **[04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=18ZKgshcwi4&t=249s)** — This is also why so many people develop autoimmune diseases after a stress event.
- **[04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=18ZKgshcwi4&t=256s)** — Especially if the stress is intense enough or a shock to the system.
- **[04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=18ZKgshcwi4&t=261s)** — Where literally you just shut down a part of the immune system that is supposed to keep these autoimmune diseases in check.
- **[04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=18ZKgshcwi4&t=268s)** — Especially a specific cell called the T regulatory cell.
- **[04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=18ZKgshcwi4&t=271s)** — Those cells are kind of like the peacekeeper.
- **[04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=18ZKgshcwi4&t=274s)** — And they tend to keep the body from developing this self attack.
- **[04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=18ZKgshcwi4&t=278s)** — It's called an autoimmune attack.
- **[04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=18ZKgshcwi4&t=280s)** — From your own immune system destroying your own body cells.
- **[04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=18ZKgshcwi4&t=283s)** — So that's interesting that also explains why stress really can activate so many problems with the immune system.
- **[04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=18ZKgshcwi4&t=291s)** — And of course with heart attack and stroke we're dealing with adrenaline.
- **[04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=18ZKgshcwi4&t=294s)** — What you have to realize is stress activates adrenaline which activates clotting and other problems related to the cardiovascular system.
- **[05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=18ZKgshcwi4&t=301s)** — Like I said before you don't even necessarily have to have real stress in front of you.
- **[05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=18ZKgshcwi4&t=306s)** — It can be you're trying to sleep and you're running through all sorts of scenarios.
- **[05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=18ZKgshcwi4&t=311s)** — But some things can get overwhelming and they can shock our body.
- **[05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=18ZKgshcwi4&t=315s)** — And I'm going to talk about some great solutions for that as well.
- **[05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=18ZKgshcwi4&t=319s)** — Without getting into the details of that.
- **[05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=18ZKgshcwi4&t=322s)** — Generally I think you know what I'm talking about when there's certain people or groups that are basically making your environment more dangerous.
- **[05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=18ZKgshcwi4&t=330s)** — Or at least perceived to be dangerous. Creating a real or fake emergency. Exaggerating a crisis.
- **[05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=18ZKgshcwi4&t=337s)** — All of these things are meant to put people in fear.
- **[05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=18ZKgshcwi4&t=341s)** — Because usually the group that's creating that problem has a solution that now you're going to be dependent on.
- **[05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=18ZKgshcwi4&t=347s)** — And really the key word in this whole thing is control.
- **[05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=18ZKgshcwi4&t=349s)** — There's good stress and bad stress. And it all really has to do with who's in control of that stress.
- **[05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=18ZKgshcwi4&t=355s)** — Because there are certain stresses that are very therapeutic to us, right?
- **[05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=18ZKgshcwi4&t=359s)** — Like exercise. We're in control.
- **[06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=18ZKgshcwi4&t=362s)** — So sometimes we think that if we can just get rid of all of our stress and our problems we'd be very very healthy.
- **[06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=18ZKgshcwi4&t=368s)** — But that's not actually true.
- **[06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=18ZKgshcwi4&t=369s)** — One would be high intensity interval training.
- **[06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=18ZKgshcwi4&t=372s)** — I mean that actually increases stress.
- **[06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=18ZKgshcwi4&t=374s)** — It increases adrenaline. It increases cortisol.
- **[06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=18ZKgshcwi4&t=377s)** — But you're only doing it for a very short period of time.
- **[06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=18ZKgshcwi4&t=379s)** — Another stress that's super therapeutic for me is rock climbing.
- **[06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=18ZKgshcwi4&t=384s)** — Now that's intense. You're going straight up and vertical. You're at great heights.
- **[06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=18ZKgshcwi4&t=388s)** — And when I climb, my attention is totally in the present on the next thing I'm going to put my hand on.
- **[06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=18ZKgshcwi4&t=397s)** — If I'm thinking about any problems in my mind, they are gone within the first few minutes.
- **[06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=18ZKgshcwi4&t=403s)** — Because I'm more focused on something else.
- **[06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=18ZKgshcwi4&t=406s)** — So it's really what you do with your attention.
- **[06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=18ZKgshcwi4&t=408s)** — Because a therapeutic goal should be to get you out of your head.
- **[06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=18ZKgshcwi4&t=412s)** — And to take your attention and unfixate it to what you're focused on and push it to something else.
- **[06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=18ZKgshcwi4&t=418s)** — Sports. That's a great therapy. Because it's a game.
- **[07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=18ZKgshcwi4&t=421s)** — It's easy to get your attention off your problems when you're doing sports.
- **[07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=18ZKgshcwi4&t=424s)** — Another thing to do is work with wood. Very therapeutic.
- **[07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=18ZKgshcwi4&t=428s)** — Cleaning, gardening, dancing, music, art, and physical manual work around your house.
- **[07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=18ZKgshcwi4&t=434s)** — All of that is super therapeutic for stress.
- **[07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=18ZKgshcwi4&t=437s)** — If you're in a stress mode, you start to breathe in a certain way.
- **[07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=18ZKgshcwi4&t=442s)** — This is a way to control your own autonomic nervous system.
- **[07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=18ZKgshcwi4&t=445s)** — It works like a charm.
- **[07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=18ZKgshcwi4&t=447s)** — What you do is breathe through your nose, not your mouth.
- **[07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=18ZKgshcwi4&t=450s)** — As you breathe in and breathe out, this is a great technique to pull you out of a panic attack or anxiety attack.
- **[07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=18ZKgshcwi4&t=457s)** — But again, it's you now controlling your own breath.
- **[07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=18ZKgshcwi4&t=461s)** — That's really the secret sauce of that.
- **[07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=18ZKgshcwi4&t=462s)** — And also taking certain nutritional things like an adaptogen.
- **[07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=18ZKgshcwi4&t=467s)** — Ashwagandha is one of the better ones.
- **[07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=18ZKgshcwi4&t=469s)** — Ashwagandha helps increase your tolerance to stress.
- **[07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=18ZKgshcwi4&t=472s)** — It calms the nerves.
- **[07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=18ZKgshcwi4&t=473s)** — B1 you can get also in nutritional yeast.
- **[07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=18ZKgshcwi4&t=476s)** — Magnesium is another one that I use as well, especially in the evening before I go to sleep.
- **[08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=18ZKgshcwi4&t=480s)** — It winds you down.
- **[08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=18ZKgshcwi4&t=482s)** — It helps in many different ways related to stress and cortisol.
- **[08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=18ZKgshcwi4&t=485s)** — But there's one more thing you can do.
- **[08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=18ZKgshcwi4&t=487s)** — I used to do this in practice and now I do videos on how to do it yourself.
- **[08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=18ZKgshcwi4&t=492s)** — You can manually do some acupressure to certain points in your body that will greatly reduce your stress.
- **[08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=18ZKgshcwi4&t=499s)** — It will literally put you to sleep when you do it.
- **[08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=18ZKgshcwi4&t=501s)** — It's wonderful.
- **[08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=18ZKgshcwi4&t=502s)** — And for that information, you can check it out right here.

- **[00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pdKgMQI_JoI&t=0s)** — When you combine sugar with caffeine, you get a powerful combination of bad things that are
- **[00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pdKgMQI_JoI&t=5s)** — going to happen to you. I'm going to get into those in just a second, but I just wanted to
- **[00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pdKgMQI_JoI&t=9s)** — first show you how much sugar is in these energy drinks. An energy drink is something that you
- **[00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pdKgMQI_JoI&t=16s)** — perceive to be something not that unhealthy, right? If we compare it to a soda, well,
- **[00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pdKgMQI_JoI&t=22s)** — what you're going to find out is that it's actually worse than Coca-Cola. Okay, let me
- **[00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pdKgMQI_JoI&t=26s)** — explain. Let's first get into this one here, Rockstar. Rockstar has 16 teaspoons of sugar.
- **[00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pdKgMQI_JoI&t=33s)** — It has the most sugar of all of these, but it's not just regular sugar. It is a synthetic,
- **[00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pdKgMQI_JoI&t=40s)** — industrial created sugar. So it's not good for your liver, but 16 teaspoons. Then we get into
- **[00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pdKgMQI_JoI&t=47s)** — the Monster energy drink, which is 14 and a half teaspoons of sugar. Not as much as this one
- **[00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pdKgMQI_JoI&t=54s)** — and then we have something called NOS, which is an enhanced mental focus drink. This one has 13
- **[01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pdKgMQI_JoI&t=61s)** — and a half teaspoons. All of these right here have more sugar than a Coke because a Coke only
- **[01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pdKgMQI_JoI&t=68s)** — has 13 teaspoons of sugar. But if we look at the caffeine, Rockstar has 160 milligrams
- **[01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pdKgMQI_JoI&t=75s)** — and also Monster has 160 milligrams and so does NOS. But Coca-Cola only has 45 milligrams.
- **[01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pdKgMQI_JoI&t=83s)** — So all three of these have three times the amount of caffeine as a Coke and all three of them have
- **[01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pdKgMQI_JoI&t=89s)** — more sugar. Yet somehow we perceive these to be healthier, but they're all not good for you
- **[01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pdKgMQI_JoI&t=94s)** — because the type of sugar that they're putting in here and the amounts is just crazy too high.
- **[01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pdKgMQI_JoI&t=98s)** — This has high fructose corn syrup. These also have synthetic sugars. Gatorade has a little
- **[01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pdKgMQI_JoI&t=103s)** — more sugar than a Coke, like just under 14 teaspoons. Okay, Empowerade has about 13
- **[01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pdKgMQI_JoI&t=108s)** — teaspoons of sugar. So all three of these are similar in sugars. Now as far as caffeine and
- **[01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pdKgMQI_JoI&t=113s)** — Gatorade, there isn't any in this particular drink, but in other drinks it goes anywhere
- **[01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pdKgMQI_JoI&t=119s)** — between 23 milligrams to 200 milligrams of caffeine. And Powerade apparently does not have
- **[02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pdKgMQI_JoI&t=125s)** — any caffeine. Then we get to this one called Celsius. Zero sugars. And of course they put
- **[02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pdKgMQI_JoI&t=130s)** — sucralose in there, the type of sweetener that isn't necessarily classified as a sugar,
- **[02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pdKgMQI_JoI&t=136s)** — but it creates a similar damage that sugar creates. But just indirectly, I'm not going to
- **[02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pdKgMQI_JoI&t=140s)** — get into that. But what you should know is this one has 270 milligrams of caffeine. Over
- **[02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pdKgMQI_JoI&t=147s)** — 100 milligrams more caffeine than these right here. And almost six times the amount of caffeine
- **[02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pdKgMQI_JoI&t=155s)** — than a Coca-Cola. But now let's get into why you never want to combine a lot of sugar with
- **[02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pdKgMQI_JoI&t=160s)** — caffeine. When you combine sugar with caffeine, you are creating a ticking time bomb. Let's get
- **[02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pdKgMQI_JoI&t=168s)** — into a deep dive on what happens when you combine a lot of sugar and caffeine at the same
- **[02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pdKgMQI_JoI&t=172s)** — time. You know when people are doing this, I always like to ask what problem are you trying
- **[02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pdKgMQI_JoI&t=176s)** — to solve? Are you trying to solve your fatigue? And is this solution going to be the best
- **[03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pdKgMQI_JoI&t=184s)** — solution or not? So let's kind of take a look at this, right? Let's first look at sugar.
- **[03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pdKgMQI_JoI&t=188s)** — First question is, do you have low blood sugar? That we can just add some sugar and raise it.
- **[03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pdKgMQI_JoI&t=193s)** — Chances are your problem is not even a low blood sugar situation. But if it is, it will
- **[03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pdKgMQI_JoI&t=198s)** — raise the blood sugar and give you a little boost in mental energy. And when I'm talking
- **[03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pdKgMQI_JoI&t=203s)** — about a little boost, I'm talking about a very short-term boost of mental energy, right?
- **[03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pdKgMQI_JoI&t=209s)** — Followed by a roller coaster crash right down here. And all the symptoms of low blood
- **[03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pdKgMQI_JoI&t=215s)** — are irritableness, brain fog, weakness, tiredness. That wouldn't actually occur
- **[03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pdKgMQI_JoI&t=222s)** — if you didn't consume that sugar in the first place. Because a lot of these energy drinks
- **[03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pdKgMQI_JoI&t=227s)** — are just filled with an ungodly amount of sugar. And where does the sugar go when you
- **[03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pdKgMQI_JoI&t=233s)** — consume it? Does it go to the muscles? Probably not. It's going to go to the brain.
- **[03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pdKgMQI_JoI&t=237s)** — The brain has the priority over incoming sugar. But it's really kind of a fake energy. It's
- **[04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pdKgMQI_JoI&t=242s)** — not a real sustaining long-term energy at all. It's not going to give you any type of endurance.
- **[04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pdKgMQI_JoI&t=248s)** — Now when we talk about energy in the body, we're really talking about the energy factory.
- **[04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pdKgMQI_JoI&t=251s)** — It's called the mitochondria. The mitochondria are in the cells. And that is where all the
- **[04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pdKgMQI_JoI&t=257s)** — energy is produced. And so food comes into this machine. And then it gets converted into
- **[04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pdKgMQI_JoI&t=263s)** — an energy currency called ATP. So you can look at ATP as some energy that you can use. It's
- **[04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pdKgMQI_JoI&t=272s)** — a sort of energy that's just sitting there that you created by eating certain food. And you can
- **[04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pdKgMQI_JoI&t=276s)** — actually use it on demand. So when you eat food, it creates so many of these ATP's. When you
- **[04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pdKgMQI_JoI&t=280s)** — consume sugar, there's actually another machine outside this machine that just deals with sugar.
- **[04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pdKgMQI_JoI&t=286s)** — But it only gives you two ATP. Then what happens, it can go through here and produce
- **[04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pdKgMQI_JoI&t=290s)** — more energy if this machine is working correctly. The reason I'm bringing this up,
- **[04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pdKgMQI_JoI&t=296s)** — because I'm trying to explain biochemistry in a really simple way. In order for you to
- **[05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pdKgMQI_JoI&t=300s)** — feed into usable fuel, it has to go through a whole bunch of steps from here all the way
- **[05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pdKgMQI_JoI&t=306s)** — through here and out this side right here. And in that process, each little step is dependent
- **[05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pdKgMQI_JoI&t=312s)** — on what's called cofactors. These are the nutrients. B1, B2, B3, B5, biotin, coenzyme Q10,
- **[05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pdKgMQI_JoI&t=320s)** — magnesium, iron, sulfur, lipoic acid. These are the helper things that allow that fuel
- **[05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pdKgMQI_JoI&t=326s)** — to be metabolized or used or converted to this right here. And the reason I'm bringing that up
- **[05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pdKgMQI_JoI&t=331s)** — is because the sugar that you're consuming in these energy drinks is completely empty
- **[05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pdKgMQI_JoI&t=338s)** — of these right here. Now, they do add some of these cofactors into these drinks. And
- **[05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pdKgMQI_JoI&t=344s)** — somehow they know that if they don't, you're going to create a lot of deficiencies. Because
- **[05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pdKgMQI_JoI&t=350s)** — your ability to make this energy is dependent on these guys right here. So if these aren't
- **[05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pdKgMQI_JoI&t=353s)** — the food that you eat, then the body is just going to suck it from your tissues, from the
- **[05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pdKgMQI_JoI&t=358s)** — reserve. This is why when you eat a lot of refined sugar, as in these drinks right here,
- **[06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pdKgMQI_JoI&t=362s)** — you're going to deplete these nutrients. Also, if you eat food like fruit, for example,
- **[06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pdKgMQI_JoI&t=368s)** — it has a lot of these nutrients. It also has antioxidants to protect against the massive
- **[06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pdKgMQI_JoI&t=374s)** — amount of sugar that you're taking in. But of course, when you're consuming refined sugar,
- **[06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pdKgMQI_JoI&t=379s)** — you don't get the benefit of any accidents. So eventually you end up destroying this machine
- **[06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pdKgMQI_JoI&t=384s)** — right here. And now you can only really get a small amount of energy from that sugar. This
- **[06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pdKgMQI_JoI&t=390s)** — is why people that consume these energy drinks over a long period of time get more tired and
- **[06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pdKgMQI_JoI&t=395s)** — more tired and more tired, until the point where it doesn't give them any energy at all.
- **[06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pdKgMQI_JoI&t=400s)** — Because the machine is broken. Another term for that is insulin resistance. Now, the other
- **[06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pdKgMQI_JoI&t=405s)** — interesting thing that the sugar does is because there's so much sugar that comes into your
- **[06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pdKgMQI_JoI&t=411s)** — gastrointestinal tract, when your body has this concentrated sugar, just like in a diabetic,
- **[06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pdKgMQI_JoI&t=416s)** — what happens, it must dilute this concentration by pulling water out of the cells and into
- **[07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pdKgMQI_JoI&t=424s)** — your intestines. And this is why when you consume a lot of sugar in sports drinks and
- **[07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pdKgMQI_JoI&t=429s)** — energy drinks, you might have diarrhea, abdominal pain, and check this out, dehydration
- **[07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pdKgMQI_JoI&t=435s)** — in the cells. Because when you consume this concentrated sugar, the body has to pull
- **[07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pdKgMQI_JoI&t=441s)** — fluids out of the cell, going from a normal cell to a raisin-like cell. So a lot of these
- **[07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pdKgMQI_JoI&t=448s)** — sport hydrating drinks are really dehydrating drinks. We get like a roller coaster effect,
- **[07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pdKgMQI_JoI&t=455s)** — a blood sugar. You might need more of the drink to have more mental energy. So this is
- **[07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pdKgMQI_JoI&t=464s)** — gut microbiome because you're consuming a lot of extra sugar that feeds pathogens. But one of
- **[07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pdKgMQI_JoI&t=471s)** — the big things that consuming a lot of refined sugar does is it depletes potassium. Because
- **[07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pdKgMQI_JoI&t=476s)** — there is a potassium-sodium pump in your body. You have like millions and millions and millions
- **[08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pdKgMQI_JoI&t=482s)** — of them all over the place. And this potassium-sodium pump powers, like a battery,
- **[08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pdKgMQI_JoI&t=488s)** — your nerves and your muscles and allows everything to work. Well, one thing about
- **[08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pdKgMQI_JoI&t=494s)** — refined sugar is it's going to deplete you of potassium. A lot of these drinks do not nearly
- **[08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pdKgMQI_JoI&t=500s)** — have enough potassium. And unless you're getting it from the diet, you're just creating a lot
- **[08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pdKgMQI_JoI&t=505s)** — of potassium deficiency. Then all of a sudden the muscles and the nervous system start getting
- **[08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pdKgMQI_JoI&t=509s)** — weaker and weaker and weaker. Our bodies need a tremendous amount of potassium. And many
- **[08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pdKgMQI_JoI&t=514s)** — people don't get that much. I mean we need like 4700 milligrams every single day. We need a
- **[08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pdKgMQI_JoI&t=520s)** — massive amount of potassium for a reason. It powers the sodium-potassium pump. And I don't
- **[08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pdKgMQI_JoI&t=525s)** — think a lot of people talk about this. But as you consume more refined sugar, you become
- **[08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pdKgMQI_JoI&t=529s)** — potassium depleted. And then all these functions that potassium gave you kind of disappear.
- **[08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pdKgMQI_JoI&t=534s)** — Like the regulation of your heart rate. So the heart rate starts going higher. Also potassium
- **[08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pdKgMQI_JoI&t=539s)** — is a physiological tranquilizer at night. It helps you calm down. Let's shift gears to
- **[09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pdKgMQI_JoI&t=544s)** — caffeine, right? So now we're going to add caffeine to sugar. What does caffeine do?
- **[09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pdKgMQI_JoI&t=549s)** — Believe it or not, a little bit of caffeine actually can help the mitochondria.
- **[09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pdKgMQI_JoI&t=554s)** — A little bit. But the amount of caffeine in these are off the chart. What does caffeine
- **[09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pdKgMQI_JoI&t=558s)** — actually do? Does it give you energy? No, it does not give you energy. What it does is it
- **[09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pdKgMQI_JoI&t=566s)** — a certain chemical compound that normally makes you tired. But it's not giving you energy.
- **[09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pdKgMQI_JoI&t=572s)** — It's tricking the body into thinking it's not tired. The problem with the caffeine in these
- **[09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pdKgMQI_JoI&t=578s)** — energy drinks is just way, way too much. So you can really overdo it. A little bit of
- **[09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pdKgMQI_JoI&t=582s)** — caffeine is fine. A lot is not good for a lot of things. Number one, it's going to increase
- **[09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pdKgMQI_JoI&t=587s)** — adrenaline. Heart rate goes up. Blood pressure goes up. Stress on the cardiovascular system.
- **[09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pdKgMQI_JoI&t=594s)** — Another interesting thing about caffeine is it's a diuretic. It's going to pull water out.
- **[10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pdKgMQI_JoI&t=600s)** — So here you are drinking an energy drink or a sports drink, a hydrating drink,
- **[10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pdKgMQI_JoI&t=605s)** — and the sugar and the caffeine. I don't think these have caffeine, but other ones do.
- **[10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pdKgMQI_JoI&t=610s)** — Basically dehydrate you. So you take these to get energy and to be hydrated, but they
- **[10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pdKgMQI_JoI&t=615s)** — actually create fatigue and dehydration. Also, it creates a stimulus on your adrenal glands.
- **[10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pdKgMQI_JoI&t=620s)** — It's going to get them working a lot more than they should, and it's going to create adrenal
- **[10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pdKgMQI_JoI&t=624s)** — fatigue. So eventually when you start out, you have a lot of energy. And then over a period
- **[10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pdKgMQI_JoI&t=629s)** — of time, you're just more tired, more tired, more tired. It's called chronic fatigue syndrome.
- **[10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pdKgMQI_JoI&t=633s)** — It's going to affect your sleep too. A better solution would be to get the diet corrected. So
- **[10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pdKgMQI_JoI&t=639s)** — the actual food gives you long-term sustained level energy. Most people do not need to add
- **[10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pdKgMQI_JoI&t=647s)** — their body can easily make energy from the fat that you have in your body. Also from this machine,
- **[10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pdKgMQI_JoI&t=654s)** — if it works correctly. So I'm just trying to increase the awareness on too many of these
- **[10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pdKgMQI_JoI&t=658s)** — over time comes with the package and there's a much better way to be hydrated and create
- **[11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pdKgMQI_JoI&t=662s)** — more energy from using food by consuming more electrolytes or actual salt. And as a side note,
- **[11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pdKgMQI_JoI&t=670s)** — if you're deficient in sodium, you will have weak muscles. Salt is important to take
- **[11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pdKgMQI_JoI&t=674s)** — with water if you're working out and you're sweating. Thanks for watching and I will see
- **[11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pdKgMQI_JoI&t=678s)** — you in the next video.

- **[00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u3k5CUmiXU&t=0s)** — I'm going to show you how to get rid of puffy eyes, okay? It's so easy.
- **[00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u3k5CUmiXU&t=4s)** — All you have to do is understand the mechanism. There's a lot of fancy terms for puffy eyes.
- **[00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u3k5CUmiXU&t=10s)** — Periorbital edema. All you need to know is it's called eye bags.
- **[00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u3k5CUmiXU&t=14s)** — And unfortunately, the medical profession treats this condition with drugs, steroids, antihistamines, all sorts of medications.
- **[00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u3k5CUmiXU&t=23s)** — And I'm not telling you not to take your medication. I just want to give you another viewpoint on this.
- **[00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u3k5CUmiXU&t=27s)** — I mean, if you look up the Wikipedia page, it'll say potentially it could be caused from the hypothyroid, insomnia, infection, allergy, and a whole bunch of other causes,
- **[00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u3k5CUmiXU&t=39s)** — which are so rare, and the bigger cause, the more common cause, isn't even mentioned at all.
- **[00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u3k5CUmiXU&t=46s)** — And the reason I know a lot about this is I had puffy eyes for many years. I didn't know what it was.
- **[00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u3k5CUmiXU&t=51s)** — But once I did this one thing, it completely cleared up.
- **[00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u3k5CUmiXU&t=55s)** — Now on the Wiki page, there's two little things that were interesting, okay?
- **[01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u3k5CUmiXU&t=60s)** — They did mention one cause being high levels of sodium, which is definitely true.
- **[01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u3k5CUmiXU&t=65s)** — And also they mentioned a low-carb diet could help prevent puffiness of the eyes, which I found very interesting too.
- **[01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u3k5CUmiXU&t=73s)** — And they had also a little data, you know, using cucumber slices on your eyes or cold packs.
- **[01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u3k5CUmiXU&t=78s)** — Yeah, maybe that might help for a second, but it doesn't really correct the problem.
- **[01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u3k5CUmiXU&t=83s)** — Yes, many times the kidneys are involved, and yes, there's usually a sodium problem as well.
- **[01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u3k5CUmiXU&t=89s)** — But both of these conditions are stemming from too much sugar in your bloodstream.
- **[01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u3k5CUmiXU&t=95s)** — I mean, even if you take a look at the number one cause of kidney disease, it's diabetes.
- **[01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u3k5CUmiXU&t=100s)** — What is diabetes? High levels of sugar.
- **[01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u3k5CUmiXU&t=102s)** — So when you look at someone's eyelids and they're puffy, yeah, it could be related to the kidney, but we want to go deeper.
- **[01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u3k5CUmiXU&t=109s)** — And here's the simplicity of it. This is what you need to know.
- **[01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u3k5CUmiXU&t=112s)** — When there's too much sugar in the bloodstream, you're going to have too much insulin in the bloodstream.
- **[01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u3k5CUmiXU&t=117s)** — You'll eventually develop insulin resistance.
- **[02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u3k5CUmiXU&t=121s)** — Both of these situations causes your body to hold sodium.
- **[02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u3k5CUmiXU&t=126s)** — More salt is retained when you consume sugar.
- **[02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u3k5CUmiXU&t=129s)** — And if you do this for a long period of time, it'll overload the kidneys and it'll actually back up into the system.
- **[02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u3k5CUmiXU&t=136s)** — And it shows up in the eyelids, sometimes even before other parts of your body.
- **[02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u3k5CUmiXU&t=141s)** — I was at a restaurant about two or three months ago and I remember seeing an overweight kid with an overweight dad just chowing down serious amounts of carbs.
- **[02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u3k5CUmiXU&t=154s)** — And both of them had really puffy eyes. I was very tempted to go over there and talk to them, but I didn't do it.
- **[02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u3k5CUmiXU&t=160s)** — My wife said, no, you better not do that.
- **[02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u3k5CUmiXU&t=162s)** — But I think a lot of people are not aware that it's coming from the sugar.
- **[02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u3k5CUmiXU&t=166s)** — So sugar causes the retention of fluid because of the retention of sodium.
- **[02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u3k5CUmiXU&t=174s)** — There's a couple of other things that happen.
- **[02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u3k5CUmiXU&t=176s)** — Number one, the depletion of potassium.
- **[02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u3k5CUmiXU&t=178s)** — You start to become potassium deficient when you consume carbs.
- **[03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u3k5CUmiXU&t=183s)** — Probably what happens is when you store this excess sugar, it gets stored as something called glycogen,
- **[03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u3k5CUmiXU&t=189s)** — which is basically a series of glucose molecules strung together with the help of potassium.
- **[03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u3k5CUmiXU&t=195s)** — So you need potassium to store the sugar as glycogen in your liver and the muscles.
- **[03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u3k5CUmiXU&t=202s)** — And so the more sugar you eat, the more potassium gets kind of stored away and stuck in this storage system of glucose called glycogen.
- **[03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u3k5CUmiXU&t=211s)** — Two other things happen. You start to develop more sympathetic dominance.
- **[03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u3k5CUmiXU&t=216s)** — That means that your fight or flight mechanism is more activated, and that's the stress mechanism.
- **[03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u3k5CUmiXU&t=223s)** — Also, another thing is increased called renin. It's a hormone.
- **[03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u3k5CUmiXU&t=228s)** — In both of these things, the sympathetics and renin retains sodium as well.
- **[03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u3k5CUmiXU&t=234s)** — So we have a lot happening in relationship to the holding of fluid and the retention of sodium and the depletion of potassium.
- **[04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u3k5CUmiXU&t=242s)** — And of course, when you eat junk food, what's junk food?
- **[04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u3k5CUmiXU&t=245s)** — Sugar, starch, MSG, monosodium glutamate.
- **[04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u3k5CUmiXU&t=250s)** — Boy, the next day you'll probably notice your eyes are puffy. That is what we're talking about.
- **[04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u3k5CUmiXU&t=256s)** — If you want to know how to fix it, very simply, you want to get this sugar out of your diet.
- **[04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u3k5CUmiXU&t=261s)** — And you can also start taking potassium and or start eating foods high in potassium.
- **[04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u3k5CUmiXU&t=267s)** — If you want a really good video on exactly what to eat to help you with that, I put it up right here.
- **[04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u3k5CUmiXU&t=274s)** — Check it out.

- **[00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJ9xTMkGxXg&t=0s)** — How do you go back to sleep if for some reason you wake up between 2 to 3 a.m. in the middle of the night?
- **[00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJ9xTMkGxXg&t=8s)** — I would consider myself an expert at insomnia because I had this for over a decade and it was
- **[00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJ9xTMkGxXg&t=14s)** — destroying my life. It was not just getting up at 2 or 3 in the morning. Sometimes I wouldn't even
- **[00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJ9xTMkGxXg&t=19s)** — sleep for one minute the entire night. I would lay there. It was basically torture. What's
- **[00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJ9xTMkGxXg&t=29s)** — rhythm with cortisol? This is a stress hormone. Cortisol should be at the lowest point in this
- **[00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJ9xTMkGxXg&t=36s)** — rhythm at 2 a.m. and the highest point at 8 a.m. For me, everything was backwards. I was very, very
- **[00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJ9xTMkGxXg&t=42s)** — awake at 2, but I was extremely tired at 8 a.m. in the morning. I tried everything. I even tried
- **[00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJ9xTMkGxXg&t=48s)** — prescription medications. It didn't work. In fact, what I didn't know at the time was those
- **[00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJ9xTMkGxXg&t=53s)** — medications actually worsen your cortisol. They raise your cortisol. We can also look at things
- **[00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJ9xTMkGxXg&t=59s)** — that help you lower cortisol. One big one is magnesium. Magnesium has the ability to actually
- **[01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJ9xTMkGxXg&t=67s)** — lower cortisol. Your cortisol can actually go up if you're deficient in magnesium. Also,
- **[01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJ9xTMkGxXg&t=72s)** — if you're sitting there watching right now and you have any tightness in your muscle in your
- **[01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJ9xTMkGxXg&t=76s)** — upper back, lower back, or if you point your toe and it cramps, that's a sure sign that
- **[01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJ9xTMkGxXg&t=82s)** — you are deficient in magnesium. The type of magnesium that I would recommend to take is
- **[01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJ9xTMkGxXg&t=85s)** — called magnesium glycinate. It can actually help relax your muscles and help reduce cortisol.
- **[01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJ9xTMkGxXg&t=91s)** — When you want to take it is at night before you go to bed. Towards the later part of the
- **[01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJ9xTMkGxXg&t=95s)** — morning, right around 6 o'clock a.m., is when you have the least amount of magnesium in
- **[01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJ9xTMkGxXg&t=100s)** — your tissues. This is also probably why a lot of health problems occur in the early morning,
- **[01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJ9xTMkGxXg&t=106s)** — like heart attacks, stroke, restless leg syndrome, because a lot of these things are influenced
- **[01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJ9xTMkGxXg&t=112s)** — by magnesium. One last indication of magnesium deficiency is twitching. So if you're getting this
- **[01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJ9xTMkGxXg&t=118s)** — twitch underneath your eye or in your arm, that's a sure sign that you are deficient in
- **[02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJ9xTMkGxXg&t=122s)** — magnesium. Magnesium controls calcium and when you don't have enough magnesium, you get more
- **[02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJ9xTMkGxXg&t=127s)** — calcium and calcium just causes cramping in different areas of the body. The other thing
- **[02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJ9xTMkGxXg&t=132s)** — that can raise cortisol at 2 a.m. is a low blood sugar situation. Let's say your diet is
- **[02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJ9xTMkGxXg&t=140s)** — heavy in the carbohydrates and so you raise your blood sugar, go to sleep at night and the blood sugar
- **[02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJ9xTMkGxXg&t=146s)** — goes down. Guess what happens when your blood sugar goes too low? The body's going to raise it.
- **[02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJ9xTMkGxXg&t=151s)** — How does it raise it? With cortisol because of your diet. We've talked about magnesium
- **[02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJ9xTMkGxXg&t=156s)** — deficiency and by the way, when you eat a lot of carbohydrates and starches, that creates
- **[02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJ9xTMkGxXg&t=161s)** — the magnesium deficiency. But if you're just eating sugar in general, you're going to have
- **[02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJ9xTMkGxXg&t=166s)** — a blood sugar issue that's going to affect cortisol and wake you up in the middle of the night.
- **[02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJ9xTMkGxXg&t=170s)** — This is what you should do. If you're getting up at 2 a.m. you want to evaluate what you ate the day
- **[02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJ9xTMkGxXg&t=175s)** — before. Did you have fine starches? Do you go out to a restaurant? Did they give you something called
- **[03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJ9xTMkGxXg&t=180s)** — MSG which also can affect your blood sugar? Also alcohol. Alcohol will really make you feel
- **[03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJ9xTMkGxXg&t=187s)** — like you're sleeping but you're not really sleeping that well. You're probably going to wake
- **[03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJ9xTMkGxXg&t=191s)** — up at 2 or even 3. The snack at night, you're going to raise your blood sugar and it's
- **[03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJ9xTMkGxXg&t=200s)** — so important not to snack after 6 30. Let's say for example, you ate very very late at night
- **[03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJ9xTMkGxXg&t=207s)** — and you ate a lot of protein. Protein tends to stimulate the body and that can interrupt your
- **[03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJ9xTMkGxXg&t=213s)** — sleep. In fact, one thing that I find that really works for my sleep is if I have my last
- **[03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJ9xTMkGxXg&t=219s)** — meal later in the afternoon and then I don't eat after that. Boy, do I sleep a lot better
- **[03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJ9xTMkGxXg&t=224s)** — if I don't eat too late at night. Another thing with salt cravings. Let's say for example,
- **[03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJ9xTMkGxXg&t=230s)** — you crave salty chips at night. The reason why people crave salt is because they're usually
- **[03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJ9xTMkGxXg&t=236s)** — deficient in sodium. Sodium helps lower cortisol. When you're deficient in sodium
- **[04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJ9xTMkGxXg&t=242s)** — or you're not having enough salt, your cortisol will go up. Add more sea salt to the
- **[04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJ9xTMkGxXg&t=248s)** — meal through the day. Do that to the point where you crave no salt at night. Another thing
- **[04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJ9xTMkGxXg&t=253s)** — will increase cortisol is watching a suspense or action movie before you go to sleep. This is
- **[04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJ9xTMkGxXg&t=260s)** — why I watch boring movies or something that's really light because if I watch an exciting movie,
- **[04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJ9xTMkGxXg&t=266s)** — I'm not going to sleep at night. It's also important not to have the blue light from
- **[04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJ9xTMkGxXg&t=271s)** — this thing or your computer before going to sleep because the blue light interferes with
- **[04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJ9xTMkGxXg&t=276s)** — melatonin that helps you wind down and go to sleep. Another thing that can increase melatonin
- **[04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJ9xTMkGxXg&t=282s)** — at night is getting enough sun exposure. Getting more sun during the day does definitely help you
- **[04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJ9xTMkGxXg&t=289s)** — sleep at night. Over 50% of the sun as well as the light from a fire or even candles can give
- **[04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJ9xTMkGxXg&t=296s)** — you infrared. That infrared will increase melatonin in the cells. If you're deficient in B1,
- **[05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJ9xTMkGxXg&t=303s)** — you're going to have a lot of energy in your body because you have more of an energy
- **[05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJ9xTMkGxXg&t=306s)** — capacity problem that you have to do something to get that energy out of your body. So if
- **[05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJ9xTMkGxXg&t=310s)** — you don't exercise, you're going to have a harder time going to sleep. So I highly recommend you
- **[05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJ9xTMkGxXg&t=314s)** — go for long walks, do some workout that will get you tired. But I have to work out to get
- **[05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJ9xTMkGxXg&t=320s)** — the energy out of my body. Another thing that can affect your sleep at 2 or 3 am is something
- **[05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJ9xTMkGxXg&t=326s)** — going on with your liver. The liver is the organ that detoxifies between one and three in
- **[05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJ9xTMkGxXg&t=333s)** — the middle of the night. If there's anything that's related to that, let's say alcohol,
- **[05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJ9xTMkGxXg&t=338s)** — you're trying to get rid of alcohol or you're taking medications that your liver is trying
- **[05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJ9xTMkGxXg&t=342s)** — to get rid of something that can throw off your sleep. Take milk thistle before you go to
- **[05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJ9xTMkGxXg&t=347s)** — bed. That's really good for the liver. Another thing that happened with me is restless leg
- **[05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJ9xTMkGxXg&t=352s)** — syndrome. That is a classic B1 deficiency or it's a magnesium deficiency. Probably because
- **[05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJ9xTMkGxXg&t=359s)** — you're consuming too many carbs. I was. If you can just fix that, you won't have restless
- **[06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJ9xTMkGxXg&t=364s)** — legs anymore. It's a real easy thing to fix. Just start consuming natural B1 and magnesium
- **[06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJ9xTMkGxXg&t=369s)** — before bed. Check your pulse rate because if your pulse rate is too high, that could be
- **[06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJ9xTMkGxXg&t=374s)** — a potassium deficiency. I remember one time I was trying to sleep and I noticed like I felt
- **[06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJ9xTMkGxXg&t=379s)** — this pounding and I checked my pulse rate. I'm like, oh my gosh, my pulse rate is like boom,
- **[06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJ9xTMkGxXg&t=383s)** — boom, boom, boom, boom. There's two things that cause a high pulse rate. It's low
- **[06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJ9xTMkGxXg&t=387s)** — potassium, usually because you're eating too many carbs or your pH is too acidic. In the
- **[06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJ9xTMkGxXg&t=393s)** — case of me, I would take kombucha tea or I would do apple cider vinegar right before bed
- **[06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJ9xTMkGxXg&t=398s)** — and I would take it too concentrated and that acidified myself. That was a problem that I ran
- **[06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJ9xTMkGxXg&t=404s)** — into. For some people, drinking apple cider vinegar more diluted can help them, but also
- **[06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJ9xTMkGxXg&t=409s)** — the apple cider vinegar really helps stabilize the blood sugars to the whole night. If you
- **[06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJ9xTMkGxXg&t=413s)** — suspect blood sugar problems, apple cider vinegar is great before you go to bed and
- **[06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJ9xTMkGxXg&t=418s)** — it'll also help you increase the absorption of certain minerals. And if that doesn't work and
- **[07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJ9xTMkGxXg&t=422s)** — you're laying there for a longer period of time, I would pull out a book. Nothing too exciting.
- **[07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJ9xTMkGxXg&t=427s)** — We just start reading a book until you get tired and fall asleep. The next day, what I
- **[07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJ9xTMkGxXg&t=432s)** — would do is I would go for a really long walk, not to raise the pulse rate, but just to
- **[07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJ9xTMkGxXg&t=438s)** — kind of like have this a lot of oxygen. So you can kind of just drain out this cortisol
- **[07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJ9xTMkGxXg&t=443s)** — and adrenaline that has built up. Go ahead and try these things and then comment down below
- **[07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJ9xTMkGxXg&t=449s)** — how they've helped you.

- **[00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XspP7Cbw4fA&t=0s)** — Now I've been very curious about why I feel so much better when I drink carbonated water
- **[00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XspP7Cbw4fA&t=7s)** — versus regular water. And I didn't know the answer until very recently. So I'm going to share this
- **[00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XspP7Cbw4fA&t=11s)** — with you as well as some other fascinating things related to CO2, carbon dioxide. So whether
- **[00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XspP7Cbw4fA&t=18s)** — you're drinking soda water, club water, seltzer water, La Croix, or any type of carbonated water,
- **[00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XspP7Cbw4fA&t=24s)** — this relates to CO2 because the way they carbonate it is by adding this gas CO2 into the water,
- **[00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XspP7Cbw4fA&t=31s)** — which does make it slightly acidic because it turns into carbonic acid. Unless it's stored
- **[00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XspP7Cbw4fA&t=37s)** — a little bit differently as these bicarbonates in water. But regardless of that, when I drink
- **[00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XspP7Cbw4fA&t=42s)** — carbonated water I just feel more hydrated, my digestion is better, and I just feel better. I
- **[00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XspP7Cbw4fA&t=49s)** — feel more relaxed when I drink carbonated water. So if you happen to see some other videos
- **[00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XspP7Cbw4fA&t=53s)** — related to carbon dioxide, I mentioned this one effect called the Bohr effect. B-O-H-R.
- **[01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XspP7Cbw4fA&t=61s)** — That is a condition that relates to CO2. In other words, for oxygen to be absorbed into
- **[01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XspP7Cbw4fA&t=66s)** — your cells, into the tissues, it takes CO2, which is very counterintuitive. You would think,
- **[01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XspP7Cbw4fA&t=73s)** — logically, if you got more air, less CO2, you would have more oxygen. But that's not true.
- **[01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XspP7Cbw4fA&t=79s)** — It takes that CO2 to slightly adjust the pH and drop it a little bit and make it slightly more
- **[01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XspP7Cbw4fA&t=86s)** — acidic to allow the oxygen to be released. This is why if you hyperventilate in a panic
- **[01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XspP7Cbw4fA&t=91s)** — attack, you're getting too much O2 and not enough CO2 and you can't breathe, right? And
- **[01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XspP7Cbw4fA&t=97s)** — then you start breathing in a paper bag and you get more CO2 and now you can breathe.
- **[01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XspP7Cbw4fA&t=101s)** — In fact, you can actually create a hypoxic state that is a state of lowered oxygen
- **[01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XspP7Cbw4fA&t=107s)** — by depriving the tissues of CO2, which is very interesting. Because normally you would think
- **[01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XspP7Cbw4fA&t=113s)** — hypoxia, low oxygen, means too much CO2, which can occur, but you can also create that
- **[02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XspP7Cbw4fA&t=120s)** — same situation with not enough CO2. So CO2 is really essential in the homeostasis of
- **[02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XspP7Cbw4fA&t=127s)** — oxygen absorption. Now in Europe, they actually have these sauna baths that are carbonated.
- **[02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XspP7Cbw4fA&t=136s)** — They call them carbonated spas or baths where they pump the CO2 into this water. And apparently
- **[02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XspP7Cbw4fA&t=142s)** — it's great for all sorts of circulatory problems, like problems with your vascular system,
- **[02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XspP7Cbw4fA&t=148s)** — especially something called peripheral vascular disorders. They even use it for diabetic
- **[02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XspP7Cbw4fA&t=152s)** — wounds and to decrease the rate of getting an amputation where they cut off the feet. I mean,
- **[02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XspP7Cbw4fA&t=158s)** — it can actually improve that by increasing microvascular circulation. Basically CO2 increases
- **[02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XspP7Cbw4fA&t=163s)** — blood flow. It's even used as the therapy after someone gets a stroke and they have this hypoxic
- **[02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XspP7Cbw4fA&t=170s)** — low oxygen state because the CO2 helps that oxygen go deep into the cells. Now I could not
- **[02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XspP7Cbw4fA&t=178s)** — find any research on drinking carbonated water, okay, in that relating to an improved health,
- **[03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XspP7Cbw4fA&t=186s)** — but I have found parallel research on all the things I'm talking about and I'll include
- **[03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XspP7Cbw4fA&t=190s)** — In one study I found there was a significant increase in the parasympathetic nervous system
- **[03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XspP7Cbw4fA&t=196s)** — activation by increasing CO2. That's the system that counters the flight or fight mode.
- **[03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XspP7Cbw4fA&t=202s)** — It's the system that helps your healing and your digestion and your ability to sleep. And
- **[03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XspP7Cbw4fA&t=206s)** — the device they use to measure the parasympathetic is what I used in my practice, which is
- **[03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XspP7Cbw4fA&t=211s)** — technology called heart rate variability. Let's take a look at some other things that I found
- **[03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XspP7Cbw4fA&t=215s)** — related to this. If you take a normal cell inside and then you take a cancer cell and we look at
- **[03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XspP7Cbw4fA&t=222s)** — the pH of each one, the cancer cell actually is more alkaline. Now the outside of the cell,
- **[03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XspP7Cbw4fA&t=229s)** — more acidic because of all the byproducts from lactic acid, things like that, but the
- **[03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XspP7Cbw4fA&t=233s)** — inside of the cell is more alkaline than a normal cell, which is very interesting, especially
- **[03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XspP7Cbw4fA&t=237s)** — as it relates to CO2. And I couldn't find any information on this, but think about this.
- **[04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XspP7Cbw4fA&t=242s)** — When you deprive the tissue of CO2, you actually can develop alkalosis. That is a state of being
- **[04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XspP7Cbw4fA&t=248s)** — too alkaline. So without that CO2 turning into carbonic acid, you can develop an overly
- **[04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XspP7Cbw4fA&t=254s)** — alkaline state. And then I wanted to figure out, is there any relationship or any significant
- **[04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XspP7Cbw4fA&t=260s)** — improvement in shrinking tumors or stopping the spread of cancer by increasing CO2? And I
- **[04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XspP7Cbw4fA&t=267s)** — found a bunch of research, which is also very interesting, which I'll include down below.
- **[04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XspP7Cbw4fA&t=271s)** — So apparently CO2 is a significant potent anti-tumor gas. It has the ability to
- **[04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XspP7Cbw4fA&t=282s)** — inhibit metastasis, which is interesting, as well as inducing apoptosis, which causes the
- **[04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XspP7Cbw4fA&t=288s)** — cancer cells to commit suicide. It also inhibits this very interesting gene that's involved
- **[04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XspP7Cbw4fA&t=295s)** — in this switching mechanism between a normal cell and it turning into cancer. That gene is
- **[05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XspP7Cbw4fA&t=302s)** — HIF-alpha, which is involved in hypoxia. Now this probably doesn't make sense unless you
- **[05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XspP7Cbw4fA&t=307s)** — understand that CO2 allows oxygen to go into the tissues. And as bad as hypoxia is,
- **[05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XspP7Cbw4fA&t=314s)** — it can be created by a lowered amount of CO2, as well as lowered oxygen levels. But also,
- **[05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XspP7Cbw4fA&t=320s)** — there's this CO2 connection that is very interesting. I had this thing in my mind where
- **[05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XspP7Cbw4fA&t=325s)** — if we just flood the body with oxygen, right, we'll be able to kill the cancer and
- **[05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XspP7Cbw4fA&t=329s)** — prevent cancer. But apparently, the CO2 is another key factor that we cannot ignore.
- **[05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XspP7Cbw4fA&t=335s)** — Like even in a thunderstorm, you can probably breathe better. And if you ever wanted to know
- **[05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XspP7Cbw4fA&t=341s)** — why, well apparently there's a lot more CO2 in the air after a thunderstorm than there is
- **[05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XspP7Cbw4fA&t=349s)** — when there's not a thunderstorm going on. Also, you'll actually get more oxygen into
- **[05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XspP7Cbw4fA&t=353s)** — your tissues if you breathe through your nose, not your mouth when you're sleeping,
- **[05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XspP7Cbw4fA&t=358s)** — as well as when you exercise. There's another interesting natural bath, like the springs.
- **[06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XspP7Cbw4fA&t=365s)** — If you go to the hot springs. And at first we might think there's a lot of minerals involved
- **[06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XspP7Cbw4fA&t=369s)** — that are helping us. But guess what? There's a significant amount of CO2 in hot springs,
- **[06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XspP7Cbw4fA&t=375s)** — which could be the reason why you feel better and you're more relaxed. Now,
- **[06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XspP7Cbw4fA&t=380s)** — they're even using CO2 in various creams for hydration to your skin and better
- **[06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XspP7Cbw4fA&t=386s)** — circulation and blood flow, which is another interesting piece of this puzzle.
- **[06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XspP7Cbw4fA&t=391s)** — And the last point about the CO2 is that CO2 apparently is a potent anti-inflammatory.
- **[06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XspP7Cbw4fA&t=398s)** — So I just wanted to increase your awareness on the CO2, this carbon dioxide thing,
- **[06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XspP7Cbw4fA&t=403s)** — as well as carbonated water. And this could be the reason, which I think it is,
- **[06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XspP7Cbw4fA&t=407s)** — of why you may feel better if you consume more carbonated water. And what I have is I have a
- **[06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XspP7Cbw4fA&t=416s)** — water carbonated. So I take my spring water and I carbonate it and that's what I drink.
- **[07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XspP7Cbw4fA&t=422s)** — But since we're on the topic of water, you haven't seen this video. I think you should
- **[07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XspP7Cbw4fA&t=426s)** — watch it. There's definitely more information to be known about water. And I put it up right here.

- **[00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Mo1F8ce1yY&t=0s)** — You may never eat bread again after watching this video.
- **[00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Mo1F8ce1yY&t=3s)** — I'm talking about certain types of bread. There's actually two types of bread. The good
- **[00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Mo1F8ce1yY&t=6s)** — and the bad.
- **[00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Mo1F8ce1yY&t=8s)** — A lot of people have a confusion on which is which. Now, you can eat certain types of bread
- **[00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Mo1F8ce1yY&t=12s)** — and I'm going to show you which ones I'm going to recommend. But humans have been
- **[00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Mo1F8ce1yY&t=15s)** — consuming bread for a very long time. I mean, it's recommended in the Bible. Many
- **[00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Mo1F8ce1yY&t=20s)** — health organizations recommend eating bread. Even the food pyramid recommends that you
- **[00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Mo1F8ce1yY&t=23s)** — should eat bread. But all bread is not created equal. There's a huge difference between
- **[00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Mo1F8ce1yY&t=28s)** — this bread and this over here. Of course, this entire topic revolves around this idea of
- **[00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Mo1F8ce1yY&t=35s)** — whole grains being healthy. So of course, they put it in cereals and they call it
- **[00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Mo1F8ce1yY&t=39s)** — heart healthy. This is the cereal that I consumed growing up as a child. Here's
- **[00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Mo1F8ce1yY&t=43s)** — another one. But what are the other ingredients they're putting in it? I mean, right here,
- **[00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Mo1F8ce1yY&t=46s)** — it says contains bioengineered food ingredients. That's another word for GMOs. Well,
- **[00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Mo1F8ce1yY&t=52s)** — apparently even instant oatmeal is heart healthy because it has the whole grains.
- **[00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Mo1F8ce1yY&t=57s)** — Of course, they kind of downplay the massive amounts of sugar and additional ingredients.
- **[01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Mo1F8ce1yY&t=62s)** — Here's more instant oatmeal. And then they have the 100% whole grain certification right
- **[01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Mo1F8ce1yY&t=69s)** — here. They recommend to eat at least three ounces or equivalents three servings size of
- **[01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Mo1F8ce1yY&t=73s)** — whole grains every single day for fiber. By the way, there's not a lot of fiber
- **[01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Mo1F8ce1yY&t=77s)** — in whole grains compared to vegetables. And of course, we even have snacks for babies
- **[01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Mo1F8ce1yY&t=82s)** — here. Grain and grow. Here we go. Whole grain goodness, of course, with added sugar and
- **[01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Mo1F8ce1yY&t=89s)** — starches. Okay, really simply, we have the bad bread and the good bread. You're never going
- **[01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Mo1F8ce1yY&t=94s)** — to get people off bread. There's things that you can buy that are healthier. And I'm about
- **[01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Mo1F8ce1yY&t=98s)** — to tell you why you don't want to eat this version right here, because this is going to
- **[01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Mo1F8ce1yY&t=101s)** — create a lot of inflammation in your gut. It's going to create weight gain. It's going
- **[01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Mo1F8ce1yY&t=105s)** — to create blood sugar issues. But the reason people love bread so much is really wrapped
- **[01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Mo1F8ce1yY&t=110s)** — around this one protein called gluten. Now what's so special about gluten? First of all,
- **[01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Mo1F8ce1yY&t=116s)** — it's the only protein that humans can't digest. Yet we eat a lot of it. But what's unique about
- **[02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Mo1F8ce1yY&t=122s)** — this protein in grains is that it has a certain mouthfeel. So a lot of people are
- **[02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Mo1F8ce1yY&t=128s)** — addicted to bread because of that pleasure feeling that they get. Opioids get rid of pain.
- **[02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Mo1F8ce1yY&t=133s)** — They actually get rid of stress. But the problem is, once you start stimulating those
- **[02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Mo1F8ce1yY&t=138s)** — receptors in the brain, you start becoming more addicted. American bread especially has...
- **[02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Mo1F8ce1yY&t=142s)** — in the last 50 years, we've been increasing the amount of gluten in bread. And so now,
- **[02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Mo1F8ce1yY&t=148s)** — if we compare now to back 50 years ago, we have five times as much gluten. So what's
- **[02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Mo1F8ce1yY&t=152s)** — the problem with gluten? It creates inflammation in your gut. It creates diseases like what's
- **[02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Mo1F8ce1yY&t=157s)** — called Celiac, which destroys the inside of your gut. A lot of people have allergies to
- **[02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Mo1F8ce1yY&t=161s)** — this as well. In fact, certain autoimmune diseases, especially Hashimoto's, can be
- **[02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Mo1F8ce1yY&t=165s)** — triggered by this whole gluten interaction with the gut. And then it goes across the
- **[02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Mo1F8ce1yY&t=170s)** — immune barrier and then your body starts to misidentify these proteins as being foreign.
- **[02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Mo1F8ce1yY&t=176s)** — And then now you have these antibodies against it. And sometimes they can cross over into
- **[03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Mo1F8ce1yY&t=181s)** — our own tissues. And now we start having antibodies against our own tissues. Autoimmune
- **[03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Mo1F8ce1yY&t=185s)** — diseases are the number one type of disease that actually surpassed heart disease and
- **[03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Mo1F8ce1yY&t=191s)** — And out of all the autoimmune diseases, we have Hashimoto's is at the top of the list. And that
- **[03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Mo1F8ce1yY&t=197s)** — is the thyroid autoimmune disease. And so what's the alternative? I like several types of
- **[03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Mo1F8ce1yY&t=204s)** — alternatives. Now, what is einkorn flour? Well, that's an ancient grain that hasn't been
- **[03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Mo1F8ce1yY&t=207s)** — altered, right? In a long, long time. So we've made this bread last night with einkorn
- **[03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Mo1F8ce1yY&t=213s)** — flour. The einkorn gluten is less elastic. It's good for flat breads. It doesn't necessarily
- **[03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Mo1F8ce1yY&t=220s)** — create as much of these sensations as well, but it's pretty darn close. But on the flip side,
- **[03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Mo1F8ce1yY&t=226s)** — very few people have gut reactions to this. And the type of starch that's in this bread
- **[03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Mo1F8ce1yY&t=232s)** — creates a less of a spike versus regular American bread. You have a different starch that will
- **[03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Mo1F8ce1yY&t=237s)** — just really create this high spike in your blood sugars. The actual genetics of this grain,
- **[04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Mo1F8ce1yY&t=243s)** — even though it's like it's a wheat flour, is very different than the genetics that they're
- **[04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Mo1F8ce1yY&t=249s)** — using right here. So it's very, very different. And then we have this other thing called the
- **[04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Mo1F8ce1yY&t=254s)** — phytic acid. Phytic acid binds with minerals. It connects with minerals, especially zinc,
- **[04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Mo1F8ce1yY&t=263s)** — iron, magnesium, manganese, calcium, and copper. So when you consume foods high in phytic acid,
- **[04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Mo1F8ce1yY&t=271s)** — it locks up these minerals and it goes through the small intestine. Phytic acid cannot be
- **[04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Mo1F8ce1yY&t=277s)** — absorbed in the small intestine. So guess what? Those minerals are stuck to it. And now these
- **[04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Mo1F8ce1yY&t=282s)** — minerals are going to be lost through the digestion. So when you consume foods high in
- **[04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Mo1F8ce1yY&t=287s)** — phytic acid, it actually depletes you of certain minerals. Now, is this going to really
- **[04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Mo1F8ce1yY&t=292s)** — be a problem with nutritional levels? Maybe not. It depends how much you consume bread.
- **[04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Mo1F8ce1yY&t=297s)** — Certain cultures who eat a lot of grains, a lot of bread, have zinc deficiencies,
- **[05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Mo1F8ce1yY&t=302s)** — iron deficiencies because of this phytic acid. Now, how do you get rid of phytic acid? Well,
- **[05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Mo1F8ce1yY&t=307s)** — you can refine it. You can just use regular flour. So in this wonderful bread right here,
- **[05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Mo1F8ce1yY&t=313s)** — it doesn't have much phytic acid, but of course it has a lot of other things. But you can also
- **[05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Mo1F8ce1yY&t=318s)** — ferment it, okay, like sourdough bread, or even sprout it. And by the way, this bread
- **[05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Mo1F8ce1yY&t=324s)** — is fermented. But sprouted bread, as in Ezekiel bread, has low amounts of phytic acid. The
- **[05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Mo1F8ce1yY&t=338s)** — Also, I do notice when you consume bread in Europe, especially France or even Italy,
- **[05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Mo1F8ce1yY&t=344s)** — and you buy bread from a bakery, it's a whole different experience. And that's simply because
- **[05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Mo1F8ce1yY&t=348s)** — of the quality and they ferment the bread longer and they have different types of wheat
- **[05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Mo1F8ce1yY&t=353s)** — that's not so high in gluten. I mean, think about this. France is a lot smaller than the U.S.
- **[05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Mo1F8ce1yY&t=359s)** — yet they have 30,000 bakeries and the U.S. has 3,000. So you don't normally find bread
- **[06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Mo1F8ce1yY&t=366s)** — in a bakery in the U.S. You go to the grocery store and it's been sitting on the shelf for
- **[06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Mo1F8ce1yY&t=371s)** — quite some time and that's the type of bread that people consume. And I guess I should probably
- **[06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Mo1F8ce1yY&t=375s)** — just quickly mention some of the dough conditioners are banned in Europe, but they're
- **[06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Mo1F8ce1yY&t=380s)** — allowed in America. So BVO or ADA, which is a whitener or potassium bromate, these chemicals
- **[06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Mo1F8ce1yY&t=386s)** — are banned in Europe, but we allow them, of course, in our wonderful bread. I'll put a few of
- **[06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Mo1F8ce1yY&t=391s)** — those recipes down below and I think you're going to like them. But we're always experimenting
- **[06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Mo1F8ce1yY&t=395s)** — with different flours. We've got almond flour, coconut flour, and of course, einkorn flour as well.
- **[06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Mo1F8ce1yY&t=399s)** — A few more points that you need to know about with American bread. The way they dry the wheat
- **[06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Mo1F8ce1yY&t=403s)** — out in America is they use glyphosate. That's the stuff in Roundup, okay? They spray it to
- **[06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Mo1F8ce1yY&t=410s)** — dry out the wheat. Now other things that are exposed to glyphosate, if it's genetically
- **[06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Mo1F8ce1yY&t=414s)** — modified, but wheat typically is not genetically modified, but the point is that it has glyphosate.
- **[07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Mo1F8ce1yY&t=420s)** — You don't want to have your body exposed to this. Sometimes they use bleach. And when you heat
- **[07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Mo1F8ce1yY&t=426s)** — or you toast this and you kind of burn it and you eat it, you get a nice dose of what's called
- **[07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Mo1F8ce1yY&t=433s)** — acrylamide. Acrylamide is known to cause cancer. So that's just one more negative on this
- **[07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Mo1F8ce1yY&t=438s)** — this list right here. Now I hope I convinced you to avoid certain types of bread, okay?
- **[07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Mo1F8ce1yY&t=443s)** — And if you're still not convinced, you might want to watch this video right here
- **[07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Mo1F8ce1yY&t=446s)** — and also click down below with some of these recipes that I just talked about, including this
- **[07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Mo1F8ce1yY&t=453s)** — one right here. I think you'll really enjoy it. You can cut this up, put it in the toaster.
- **[07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Mo1F8ce1yY&t=456s)** — I think you'll be pleasantly surprised at how delicious it is.
