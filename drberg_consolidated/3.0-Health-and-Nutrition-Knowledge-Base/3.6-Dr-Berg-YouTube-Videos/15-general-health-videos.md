- **[00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZDTEWbsZd8&t=0s)** — Wow. I wanted to create this follow-up video on the past video with the situation in North Carolina.
- **[00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZDTEWbsZd8&t=7s)** — I wanted to basically show people where the donations went. This is going to blow you away.
- **[00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZDTEWbsZd8&t=15s)** — This is incredible. We were able to raise almost $800,000. And I want to talk to Bill on exactly
- **[00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZDTEWbsZd8&t=23s)** — where this went. And I'm just blown away. So go ahead over to you, Bill.
- **[00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZDTEWbsZd8&t=27s)** — We started the launch about a month ago, raising the money on my GoFundMe to build two homes for
- **[00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZDTEWbsZd8&t=33s)** — people. And then I really started seeing the need for these campers. The different organizations
- **[00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZDTEWbsZd8&t=38s)** — I've been working with down here, the nonprofits, were just telling me they need campers, campers,
- **[00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZDTEWbsZd8&t=43s)** — campers. I decided to start maybe buying a couple campers. The money kept coming in,
- **[00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZDTEWbsZd8&t=47s)** — so the campers kept coming in. I've been down here now. This is my third trip. We left
- **[00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZDTEWbsZd8&t=52s)** — Virginia last Friday with a convoy of 25 campers. Every single one of those campers is now already
- **[00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZDTEWbsZd8&t=58s)** — set up. So that's 25 people that have a roof over their heads. They have a shower. They have
- **[01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZDTEWbsZd8&t=63s)** — a small kitchen and beds to sleep in. All the money I've been raising has gone basically right
- **[01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZDTEWbsZd8&t=68s)** — now to campers. I'm still saving enough money to build the homes, but I feel like I haven't even
- **[01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZDTEWbsZd8&t=73s)** — put a dent in it. Yet I have put 25 people in a camper. So that's making me feel good.
- **[01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZDTEWbsZd8&t=77s)** — The organizations I'm working with, they definitely need more campers. I mean,
- **[01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZDTEWbsZd8&t=82s)** — I brought this one down this morning. I got a call that these people didn't have a camper.
- **[01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZDTEWbsZd8&t=85s)** — They lost their home completely. FEMA's just dragging butt. They're not helping them with
- **[01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZDTEWbsZd8&t=93s)** — this. You know, they've given them $750 and they're saying that their house... I'm not even
- **[01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZDTEWbsZd8&t=100s)** — sure what they tell these people anymore, but nobody's getting any money. If it wasn't for
- **[01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZDTEWbsZd8&t=105s)** — money that these nonprofits down here are trying to gain and the money that I've been
- **[01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZDTEWbsZd8&t=109s)** — raising, I don't know what these people are going to do. I really don't. I tell you,
- **[01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZDTEWbsZd8&t=115s)** — you come down here and you talk to these families, I don't understand what's happening.
- **[01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZDTEWbsZd8&t=119s)** — It's really starting to piss me off a little bit. It's insane. Insane. Yeah, I know there's
- **[02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZDTEWbsZd8&t=125s)** — more people that need help and we're going to continue to do the GoFundMe and also have
- **[02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZDTEWbsZd8&t=130s)** — another link that is more of a tax free because you found another foundation that we could even
- **[02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZDTEWbsZd8&t=136s)** — do tax free donations, right? Yeah, so I'm working through Rise Disaster Relief and
- **[02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZDTEWbsZd8&t=140s)** — Recovery. They're based out of Spruce Pine, North Carolina. I'm going to be running a lot
- **[02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZDTEWbsZd8&t=145s)** — of this stuff through them so that we can get the people with the bigger donations,
- **[02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZDTEWbsZd8&t=150s)** — can get tax credits. You can still use the GoFundMe. It's quick and easy, but we've got
- **[02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZDTEWbsZd8&t=155s)** — the other ones set up through our PayPal. So I'll put those links down below. But what I
- **[02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZDTEWbsZd8&t=160s)** — really want to show people is the reaction of what the money and also the help through the
- **[02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZDTEWbsZd8&t=168s)** — campers have and the reaction from people. So we're going to roll right into that. I want to
- **[02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZDTEWbsZd8&t=172s)** — just say thank you for donating. We appreciate it so much. This is helping so many people.
- **[02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZDTEWbsZd8&t=177s)** — You're going to see that. Let's roll right into it now.
- **[03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZDTEWbsZd8&t=187s)** — I've been selling my soul, working all day, over time hours, for bullshit pay,
- **[03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZDTEWbsZd8&t=194s)** — so I can sit out here and waste my life away. Drag back home and drown my troubles away.
- **[03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZDTEWbsZd8&t=201s)** — It's a damn shame what the world's gotten to. People like me, people like you,
- **[03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZDTEWbsZd8&t=209s)** — wish I could just wake up and it not be true. But it is, all it is.
- **[03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZDTEWbsZd8&t=216s)** — I'm here with Pedro and Halle Jandra and they just got their new camper. I brought it down from
- **[03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZDTEWbsZd8&t=221s)** — Virginia. You've got two children here. You definitely need a place to stay.
- **[03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZDTEWbsZd8&t=226s)** — Yeah, this will definitely help out. This is your camper and I'm going to sign the
- **[03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZDTEWbsZd8&t=230s)** — title over to you. So whatever you want to sell it, it's your money.
- **[03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZDTEWbsZd8&t=236s)** — Is that going to do you? It's going to do me. And here's a little Christmas money.
- **[04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZDTEWbsZd8&t=241s)** — Okay, good. For your service, I want to give you a check of $5,000 to get you on your feet.
- **[04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZDTEWbsZd8&t=247s)** — I appreciate it, okay? Yes, you bet. Thank you. Enjoy it. All yours. Tracy, guys, I thank
- **[04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZDTEWbsZd8&t=254s)** — you all so much for bringing this camper in for us, giving my mom and me a safe environment.
- **[04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZDTEWbsZd8&t=260s)** — May God bless you. May God bless everyone else. Stay warm out there. We love you guys.
- **[04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZDTEWbsZd8&t=265s)** — It's December 20th. I'm in Sprucebine, North Carolina. And this is the kind of stuff
- **[04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZDTEWbsZd8&t=270s)** — is still everywhere. The devastation here, you know, everywhere you look in some of these places,
- **[04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZDTEWbsZd8&t=275s)** — you know, you can drive down the main road and everything sort of looks fine. But you pull down
- **[04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZDTEWbsZd8&t=280s)** — on these side roads. This house was destroyed by wind. The insurance company is trying to
- **[04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZDTEWbsZd8&t=284s)** — give them like $39,000. That's what they think is going to fix this house. It is crazy. I'm
- **[04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZDTEWbsZd8&t=289s)** — going down into Swannanoa right now and it's just going to get worse. So help us out.
- **[04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZDTEWbsZd8&t=293s)** — You know, it's just amazing to see the spirit of people tested but not broken by this
- **[04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZDTEWbsZd8&t=298s)** — devastating disaster. We should continue to fund this effort and donating what we can
- **[05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZDTEWbsZd8&t=302s)** — to get these families back on their feet. And I really want to thank everyone for their
- **[05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZDTEWbsZd8&t=306s)** — donations to the new life. We're hoping to give these families after such dark times
- **[05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZDTEWbsZd8&t=311s)** — during the holiday season. I want to wish you a Merry Christmas, Happy Holiday, and a Happy New Year.
