- **[00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-pQNxUlAOI&t=0s)** — I'm going to do a makeover of my studio and I'm going to show you behind the scenes of everything.
- **[00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-pQNxUlAOI&t=9s)** — I'm hesitating showing you what this looks like. So just don't laugh, okay?
- **[00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-pQNxUlAOI&t=13s)** — All right, this is my makeshift crappy setup right here, which is totally embarrassing.
- **[00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-pQNxUlAOI&t=20s)** — I know. But, you know, I had a studio in my other house, but we moved to this farm and I
- **[00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-pQNxUlAOI&t=27s)** — never got around to it. So I have this makeshift... this is my studio. This is where I do most of the
- **[00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-pQNxUlAOI&t=33s)** — film and I have this digital... oh yeah, this is... you probably thought this was real, right?
- **[00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-pQNxUlAOI&t=39s)** — And I'm still trying to figure out... this is bad. Come on, let's go. Okay, voila. And so
- **[00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-pQNxUlAOI&t=47s)** — I'll come in here and I'll turn on my lights. Okay, my camera. But look at this paint can.
- **[00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-pQNxUlAOI&t=56s)** — This is ridiculous. Ridiculous. I need an upgrade. And so I'm going to call Bill and see if he can
- **[01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-pQNxUlAOI&t=62s)** — actually do a little upgrade. I don't really need anything too fancy. I just need a wooden table
- **[01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-pQNxUlAOI&t=66s)** — because these blocks need to go. Let's just get him on the line and see what he says.
- **[01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-pQNxUlAOI&t=70s)** — Hey Bill. Hey Dr. Byrne. I have a little situation. Okay. Don't laugh. This is what I have as a desk.
- **[01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-pQNxUlAOI&t=76s)** — Of the cylinder block? Yeah. And I got things propped up a little bit as a makeshift.
- **[01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-pQNxUlAOI&t=82s)** — Never really got around to it. I'm assuming you need a new desk.
- **[01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-pQNxUlAOI&t=86s)** — Just need something other than this plastic card table. Yeah, give me the dimensions.
- **[01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-pQNxUlAOI&t=90s)** — We'll take care of it. We'll talk soon. Okay, cool. Anything is an upgrade.
- **[01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-pQNxUlAOI&t=95s)** — Shoot this in the dumpster.
- **[01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-pQNxUlAOI&t=106s)** — So we have the big reveal today. Today we're going to show you
- **[01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-pQNxUlAOI&t=110s)** — the new studio. We've been working on this all week. I'm really excited. I hope you will
- **[01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-pQNxUlAOI&t=115s)** — Typically my routine, I get up between four and four thirty in the morning and start doing research
- **[02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-pQNxUlAOI&t=121s)** — and then eventually shoot a video right around 12. Sometimes one, two, three, even four o'clock
- **[02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-pQNxUlAOI&t=127s)** — in the afternoon. Now they don't have a big team of people doing research. I do all of it.
- **[02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-pQNxUlAOI&t=131s)** — It's a lot of work, but you need a good studio. And so now I have it right here.
- **[02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-pQNxUlAOI&t=136s)** — Thanks to Bill. Check this out. This is a tree that fell in my pond. Yeah, so we actually
- **[02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-pQNxUlAOI&t=154s)** — took it. We milled it on the sawmill and then we kiln dried it and then we processed it,
- **[02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-pQNxUlAOI&t=159s)** — which means we edged it. We planed it. We sanded it and then we put a coat of lacquer on.
- **[02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-pQNxUlAOI&t=163s)** — It'll darken as time goes on, but it's just a different contrast. It's really,
- **[02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-pQNxUlAOI&t=168s)** — really pretty stuff. I love cherry. It's my favorite wood. It's gorgeous. So now
- **[02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-pQNxUlAOI&t=173s)** — this is the ultimate desk. I am so excited about doing videos now in a slightly better
- **[02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-pQNxUlAOI&t=179s)** — studio than I had before, which I'm embarrassed to even show you. So we have this couple of
- **[03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-pQNxUlAOI&t=184s)** — lights right here. And also we have this. Check this out. It's like looking down at Google Earth
- **[03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-pQNxUlAOI&t=192s)** — to the Grand Canyon, but we're not at the Grand Canyon. We're on my table.
- **[03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-pQNxUlAOI&t=196s)** — So now I have this whiteboard that I can sketch things out. If I'm educating people
- **[03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-pQNxUlAOI&t=201s)** — about, I don't know, meta-pause, I can talk about how all the hormones go down except one
- **[03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-pQNxUlAOI&t=205s)** — called cortisol that goes up. That's why people, as they get older, lose their muscles.
- **[03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-pQNxUlAOI&t=211s)** — So this can just allow a lot of different easy explanations without using the big board right
- **[03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-pQNxUlAOI&t=216s)** — there. But I'm just loving this table. How the heck did you come up with this idea? It
- **[03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-pQNxUlAOI&t=223s)** — really looks like a flowing river. I know it's lighted underneath, but how did you come up
- **[03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-pQNxUlAOI&t=226s)** — with this? I thought it would be cool to actually almost have something look like the Grand
- **[03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-pQNxUlAOI&t=231s)** — Canyon because you were telling me how the camera was going to drop down on it. But we
- **[03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-pQNxUlAOI&t=234s)** — started thick with the epoxy on that side and we kind of tapered it out to almost zero over here,
- **[04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-pQNxUlAOI&t=241s)** — which I thought was kind of cool. Just something I decided to do and put it on this cool base.
- **[04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-pQNxUlAOI&t=246s)** — And yeah, it looks amazing from the down shot. I'm really impressed with it. Kind of cool.
- **[04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-pQNxUlAOI&t=250s)** — No, this is like over the top cool. Yeah, it looks great. So for those of you that have not
- **[04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-pQNxUlAOI&t=256s)** — subscribed to his channel, definitely subscribe and check out the video on how he built this.
- **[04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-pQNxUlAOI&t=261s)** — I'm going to put that up right here. Check it out.

- **[00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QlGJA-_a3uM&t=0s)** — So I want to share a short story that relates to the topic. I live in a farm. I have a goat named Bennett.
- **[00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QlGJA-_a3uM&t=6s)** — No matter what I do, Bennett seems to get through the fence and will start eating trees on the other side of the fence.
- **[00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QlGJA-_a3uM&t=12s)** — And this has been going on for quite some time. Okay, I got it figured out. I patched the holes.
- **[00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QlGJA-_a3uM&t=17s)** — There's no way Bennett is getting across the fence. Next day I come out, Bennett is across the fence.
- **[00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QlGJA-_a3uM&t=23s)** — So I started out with this fence, then reinforcing with an electric fence, putting mesh behind electric fence, to eventually building a wooden fence.
- **[00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QlGJA-_a3uM&t=33s)** — But even this wooden fence reinforced with electrical wires didn't hold Bennett in our paddock.
- **[00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QlGJA-_a3uM&t=41s)** — So then I had a bright idea of reinforcing all of this with chicken wire that was grounded into the earth.
- **[00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QlGJA-_a3uM&t=48s)** — I finally got it solved. There's no way he's going to get through this fence this time.
- **[00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QlGJA-_a3uM&t=52s)** — The next day, Bennett is on the other side of the fence.
- **[00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QlGJA-_a3uM&t=55s)** — Now Bennett is a very cute dwarf goat that looks like a cartoon character.
- **[01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QlGJA-_a3uM&t=61s)** — So it's hard to get mad at Bennett. But I was definitely furious at Bennett.
- **[01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QlGJA-_a3uM&t=64s)** — And so I had one last thing I was going to do before I basically hopeless in the situation.
- **[01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QlGJA-_a3uM&t=69s)** — And that was putting cameras all the way around the entire paddock.
- **[01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QlGJA-_a3uM&t=73s)** — Okay, that's a big job. So we did that.
- **[01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QlGJA-_a3uM&t=76s)** — And take a wild guess how Bennett was getting through the fence.
- **[01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QlGJA-_a3uM&t=82s)** — He wasn't getting through the fence.
- **[01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QlGJA-_a3uM&t=84s)** — Little tiny dwarf goat Bennett was able to jump over the fence.
- **[01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QlGJA-_a3uM&t=90s)** — Which was shocking. And this is called missing information.
- **[01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QlGJA-_a3uM&t=95s)** — And this relates to the topic.
- **[01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QlGJA-_a3uM&t=97s)** — And sometimes the information is not obvious, especially when you have a dwarf goat that apparently can jump extremely high.
- **[01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QlGJA-_a3uM&t=105s)** — No one ever told me that. I had no idea.
- **[01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QlGJA-_a3uM&t=107s)** — So let me dive right into and share some information related to dementia.
- **[01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QlGJA-_a3uM&t=111s)** — That you're going to be very glad that you're watching this video.
- **[01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QlGJA-_a3uM&t=114s)** — You know, when you evaluate a problem and you do a real good, thorough job of looking at all angles of this problem.
- **[02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QlGJA-_a3uM&t=121s)** — And everything just makes sense. Then we're getting closer to the truth.
- **[02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QlGJA-_a3uM&t=126s)** — I want to start this whole presentation with talking about a drug called Lupron.
- **[02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QlGJA-_a3uM&t=131s)** — It deals with certain cancers because it suppresses certain sex hormones.
- **[02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QlGJA-_a3uM&t=136s)** — Like testosterone, estrogen, progesterone, etc.
- **[02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QlGJA-_a3uM&t=139s)** — But I looked at one study relating to Lupron that decreased significantly dementia symptoms.
- **[02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QlGJA-_a3uM&t=148s)** — And the missing information about Lupron is that Lupron is a potent suppressor of this hormone called luteinizing hormone.
- **[02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QlGJA-_a3uM&t=157s)** — It's a hormone made from your pituitary.
- **[02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QlGJA-_a3uM&t=160s)** — And it basically signals down and tells the body to make various hormones like progesterone, like testosterone.
- **[02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QlGJA-_a3uM&t=170s)** — And Lupron suppresses luteinizing hormone.
- **[02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QlGJA-_a3uM&t=174s)** — As men get older, luteinizing hormone goes up.
- **[02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QlGJA-_a3uM&t=179s)** — I'm talking about 1000% higher than when you were younger.
- **[03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QlGJA-_a3uM&t=183s)** — If there's some type of blockage or a lack of a hormone down in the ovaries or testicle,
- **[03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QlGJA-_a3uM&t=189s)** — then the pituitary is going to start to really increase the luteinizing hormone.
- **[03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QlGJA-_a3uM&t=193s)** — And really what happens is as you get older, you lose the function of the testicles and the ovaries.
- **[03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QlGJA-_a3uM&t=199s)** — But we're going to just kind of hyper-focus on the luteinizing hormone right now.
- **[03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QlGJA-_a3uM&t=202s)** — Because of this missing piece, it's involved in age-related cognitive decline,
- **[03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QlGJA-_a3uM&t=210s)** — neuroinflammation, inflammation of the nerve cells, and synaptic dysfunction.
- **[03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QlGJA-_a3uM&t=217s)** — Those are little connections between the nerves.
- **[03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QlGJA-_a3uM&t=220s)** — They start to malfunction.
- **[03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QlGJA-_a3uM&t=222s)** — And apparently, patients with Alzheimer's have higher amounts of LH, luteinizing hormone,
- **[03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QlGJA-_a3uM&t=228s)** — than people that have normal cognitive function.
- **[03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QlGJA-_a3uM&t=232s)** — Now let's talk about progesterone.
- **[03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QlGJA-_a3uM&t=234s)** — Because progesterone significantly tanks when you have high levels of luteinizing hormone.
- **[04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QlGJA-_a3uM&t=243s)** — Apparently, progesterone is a very powerful neuro-steroid.
- **[04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QlGJA-_a3uM&t=249s)** — Neuro being nerve. Steroid meaning a type of hormone.
- **[04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QlGJA-_a3uM&t=252s)** — It supports the development of neurons.
- **[04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QlGJA-_a3uM&t=255s)** — And I'm telling you, when I started looking at these studies, which I'm going to put down below,
- **[04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QlGJA-_a3uM&t=259s)** — there are a ton of studies on progesterone with this interesting function
- **[04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QlGJA-_a3uM&t=263s)** — of supporting the brain.
- **[04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QlGJA-_a3uM&t=265s)** — Because women have more progesterone, apparently they have less negative effects
- **[04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QlGJA-_a3uM&t=270s)** — if they get traumatic brain injury than men.
- **[04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QlGJA-_a3uM&t=273s)** — Progesterone keeps the inflammation very low in your brain cells.
- **[04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QlGJA-_a3uM&t=278s)** — Progesterone enhances serotonin, and they have found that when this happens,
- **[04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QlGJA-_a3uM&t=285s)** — there's less addictive behaviors, like gambling and taking drugs, like cocaine.
- **[04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QlGJA-_a3uM&t=292s)** — People that have more addictions apparently have lower amounts of progesterone.
- **[04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QlGJA-_a3uM&t=296s)** — Interesting. Progesterone prevents apoptosis, which is a self-destructive thing
- **[05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QlGJA-_a3uM&t=302s)** — that occurs in a nerve cell or a cell in general.
- **[05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QlGJA-_a3uM&t=305s)** — If there's some damage in the cell, it commits suicide.
- **[05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QlGJA-_a3uM&t=309s)** — So progesterone prevents that. Progesterone even decreases blood-brain barrier leakage.
- **[05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QlGJA-_a3uM&t=315s)** — I mean, even think about, like after a menopause, what happens to progesterone in women?
- **[05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QlGJA-_a3uM&t=319s)** — It just goes way down to next to zero. In men, it might occur a little bit later,
- **[05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QlGJA-_a3uM&t=327s)** — like in their 70s, for example.
- **[05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QlGJA-_a3uM&t=330s)** — So now the question, is there something fairly natural that can help suppress luteinizing hormone?
- **[05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QlGJA-_a3uM&t=336s)** — And the answer is yes. It's melatonin.
- **[05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QlGJA-_a3uM&t=339s)** — Melatonin has the ability to suppress luteinizing hormone, indirectly increasing progesterone.
- **[05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QlGJA-_a3uM&t=347s)** — Now, there's a fascinating book that I'll put the link down below.
- **[05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QlGJA-_a3uM&t=351s)** — And I really like the author because in several of his books, he just evaluates the crap out of different topics.
- **[05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QlGJA-_a3uM&t=359s)** — I mean, he looks at things from every different angle.
- **[06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QlGJA-_a3uM&t=361s)** — He recommends that if someone has dementia, they should be taking like 75 milligrams of melatonin before bed.
- **[06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QlGJA-_a3uM&t=366s)** — And for men, it should be 125 milligrams before bed.
- **[06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QlGJA-_a3uM&t=371s)** — My idea about melatonin was for sleep.
- **[06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QlGJA-_a3uM&t=375s)** — And also, I have videos on what melatonin does to the cells. It's a powerful antioxidant.
- **[06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QlGJA-_a3uM&t=380s)** — But what was missing was this information on it lowering luteinizing hormone and indirectly increasing progesterone.
- **[06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QlGJA-_a3uM&t=388s)** — There's an interesting study on mice, which I'll put down below.
- **[06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QlGJA-_a3uM&t=391s)** — They had Alzheimer's symptoms or dementia, melatonin, and then they had them exercise.
- **[06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QlGJA-_a3uM&t=396s)** — And it halted the symptoms of Alzheimer's.
- **[06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QlGJA-_a3uM&t=400s)** — And even the author in the book has taken for over a year 500 milligrams of melatonin without any side effects.
- **[06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QlGJA-_a3uM&t=408s)** — So when people take melatonin, they usually take like three milligrams right before bed.
- **[06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QlGJA-_a3uM&t=412s)** — We're talking like 75 to 125. It's an extreme dosage.
- **[06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QlGJA-_a3uM&t=417s)** — There's a lot of benefits of melatonin.
- **[06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QlGJA-_a3uM&t=419s)** — I mean, it's definitely with cancer because melatonin is made by your mitochondria and it's a powerful antioxidant.
- **[07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QlGJA-_a3uM&t=425s)** — Now, there's some additional things that a person can take to help decrease luteinizing hormone.
- **[07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QlGJA-_a3uM&t=432s)** — And also to help raise progesterone.
- **[07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QlGJA-_a3uM&t=434s)** — And one is something called DHEA.
- **[07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QlGJA-_a3uM&t=438s)** — And taking more DHEA can also decrease your cortisol levels as well.
- **[07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QlGJA-_a3uM&t=442s)** — You can actually get a blood test to see where your DHEA is at if you're going to take that.
- **[07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QlGJA-_a3uM&t=447s)** — But it's something you could get as a supplement.
- **[07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QlGJA-_a3uM&t=450s)** — Another supplement is called a pregnenolone.
- **[07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QlGJA-_a3uM&t=452s)** — But before taking that, you might want to just get a blood test to see where your levels are at.
- **[07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QlGJA-_a3uM&t=457s)** — And there's other ways you can get melatonin as well.
- **[07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QlGJA-_a3uM&t=460s)** — But going to bed with the lights turned down can help stimulate melatonin in your pineal gland.
- **[07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QlGJA-_a3uM&t=466s)** — But 95% of your melatonin can be gotten from the sun.
- **[07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QlGJA-_a3uM&t=472s)** — OK, and I'm talking about a certain frequency or energy of the sun called infrared.
- **[07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QlGJA-_a3uM&t=477s)** — Most of the UV radiation is in the middle of the day, but not in the early morning or the late night.
- **[08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QlGJA-_a3uM&t=483s)** — That's when you get infrared without all of the ultraviolet.
- **[08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QlGJA-_a3uM&t=488s)** — And it goes right into your body. It'll go through your clothes.
- **[08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QlGJA-_a3uM&t=492s)** — So one time I was out in the woods and I have this device that can measure different frequencies of light from the sun, right?
- **[08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QlGJA-_a3uM&t=499s)** — And I was walking through the woods and I just noticed this interesting pattern.
- **[08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QlGJA-_a3uM&t=502s)** — It was almost completely dark in the woods.
- **[08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QlGJA-_a3uM&t=504s)** — How is this certain pattern of light penetrating?
- **[08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QlGJA-_a3uM&t=508s)** — Same thing happens when we sit in front of the fireplace or a campfire.
- **[08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QlGJA-_a3uM&t=511s)** — It's going to increase and enhance our melatonin.
- **[08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QlGJA-_a3uM&t=514s)** — And also, if you want to learn about the early signs of dementia and you haven't seen this video, I think I had like 11 million views.
- **[08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QlGJA-_a3uM&t=522s)** — I'll put it up right here. Check it out.
