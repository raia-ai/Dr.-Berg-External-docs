## What Is Solanine

# What is solanine?

**Solanine: Understanding Its Role and Impact**

Solanine is a natural compound found in nightshade vegetables, such as potatoes, tomatoes, and eggplants. It acts as a plant defense mechanism against pests and is primarily concentrated in the leaves and stems, with trace amounts in the edible parts.

**Impact on Arthritis:** Some individuals with arthritis report that nightshades exacerbate their symptoms, possibly due to solanine's potential to trigger inflammation. While research is limited, solanine might aggravate symptoms in those with specific sensitivities or allergies.

**Identifying Sensitivities:** To determine if solanine affects your arthritis, maintain a food diary and note any changes in symptoms. You might also consider eliminating nightshades from your diet temporarily, then reintroducing them to observe any differences. Although sensitivities are rare, they may contribute to increased joint pain or inflammation in some individuals.
