- **[00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QKeCwKDdWyM&t=0s)** — We can learn a lot about the number one selling drug in the world. Now, I'm not going to tell
- **[00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QKeCwKDdWyM&t=6s)** — people not to take this drug. I'm not going to tell people to take it. And I'm definitely
- **[00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QKeCwKDdWyM&t=11s)** — not here to get in the middle of you and your doctor with this medication. But if I had this
- **[00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QKeCwKDdWyM&t=16s)** — particular illness and needed this drug and I was told about this drug, I would want some
- **[00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QKeCwKDdWyM&t=21s)** — additional information. And that's what I'm going to share with you today. This drug is projected
- **[00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QKeCwKDdWyM&t=26s)** — to produce over $27 billion at the end of this year, 2024. And it's a cancer drug. And it's very
- **[00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QKeCwKDdWyM&t=37s)** — unique in that it's creating a paradigm shift in oncology. Because what it does is it actually
- **[00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QKeCwKDdWyM&t=43s)** — targets a very specific thing for certain types of cancer, not all of cancer. It's called
- **[00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QKeCwKDdWyM&t=48s)** — precision medicine. So it's not a broad-based antibiotic or like chemotherapy. It's very
- **[00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QKeCwKDdWyM&t=55s)** — targeted to this one thing. It releases the brakes on your own immune system. Cancer is
- **[01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QKeCwKDdWyM&t=65s)** — always trying to evade your immune system. This specific drug is called ketruta, which
- **[01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QKeCwKDdWyM&t=72s)** — does something to block that mechanism and allows your own immune system to be able to
- **[01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QKeCwKDdWyM&t=79s)** — tag and see where the cancer cells are so they can kill it. So that's one thing I
- **[01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QKeCwKDdWyM&t=84s)** — like about this strategy is that you're getting your own immune system to do the work. It's like
- **[01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QKeCwKDdWyM&t=90s)** — training this elite special forces to do a very specific job to attack a very specific
- **[01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QKeCwKDdWyM&t=98s)** — invader. They also use this drug for autoimmune diseases, infections, and cancer.
- **[01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QKeCwKDdWyM&t=105s)** — I like this strategy better if you have the type of cancer that this can help you with,
- **[01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QKeCwKDdWyM&t=110s)** — versus chemotherapy, which kills off cancer and your immune system. It pretty much wipes
- **[01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QKeCwKDdWyM&t=116s)** — everything out. We're dealing with something called immunomodulation. This is something that
- **[02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QKeCwKDdWyM&t=121s)** — either increases or decreases or blocks your immune system. There are quite a few side effects
- **[02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QKeCwKDdWyM&t=130s)** — as I'm going to scroll down. You can see all the different side effects. There's many. So it
- **[02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QKeCwKDdWyM&t=135s)** — doesn't come without its problems. Now the other problem with this drug is that it doesn't
- **[02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QKeCwKDdWyM&t=142s)** — work on all types of cancer. Cancer is very diverse. In other words, there are certain
- **[02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QKeCwKDdWyM&t=146s)** — cancers that don't even have the specific pathway for this to deal with. And cancer
- **[02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QKeCwKDdWyM&t=152s)** — has a super ability to also adapt. The cancer cells that are remaining from that insult,
- **[02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QKeCwKDdWyM&t=158s)** — they become resistant, they become super strong, and they can go out of control.
- **[02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QKeCwKDdWyM&t=163s)** — Similar to taking an antibiotic, these microbes resist that and become stronger. Now you have
- **[02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QKeCwKDdWyM&t=168s)** — these superbugs. Also, this drug does not address the fuel for the cancer, or doesn't
- **[02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QKeCwKDdWyM&t=175s)** — block the raw materials that it needs to build cancer cells. And the drug doesn't address
- **[03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QKeCwKDdWyM&t=181s)** — the microenvironment where this cancer lives. I think an approach that uses multiple strategies
- **[03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QKeCwKDdWyM&t=188s)** — at the same time just would be really smart if you have cancer. So the first question is,
- **[03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QKeCwKDdWyM&t=195s)** — is there anything natural that is in an immunomodulator? And the answer is yes. There
- **[03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QKeCwKDdWyM&t=201s)** — are a lot of different natural remedies that help to increase or decrease the immune system.
- **[03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QKeCwKDdWyM&t=208s)** — In fact, this is how a lot of drug companies get their ideas and develop patents for
- **[03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QKeCwKDdWyM&t=213s)** — research in the area of plant chemicals. If I'm not mistaken, I think it's over 50%
- **[03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QKeCwKDdWyM&t=219s)** — of all drugs are derivatives of something that came from nature. So we have astragalus.
- **[03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QKeCwKDdWyM&t=225s)** — Okay, that's very potent. We have the reishi mushroom. There's also other types of mushrooms
- **[03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QKeCwKDdWyM&t=231s)** — too that deal with cancer. And then of course you just have vitamin D in relationship to
- **[03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QKeCwKDdWyM&t=235s)** — cancer. And think about what vitamin D does as in an immunomodulator. I mean, I personally
- **[03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QKeCwKDdWyM&t=239s)** — take 20,000 I use of vitamin D3 every single day, especially if someone's dealing with
- **[04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QKeCwKDdWyM&t=244s)** — autoimmunity type problem or inflammation. I would also address the diet. I would do things
- **[04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QKeCwKDdWyM&t=250s)** — to avoid fueling the cancer cell. I would also do fasting because that is the most powerful
- **[04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QKeCwKDdWyM&t=258s)** — thing to help starve off cancer. And if you can't do prolonged fasting, you can do the
- **[04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QKeCwKDdWyM&t=264s)** — mimicking diet, okay, which is a bit easier. And you would do that for five days, once a month,
- **[04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QKeCwKDdWyM&t=270s)** — maybe every three weeks. And also there's something that medicine doesn't really get
- **[04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QKeCwKDdWyM&t=274s)** — into. It's the mindset. I personally know people who are very strong willed. They're
- **[04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QKeCwKDdWyM&t=279s)** — not going down with cancer. There's a reason why when the doctor says you have this
- **[04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QKeCwKDdWyM&t=284s)** — amount of time to live that there's a high correlation between the person only living
- **[04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QKeCwKDdWyM&t=289s)** — that amount of time because somehow that gets in your mind and you agree with it. And then all
- **[04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QKeCwKDdWyM&t=293s)** — of a sudden that happens. But I think it's really, really important to disagree with cancer and
- **[05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QKeCwKDdWyM&t=300s)** — basically say, you know, I'm going to survive no matter what I'm going to make it happen.
- **[05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QKeCwKDdWyM&t=304s)** — There are also nutritional protocols to help starve cancer. And if you have not seen my
- **[05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QKeCwKDdWyM&t=310s)** — video that I recently did, I cover all the protocols and what you need to do. And I put
- **[05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QKeCwKDdWyM&t=315s)** — that video right here. Check it out.

- **[00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TBSGhpG8yfE&t=0s)** — Let's talk about how to get rid of swollen legs, ankles, and feet.
- **[00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TBSGhpG8yfE&t=5s)** — Would you believe that I used to have pitting edema right on my ankles?
- **[00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TBSGhpG8yfE&t=8s)** — I remember pressing into my lower ankle and leaving a dent.
- **[00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TBSGhpG8yfE&t=13s)** — I mean, I'm not that old. It was some years ago, but even in this picture you could see,
- **[00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TBSGhpG8yfE&t=17s)** — my face was completely round.
- **[00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TBSGhpG8yfE&t=21s)** — Anytime someone has a round face, what that means is they have blood sugar issues.
- **[00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TBSGhpG8yfE&t=26s)** — But the point is, I had a lot of health problems, and pitting edema was definitely one of them.
- **[00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TBSGhpG8yfE&t=31s)** — Now, swollen legs are called edema. And if you look this up,
- **[00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TBSGhpG8yfE&t=35s)** — it'll say that it's a liver problem, a kidney problem, a heart problem.
- **[00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TBSGhpG8yfE&t=39s)** — Maybe you're consuming too much sodium. But that's not always the case.
- **[00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TBSGhpG8yfE&t=43s)** — There's something else way more common, and I'm going to share that with you today.
- **[00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TBSGhpG8yfE&t=46s)** — And this is totally easy to fix. When you watch this video, if you just apply what I'm going to show you,
- **[00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TBSGhpG8yfE&t=51s)** — you'll fix this very fast. Without taking a blood thinner,
- **[00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TBSGhpG8yfE&t=55s)** — like some type of diuretic, to push the fluid out. I mean, that comes with a package, like side effects.
- **[01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TBSGhpG8yfE&t=61s)** — When you have fluid retention, especially in your lower legs and ankles,
- **[01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TBSGhpG8yfE&t=66s)** — this boils down to a problem with these little tiny pumps that are not working.
- **[01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TBSGhpG8yfE&t=71s)** — In your cells, you have millions and millions of these little tiny pumps that push fluid in and out of the cell.
- **[01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TBSGhpG8yfE&t=77s)** — And the specific pump that's not working in this case is called the sodium-potassium pump.
- **[01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TBSGhpG8yfE&t=81s)** — There's some really interesting things about this pump. It uses like 30 to 40 percent of all the energy that is given to that cell.
- **[01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TBSGhpG8yfE&t=88s)** — But if that pump goes bad, like in our house in the basement, when the pump went bad,
- **[01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TBSGhpG8yfE&t=92s)** — we had about a foot of water in our basement. If the pump goes bad in your body,
- **[01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TBSGhpG8yfE&t=97s)** — you're going to have a lot of fluid that is not going to be in the cells. It's going to be outside the cells.
- **[01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TBSGhpG8yfE&t=102s)** — And that's called interstitial fluid retention. So what's really going on in your lower ankles
- **[01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TBSGhpG8yfE&t=107s)** — is you're getting a condition where your sugar in the blood is too high
- **[01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TBSGhpG8yfE&t=112s)** — and all that sugar is connected to the protein in the blood called hemoglobin.
- **[01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TBSGhpG8yfE&t=116s)** — So let's say we have a protein bar right here representing the protein and then we have a marshmallow representing the sugar.
- **[02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TBSGhpG8yfE&t=123s)** — What happens when this sugar connects to the protein in your blood? This is called glycation.
- **[02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TBSGhpG8yfE&t=129s)** — So this is the term that they use when you hear this test called A1C.
- **[02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TBSGhpG8yfE&t=133s)** — The A1C test measures how much sugar is stuck to your blood protein.
- **[02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TBSGhpG8yfE&t=141s)** — And it gives you an average of like three months because the red blood cell survives about three months.
- **[02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TBSGhpG8yfE&t=147s)** — And so when this sugar gets stuck to the blood protein, it doesn't come off.
- **[02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TBSGhpG8yfE&t=152s)** — It's stuck there permanently until that blood cell dies. And so when you eat more sugar,
- **[02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TBSGhpG8yfE&t=156s)** — you get more sugar stuck to this protein, more sugar stuck to the protein,
- **[02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TBSGhpG8yfE&t=160s)** — until this protein can't work anymore. And the name for this is that the protein is glycated.
- **[02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TBSGhpG8yfE&t=167s)** — But the main takeaway for this is that when you eat sugar, you destroy the ability for the blood cell
- **[02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TBSGhpG8yfE&t=172s)** — to carry nutrition to the body, to carry oxygen. And this glycated protein molecule now plugs up your circulation.
- **[03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TBSGhpG8yfE&t=181s)** — Then you get a lack of blood flow and then you get this pooling that goes on in your lower part of your body.
- **[03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TBSGhpG8yfE&t=186s)** — And this is that swelling because it also destroys the inside of your arteries and it creates a leakiness outside the cell.
- **[03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TBSGhpG8yfE&t=195s)** — The fluid that was supposed to be inside your vessels can now escape.
- **[03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TBSGhpG8yfE&t=199s)** — The other thing that this does when you eat a lot of sugar is that it actually creates a sodium retention.
- **[03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TBSGhpG8yfE&t=204s)** — Not to mention the other mineral called potassium gets locked up in the sugar. And wherever the sodium goes, the water goes.
- **[03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TBSGhpG8yfE&t=212s)** — Now, over time, this is going to affect the nerves in the bottom of the feet. You're going to get numbness, tingling.
- **[03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TBSGhpG8yfE&t=218s)** — They call that peripheral neuropathy. And so, yes, when you look at a diabetic, you see a lot of fluid in the ankles and things.
- **[03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TBSGhpG8yfE&t=224s)** — But even people that are not diabetic and maybe they're not even pre-diabetic, they're going towards that area.
- **[03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TBSGhpG8yfE&t=231s)** — They also have fluid retention. And that's what I had. There is a very important vitamin to correct this.
- **[03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TBSGhpG8yfE&t=238s)** — But there are two other things, the minerals that you need to also get from the diet. Of course, the obvious one is potassium.
- **[04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TBSGhpG8yfE&t=245s)** — The problem with potassium is that it's not easy to get from the diet because we need so, so much.
- **[04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TBSGhpG8yfE&t=251s)** — An average person needs 4,700 milligrams. Now think about what that means.
- **[04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TBSGhpG8yfE&t=257s)** — If you were to eat one banana, that's like 300 milligrams. So how many times does 300 go into 4,700?
- **[04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TBSGhpG8yfE&t=265s)** — Let's take a look. You would have to consume 15.6 bananas every day just to get your potassium.
- **[04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TBSGhpG8yfE&t=272s)** — But the problem with that is that's going to be hard. And also that's a lot of sugar.
- **[04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TBSGhpG8yfE&t=277s)** — So instead of doing that, you might be better off doing like avocados, more salad and even more fruit like berries.
- **[04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TBSGhpG8yfE&t=285s)** — You can get a lot of potassium from that. Now, the other mineral, magnesium, is behind something called ATP, which is the energy currency of the body.
- **[04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TBSGhpG8yfE&t=292s)** — And yes, you're going to get cramps if you have magnesium problems, but also you're going to have a lack of energy.
- **[04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TBSGhpG8yfE&t=298s)** — So to get magnesium, you probably need to consume more pumpkin seeds or sunflower seeds as well as leafy greens.
- **[05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TBSGhpG8yfE&t=307s)** — But you don't need 4,700 like potassium. You need about 420 milligrams of magnesium.
- **[05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TBSGhpG8yfE&t=313s)** — You can also get both of these from a good electrolyte powder. But just make sure that the electrolyte powder is high quality.
- **[05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TBSGhpG8yfE&t=319s)** — It doesn't have the hidden sugars. All right, so that will fix the pump.
- **[05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TBSGhpG8yfE&t=323s)** — But the very reason why the pump went bad is what we want to talk about next.
- **[05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TBSGhpG8yfE&t=328s)** — And that is a deficiency of vitamin B1. So I want to show you in this little very simple chart here.
- **[05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TBSGhpG8yfE&t=334s)** — I'm being very sarcastic. It's a huge biochemical chart.
- **[05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TBSGhpG8yfE&t=338s)** — You can see all this chemistry stuff going on right here and this stuff right here.
- **[05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TBSGhpG8yfE&t=343s)** — When you eat sugar in the body, it starts here and then it has to be broken down into a smaller sugar molecule called glucose.
- **[05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TBSGhpG8yfE&t=352s)** — And then it has to enter the machine to be turned into energy.
- **[05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TBSGhpG8yfE&t=357s)** — In order for it to go from this step to this step, this one little enzyme requires vitamin B1.
- **[06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TBSGhpG8yfE&t=364s)** — If you don't have enough, then you will not be able to use that as energy.
- **[06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TBSGhpG8yfE&t=368s)** — And so the number one cause of a B1 deficiency is consuming too much carbohydrates in the refined form.
- **[06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TBSGhpG8yfE&t=377s)** — For example, if you eat all this refined sugar without B1, now the body has to pull from its reserves, right?
- **[06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TBSGhpG8yfE&t=384s)** — We have to pull it from different tissues and organs and glands.
- **[06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TBSGhpG8yfE&t=387s)** — And eventually you're going to be deficient.
- **[06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TBSGhpG8yfE&t=390s)** — And that B1 is also very important as an antioxidant to protect the nerves.
- **[06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TBSGhpG8yfE&t=395s)** — This is why when you run out of B1, you get what's called peripheral neuropathy,
- **[06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TBSGhpG8yfE&t=401s)** — which is tingling and numbness and burning on the bottom of your feet.
- **[06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TBSGhpG8yfE&t=405s)** — The point is that B1 is so important in carbohydrate metabolism and protecting you against a lot of carbohydrates.
- **[06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TBSGhpG8yfE&t=412s)** — And when I say protection, I'm talking about the protection against this glycation, this sugar connecting to the protein.
- **[07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TBSGhpG8yfE&t=421s)** — B1 keeps these apart so you don't destroy your blood cells and you have good circulation.
- **[07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TBSGhpG8yfE&t=428s)** — Because you have to realize as soon as that connects to it, it's permanent.
- **[07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TBSGhpG8yfE&t=432s)** — It's not coming off. So magnesium, potassium and B1 is the solution to swollen ankles.
- **[07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TBSGhpG8yfE&t=440s)** — But you also have to get the sugar out of the diet because as soon as you go back to eating the refined carbohydrates, guess what?
- **[07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TBSGhpG8yfE&t=447s)** — The swelling comes back.
- **[07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TBSGhpG8yfE&t=448s)** — Alright, so now the question is, if I'm not going to eat carbs, what am I going to eat?
- **[07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TBSGhpG8yfE&t=452s)** — For that information, you need to watch this video right here.

- **[00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7D35xgIVtQM&t=0s)** — Hi guys, in this video we are going to talk about the nutrients for the adrenal.
- **[00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7D35xgIVtQM&t=4s)** — I put together a kit, a very comprehensive kit, that covers all of the different aspects
- **[00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7D35xgIVtQM&t=10s)** — of the adrenal type. And I want to talk about them.
- **[00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7D35xgIVtQM&t=13s)** — Number one, sleep aid. Now this is something I take every night before I go to sleep.
- **[00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7D35xgIVtQM&t=18s)** — You take it literally about 15 minutes before you go to sleep and you will just go right
- **[00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7D35xgIVtQM&t=22s)** — to sleep, wake up feeling refreshed, you won't feel groggy. It doesn't have the
- **[00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7D35xgIVtQM&t=29s)** — feel kind of foggy. It has certain things to help relax the internal stress so you
- **[00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7D35xgIVtQM&t=36s)** — can turn off fast and then sleep sound through the night. I have adapted this formula over
- **[00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7D35xgIVtQM&t=41s)** — the years to just perfect it so it has been changed many times. I am not going
- **[00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7D35xgIVtQM&t=44s)** — to change it because I have the formula exact. It works really good.
- **[00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7D35xgIVtQM&t=48s)** — So sleep aid, one before bed. The adrenal and cortisol relief. This is something
- **[00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7D35xgIVtQM&t=51s)** — you take during the day. The sensation that you know you need this is if you have
- **[00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7D35xgIVtQM&t=56s)** — this internal stress, this tension that you need to relax. And if you know people
- **[01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7D35xgIVtQM&t=61s)** — are about ready to fly off the handle or have low patience, just give them one
- **[01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7D35xgIVtQM&t=66s)** — tablet and wait like three minutes. They are just going to feel very chilled out.
- **[01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7D35xgIVtQM&t=70s)** — So it is really good to take during the day. You take like three, spread it out.
- **[01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7D35xgIVtQM&t=73s)** — You can take more if you want. But it will really chill out the body to the
- **[01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7D35xgIVtQM&t=78s)** — point where you will feel very calm and serene. It is a very cool product.
- **[01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7D35xgIVtQM&t=81s)** — And the next one is trace minerals. I use a plant-based trace minerals which are
- **[01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7D35xgIVtQM&t=86s)** — fifteen thousand times smaller than regular minerals. But these help the
- **[01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7D35xgIVtQM&t=92s)** — proteins work in your body. So with adrenal you have a lot of breakdown of
- **[01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7D35xgIVtQM&t=96s)** — protein, loss of collagen. You have a lot of problems with enzymes not
- **[01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7D35xgIVtQM&t=100s)** — working because the hormonal shift. So this is a really good one to help
- **[01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7D35xgIVtQM&t=105s)** — support not just hair and nails and skin, but muscle, tendon, ligament,
- **[01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7D35xgIVtQM&t=111s)** — disc. Okay. Last one is gallbladder formula. The gallbladder is a kind of an
- **[01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7D35xgIVtQM&t=118s)** — organ that people don't talk about. It is like a missing link to so many
- **[02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7D35xgIVtQM&t=122s)** — health problems. Especially with digestion and bloating, feeling a
- **[02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7D35xgIVtQM&t=125s)** — swollen belly. So many people have a problem with digestion and they
- **[02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7D35xgIVtQM&t=129s)** — actually think it is all fat, but really it is digestion. In this
- **[02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7D35xgIVtQM&t=133s)** — product I have things to help support a healthy gallbladder, support
- **[02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7D35xgIVtQM&t=139s)** — the stomach, enzymes to help you for the pancreas. So it is a very
- **[02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7D35xgIVtQM&t=143s)** — comprehensive digestive formula with emphasis on the gallbladder. Very
- **[02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7D35xgIVtQM&t=147s)** — popular, very effective, especially for bloating. And also it comes with
- **[02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7D35xgIVtQM&t=152s)** — my book, the New Body Type Guide, which you are going to focus right on
- **[02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7D35xgIVtQM&t=155s)** — the adrenal chapter after you do the basic plan. This has everything you
- **[02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7D35xgIVtQM&t=160s)** — need to know about the adrenal body type. And then this book right
- **[02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7D35xgIVtQM&t=165s)** — here, which is It is Not Lose Weight to Get Healthy, It is Get Healthy
- **[02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7D35xgIVtQM&t=168s)** — to Lose Weight. It is a summary, companion book of this so you can
- **[02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7D35xgIVtQM&t=172s)** — jump right in, read it within an hour and get started. And then
- **[02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7D35xgIVtQM&t=176s)** — you can fill in the details with this. So I also included several
- **[03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7D35xgIVtQM&t=180s)** — bonuses so you can check it out. I put a link down below. So your

- **[00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ac1rrcr6xhY&t=0s)** — So there's one cell in your body that takes a beating. It does the majority of detoxification.
- **[00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ac1rrcr6xhY&t=7s)** — And that cell is called the hepatocyte. And hepatocytes are liver cells. So your liver is the main detoxification organ of the entire body.
- **[00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ac1rrcr6xhY&t=17s)** — To a lesser degree, the kidneys help you detoxify, the small intestine helps you detoxify, the skin can help you detoxify, and even your fat cells can help to some degree detoxify.
- **[00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ac1rrcr6xhY&t=29s)** — But it's that liver that takes a beating. So today we're going to talk about how to make sure your liver is doing its job.
- **[00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ac1rrcr6xhY&t=37s)** — But I want to give you some solutions that are simple, easy changes to protect yourself.
- **[00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ac1rrcr6xhY&t=42s)** — But you do need to be aware of the quantity of chemicals that we are swimming in every day.
- **[00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ac1rrcr6xhY&t=49s)** — Because they do affect us in a negative way, but it's hard to pinpoint one thing versus another because there are so many chemicals and variables.
- **[00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ac1rrcr6xhY&t=57s)** — It's very hard to test for this. I mean, think about this. We have 27 trillion pounds of chemicals that are produced or imported from other places to the U.S. every single year.
- **[01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ac1rrcr6xhY&t=70s)** — That's 74 billion pounds every single day, which comes out to about 250 pounds of chemicals per person.
- **[01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ac1rrcr6xhY&t=79s)** — So there is a lot of exposure of chemicals. Now, you might say, well, I live a pretty clean life and I'm not really exposed to chemicals.
- **[01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ac1rrcr6xhY&t=86s)** — It doesn't include fuels, doesn't include pesticides. It doesn't even include the chemicals in your food.
- **[01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ac1rrcr6xhY&t=94s)** — And I'm not even including the poisons. I'm sorry, did I say poisons? I meant medications from health care.
- **[01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ac1rrcr6xhY&t=101s)** — I mean, it's just bizarre to me that if we think about health care, well, that's just another way we're exposed to more chemicals to suppress symptoms.
- **[01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ac1rrcr6xhY&t=111s)** — I mean, really what's missing in health care is the health part. I mean, what is in health care that's actually creating more health?
- **[01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ac1rrcr6xhY&t=118s)** — These chemicals, they build up a half-life and some of these chemicals can be from weeks to years to decades.
- **[02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ac1rrcr6xhY&t=125s)** — And a half-life of the substance is that you're reducing the potency of something by 50% over a period of time.
- **[02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ac1rrcr6xhY&t=133s)** — So it becomes less activated. And a lot of times they'll measure the half-life of certain chemicals.
- **[02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ac1rrcr6xhY&t=139s)** — Okay, the book on toxicology. You can see there's actually quite a few toxins in our environment and a lot of information on it.
- **[02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ac1rrcr6xhY&t=146s)** — But the half-life of a lot of these chemicals are measured usually through the blood, not necessarily through your tissues, the cells outside the blood, which is a whole different thing.
- **[02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ac1rrcr6xhY&t=157s)** — We definitely need to do three things. We need to be aware of the chemicals. We need to reduce the exposure to the chemicals.
- **[02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ac1rrcr6xhY&t=162s)** — And we definitely need to increase the ability to detoxify the chemicals.
- **[02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ac1rrcr6xhY&t=168s)** — And the main support needs to be to the hepatocyte, that liver cell.
- **[02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ac1rrcr6xhY&t=173s)** — And now a lot of these chemicals in the environment act like estrogen.
- **[02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ac1rrcr6xhY&t=177s)** — Okay, so they're called estrogen disruptors or even endocrine disruptors, because what they do to the endocrine system, they can act and mimic like your hormones.
- **[03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ac1rrcr6xhY&t=188s)** — And so they can really throw off the thyroid, the adrenals, the pituitary, all these different hormonal pathways.
- **[03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ac1rrcr6xhY&t=195s)** — And there's definitely a direct connection between what those chemicals do and how they damage the DNA, how they alter the DNA.
- **[03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ac1rrcr6xhY&t=201s)** — They can mutate and change the DNA and they create a lot of diseases, a lot of oxidation and free radical damage.
- **[03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ac1rrcr6xhY&t=208s)** — And of course, this free radical damage can create a whole cascade of problems.
- **[03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ac1rrcr6xhY&t=212s)** — And this is why antioxidants help to counter that.
- **[03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ac1rrcr6xhY&t=216s)** — Our bodies make antioxidants and we also can get antioxidants from food.
- **[03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ac1rrcr6xhY&t=221s)** — Now, another really interesting thing about certain chemicals in foods that can help us detoxify is the fact that we already have the machinery, the enzymes within our bodies.
- **[03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ac1rrcr6xhY&t=235s)** — OK, we have certain enzymes that can turn poisons into harmless particles, but they can become activated by certain things in our foods.
- **[04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ac1rrcr6xhY&t=245s)** — So sometimes we have this idea that it's just the antioxidants that are kind of countering the oxidation, but also they're activating something that we already have inside.
- **[04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ac1rrcr6xhY&t=255s)** — We just need to turn on those genes to do the job a little bit better.
- **[04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ac1rrcr6xhY&t=259s)** — And I just had my DNA tested and apparently I also have certain detoxifying genes that are not working like they should.
- **[04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ac1rrcr6xhY&t=267s)** — So I have to work harder at getting them to work.
- **[04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ac1rrcr6xhY&t=271s)** — So there's a group of enzymes that are called the cytochrome P450 enzymes.
- **[04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ac1rrcr6xhY&t=277s)** — And there's this whole biochemical pathway that goes from phase one, phase two, phase three, that helps to turn these poisons into things that are harmless.
- **[04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ac1rrcr6xhY&t=286s)** — So the majority of that occurs in that hepatocyte, but it does incur in other places in the body.
- **[04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ac1rrcr6xhY&t=292s)** — So I'm going to be going through things that we can do to minimize exposure to the poisons, what you can do to activate them,
- **[04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ac1rrcr6xhY&t=299s)** — and also the number one food that will help you activate these enzymes that you already have.
- **[05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ac1rrcr6xhY&t=305s)** — All we have to do is trigger them.
- **[05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ac1rrcr6xhY&t=306s)** — We have toxins and pollution from the air, from the water, from the food, from beauty products, right?
- **[05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ac1rrcr6xhY&t=315s)** — Oceans, shampoo, hair gels, conditioners, hair dyes, etc., etc.
- **[05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ac1rrcr6xhY&t=321s)** — We need to make sure those are as clean as possible.
- **[05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ac1rrcr6xhY&t=325s)** — This is kind of good on the list and just talk about air pollution.
- **[05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ac1rrcr6xhY&t=328s)** — I would highly recommend getting some type of filter.
- **[05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ac1rrcr6xhY&t=331s)** — There's one good one called Merv VIII, and that can be very essential if you live in polluted areas,
- **[05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ac1rrcr6xhY&t=336s)** — especially if you live in the city.
- **[05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ac1rrcr6xhY&t=337s)** — You want that air filter to minimize the amount of chemicals, and that can make a big difference in your exposure.
- **[05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ac1rrcr6xhY&t=344s)** — Number two, growing certain plants that can help soak up chemicals like benzene and formaldehyde
- **[05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ac1rrcr6xhY&t=353s)** — and many of the other chemicals in the air. So it's not a very expensive thing to just
- **[05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ac1rrcr6xhY&t=357s)** — have more plants in your house. And I'm going to put a video down below of what plants I
- **[06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ac1rrcr6xhY&t=362s)** — would recommend. Spending more time in nature is very, very therapeutic from just breathing
- **[06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ac1rrcr6xhY&t=368s)** — in healthy air. All right, what about a water filter? Do you have a shower filter?
- **[06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ac1rrcr6xhY&t=373s)** — Do you have a water filter? You definitely need to get one. The amount of crap that's in our water.
- **[06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ac1rrcr6xhY&t=379s)** — I mean, even chlorine. Yes, chlorine will kill off pathogens, but on the flip side, it can
- **[06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ac1rrcr6xhY&t=386s)** — increase the risk of cancer. So we have chlorine, we have fluoride, we have all these other
- **[06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ac1rrcr6xhY&t=391s)** — chemicals in the water. So you need to get a water filter and they don't have to be expensive.
- **[06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ac1rrcr6xhY&t=396s)** — I mean, a really simple, relatively inexpensive water filter. And you get all different kinds.
- **[06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ac1rrcr6xhY&t=400s)** — You can get it from the shower or a pitcher or under the counter or over the counter.
- **[06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ac1rrcr6xhY&t=405s)** — Just go to Zero Water. I'll put a link down below. I'm not affiliated with them, but they
- **[06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ac1rrcr6xhY&t=409s)** — have a good system. They have three ways of getting rid of chemicals. The carbon filter,
- **[06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ac1rrcr6xhY&t=413s)** — they have one that binds to heavy metals, and they have another filter that will help
- **[06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ac1rrcr6xhY&t=418s)** — reduce other things like chloride and fluoride and things like that. Now, another really
- **[07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ac1rrcr6xhY&t=423s)** — important thing is fish. Okay, always it's wild caught. Farm raised fish are loaded with
- **[07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ac1rrcr6xhY&t=429s)** — okay, just more chemicals. You want to do wild caught. And you definitely want to consume the
- **[07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ac1rrcr6xhY&t=434s)** — fish that are smaller. You don't want to consume the big fish. Like avoid swordfish,
- **[07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ac1rrcr6xhY&t=440s)** — shark, tuna. These fish accumulate a lot of mercury because they tend to eat smaller fish
- **[07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ac1rrcr6xhY&t=448s)** — that eat smaller fish. So there's a much higher concentration of mercury, like sometimes up to
- **[07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ac1rrcr6xhY&t=452s)** — a thousand times more. And that mercury can accumulate in your body. But with the smaller
- **[07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ac1rrcr6xhY&t=456s)** — fish, there's much, much less mercury and the selenium can bind to the mercury that's in there
- **[07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ac1rrcr6xhY&t=462s)** — and inactivate it. So it's not a problem. Now, what about organic vegetables? Absolutely.
- **[07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ac1rrcr6xhY&t=467s)** — Let's say you just can't afford organic. You can break down a considerable amount of
- **[07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ac1rrcr6xhY&t=473s)** — organophosphates by using apple cider vinegar and water. You just put a fourth of a cup
- **[07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ac1rrcr6xhY&t=478s)** — of apple cider vinegar and a gallon of water and wash your vegetables. You can remove a lot
- **[08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ac1rrcr6xhY&t=484s)** — chemicals just by that simple procedure. So organic food is without pesticides and it is
- **[08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ac1rrcr6xhY&t=490s)** — more nutrient dense. Now I already mentioned the chemical free beauty products. So many people
- **[08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ac1rrcr6xhY&t=496s)** — are exposing their bodies, deodorants and hand creams, and they're not really reading the
- **[08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ac1rrcr6xhY&t=501s)** — label. These things accumulate. They go into the liver. The next thing I would really avoid
- **[08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ac1rrcr6xhY&t=506s)** — is canned foods. Canned foods greatly increase things called BPAs. And I'm not going to
- **[08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ac1rrcr6xhY&t=513s)** — get into the technicalities of them, but if you go through this book right here and look at the
- **[08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ac1rrcr6xhY&t=519s)** — section of BPAs, you're going to find that they create a lot of problems with your endocrine
- **[08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ac1rrcr6xhY&t=524s)** — system. They're endocrine disruptors and you're going to get a lot of them if you're
- **[08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ac1rrcr6xhY&t=528s)** — consistently eating canned foods, especially those soups. So I would just avoid canned foods
- **[08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ac1rrcr6xhY&t=533s)** — or if you do consume them, don't consume them often. All right. So let's bring up the
- **[08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ac1rrcr6xhY&t=538s)** — number one food to help strengthen and trigger the detoxifying enzymes in the hepatocyte,
- **[09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ac1rrcr6xhY&t=548s)** — the liver cell. And that is cruciferous vegetables. Now there's a lot of other things
- **[09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ac1rrcr6xhY&t=553s)** — that will do it too, like garlic, for example. Onion will do it. Oregano. But the
- **[09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ac1rrcr6xhY&t=559s)** — cruciferous family of vegetables are potent inducers of cytochrome P450 enzymes. And
- **[09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ac1rrcr6xhY&t=567s)** — there's a tremendous amount of research on this. It's hardcore data. Those foods consumed
- **[09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ac1rrcr6xhY&t=570s)** — on a regular basis can help to not just pull chemicals out, but they also provide a lot of
- **[09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ac1rrcr6xhY&t=577s)** — other benefits. Anti-inflammatory, anti-cancer. Now every time you deal with toxins or free
- **[09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ac1rrcr6xhY&t=584s)** — radicals or antioxidants, people always think about plants, right? Because we all know that
- **[09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ac1rrcr6xhY&t=592s)** — these antioxidants are not in, you know, meats. Well, that's not actually true. I recently was
- **[09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ac1rrcr6xhY&t=599s)** — involved in a study sending my beef from my farm into a study. Okay. It's called the beef
- **[10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ac1rrcr6xhY&t=607s)** — nutrient density study. I just want to show you this one graph right here.
- **[10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ac1rrcr6xhY&t=612s)** — I don't know if you can see this. See this, this green bar right here. Okay. Right there.
- **[10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ac1rrcr6xhY&t=616s)** — Versus the blue bar versus the other colored bar right here. I think it's pink.
- **[10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ac1rrcr6xhY&t=622s)** — So right here we have Dr. Berg's beef, and then we have other farmers on average of the
- **[10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ac1rrcr6xhY&t=628s)** — grass fed beef, and then we have the grain fed beef. Now what this is evaluating
- **[10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ac1rrcr6xhY&t=635s)** — is phytonutrients. These are plant based chemicals, plant based chemicals in beef.
- **[10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ac1rrcr6xhY&t=641s)** — Now the healthier the beef, the more you're going to have these plant based chemicals
- **[10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ac1rrcr6xhY&t=646s)** — that can act as antioxidants and create a lot of other health benefits. But you can see there
- **[10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ac1rrcr6xhY&t=651s)** — are definitely more, if you compare grain fed to grass fed, definitely more. But the healthier
- **[10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ac1rrcr6xhY&t=656s)** — the beef, like I do grass fed grass finished. Okay. And I really take care of my cattle.
- **[11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ac1rrcr6xhY&t=663s)** — So you can see the amount of phytonutrients. This would be a great substitute for vegetables.
- **[11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ac1rrcr6xhY&t=670s)** — If you have gut problems, right? Because there's definitely an increase in people doing carnivore
- **[11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ac1rrcr6xhY&t=677s)** — because of their gut issues. And people will say, well, you can't get all the nutrients from
- **[11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ac1rrcr6xhY&t=681s)** — beef or other types of organ meats. Well, apparently you can, but I really think it's the
- **[11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ac1rrcr6xhY&t=685s)** — quality. Well, this just proves it. It's the quality of meat. You're not going to go down to
- **[11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ac1rrcr6xhY&t=690s)** — the local Safeway grocery store and get deli meat and think you're going to be getting
- **[11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ac1rrcr6xhY&t=697s)** — those phytonutrients. You're going to have to go to the farmer's market or you're going to have
- **[11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ac1rrcr6xhY&t=701s)** — to get grass fed grass finished to really get the full health benefits of these products.
- **[11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ac1rrcr6xhY&t=708s)** — Is the animal being fed grains? Okay. Or grass and weeds grown on healthy soils.
- **[11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ac1rrcr6xhY&t=715s)** — So we have the cruciferous vegetables like the kale, the broccoli, the arugula,
- **[11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ac1rrcr6xhY&t=719s)** — the radish, all those are very, very key. But you also have all the herbs too that can
- **[12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ac1rrcr6xhY&t=725s)** — And then we have things that contain B vitamins that can help you detoxify. I did a whole video
- **[12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ac1rrcr6xhY&t=731s)** — on that. It's actually a very interesting video, which I'll put a link down below.
- **[12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ac1rrcr6xhY&t=734s)** — And then we have minerals that help you detoxify like selenium, like in Brazil nuts,
- **[12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ac1rrcr6xhY&t=739s)** — very important to help increase glutathione, which is another enzyme to help break down
- **[12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ac1rrcr6xhY&t=745s)** — poisons and your gut microbiome is so important in supporting detoxification. If you don't have
- **[12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ac1rrcr6xhY&t=754s)** — the full diversity of your gut microbes, that's going to limit your ability to get
- **[12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ac1rrcr6xhY&t=758s)** — rid of poisons. So start consuming foods with microbes like sauerkraut, kimchi,
- **[12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ac1rrcr6xhY&t=763s)** — kefir, very important. The next thing I want to talk about is fasting. When you fast,
- **[12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ac1rrcr6xhY&t=768s)** — especially periodic prolonged fasting, you increase your own body's network of antioxidants.
- **[12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ac1rrcr6xhY&t=777s)** — You strengthen and turn on the genes that help you detoxify. Your liver starts increasing its
- **[13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ac1rrcr6xhY&t=786s)** — capacity to get rid of poisons. You go through what's called autophagy, which is
- **[13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ac1rrcr6xhY&t=792s)** — the recycling of old damaged proteins and getting rid of pathogens, strengthening the
- **[13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ac1rrcr6xhY&t=798s)** — systems that help keep you clean. I had this really bizarre thought. I would love to go into
- **[13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ac1rrcr6xhY&t=805s)** — nursing homes and just replace their food, just to see what would happen to the health
- **[13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ac1rrcr6xhY&t=810s)** — of these elderly people. I think the need for medications would go way down and it would
- **[13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ac1rrcr6xhY&t=818s)** — probably just be miraculous. But unfortunately, I just found something out that's pretty
- **[13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ac1rrcr6xhY&t=822s)** — depressing that there's certain regulations about people in nursing homes. And I think
- **[13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ac1rrcr6xhY&t=827s)** — even hospitals that they have to eat every 14 hours and they have to have these certain
- **[13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ac1rrcr6xhY&t=833s)** — foods, which I'm looking at being not very, very healthy. So I think it'd be very difficult,
- **[13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ac1rrcr6xhY&t=839s)** — unfortunately, to put them on some type of intermittent fasting program, which is exactly
- **[14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ac1rrcr6xhY&t=843s)** — what they need and actually have them eat food that came from the farm. That would be just
- **[14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ac1rrcr6xhY&t=848s)** — awesome. But if you have the ability to do intermittent fasting, do it. It's going to help
- **[14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ac1rrcr6xhY&t=852s)** — you. And the last point about toxins is exercise and sweating. Very important. When you
- **[14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ac1rrcr6xhY&t=859s)** — exercise, you stimulate genes that help you detoxify. But if you over train, you're going to
- **[14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ac1rrcr6xhY&t=866s)** — really shut down the systems to get rid of toxins. Because think about it, when you
- **[14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ac1rrcr6xhY&t=869s)** — exercise, you're generating a lot of free radical damage and oxidation from just the
- **[14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ac1rrcr6xhY&t=877s)** — metabolism of pushing yourself. So that requires a strong, robust antioxidant system. There are
- **[14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ac1rrcr6xhY&t=883s)** — like grapefruit and grapefruit juice and St. John's wort that inhibit that detoxification
- **[14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ac1rrcr6xhY&t=892s)** — system in the pedocyte. So this is why if someone's taking a drug or a medication and
- **[14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ac1rrcr6xhY&t=897s)** — they're taking grapefruit juice at the same time, they're going to retain these chemicals
- **[15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ac1rrcr6xhY&t=901s)** — in their body. And I'm not telling you not to consume them. I'm just telling you that
- **[15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ac1rrcr6xhY&t=906s)** — they do tend to slow down the elimination of poisons. There's a very interesting video
- **[15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ac1rrcr6xhY&t=912s)** — on a vitamin deficiency that can greatly influence your ability to detoxify.
- **[15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ac1rrcr6xhY&t=920s)** — And I put that video up right here. Check it out.

- **[00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPDHHIgcwlU&t=0s)** — Let's talk about the four ways to speed up the growth of muscle. Now you have about 650 muscles
- **[00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPDHHIgcwlU&t=6s)** — in your body and I'm talking mainly the skeletal muscles, not into the other muscles. But the
- **[00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPDHHIgcwlU&t=11s)** — purpose of muscle is to create movement, to help you with posture, to help you even with your
- **[00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPDHHIgcwlU&t=17s)** — metabolism. If you don't have enough muscle mass, let's say you're getting older and you lose
- **[00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPDHHIgcwlU&t=22s)** — your muscle, you lose your metabolism too. So you have a lot of mitochondria that helps you
- **[00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPDHHIgcwlU&t=27s)** — burn fat in your muscle. And then also muscle helps pump the lymphatic system. And so if you
- **[00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPDHHIgcwlU&t=33s)** — don't move a lot, you're not going to pump your limp through your body. Now there are two
- **[00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPDHHIgcwlU&t=37s)** — not surprising ways to increase muscle growth. You already know this. High intensity exercise
- **[00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPDHHIgcwlU&t=43s)** — and the consumption of protein. You're not going to grow muscles on a vegan burger, okay,
- **[00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPDHHIgcwlU&t=48s)** — or a plant-based burger. It's not going to happen. You need the best source of protein and
- **[00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPDHHIgcwlU&t=53s)** — that would be animal protein. Steak and eggs are at the top of the list. Now how much protein
- **[00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPDHHIgcwlU&t=58s)** — you need? Anywhere between 0.8 to 1.5 grams of protein per kilogram of weight. Now what I mean
- **[01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPDHHIgcwlU&t=69s)** — by kilogram of weight, I'm talking about of your kilogram of lean body muscle weight. So if
- **[01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPDHHIgcwlU&t=75s)** — you're a really big person and you have a lot of fat, you got to do this calculation on
- **[01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPDHHIgcwlU&t=80s)** — lean body mass. And I will put a link down below to kind of help you figure out that calculation.
- **[01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPDHHIgcwlU&t=86s)** — Now if you're not into kilograms, you're into more in pounds. There's a different formula
- **[01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPDHHIgcwlU&t=90s)** — for that. I'm going to put that down below. When you're talking about grams of protein,
- **[01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPDHHIgcwlU&t=95s)** — we're not talking about the actual weight of a steak, for example, we're talking about the
- **[01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPDHHIgcwlU&t=100s)** — protein in that steak. Let's say for example, if we talk about pounds, right? And you weigh
- **[01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPDHHIgcwlU&t=109s)** — about 185 pounds and that's how much lean body mass you have. That would come out to about 84
- **[01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPDHHIgcwlU&t=115s)** — kilograms. Okay, if we do the calculation on 0.8 grams, I would just times that times 84 and
- **[02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPDHHIgcwlU&t=123s)** — that comes out to 67 grams. And then if we look at the high range 1.5 grams and we do
- **[02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPDHHIgcwlU&t=129s)** — that calculation, we're talking between 67 grams of protein to 126 grams of protein.
- **[02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPDHHIgcwlU&t=136s)** — So what would determine if you're on the low end or the high end? Your age, how active you
- **[02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPDHHIgcwlU&t=141s)** — are, how much exercise you do, and the strength of your digestive system. Like if
- **[02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPDHHIgcwlU&t=146s)** — you're 95 years old, you're probably not going to do the top highest amount of protein
- **[02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPDHHIgcwlU&t=151s)** — versus if you were an athlete at 20 years old. And some people might even need to go up to 2
- **[02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPDHHIgcwlU&t=156s)** — grams of protein per kilogram of lean body mass. Now let's get into the surprising things
- **[02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPDHHIgcwlU&t=162s)** — that can increase the speed of muscle growth. First thing on the list is creatine, right? And
- **[02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPDHHIgcwlU&t=168s)** — by the way, creatine is in foods, especially meat. But if we want to speed up the growth of
- **[02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPDHHIgcwlU&t=175s)** — muscle, we want to take it as a supplement. It's not necessarily creating muscle itself,
- **[03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPDHHIgcwlU&t=181s)** — but indirectly it is. Because creatine is kind of like a buffer or a substitute for energy,
- **[03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPDHHIgcwlU&t=188s)** — especially the initial high intensity exercise with short duration. Even before glucose is made,
- **[03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPDHHIgcwlU&t=197s)** — you use a type of creatine. And that's used as energy to allow you to recycle or recover
- **[03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPDHHIgcwlU&t=203s)** — this ATP. And what's unique about that is when you exercise high intensity, short duration,
- **[03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPDHHIgcwlU&t=210s)** — that is what increases the muscle growth. And so creatine allows you to do that. If you don't
- **[03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPDHHIgcwlU&t=216s)** — have enough creatine, you're not going to have the energy to work out like that, number one.
- **[03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPDHHIgcwlU&t=220s)** — And the energy that's supplying the system actually can help you grow this muscle. It allows
- **[03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPDHHIgcwlU&t=224s)** — you to do more work. I mean, if you're going to go work out and build muscles,
- **[03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPDHHIgcwlU&t=229s)** — and you're tired and you don't have enough energy, it's probably not going to happen.
- **[03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPDHHIgcwlU&t=233s)** — Now, as far as how much creatine you need, if you're really serious about building muscles,
- **[03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPDHHIgcwlU&t=237s)** — I would use 20 grams for about five days, and then go down to like a maintenance dosage
- **[04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPDHHIgcwlU&t=245s)** — of three grams for the rest of the month. And then you would cycle to a higher amount,
- **[04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPDHHIgcwlU&t=251s)** — 20 grams for five days, and then cycle back to your smaller maintenance amount. Number two,
- **[04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPDHHIgcwlU&t=258s)** — cold therapy. Now you can do cold showers, cold immersion, cryotherapy. There's a lot of
- **[04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPDHHIgcwlU&t=264s)** — versions of this. When you're in the cold, the body has to do something very, very unique.
- **[04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPDHHIgcwlU&t=270s)** — It has to maintain the core temperature. So it has to generate a tremendous amount of energy
- **[04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPDHHIgcwlU&t=276s)** — to do that. So to do that, you're going to generate this type of brown fat, which then
- **[04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPDHHIgcwlU&t=281s)** — will stimulate the white fat, and you're going to burn a lot of calories. And so the
- **[04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPDHHIgcwlU&t=286s)** — of burning more calories, burning more fat, and the cold therapy, both in rats and humans,
- **[04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPDHHIgcwlU&t=295s)** — increases the expression of the muscle genes, certain genes in your muscles that help the
- **[05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPDHHIgcwlU&t=303s)** — growth of muscle, as well as something called the RNA, which is kind of like the protein
- **[05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPDHHIgcwlU&t=309s)** — factory that makes different proteins. Cold therapy increases that. Cold therapy also
- **[05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPDHHIgcwlU&t=316s)** — decreases inflammation. Now you may have heard studies that show that cold therapy
- **[05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPDHHIgcwlU&t=322s)** — actually does not increase your muscle. It actually will shrink your muscles.
- **[05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPDHHIgcwlU&t=329s)** — That is true initially, but in the recovery phase, it will increase the muscle size. It's
- **[05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPDHHIgcwlU&t=339s)** — stressed in the body to create some cool changes. All right, number three,
- **[05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPDHHIgcwlU&t=344s)** — intermittent fasting. There's one school of thought that if you're not eating,
- **[05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPDHHIgcwlU&t=348s)** — your muscles are going to waste away. But what happens when you do intermittent fasting,
- **[05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPDHHIgcwlU&t=352s)** — you stimulate growth hormone, you stimulate all sorts of things that indirectly can
- **[05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPDHHIgcwlU&t=358s)** — potentially increase muscle through the hormone growth hormone. Here's the catch 22.
- **[06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPDHHIgcwlU&t=364s)** — You're probably not going to grow any muscles if you're doing any type of prolonged fasting.
- **[06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPDHHIgcwlU&t=369s)** — I'm talking about just doing intermittent fasting like two meals a day, not cutting your calories
- **[06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPDHHIgcwlU&t=375s)** — down, just not having the snacks. Because intermittent fasting will also make insulin
- **[06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPDHHIgcwlU&t=380s)** — more sensitive. So by fixing insulin resistance, you can actually get more insulin to the
- **[06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPDHHIgcwlU&t=385s)** — muscle because the snacking just kills this whole process. Here's another catch 22.
- **[06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPDHHIgcwlU&t=392s)** — You got to be somewhat healthy to do fasting. I mean, if you take a really sick person and
- **[06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPDHHIgcwlU&t=399s)** — you start to put them on this stress of fasting, it might not be the best thing
- **[06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPDHHIgcwlU&t=405s)** — to start them out on. I'm talking about a person who is not sickly, who has somewhat
- **[06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPDHHIgcwlU&t=411s)** — of a good health and that can do this correctly and also combine at the same time
- **[06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPDHHIgcwlU&t=417s)** — the exercise because they have the energy to do it. Number four, arginine. And it can significantly
- **[07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPDHHIgcwlU&t=423s)** — help you increase growth hormone by inhibiting another hormone called somatostatin. So arginine
- **[07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPDHHIgcwlU&t=430s)** — kind of takes the breaks off of growth hormone. They've even given children that are
- **[07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPDHHIgcwlU&t=434s)** — a bit shorter than they should be about 2.2 grams of arginine. And notice that they actually
- **[07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPDHHIgcwlU&t=440s)** — grew taller. But arginine is another surprising way to enhance the growth of muscle. But what
- **[07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPDHHIgcwlU&t=446s)** — you want to do is you want to take a bit higher amounts, between three to six grams per day on an

- **[00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xs1i6QzoB6o&t=0s)** — There are five foods that you need to know about to improve your sleep quality.
- **[00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xs1i6QzoB6o&t=4s)** — This is one of those videos that you want to save and keep watching over and over just
- **[00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xs1i6QzoB6o&t=8s)** — to remind yourself of these key things to help you sleep.
- **[00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xs1i6QzoB6o&t=11s)** — I personally had a sleep problem extremely bad for well over a decade and I wish I
- **[00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xs1i6QzoB6o&t=17s)** — would have known what I'm going to tell you right now.
- **[00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xs1i6QzoB6o&t=19s)** — The big thing about sleep is to optimize a hormone called melatonin. Melatonin is
- **[00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xs1i6QzoB6o&t=24s)** — a hormone that helps you go to sleep and get into some of these deep restful waves
- **[00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xs1i6QzoB6o&t=29s)** — of sleep. More importantly than boosting melatonin, it's important to know how to
- **[00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xs1i6QzoB6o&t=34s)** — avoid things that reduce your melatonin.
- **[00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xs1i6QzoB6o&t=37s)** — The first thing has to do with your temperature in your room.
- **[00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xs1i6QzoB6o&t=40s)** — If you're going to bed and your temperature is 75 degrees Fahrenheit or warmer,
- **[00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xs1i6QzoB6o&t=47s)** — you're going to have a significantly lowered melatonin level as well as a lowered REM level.
- **[00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xs1i6QzoB6o&t=53s)** — The quality of sleep is going to be really crappy.
- **[00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xs1i6QzoB6o&t=56s)** — The best temperature to optimize melatonin between 60 and 69 degrees Fahrenheit with
- **[01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xs1i6QzoB6o&t=63s)** — the optimum perfect number at 65 degrees Fahrenheit.
- **[01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xs1i6QzoB6o&t=67s)** — If your room is at that temperature, your melatonin will be optimized.
- **[01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xs1i6QzoB6o&t=71s)** — Even your body's core temperature, which should be 98.6 between 12 o'clock and 5 o'clock,
- **[01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xs1i6QzoB6o&t=78s)** — your core temperature goes down between 1 and 2 degrees.
- **[01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xs1i6QzoB6o&t=82s)** — People that have insomnia don't have that mechanism where their body gets cooler by
- **[01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xs1i6QzoB6o&t=89s)** — 1 to 2 degrees. A lot of you watching are doing intermittent fasting.
- **[01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xs1i6QzoB6o&t=92s)** — And you probably watched my videos in the past where I told you to get up in the
- **[01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xs1i6QzoB6o&t=96s)** — morning, skip your breakfast, have your first meal at 12 and your last meal at
- **[01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xs1i6QzoB6o&t=101s)** — 6. But here's my conclusion on that. I think initially it's very good to do that,
- **[01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xs1i6QzoB6o&t=105s)** — especially if you're trying to lose weight and you're trying to correct insulin resistance
- **[01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xs1i6QzoB6o&t=108s)** — because here you are, you fasted all night, might as well ride the wave, go as long
- **[01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xs1i6QzoB6o&t=113s)** — as you can, and then have your first meal. But after you do it for a period of time,
- **[01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xs1i6QzoB6o&t=117s)** — let's say you do this for over a year or even six months and you kind of correct
- **[02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xs1i6QzoB6o&t=121s)** — this insulin resistance, you may want to experiment to have your first meal in the
- **[02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xs1i6QzoB6o&t=126s)** — morning and your second meal at lunch and maybe not even have a dinner because
- **[02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xs1i6QzoB6o&t=131s)** — one thing that will disrupt your sleep is sleeping on a very large meal.
- **[02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xs1i6QzoB6o&t=136s)** — What I've been doing recently and it seems to work really good is to have the two meals in
- **[02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xs1i6QzoB6o&t=142s)** — the first part of the day. This also gives you a little more energy through the day,
- **[02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xs1i6QzoB6o&t=147s)** — not at night. So why would you want to have a large meal in the evening,
- **[02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xs1i6QzoB6o&t=151s)** — which you're just going to sleep on. This next point has to do with blue light. If we
- **[02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xs1i6QzoB6o&t=156s)** — look at the spectrum of light, part of that spectrum is the blue light. That is the wave
- **[02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xs1i6QzoB6o&t=162s)** — to filter out in the evening. Why? Because blue light inhibits or suppresses that sleep hormone
- **[02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xs1i6QzoB6o&t=170s)** — melatonin that helps you go to sleep. Probably the worst is the flipping through the social
- **[02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xs1i6QzoB6o&t=176s)** — media on your cell phone before you go to bed. There is a big difference between the TV
- **[03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xs1i6QzoB6o&t=181s)** — blue light and close-up cell phone blue light. The blue light in your cell phone is much
- **[03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xs1i6QzoB6o&t=188s)** — stronger. So if you are going to watch TV at night, that's fine. But just turn the lights out
- **[03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xs1i6QzoB6o&t=193s)** — around the TV so you can darken things. And if you have to be in your cell phone,
- **[03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xs1i6QzoB6o&t=197s)** — you can wear these blue light filtered glasses. You have to realize that blue light not only
- **[03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xs1i6QzoB6o&t=202s)** — affects melatonin, it kind of wakes you up. And blue light also messes with your eyes.
- **[03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xs1i6QzoB6o&t=207s)** — It can create damage in the eyes. So just be aware of blue light, turn the lights down a
- **[03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xs1i6QzoB6o&t=213s)** — little bit. It gets later in the day. Another way to build up your melatonin is through
- **[03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xs1i6QzoB6o&t=218s)** — exposing yourself to the actual sun during the day. The vitamin D from the sun can also help
- **[03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xs1i6QzoB6o&t=225s)** — indirectly increase your melatonin and your sleep cycles. But I tell you, if you have
- **[03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xs1i6QzoB6o&t=230s)** — sleep apnea or you have jet lag or you're on rotational shifts, you should be consuming
- **[03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xs1i6QzoB6o&t=236s)** — vitamin D as well because vitamin D is really important in kind of reestablishing those
- **[04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xs1i6QzoB6o&t=242s)** — circadian waves. Now there's one more point about cell phones. There's something called EMF,
- **[04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xs1i6QzoB6o&t=247s)** — electromagnetic fields that come off this. It's like invisible radiation. Just as a very side
- **[04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xs1i6QzoB6o&t=252s)** — note, I will do a full video on this, but this is the device that I use. It's the trifield.
- **[04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xs1i6QzoB6o&t=257s)** — So you can turn this on and start testing the exposure to various
- **[04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xs1i6QzoB6o&t=263s)** — things to see what is giving you all these EMF waves that could greatly inhibit your sleep.
- **[04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xs1i6QzoB6o&t=269s)** — I have tested my entire house. I go through the computer. I go through the area where I'm
- **[04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xs1i6QzoB6o&t=275s)** — sleeping, the walls that are close to my bed to make sure there was no extra frequencies
- **[04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xs1i6QzoB6o&t=281s)** — that were affecting me. And I found several areas that were really messing me up.
- **[04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xs1i6QzoB6o&t=286s)** — And one was just in the back wall where my head was and the headboard,
- **[04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xs1i6QzoB6o&t=290s)** — the wires were crossed. So I had an electrician come in there and fix that.
- **[04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xs1i6QzoB6o&t=294s)** — And that created a huge improvement in my arrhythmias that I had. I started getting
- **[05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xs1i6QzoB6o&t=300s)** — palpitations in my heart. And I felt like when I went to sleep, it was like my heart was like
- **[05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xs1i6QzoB6o&t=305s)** — working harder. And it was those EMF waves. Amazing. There's a few more things that inhibit
- **[05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xs1i6QzoB6o&t=311s)** — melatonin. Alcohol, caffeine, nicotine, medications, especially the antidepressants.
- **[05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xs1i6QzoB6o&t=318s)** — And also a high carb diet will inhibit the melatonin. And if you exercise like three
- **[05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xs1i6QzoB6o&t=324s)** — hours before you go to sleep. Now let's get to the five foods that can help you increase
- **[05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xs1i6QzoB6o&t=329s)** — melatonin. The first food we're going to talk about is tart cherries. Now there's two different
- **[05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xs1i6QzoB6o&t=335s)** — studies that I looked at. One was tart cherry juice, like one ounce before bed. And the
- **[05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xs1i6QzoB6o&t=341s)** — other one was just consuming tart cherries twice a day. Tart cherries, there actually is
- **[05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xs1i6QzoB6o&t=346s)** — melatonin in there. There's also something called tryptophan. Tryptophan turns into
- **[05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xs1i6QzoB6o&t=352s)** — which then turns into melatonin. Apparently giving some people 84 more minutes of sleep
- **[05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xs1i6QzoB6o&t=359s)** — in a study that was done with people over age 50. Number two is kiwis. Consuming two kiwis a day
- **[06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xs1i6QzoB6o&t=367s)** — actually increase serotonin. That's that precursor to melatonin. After four weeks of
- **[06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xs1i6QzoB6o&t=373s)** — consuming kiwis, there was a significant improvement in quality of sleep, length of
- **[06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xs1i6QzoB6o&t=379s)** — waking up feeling refreshed, and speed of going to sleep. Number three fatty fish like salmon,
- **[06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xs1i6QzoB6o&t=386s)** — tuna, and trout. All three of these can help increase melatonin. Number four kefir. Kefir
- **[06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xs1i6QzoB6o&t=393s)** — is like yogurt but it has even more microbes. It survives the stomach acids much better. And
- **[06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xs1i6QzoB6o&t=400s)** — don't get the flavored one. Get the unflavored whole milk grass-fed. Whether you do you know
- **[06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xs1i6QzoB6o&t=406s)** — goats milk, sheep milk. So you want to get the kefir and you can blend that with things
- **[06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xs1i6QzoB6o&t=412s)** — rich in polyphenols like berries. I like the blueberry. Sometimes I'll do raspberry or blackberry.
- **[06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xs1i6QzoB6o&t=419s)** — And when you drink it, you're feeding your microbiome polyphenols which they're going to
- **[07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xs1i6QzoB6o&t=424s)** — thank you for by helping you sleep. The last food that I'm going to recommend is sauerkraut.
- **[07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xs1i6QzoB6o&t=429s)** — Now the microbes in raw sauerkraut can help you sleep greatly. The cabbage also has tryptophan.
- **[07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xs1i6QzoB6o&t=436s)** — It has things to help your gut. It also increases something called GABA. GABA is a kind of a
- **[07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xs1i6QzoB6o&t=443s)** — neurotransmitter that calms you down. It's going to help you sleep. And as we age our GABA goes
- **[07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xs1i6QzoB6o&t=449s)** — down. Sauerkraut has certain properties to help you reduce stress and cortisol. Sauerkraut
- **[07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xs1i6QzoB6o&t=454s)** — also has vitamin C that's been associated with better sleep. And lastly, don't forget about
- **[07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xs1i6QzoB6o&t=460s)** — your breathing while you're sleeping. Breathe in slowly and breathe out slowly through your
- **[07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xs1i6QzoB6o&t=466s)** — nose. So just by focusing on the breathing can kind of pull you out of this sympathetic
- **[07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xs1i6QzoB6o&t=471s)** — stress state. So I have videos on that as well. In fact, that might be a really good
- **[07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xs1i6QzoB6o&t=476s)** — one to watch right now. I'll put it up right here. Check it out.

- **[00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5wXcNJWrsmQ&t=0s)** — Now, there's a very specific reason why fasting helps you to live longer. It activates a whole bunch of genes that are longevity genes.
- **[00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5wXcNJWrsmQ&t=11s)** — They reduce inflammation. If someone is a diabetic or a pre-diabetic, they're much improved.
- **[00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5wXcNJWrsmQ&t=17s)** — And there are even genes that protect the cells against disease.
- **[00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5wXcNJWrsmQ&t=22s)** — There are six things that can destroy your results, okay? And you need to know about these.
- **[00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5wXcNJWrsmQ&t=27s)** — Number one, doing fasting for too long. So there's two types of fasting. You have intermittent fasting, and then you have prolonged fasting, where you're doing fasting for a period of time.
- **[00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5wXcNJWrsmQ&t=41s)** — Sometimes people are gung-ho and they push it. They do the same pattern for so long. Let's say even they're doing one meal a day, right?
- **[00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5wXcNJWrsmQ&t=49s)** — But they don't feel really good. And they notice that they might be losing some muscle from that.
- **[00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5wXcNJWrsmQ&t=55s)** — Anytime you feel like crap when you're doing a fast, that pattern is not right for you. So you really have to build up to a prolonged fast. You can't just jump in unless you're pretty healthy.
- **[01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5wXcNJWrsmQ&t=66s)** — Now, as far as doing a one meal a day fast versus a two meal a day, that really also depends on how you feel.
- **[01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5wXcNJWrsmQ&t=74s)** — Number two, dietary protein. Both the amount of dietary protein and the type of dietary protein are very important.
- **[01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5wXcNJWrsmQ&t=84s)** — I would not recommend getting your protein from a plant source. I would recommend getting it from animal protein. That is the best protein that you can consume.
- **[01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5wXcNJWrsmQ&t=94s)** — And out of all the proteins you can consume, red meat is at the top of the list. Then we get eggs. Then we get lamb. Then we get fish or seafood.
- **[01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5wXcNJWrsmQ&t=105s)** — Organic pasture raised chickens are one of the best sources of protein unless if it's not organic or it's commercial chicken. And those are high in omega-6.
- **[01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5wXcNJWrsmQ&t=113s)** — Now, as far as the amount of protein, I'm going to recommend that each of those meals you have between seven and eight ounces of protein.
- **[02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5wXcNJWrsmQ&t=123s)** — Now, if you're doing a one meal a day, this is more difficult. You're going to have to do like 10 ounces.
- **[02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5wXcNJWrsmQ&t=129s)** — But realize when you do go down the one meal a day, your body becomes more efficient and the requirement for protein does go down.
- **[02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5wXcNJWrsmQ&t=137s)** — And there's all sorts of protective mechanisms that kick in that prevent muscle loss and also increase growth hormone.
- **[02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5wXcNJWrsmQ&t=145s)** — I know some people, if they don't get enough protein, they feel weaker. So you might want to just experiment with that.
- **[02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5wXcNJWrsmQ&t=150s)** — And then if you had too much protein, that can actually keep you up at night. All right.
- **[02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5wXcNJWrsmQ&t=154s)** — The third mistake, there's one raw material that you need to know about as well.
- **[02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5wXcNJWrsmQ&t=158s)** — Cholesterol. Cholesterol is needed to make all the sex hormones.
- **[02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5wXcNJWrsmQ&t=162s)** — And you might also think that I can eat red meat, butter or lard, and I can get my cholesterol that way.
- **[02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5wXcNJWrsmQ&t=169s)** — But all of those are low in cholesterol. It's like between one and two percent.
- **[02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5wXcNJWrsmQ&t=174s)** — What is high in cholesterol is egg yolks, liver and shellfish.
- **[03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5wXcNJWrsmQ&t=181s)** — Very great for cholesterol. And we need the nutrients that also help make these hormones.
- **[03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5wXcNJWrsmQ&t=186s)** — Zinc is at the top of the list. It's a trace mineral. Vitamin D in high enough amounts is very important.
- **[03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5wXcNJWrsmQ&t=193s)** — Magnesium is very important. But the one that you don't need is a lot of calcium.
- **[03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5wXcNJWrsmQ&t=197s)** — The next mistake, number four, is to force a certain pattern of intermittent fasting that might not align with your body.
- **[03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5wXcNJWrsmQ&t=207s)** — The best way to figure out what type of fasting pattern you need is to let your body tell you.
- **[03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5wXcNJWrsmQ&t=214s)** — Let's say you start by skipping your meal, right?
- **[03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5wXcNJWrsmQ&t=217s)** — And then you have lunch as your first meal and dinner as your second meal.
- **[03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5wXcNJWrsmQ&t=220s)** — And you do that for a while to the point where you're able to find that you're not hungry at lunch.
- **[03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5wXcNJWrsmQ&t=226s)** — So you push it further and further forward to the point where you're eating at two o'clock or even three o'clock.
- **[03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5wXcNJWrsmQ&t=234s)** — So we're shortening this pattern so you have more hours of fasting.
- **[03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5wXcNJWrsmQ&t=239s)** — Let's say you never really get to a point where you can do one meal a day. That's totally fine.
- **[04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5wXcNJWrsmQ&t=243s)** — Because you're letting your body tell you when to fast.
- **[04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5wXcNJWrsmQ&t=246s)** — And so some people can fast very long and feel great at it, but other people can't.
- **[04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5wXcNJWrsmQ&t=251s)** — Let your body tell you how long to fast.
- **[04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5wXcNJWrsmQ&t=254s)** — Next mistake is too much exercise, especially when you're fasting.
- **[04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5wXcNJWrsmQ&t=259s)** — Some people can't handle a lot of exercise when they're fasting. They should be resting.
- **[04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5wXcNJWrsmQ&t=263s)** — Too much exercise is going to create too much stress.
- **[04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5wXcNJWrsmQ&t=266s)** — And then what's going to happen, you're not going to recover as well.
- **[04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5wXcNJWrsmQ&t=269s)** — So then we're going to lose more muscle because the exercise is a stress and the recovery is where all the magic happens.
- **[04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5wXcNJWrsmQ&t=276s)** — And the last mistake is not getting enough sleep.
- **[04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5wXcNJWrsmQ&t=280s)** — Most of the repair happens while you're sleeping.

- **[00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QTlp6VTu4S8&t=0s)** — Let's talk about the early warning signs of colon cancer you absolutely do not want to ignore.
- **[00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QTlp6VTu4S8&t=5s)** — So when I give you these six warning signs, just realize these are indicators. They're not
- **[00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QTlp6VTu4S8&t=10s)** — meant to diagnose you. Indicators are symptoms that there is a situation, but it doesn't tell
- **[00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QTlp6VTu4S8&t=17s)** — you what it is unless you look at all the information. But here's the thing, 50% of the
- **[00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QTlp6VTu4S8&t=21s)** — time there is no early warning signs. So it is important not to ignore these signs but to
- **[00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QTlp6VTu4S8&t=28s)** — understand them and pay attention to them. Now I do want to mention polyps, the little mini tumors
- **[00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QTlp6VTu4S8&t=34s)** — that can grow in your colon. And a lot of times people think that if you have polyps that means
- **[00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QTlp6VTu4S8&t=41s)** — you have cancer. No, it could be a benign little tiny tumor that does not grow, does not turn
- **[00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QTlp6VTu4S8&t=48s)** — into cancer. In fact, 80% of the time there's only a very very tiny risk between 0% to 2%
- **[00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QTlp6VTu4S8&t=56s)** — getting cancer. There are various risk factors that people talk about, you know, like smoking
- **[01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QTlp6VTu4S8&t=61s)** — and drinking and junk food and obesity and H. pylori. That's a microbe that tends to live in
- **[01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QTlp6VTu4S8&t=68s)** — the stomach but it can travel different places. And then there's this topic of red meat or
- **[01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QTlp6VTu4S8&t=74s)** — processed meat that you may have heard of. They always tend to talk about that. There was a group
- **[01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QTlp6VTu4S8&t=78s)** — that concluded that it's a probable carcinogen, okay, but the data and the evidence is pretty
- **[01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QTlp6VTu4S8&t=86s)** — weak. Especially since this new report came out in JAMA which was a bigger evaluation of the
- **[01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QTlp6VTu4S8&t=93s)** — data on red meat and processed meat. And they found out if you actually include carbohydrates
- **[01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QTlp6VTu4S8&t=99s)** — into the equation there's no association between red meat or even processed meat and
- **[01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QTlp6VTu4S8&t=105s)** — cancer. And I'm going to put that link down below. I hope you read it because there's been
- **[01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QTlp6VTu4S8&t=109s)** — this massive push to make meat the villain when in fact that may not be true. There's a huge
- **[01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QTlp6VTu4S8&t=115s)** — difference between different types of red meat, right? You have grass-fed grass-finished meat
- **[02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QTlp6VTu4S8&t=122s)** — versus grain-fed meat. Did they evaluate those two? No. They lumped everything in together
- **[02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QTlp6VTu4S8&t=128s)** — and their evidence was based on observational studies using questionnaires. And they ignored
- **[02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QTlp6VTu4S8&t=133s)** — a lot of the data into this evaluation. And from my viewpoint, my opinion, I do not think that
- **[02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QTlp6VTu4S8&t=140s)** — red meat puts people at risk for cancer. Now what about genetics? Well, yeah, there's a
- **[02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QTlp6VTu4S8&t=146s)** — genetic component but it's only five percent. Epigenetics, your lifestyle, are senior and
- **[02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QTlp6VTu4S8&t=151s)** — what you do, what you eat, your environment can control your genes. And then that leads
- **[02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QTlp6VTu4S8&t=157s)** — to this microbiome being out of balance. 80 percent of your immune system is these microbes
- **[02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QTlp6VTu4S8&t=164s)** — in your gut. Your immune system is what protects you against cancer. I mean, look at another
- **[02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QTlp6VTu4S8&t=168s)** — thing, antibiotics. In one report, it was like it increased your risk by 45 percent. So anything
- **[02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QTlp6VTu4S8&t=174s)** — that can alter your microbiome in a negative way can put you at risk. So you want to look at
- **[02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QTlp6VTu4S8&t=178s)** — what causes inflammation in our gut, right? What can that be? Well, you have gluten, you have
- **[03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QTlp6VTu4S8&t=183s)** — foods, seed oils, all these things can create inflammation in your gut and then that can create
- **[03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QTlp6VTu4S8&t=189s)** — a cascade and create alteration in this microbiome. But the microbiome can keep
- **[03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QTlp6VTu4S8&t=194s)** — viruses in check. So, and I'm going to get to this, but when you eat food, you're really
- **[03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QTlp6VTu4S8&t=199s)** — eating for two, okay? Your own cells and your microbiome. Okay, so what are the early warning
- **[03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QTlp6VTu4S8&t=206s)** — signs that could potentially indicate colon cancer? Number one, blood in the stool.
- **[03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QTlp6VTu4S8&t=212s)** — Okay, that's number one. But if there's blood in the stool deeper in your digestive tract,
- **[03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QTlp6VTu4S8&t=218s)** — by the time it gets out, it's no longer going to be red. It'll be black. Number two, anemia.
- **[03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QTlp6VTu4S8&t=223s)** — Okay, you're anemic, yet there's no reason to be anemic. That could be a potential indicator.
- **[03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QTlp6VTu4S8&t=229s)** — Number three, the shape of the stool is thinner because there's obviously some cancer
- **[03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QTlp6VTu4S8&t=236s)** — obstructing the colon, altering the shape of your stool. Number four, you have constipation
- **[04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QTlp6VTu4S8&t=242s)** — that seems to be getting worse. Why would that be? Because there's an obstruction in your colon.
- **[04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QTlp6VTu4S8&t=248s)** — Number five, abdominal pain. Why would you have that? Well, because there's a certain mass
- **[04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QTlp6VTu4S8&t=253s)** — that's growing in your colon and it's pushing on nerve endings. Number six, a sudden cause
- **[04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QTlp6VTu4S8&t=258s)** — of weight loss or a loss of appetite. So again, these six indicators or clues are just
- **[04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QTlp6VTu4S8&t=266s)** — indicators. That doesn't mean you have a problem and you don't want to treat them as a problem.
- **[04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QTlp6VTu4S8&t=272s)** — You want to find out what's behind the problem. You know, the doctor comes in with authority
- **[04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QTlp6VTu4S8&t=277s)** — and says, you have this period of time to live. And it's interesting how people tend to
- **[04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QTlp6VTu4S8&t=285s)** — live that particular time. You're in a state of confusion. Everyone's telling you to do this
- **[04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QTlp6VTu4S8&t=290s)** — and what do you do? Especially based on this particular person who should have been dead
- **[04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QTlp6VTu4S8&t=298s)** — six years ago because he had a stage four cancer. And the prognosis of stage four cancer is like
- **[05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QTlp6VTu4S8&t=303s)** — weeks to months. He should have been dead six years ago. He's still alive.
- **[05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QTlp6VTu4S8&t=307s)** — And it'd be very important to study what he did. But we're going to talk about how to
- **[05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QTlp6VTu4S8&t=311s)** — potentially avoid cancer. Okay. What are some things you can do? As far as antibiotics,
- **[05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QTlp6VTu4S8&t=316s)** — avoid those if you possibly can. And if you have to take antibiotics, definitely fortify with a
- **[05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QTlp6VTu4S8&t=323s)** — good probiotic. I think intermittent fasting and periodic prolonged fasting is essential.
- **[05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QTlp6VTu4S8&t=329s)** — Why? Because it's going to clear out the colon. You allow your colon to have a chance
- **[05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QTlp6VTu4S8&t=333s)** — to regenerate, heal, and not be so stressed 24-7. I think the cruciferous
- **[05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QTlp6VTu4S8&t=338s)** — vegetables would be something to look at and consume not every day, but maybe a few times
- **[05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QTlp6VTu4S8&t=344s)** — That would be like kale, broccoli, Brussels sprouts, cabbage. Now, if I eat broccoli,
- **[05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QTlp6VTu4S8&t=349s)** — it tears my gut up. So any of these cruciferous vegetables that you eat that you bloat,
- **[05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QTlp6VTu4S8&t=354s)** — don't eat them. I can do cabbage and arugula very easily. And then when you ferment it,
- **[06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QTlp6VTu4S8&t=360s)** — you get all this probiotic. Now, remember when I talked about inactivity? Well, activity as
- **[06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QTlp6VTu4S8&t=366s)** — an exercise is probably one of the most potent things you can do to avoid cancer. Why? Because
- **[06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QTlp6VTu4S8&t=372s)** — you're strengthening your mitochondria and all cancer originates from a dysfunctional
- **[06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QTlp6VTu4S8&t=378s)** — mitochondria. So by exercising, you actually generate more mitochondria and you actually
- **[06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QTlp6VTu4S8&t=384s)** — strengthen the mitochondria. Things like garlic, thyme, sage, different spices,
- **[06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QTlp6VTu4S8&t=391s)** — I think you should start putting those on your meat or your salad. You want to avoid
- **[06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QTlp6VTu4S8&t=395s)** — certain things that create inflammation like gluten and grains and seed oils and junk foods.
- **[06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QTlp6VTu4S8&t=401s)** — And also one point about inflammation is cancer tends to grow into areas of inflammation.
- **[06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QTlp6VTu4S8&t=408s)** — Now, I think there's a lot more to be learned about the microbiome. And if you have not
- **[06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QTlp6VTu4S8&t=413s)** — seen this video right here, I think you'll enjoy it.

- **[00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knY-Foaeqlg&t=0s)** — Let's talk about the seven best foods to prevent and reverse kidney damage.
- **[00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knY-Foaeqlg&t=5s)** — The kidney is a filter. This one on the left is a dirty kidney. This one on the right is a clean
- **[00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knY-Foaeqlg&t=10s)** — kidney. We're going to show you how to go from this to this using foods. I think the biggest
- **[00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knY-Foaeqlg&t=16s)** — myth about the kidney is this topic of potassium. I don't know how this started, but people tend
- **[00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knY-Foaeqlg&t=21s)** — to think that potassium is really bad for the kidney. You have to avoid potassium foods
- **[00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knY-Foaeqlg&t=26s)** — if you want to protect the kidney. That is absolutely not true. Potassium actually protects
- **[00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knY-Foaeqlg&t=32s)** — the kidney from damage. The only time you wouldn't want to take potassium is when you started to get
- **[00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knY-Foaeqlg&t=37s)** — advanced stage kidney disease. You need to consume a lot of potassium since our bodies
- **[00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knY-Foaeqlg&t=42s)** — require 4,700 milligrams a day. A couple ways that the potassium helps the kidney other than
- **[00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knY-Foaeqlg&t=49s)** — directly protecting kidney damage is this. Potassium lowers your blood pressure. And having
- **[00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knY-Foaeqlg&t=55s)** — high blood pressure is one of the main things that destroys the kidney. If you have an imbalance
- **[00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knY-Foaeqlg&t=58s)** — with sodium and you don't have enough potassium, that can also be hard on the kidney. The way to
- **[01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knY-Foaeqlg&t=64s)** — handle the sodium on the kidney is simply to increase your potassium. Potassium can help
- **[01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knY-Foaeqlg&t=68s)** — protect you against kidney stones because it can lower the incidence of oxalates binding with
- **[01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knY-Foaeqlg&t=75s)** — calcium. The real bad things that damage the kidney. Number one, and this is the biggest one,
- **[01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knY-Foaeqlg&t=80s)** — consuming a lot of sugar, starches, things like that. Because all that sugar in your blood
- **[01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knY-Foaeqlg&t=84s)** — ends up in the kidney and it creates a lot of oxidation. And you can visualize that as something
- **[01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knY-Foaeqlg&t=90s)** — that's rusting out the kidney, damaging that little filter. Other things that will destroy
- **[01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knY-Foaeqlg&t=94s)** — the kidney, alcohol, NSAIDs like ibuprofen, medications. A lot of medications are synthetic,
- **[01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knY-Foaeqlg&t=101s)** — prednisone or even antibiotics. Getting too many pesticides from the foods, heavy metals,
- **[01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knY-Foaeqlg&t=107s)** — food dyes, and too much phosphorus from soda. Really damaging to the kidney. Being in
- **[01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knY-Foaeqlg&t=113s)** — a diet with enough vitamin D and potassium and even magnesium can greatly help that. I'm going
- **[01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knY-Foaeqlg&t=119s)** — to show you all the different foods that you should be eating that can help reverse a lot of
- **[02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knY-Foaeqlg&t=124s)** — the things I'm talking about. Number one is really a category of key vegetables that are
- **[02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knY-Foaeqlg&t=128s)** — really important with kidney function. Asparagus. Some people don't like it but if you can consume
- **[02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knY-Foaeqlg&t=134s)** — it, it's really good for the kidney. It has a certain enzyme that helps to detoxify the kidneys.
- **[02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knY-Foaeqlg&t=140s)** — The next vegetable I would recommend is celery. Celery also has things in it to greatly improve
- **[02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knY-Foaeqlg&t=146s)** — kidney function. Bell peppers are loaded with vitamin C and a lot of other good nutrients for
- **[02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knY-Foaeqlg&t=150s)** — the kidney. Cabbage is another really good vegetable for the kidney. Cauliflower is another
- **[02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knY-Foaeqlg&t=155s)** — great vegetable. Garlic is loaded with allicin which is really good for kidney function.
- **[02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knY-Foaeqlg&t=161s)** — There are plenty of other vegetables but these are the ones that are very low in something
- **[02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knY-Foaeqlg&t=165s)** — called oxalates. Spinach is high in oxalates. You can have spinach but I would recommend having
- **[02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knY-Foaeqlg&t=170s)** — it with cheese because those oxalates could irritate the kidney. And the most common kidney
- **[02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knY-Foaeqlg&t=175s)** — stone is calcium oxalate stones. And one great remedy for that is increasing your magnesium.
- **[03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knY-Foaeqlg&t=183s)** — This is number two. Magnesium rich foods. Pumpkin seeds, anything leafy greens, avocados
- **[03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knY-Foaeqlg&t=189s)** — are all high in magnesium. I would, as a side note, also consume magnesium glycinate at least
- **[03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knY-Foaeqlg&t=195s)** — 400 milligrams per day because that magnesium also helps protect the kidney and it does a
- **[03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knY-Foaeqlg&t=200s)** — lot of additional things for the kidney indirectly. Number three. Probiotic foods.
- **[03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knY-Foaeqlg&t=206s)** — Kefir, yogurt, sauerkraut, kimchi. On top of that there are two microbes that have a
- **[03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knY-Foaeqlg&t=219s)** — The first one is lactobacillus casei and bifidobacterium longum. Both of those have
- **[03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knY-Foaeqlg&t=227s)** — been extensively used to help take the stress off the kidney. I would highly recommend them.
- **[03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knY-Foaeqlg&t=231s)** — Number four. Having not just a high quality protein source, also not overdoing it. Adding
- **[03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knY-Foaeqlg&t=237s)** — more protein could stress it a little bit more. If you're seeing excess waste from protein in
- **[04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knY-Foaeqlg&t=243s)** — your blood or your urine, you're consuming too much protein. Cut down the amount of
- **[04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knY-Foaeqlg&t=248s)** — You don't want to go low. You want to go a moderate amount of protein. Maybe you do six to
- **[04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knY-Foaeqlg&t=253s)** — seven ounces per meal. And as far as the source goes, wild caught fish, sardines, and
- **[04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knY-Foaeqlg&t=259s)** — cod liver would also give you the omega-3. That's good for the kidney as well. And then
- **[04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knY-Foaeqlg&t=263s)** — also eggs. Number five. High antioxidant foods. Blueberries, blackberries, raspberries,
- **[04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knY-Foaeqlg&t=269s)** — strawberries, beets are really good for the kidney as well. To counter some of this
- **[04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knY-Foaeqlg&t=274s)** — rusting out effect that happens just having high blood sugar or other things. Number six.
- **[04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knY-Foaeqlg&t=279s)** — Quercetin. Quercetin has some really great properties for the kidney. And the best source
- **[04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knY-Foaeqlg&t=284s)** — of quercetin is white onions, red onions. I consume a lot of onions and you can saute them,
- **[04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knY-Foaeqlg&t=291s)** — eat them raw. Quercetin has an anti-inflammatory effect. It also then will prevent scar tissue
- **[04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knY-Foaeqlg&t=298s)** — in the kidney. It tends to put the fire out if there's oxidative stress. So just cook your
- **[05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knY-Foaeqlg&t=302s)** — onions or add onions to the meal. And number seven. Extra virgin olive oil. When it comes to
- **[05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knY-Foaeqlg&t=309s)** — olive oil, there are certain things in olive oil, certain chemical compounds that are just dynamite
- **[05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knY-Foaeqlg&t=314s)** — for inflammation, kidney support. And it's even good for kidney stones. And I've sampled a lot
- **[05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knY-Foaeqlg&t=321s)** — of different olive oils and there's a lot of good ones out there. And of course, my
- **[05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knY-Foaeqlg&t=324s)** — favorite is the one from Italy. I will put a link down below of the one that I use. It's
- **[05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knY-Foaeqlg&t=328s)** — charts as far as quality. As far as drinking liquid, it's also true if you're consuming
- **[05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knY-Foaeqlg&t=334s)** — too much liquid, that's not good for the kidney because it causes the kidney to work
- **[05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knY-Foaeqlg&t=338s)** — too hard. You need that sweet spot right in the middle. One additional little tip I'm going
- **[05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knY-Foaeqlg&t=342s)** — to recommend when you drink liquid. Pre-make some tea. Keep it in the fridge and consume
- **[05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knY-Foaeqlg&t=348s)** — tea as your main liquid because the polyphenols in tea do a lot for the kidney. These
- **[05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knY-Foaeqlg&t=355s)** — polyphenols also can bind with excessive iron that can damage the kidney. And of course,
- **[06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knY-Foaeqlg&t=361s)** — I'm not just recommending getting the tea that has the most caffeine or any caffeine,
- **[06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knY-Foaeqlg&t=365s)** — but there's a lot of different teas that can help the kidney. Green tea, but if I'm not
- **[06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knY-Foaeqlg&t=368s)** — mistaken, green tea might have caffeine, so you might want to not overdo that one.
- **[06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knY-Foaeqlg&t=372s)** — Nettle tea is a great anti-inflammatory tea. Dandelion tea is really good as well. It'll
- **[06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knY-Foaeqlg&t=378s)** — help act as a diuretic to get rid of excess fluid. Turmeric tea or even a black tea that
- **[06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knY-Foaeqlg&t=383s)** — is naturally decaffeinated. The last point I want to make is think about this. The kidney
- **[06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knY-Foaeqlg&t=387s)** — is a filter of your blood and you're eating food frequently. It is going to overtax the
- **[06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knY-Foaeqlg&t=393s)** — filtration. It's not a bad idea to do intermittent fasting to support the kidney
- **[06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knY-Foaeqlg&t=397s)** — for two reasons. Number one, you can decrease the stress on the kidney by just not forcing it
- **[06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knY-Foaeqlg&t=402s)** — to work so hard. And secondly, intermittent fasting will drop insulin considerably to the
- **[06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knY-Foaeqlg&t=408s)** — point where your kidneys can start to heal because one of the big culprits for damage to your
- **[06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knY-Foaeqlg&t=413s)** — kidney is too much insulin. You definitely want to do a combination of low carb,
- **[06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knY-Foaeqlg&t=418s)** — intermittent fasting with this program. And if you want information on that,
- **[07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knY-Foaeqlg&t=421s)** — you can check out this video on fasting right here.

## Video 10: 7 Fruits That Destroy Cancer

**Watch on YouTube:** [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVgfijICfrI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVgfijICfrI)

## Full Transcript with Timestamps

*Click any timestamp to jump to that moment in the video*

- **[00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVgfijICfrI&t=0s)** — Today we're going to talk about seven fruits that have the potential to kill cancer. How does a
- **[00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVgfijICfrI&t=5s)** — fruit or a plant ever come up with this chemical to kill cancer since that plant or fruit doesn't
- **[00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVgfijICfrI&t=14s)** — normally get cancer like humans get? We will also answer the question of the sugar in fruits, right?
- **[00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVgfijICfrI&t=21s)** — Because people might know that fruits are high in sugar and cancer loves sugar. All right,
- **[00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVgfijICfrI&t=26s)** — let's first dive into number one. Berries. But there's two specific berries that have more
- **[00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVgfijICfrI&t=32s)** — cancer fighting potential than other berries and that would be the blueberry and the blackberry
- **[00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVgfijICfrI&t=38s)** — because they have a lot more of this thing called anthocyanins that has all sorts of
- **[00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVgfijICfrI&t=44s)** — interesting properties. One being the inhibiting of cancer growth. Okay, now anthocyanins also
- **[00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVgfijICfrI&t=53s)** — feed your gut microbes. Like 80% of your immune system is in your gut microbiome. So your gut
- **[01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVgfijICfrI&t=60s)** — microbes love to eat these plant-based chemicals. You strengthen them, they become more diverse,
- **[01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVgfijICfrI&t=66s)** — and they increase in number. There's some pretty great, incredible research on anthocyanins
- **[01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVgfijICfrI&t=72s)** — decreasing breast cancer, colon cancer, and prostate cancer. Now, I will say they're
- **[01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVgfijICfrI&t=77s)** — observational studies, but still the research is pretty strong. If you can just imagine like,
- **[01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVgfijICfrI&t=81s)** — yeah, we just discovered that you can actually help inhibit cancer by eating healthier, right?
- **[01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVgfijICfrI&t=86s)** — Who's going to fund that? And that goes right up against pharmaceutical companies.
- **[01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVgfijICfrI&t=90s)** — It's not going to happen. There's just so many other things that go way beyond just cancer.
- **[01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVgfijICfrI&t=95s)** — We're talking about anti-inflammatory, anti-microbial. All right, so let's go to
- **[01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVgfijICfrI&t=99s)** — number two. Citrus fruits, right? This is lemon, limes, grapefruit. Not only are they
- **[01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVgfijICfrI&t=107s)** — loaded with vitamin C, which helps your immune system, but they're loaded with flavonoids.
- **[01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVgfijICfrI&t=113s)** — One being the detoxification of cancer-causing agents. So in other words, it strengthens the
- **[02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVgfijICfrI&t=120s)** — liver's ability to turn these carcinogens into harmless particles. So if you regularly
- **[02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVgfijICfrI&t=126s)** — consume citrus fruits, whether it's also like lemon in the water, things like that,
- **[02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVgfijICfrI&t=131s)** — you may decrease your risk for certain types of cancer, especially of the digestive system.
- **[02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVgfijICfrI&t=136s)** — Next one is pomegranates. Pomegranates are rich in a certain nutrient called
- **[02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVgfijICfrI&t=143s)** — elegic acid. It also has anti-cancer properties. These compounds work over time to protect your
- **[02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVgfijICfrI&t=149s)** — DNA from damage. You have to realize that a cancer cell came from a normal cell. Cancer
- **[02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVgfijICfrI&t=155s)** — really is a normal cell that has damage that then has to survive. And so it starts to morph
- **[02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVgfijICfrI&t=161s)** — into some other type of metabolism. There's a lot of other phytonutrients in pomegranates
- **[02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVgfijICfrI&t=166s)** — that do a lot of different things as well. Decrease inflammation, decrease oxidative stress.
- **[02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVgfijICfrI&t=173s)** — All right, the next one is grapes. Now what are grapes known for? Well,
- **[02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVgfijICfrI&t=177s)** — the phytonutrient called resveratrol. Resveratrol is known to help decrease aging.
- **[03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVgfijICfrI&t=183s)** — And one of the reasons why someone can extend their age is they're not dying from certain
- **[03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVgfijICfrI&t=187s)** — things. So resveratrol is a very thoroughly researched phytonutrient that has all sorts of
- **[03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVgfijICfrI&t=193s)** — properties. One being a superhero anti-cancer effect that can bulletproof your cells from
- **[03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVgfijICfrI&t=201s)** — experiencing excessive amounts of stress that can then cause the triggering of the cancer.
- **[03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVgfijICfrI&t=207s)** — The next one on the list is tomatoes. Yes, tomatoes are really a fruit, even though you
- **[03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVgfijICfrI&t=212s)** — might have thought it was a vegetable. Tomatoes are loaded with something called
- **[03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVgfijICfrI&t=216s)** — lycopene. Now you actually can increase the amount of lycopene if you cook the tomato,
- **[03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVgfijICfrI&t=221s)** — as in tomato sauce. Now I have a huge garden of tomatoes, all different kinds. And because I'm
- **[03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVgfijICfrI&t=228s)** — experimenting on different types of tomatoes, I have dark purple ones, the green and yellow
- **[03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVgfijICfrI&t=233s)** — ones. I have all different types. And those colors represent different pigments, different
- **[03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVgfijICfrI&t=238s)** — phytonutrients. So I'm going to experiment on this and see which ones I like as far as taste,
- **[04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVgfijICfrI&t=243s)** — see which ones are not as destroyed by insects and bugs. And then also I'm going to send
- **[04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVgfijICfrI&t=247s)** — them to the lab to see what the heck is in these tomatoes. All right, next one, avocados.
- **[04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVgfijICfrI&t=252s)** — First thing that avocados have is glutathione. That's a super powerful antioxidant that can
- **[04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVgfijICfrI&t=258s)** — protect your cells against what's called carcinogens, which are things that cause
- **[04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVgfijICfrI&t=263s)** — cancer. The more glutathione you can consume from actual food, the better. The other thing
- **[04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVgfijICfrI&t=269s)** — that avocados have are certain phytonutrients that specifically target cancer stem cells. And
- **[04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVgfijICfrI&t=276s)** — those are the cells that are not turned into a cancer cell yet, but they're going to. So if you
- **[04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVgfijICfrI&t=281s)** — can slow those down, you get at the root of cancer. All right, the last one on the list is
- **[04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVgfijICfrI&t=288s)** — olives. Yes, an olive is a fruit as well. Olives have something called allylropane,
- **[04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVgfijICfrI&t=294s)** — and another one called hydroxytyrosal. Both protect you against the growth of cancer cells.
- **[05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVgfijICfrI&t=300s)** — Olives are like a natural shield. They protect the body from the inside out. Another cool
- **[05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVgfijICfrI&t=305s)** — thing about olives is that these phytonutrients increase something called apoptosis. When the
- **[05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVgfijICfrI&t=312s)** — cell is sick, it naturally commits suicide to protect the whole body. So the phytonutrient
- **[05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVgfijICfrI&t=318s)** — in olives can help cause the cancer cell to commit suicide. So that's a really good thing.
- **[05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVgfijICfrI&t=324s)** — All right, so now let's talk about how a fruit actually developed these compounds in
- **[05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVgfijICfrI&t=327s)** — the first place. These plants have developed certain compounds to help them survive as a
- **[05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVgfijICfrI&t=335s)** — defense mechanism against the stress from UV radiation, pathogens, viruses, other bacteria.
- **[05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVgfijICfrI&t=342s)** — They can't run away from anything, so they have to develop all these compounds to teach
- **[05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVgfijICfrI&t=346s)** — whoever eats them a lesson. So these anti-cancer plant-based chemicals also inhibit certain
- **[05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVgfijICfrI&t=353s)** — enzymes. Some of the phytonutrients also increase what's called autophagy. What happens
- **[05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVgfijICfrI&t=358s)** — is it causes your body to start eating damaged cells and then turn those into new proteins.
- **[06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVgfijICfrI&t=365s)** — And also some of the plant-based chemicals that kill insects create a very mild short-term
- **[06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVgfijICfrI&t=371s)** — stress in our body that then causes our body to compensate and become stronger. Think about
- **[06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVgfijICfrI&t=376s)** — this. If a child never gets sick, they won't have an immune system. And having the body
- **[06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVgfijICfrI&t=381s)** — learn from that and become stronger, it's not good to eliminate all stress. These
- **[06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVgfijICfrI&t=386s)** — chemicals are not necessarily just killing or dissolving this cancer. They're getting rid
- **[06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVgfijICfrI&t=391s)** — of the things that turn into cancer. The inflammation, they're supporting the gut microbe
- **[06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVgfijICfrI&t=397s)** — around the cancer. And so even if there's more sugar in the fruit, the different phytonutrients
- **[06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVgfijICfrI&t=403s)** — with the fiber itself all buffer a lot of that sugar. So it's not like eating a candy
- **[06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVgfijICfrI&t=408s)** — bar at all. So I really think that food should be our medicine. Unfortunately, the medical
- **[06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVgfijICfrI&t=414s)** — does not look at food as medicine. And it's just bizarre to me to think that you can get
- **[06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVgfijICfrI&t=419s)** — healthy by taking a poison. I'm sorry, a medication. Currently, I'm involved in doing
- **[07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVgfijICfrI&t=423s)** — research on cancer with a group out of Europe. And we published several amazing studies on
- **[07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVgfijICfrI&t=430s)** — cancer using these natural compounds in plants because they have virtually no side effects,
- **[07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVgfijICfrI&t=437s)** — as chemo does have massive side effects. That's the problem with trying to address
- **[07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVgfijICfrI&t=442s)** — cancer to kill it off. You need to use something in the body that does not have
- **[07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVgfijICfrI&t=446s)** — the toxic effects. So check it out down below and I will see you in the next video.

*Click any timestamp to jump to that moment in the video*

- **[00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dS3owmZ_QnY&t=0s)** — There are seven stupid mistakes people make regarding their health.
- **[00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dS3owmZ_QnY&t=5s)** — Number one, getting the wrong advice and then accepting that advice as a fact.
- **[00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dS3owmZ_QnY&t=11s)** — You know, you go to the doctor and they might ask you about what you're taking
- **[00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dS3owmZ_QnY&t=14s)** — and you say, I'm taking these vitamins, I'm taking magnesium, etc.
- **[00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dS3owmZ_QnY&t=17s)** — And they're going to just kind of go, oh, you don't need that.
- **[00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dS3owmZ_QnY&t=19s)** — You can get that from your diet. And then you accept it as a fact.
- **[00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dS3owmZ_QnY&t=23s)** — Unfortunately, just because someone has an MD behind their name
- **[00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dS3owmZ_QnY&t=26s)** — or even a PhD behind their name,
- **[00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dS3owmZ_QnY&t=28s)** — doesn't mean they fully evaluated all the information.
- **[00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dS3owmZ_QnY&t=31s)** — They haven't even looked at it.
- **[00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dS3owmZ_QnY&t=33s)** — They just tell you their opinion and then you accept it.
- **[00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dS3owmZ_QnY&t=36s)** — So that would be a big mistake.
- **[00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dS3owmZ_QnY&t=38s)** — And this definitely relates to a vitamin D deficiency.
- **[00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dS3owmZ_QnY&t=40s)** — There is so much valuable information about vitamin D
- **[00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dS3owmZ_QnY&t=43s)** — that's buried deep into the literature.
- **[00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dS3owmZ_QnY&t=46s)** — And if you just do a superficial look at, you know, the first three pages on Google,
- **[00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dS3owmZ_QnY&t=51s)** — you're probably going to find all sorts of bias information and,
- **[00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dS3owmZ_QnY&t=54s)** — Oh yeah, vitamin D doesn't do anything and we get enough from our diet or the sun.
- **[00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dS3owmZ_QnY&t=59s)** — And that is just terrible information because so many people have vitamin D resistance.
- **[01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dS3owmZ_QnY&t=64s)** — So the normal typical amounts, even if it's like 2000 IUs, are not going to do anything.
- **[01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dS3owmZ_QnY&t=70s)** — They'll never be able to achieve this therapeutic effect.
- **[01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dS3owmZ_QnY&t=73s)** — Number two, a person is depending on all their protein requirements from a protein powder.
- **[01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dS3owmZ_QnY&t=80s)** — And it's not complete compared to animal protein.
- **[01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dS3owmZ_QnY&t=83s)** — You're not getting any vitamins or minerals or other things that are in animal meats.
- **[01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dS3owmZ_QnY&t=88s)** — Now, the other thing that comes with that is when you just consume meat
- **[01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dS3owmZ_QnY&t=92s)** — and you're thinking you're getting all of your proteins.
- **[01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dS3owmZ_QnY&t=95s)** — Did you realize that out of all the proteins in your body, 30% is collagen.
- **[01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dS3owmZ_QnY&t=101s)** — There's not a lot of collagen in meat.
- **[01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dS3owmZ_QnY&t=103s)** — Now, if you eat a tender steak, for example, you're only getting like 1-2% collagen.
- **[01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dS3owmZ_QnY&t=108s)** — All right, number three, basically a problem with medicine, the whole system.
- **[01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dS3owmZ_QnY&t=111s)** — You treat the symptom, you don't really get rid of the cause.
- **[01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dS3owmZ_QnY&t=114s)** — Now, I'm not talking about the doctors that are mending a bone from a fracture
- **[01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dS3owmZ_QnY&t=119s)** — or if you go to the doctor for an infection.
- **[02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dS3owmZ_QnY&t=121s)** — I'm talking about how they treat chronic disease, you know, with certain pills.
- **[02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dS3owmZ_QnY&t=126s)** — A really good example is just blood sugar, right?
- **[02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dS3owmZ_QnY&t=129s)** — So normally you should have a certain amount of normal blood sugar.
- **[02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dS3owmZ_QnY&t=132s)** — Even if you do eat carbs, this hormone called insulin comes in there,
- **[02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dS3owmZ_QnY&t=136s)** — takes the sugar out of the blood, so you can have normal blood sugars.
- **[02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dS3owmZ_QnY&t=138s)** — So yes, that whole system of medicine is really stupid.
- **[02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dS3owmZ_QnY&t=143s)** — So the next time you're at your doctor, ask them,
- **[02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dS3owmZ_QnY&t=145s)** — is there going to be any point in this treatment program
- **[02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dS3owmZ_QnY&t=148s)** — that I'm going to come off the medication because the medication fixed it.
- **[02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dS3owmZ_QnY&t=151s)** — All right, number four, the hyper focus on reducing your salt content for high blood pressure.
- **[02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dS3owmZ_QnY&t=158s)** — I mean, in nutrition science, you need like twice as much potassium to sodium.
- **[02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dS3owmZ_QnY&t=163s)** — As far as the ratios, I mean, it would probably be better
- **[02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dS3owmZ_QnY&t=165s)** — if you had four times the potassium to the sodium.
- **[02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dS3owmZ_QnY&t=168s)** — So instead of focusing on lowering your sodium,
- **[02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dS3owmZ_QnY&t=171s)** — which is going to create weakness and other problems,
- **[02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dS3owmZ_QnY&t=174s)** — why not increase the potassium?
- **[02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dS3owmZ_QnY&t=176s)** — And if someone really were to evaluate what potassium does to your arteries,
- **[03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dS3owmZ_QnY&t=181s)** — it keeps them flexible.
- **[03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dS3owmZ_QnY&t=184s)** — All right, number five, having this idea that unsaturated fats
- **[03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dS3owmZ_QnY&t=188s)** — are somehow healthier than saturated fats.
- **[03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dS3owmZ_QnY&t=192s)** — And I'm talking about these unsaturated fats, the heart healthy unsaturated fats.
- **[03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dS3owmZ_QnY&t=198s)** — It is highly refined and it's in pretty much every single junk food,
- **[03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dS3owmZ_QnY&t=204s)** — which is called ultra processed foods.
- **[03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dS3owmZ_QnY&t=206s)** — And yes, it might lower your cholesterol a little bit,
- **[03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dS3owmZ_QnY&t=210s)** — but what about all the other damage that it can do?
- **[03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dS3owmZ_QnY&t=213s)** — I'm talking about like rusting out the inside of your arteries,
- **[03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dS3owmZ_QnY&t=216s)** — creating inflammation, etc.
- **[03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dS3owmZ_QnY&t=218s)** — All right, number six, this idea that red meat is junk food.
- **[03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dS3owmZ_QnY&t=224s)** — We've been eating red meat for a very long time.
- **[03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dS3owmZ_QnY&t=226s)** — It still retains all the vitamins, the minerals,
- **[03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dS3owmZ_QnY&t=228s)** — the other stuff that's in there that can help you.
- **[03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dS3owmZ_QnY&t=231s)** — And yes, there's different levels of processed meat,
- **[03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dS3owmZ_QnY&t=234s)** — but to lump in the red meat with the processed meat
- **[03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dS3owmZ_QnY&t=236s)** — and even state that they are both the same as far as causing cancer is stupid.
- **[04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dS3owmZ_QnY&t=242s)** — Because red meat is one of the most healing things that you can consume,
- **[04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dS3owmZ_QnY&t=246s)** — especially for gut health.
- **[04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dS3owmZ_QnY&t=248s)** — In fact, it was the thing to actually turn me around just within probably minutes.
- **[04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dS3owmZ_QnY&t=254s)** — I remember years ago when I was a junk food junkie,
- **[04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dS3owmZ_QnY&t=257s)** — and then I just started to consume red meat for breakfast
- **[04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dS3owmZ_QnY&t=260s)** — and it was like a miracle overnight.
- **[04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dS3owmZ_QnY&t=262s)** — I just felt like the brain fog went away.
- **[04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dS3owmZ_QnY&t=264s)** — I started feeling better.
- **[04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dS3owmZ_QnY&t=265s)** — All right, and number seven, reading nutrition facts.
- **[04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dS3owmZ_QnY&t=267s)** — This unfortunately is a very stupid mistake
- **[04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dS3owmZ_QnY&t=269s)** — because if you actually started reading the nutrition facts,
- **[04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dS3owmZ_QnY&t=273s)** — you're going to be shocked.
- **[04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dS3owmZ_QnY&t=274s)** — It's very confusing when you focus on the nutritional facts through up here,
- **[04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dS3owmZ_QnY&t=280s)** — all these numbers right here.
- **[04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dS3owmZ_QnY&t=281s)** — I mean, it gives you some data,
- **[04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dS3owmZ_QnY&t=282s)** — but you really can't tell what's going on unless you read the ingredients.
- **[04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dS3owmZ_QnY&t=287s)** — And of course, the first one is sugars.
- **[04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dS3owmZ_QnY&t=289s)** — And of course, they have sugars hidden as other words,
- **[04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dS3owmZ_QnY&t=292s)** — like high fructose corn syrup, things like that.
- **[04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dS3owmZ_QnY&t=294s)** — And that's number one.
- **[04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dS3owmZ_QnY&t=295s)** — And number two is all the seed oils,
- **[04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dS3owmZ_QnY&t=297s)** — like corn oil, canola, soy oil, cotton seed oil.
- **[05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dS3owmZ_QnY&t=302s)** — But number three, starch.
- **[05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dS3owmZ_QnY&t=304s)** — Starch is really the hidden sugar that people don't talk about.
- **[05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dS3owmZ_QnY&t=308s)** — Let's take, for example, this product right here.
- **[05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dS3owmZ_QnY&t=311s)** — If you look at the total carbohydrate,
- **[05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dS3owmZ_QnY&t=313s)** — and this is actually very interesting, 16 grams of carbohydrate.
- **[05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dS3owmZ_QnY&t=317s)** — Guess how much sugar is in here?
- **[05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dS3owmZ_QnY&t=318s)** — Zero.
- **[05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dS3owmZ_QnY&t=319s)** — All right. If we take the 16 grams of carbohydrate,
- **[05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dS3owmZ_QnY&t=322s)** — which is really hidden sugars,
- **[05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dS3owmZ_QnY&t=324s)** — and then we multiply it by the number of serving sizes.
- **[05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dS3owmZ_QnY&t=327s)** — This right here is 56 teaspoons of sugar
- **[05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dS3owmZ_QnY&t=333s)** — and this one bag of Doritos.
- **[05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dS3owmZ_QnY&t=336s)** — These refined starches act on your blood sugars worse than actual sugar.
- **[05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dS3owmZ_QnY&t=340s)** — But it's classified as zero sugars.
- **[05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dS3owmZ_QnY&t=344s)** — You see the problem?
- **[05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dS3owmZ_QnY&t=345s)** — A person is literally going to make stupid choices because it's omitted.
- **[05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dS3owmZ_QnY&t=348s)** — Now, since we're on the topic of starches,
- **[05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dS3owmZ_QnY&t=351s)** — I think this next video on maltodextrin will blow you away.
- **[05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dS3owmZ_QnY&t=355s)** — Check it out. It's right here.

- **[00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4vpuB13Lvg&t=0s)** — Let's show you the seven ways to burn more fat while you are sleeping. There's nothing worse than
- **[00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4vpuB13Lvg&t=7s)** — poor sleep to stop you from burning fat. I had this patient who came in long ago who lifted
- **[00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4vpuB13Lvg&t=14s)** — over three million pounds in the gym over a course of a year. She was hardcore dedicated and she
- **[00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4vpuB13Lvg&t=20s)** — lost I think one or two pounds. Very depressed. The problem that she had was she wasn't sleeping
- **[00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4vpuB13Lvg&t=26s)** — that great. I fixed her sleep with what I'm going to show you now. And the first month she lost 16
- **[00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4vpuB13Lvg&t=33s)** — pounds. So let's start with number seven. Work backwards. Then I'll eventually get to the most
- **[00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4vpuB13Lvg&t=40s)** — important thing you need to do out of all of these tips. Okay, number seven. You want to
- **[00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4vpuB13Lvg&t=45s)** — let your appetite dictate what fasting pattern that you should be on. And then because you
- **[00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4vpuB13Lvg&t=50s)** — don't have an appetite, it allows you to go longer. And you just really want to pay attention,
- **[00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4vpuB13Lvg&t=54s)** — be in tune with your appetite. So if you're not hungry, just don't eat. All right, number six.
- **[01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4vpuB13Lvg&t=60s)** — Reduce the extra excess fat, extra butter and MCT oil in the coffee or you're adding more
- **[01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4vpuB13Lvg&t=68s)** — fat. Don't do that. What we want to do is we want to force our bodies to burn our own
- **[01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4vpuB13Lvg&t=74s)** — body fat and not the dietary fat. I don't want you to go low fat. But I don't want you to add
- **[01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4vpuB13Lvg&t=80s)** — additional fat that is excess to the normal fat that comes with your protein, your meat,
- **[01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4vpuB13Lvg&t=85s)** — things like that. Number five. Make sure your carbs aren't too high. I think an easy way to
- **[01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4vpuB13Lvg&t=90s)** — do it without having to count carbs is just to eat meat and vegetables. Most vegetables,
- **[01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4vpuB13Lvg&t=95s)** — especially salads, they don't have a lot of carbs. They have a lot of fiber. You're not
- **[01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4vpuB13Lvg&t=100s)** — going to ever gain weight on salad. I'm sorry. If anyone ever says that, they don't
- **[01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4vpuB13Lvg&t=104s)** — know what you're talking about. Some people might have a thyroid issue and they have a hard
- **[01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4vpuB13Lvg&t=110s)** — time converting T4 to T3. T3 is like the active form of the thyroid hormone. This happens in
- **[01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4vpuB13Lvg&t=115s)** — some people, especially when they go low carb for a longer period of time. What they should do
- **[02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4vpuB13Lvg&t=120s)** — to solve this is not to start adding a lot of sugar and stuff like that, but just add more
- **[02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4vpuB13Lvg&t=127s)** — berries. That would be something that could potentially help your sleep because it helps the
- **[02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4vpuB13Lvg&t=133s)** — thyroid. And if you're getting bloating, you're not on the right eating plan. Start
- **[02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4vpuB13Lvg&t=136s)** — eliminating things. The nuts. Maybe you eliminate the cheese, that type of thing, or dairy. And
- **[02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4vpuB13Lvg&t=142s)** — some people that have inflammation in their gut do very well in the carnivore diet,
- **[02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4vpuB13Lvg&t=148s)** — which is also a diet that eliminates a lot of potential things that bloat you. Now let's go
- **[02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4vpuB13Lvg&t=154s)** — to four. Overall sleep hygiene. Making sure that you invest in a good mattress. I'm telling
- **[02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4vpuB13Lvg&t=160s)** — you, you spend one third of your life in bed. Might as well invest in a good mattress. The
- **[02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4vpuB13Lvg&t=167s)** — best way to get a mattress is to go to a mattress store and start testing things out
- **[02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4vpuB13Lvg&t=171s)** — because some people do better on the softer. Some people do better on the firmer. Make sure
- **[02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4vpuB13Lvg&t=175s)** — the room is not too hot. If you can crack the window open and get more fresh air,
- **[03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4vpuB13Lvg&t=180s)** — that would be great. If you have a dog in your bed that keeps you up, you're going to
- **[03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4vpuB13Lvg&t=186s)** — put the dog somewhere else because I mean just the excess noise and the movement in bed.
- **[03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4vpuB13Lvg&t=193s)** — And unfortunately, if you're sleeping with someone that snores, it just throws everything
- **[03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4vpuB13Lvg&t=197s)** — off. Growing up, I slept in the basement. Okay, it was cool, dark, and boy, that was great
- **[03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4vpuB13Lvg&t=204s)** — because I could just bundle up and go to sleep and it was the best sleep environment.
- **[03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4vpuB13Lvg&t=208s)** — Nowadays, there's lights on. We have the computer, the LED lights, the blue lights. It's
- **[03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4vpuB13Lvg&t=213s)** — very, very bad for sleep. So you really want to start dimming the lights early on. The more light
- **[03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4vpuB13Lvg&t=220s)** — you have, especially blue light, that's going to interrupt the melatonin. So that's going to
- **[03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4vpuB13Lvg&t=223s)** — prevent you from going to sleep. Now we're at number three. These are sleep aids. Okay,
- **[03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4vpuB13Lvg&t=228s)** — apple cider vinegar through the day, like maybe once or twice or three times in some
- **[03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4vpuB13Lvg&t=233s)** — water, like a tablespoon. That'll help your blood sugar. It will help you sleep. So that's
- **[03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4vpuB13Lvg&t=239s)** — two. Collagen is a good supplement to take. One third of it is glycine. Glycine is usually
- **[04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4vpuB13Lvg&t=246s)** — deficient in most people. Glycine is needed to sleep. Another remedy is niacinamide. Take a
- **[04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4vpuB13Lvg&t=253s)** — little bit, maybe 100 to 150 milligrams at a time. Vitamin D is also very important for
- **[04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4vpuB13Lvg&t=258s)** — sleep cycles. Sometimes I'll take vitamin D right before bed. It really helps, especially
- **[04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4vpuB13Lvg&t=263s)** — And lastly, sea salt. All right, number two, do a full workout where your whole body gets
- **[04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4vpuB13Lvg&t=270s)** — not just tired, but you sweat. Okay, so you want to push yourself to the intensity that
- **[04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4vpuB13Lvg&t=276s)** — if you're doing weights, it's to a failure. Okay, so we don't want to just do a little
- **[04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4vpuB13Lvg&t=282s)** — exercise, maybe in the beginning, but you want to graduate to something more intense. Let's
- **[04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4vpuB13Lvg&t=287s)** — say you're sprinting up a hill and you hit a wall. That would be good. You know, do several
- **[04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4vpuB13Lvg&t=291s)** — those because we want to do enough exercise to deplete the energy in your body and also
- **[04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4vpuB13Lvg&t=297s)** — stimulate growth hormone. Growth hormone is activated by the intensity of exercise. So we
- **[05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4vpuB13Lvg&t=304s)** — want that workout, but not very frequently. Those people who had the hardest time losing
- **[05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4vpuB13Lvg&t=308s)** — weight were the most desperate and serious about it. And that alone, that mindset,
- **[05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4vpuB13Lvg&t=316s)** — that emotion stresses people out and it adds more cortisol. So I highly recommend you go about
- **[05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4vpuB13Lvg&t=323s)** — this in a relaxed manner as much as possible and relaxed and don't worry about it so much.
- **[05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4vpuB13Lvg&t=329s)** — Self-induced stress can activate cortisol. Don't expect things just to bounce back right
- **[05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4vpuB13Lvg&t=334s)** — off the bat. You have to have what's called in medicine, patience. This is why we put you in
- **[05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4vpuB13Lvg&t=341s)** — a waiting room, right? And also when you're starting out weight loss, especially if you're
- **[05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4vpuB13Lvg&t=346s)** — menopausal, you don't just have a weight loss problem. You have also a loss of muscle problem
- **[05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4vpuB13Lvg&t=351s)** — that's called atrophy. And in the process of healing, sleeping, you're going to rebuild
- **[05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4vpuB13Lvg&t=357s)** — muscle. All right, number one, the most important tip, okay? You want to go to bed
- **[06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4vpuB13Lvg&t=363s)** — between nine and nine thirty. Okay? And you want to sleep for nine hours. Now,
- **[06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4vpuB13Lvg&t=370s)** — before you think I'm crazy, let me tell you why. Think about what's going to happen. You're going
- **[06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4vpuB13Lvg&t=376s)** — to get a lot more repair of proteins, muscle, and your metabolism is a function of how much
- **[06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4vpuB13Lvg&t=383s)** — lean muscle mass you have. You think you're like wasting the day away, but you're actually
- **[06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4vpuB13Lvg&t=387s)** — doing a lot of productive work with your body. It's part of the healing phase. So get that
- **[06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4vpuB13Lvg&t=391s)** — nine hours of sleep, be in bed by nine, nine thirty. And if you can't sleep that long,
- **[06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4vpuB13Lvg&t=396s)** — maybe you take a nap or you get up and you go back to sleep. But the point is that the more sleep,
- **[06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4vpuB13Lvg&t=401s)** — especially in the beginning, the better, the more weight loss. Why? Because you burn all the fat
- **[06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4vpuB13Lvg&t=405s)** — while you're sleeping. So might as well ride the wave. So since we're on this topic of sleep,
- **[06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4vpuB13Lvg&t=409s)** — I think it's really important to know a little bit more about this hormone cortisol that can
- **[06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4vpuB13Lvg&t=413s)** — prevent you from going to sleep. And I have this wonderful download on my website that you

- **[00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Hobt4Pb4iA&t=0s)** — So many people look at walking as a very trivial thing. And sometimes they'll think it's just kind
- **[00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Hobt4Pb4iA&t=5s)** — of a waste of time because think about how much production or productive things you can do in place
- **[00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Hobt4Pb4iA&t=11s)** — of, you know, walking for 45 minutes. Well, after today's video that might change your mind because
- **[00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Hobt4Pb4iA&t=17s)** — walking is probably one of the most therapeutic things you can do. And the majority of these
- **[00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Hobt4Pb4iA&t=22s)** — benefits I'm going to talk about related to walking are things that you probably have never
- **[00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Hobt4Pb4iA&t=28s)** — heard before. I mean, we know walking helps you, you know, maybe lose some weight, maybe reduce stress,
- **[00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Hobt4Pb4iA&t=35s)** — but how does it reduce stress? That's the question. The first point, I'm going to dive right in,
- **[00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Hobt4Pb4iA&t=40s)** — is this. When you walk you significantly lower your cortisol levels even after a 20-minute walk.
- **[00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Hobt4Pb4iA&t=48s)** — So what does this mean? When you have high levels of cortisol your body is in this
- **[00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Hobt4Pb4iA&t=53s)** — adapt mode. It's adapting your physiology to your environment, to stress. So walking turns
- **[01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Hobt4Pb4iA&t=61s)** — off that mechanism. So you're less in this flight or fight sympathetic dominance mode and
- **[01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Hobt4Pb4iA&t=67s)** — more in the parasympathetic. So that's why you feel calmer. That's why you feel less
- **[01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Hobt4Pb4iA&t=71s)** — stress because now the body is not stuck in this stress reaction mode. And so with lower
- **[01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Hobt4Pb4iA&t=77s)** — levels of cortisol and adrenaline you're going to feel better. Even on DNA testing there's a
- **[01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Hobt4Pb4iA&t=82s)** — certain gene that causes the person to hold on to adrenaline longer. And the remedy for that is
- **[01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Hobt4Pb4iA&t=90s)** — to exercise and flush it out. Not necessarily always high intensity but some low intensity
- **[01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Hobt4Pb4iA&t=98s)** — long walks. Alright, number two, which relates to number one. You're going to have improved
- **[01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Hobt4Pb4iA&t=103s)** — creativity. And what I mean by that is more creative thinking. Think about this. When you're
- **[01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Hobt4Pb4iA&t=109s)** — in stress mode and you have high levels of cortisol, what is your level of creativity?
- **[01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Hobt4Pb4iA&t=115s)** — It's pretty low. It's almost impossible to be creative when you're under stress, when you
- **[02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Hobt4Pb4iA&t=120s)** — have high levels of cortisol. And this definitely relates to problem solving as well because when
- **[02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Hobt4Pb4iA&t=125s)** — you solve problems you need creativity and when you have stress you're not really good at
- **[02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Hobt4Pb4iA&t=130s)** — solving problems like you would if you were more calm and you had more creativity. Going
- **[02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Hobt4Pb4iA&t=135s)** — on a long walk gives you this new space, this ability to look at things a little bit easier.
- **[02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Hobt4Pb4iA&t=142s)** — It gives you space between you and the problem. So the problem is not like all up here. You have
- **[02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Hobt4Pb4iA&t=147s)** — space now. You can kind of look at it. You can kind of play with it. You can come up with
- **[02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Hobt4Pb4iA&t=152s)** — solutions. Number three, which relates to number two, this is going to affect your overall
- **[02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Hobt4Pb4iA&t=156s)** — mood. You're going to have less anxiety. You'll be less depressed. Alright, number four,
- **[02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Hobt4Pb4iA&t=161s)** — the mitochondria inside your cells, which is the energy factory, and most diseases are associated
- **[02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Hobt4Pb4iA&t=167s)** — with damaged mitochondria. They call it a problem with your metabolism. And that really
- **[02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Hobt4Pb4iA&t=172s)** — relates to how well that your cells are fed fuel and oxygen and etc. So when you go on
- **[02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Hobt4Pb4iA&t=179s)** — long walks you enhance the quality of mitochondria. You enhance the numbers of mitochondria.
- **[03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Hobt4Pb4iA&t=187s)** — Mitochondria become more efficient at burning fuel. And the better your mitochondria work,
- **[03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Hobt4Pb4iA&t=193s)** — the less diseases you'll have. Number five, and this is interesting, exercise, especially
- **[03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Hobt4Pb4iA&t=198s)** — walking, increases microbial diversity. You'll have more diverse types of microbes. That's
- **[03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Hobt4Pb4iA&t=205s)** — pretty wild, which is going to help a lot of things. It's going to help your immune system.
- **[03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Hobt4Pb4iA&t=208s)** — It's going to help your digestion. It's going to help your energy. And number six,
- **[03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Hobt4Pb4iA&t=213s)** — walking improves or increases your endogenous antioxidants. What does endogenous mean?
- **[03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Hobt4Pb4iA&t=220s)** — It means something from within. In other words, your body has the ability to create
- **[03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Hobt4Pb4iA&t=226s)** — antioxidants. And when you do walks, you actually create more of your own antioxidants.
- **[03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Hobt4Pb4iA&t=232s)** — And this is nothing to do with what you're eating. Your body is just making more antioxidant
- **[03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Hobt4Pb4iA&t=237s)** — networks, which is going to help you fight off free radicals. It's going to actually help
- **[04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Hobt4Pb4iA&t=242s)** — longevity. It's going to help prevent a lot of problems. Number seven, walking actually increases
- **[04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Hobt4Pb4iA&t=250s)** — your natural killer cells. These are part of the immune system and they actually kill cancer
- **[04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Hobt4Pb4iA&t=256s)** — cells and viruses. Well, walking increases the natural killer cells. Number eight,
- **[04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Hobt4Pb4iA&t=261s)** — walking improves insulin and glucose sensitivity. So if you have insulin resistance,
- **[04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Hobt4Pb4iA&t=269s)** — if you have a problem with glucose, walking improves this to the point where it can
- **[04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Hobt4Pb4iA&t=276s)** — significantly decrease the resistance to insulin, which is going to help your blood sugars. So if
- **[04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Hobt4Pb4iA&t=281s)** — you're a diabetic or a pre-diabetic, walking is awesome. And even if you had the dawn
- **[04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Hobt4Pb4iA&t=286s)** — phenomena where you wake up in the morning and your blood sugars are high, going for a long
- **[04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Hobt4Pb4iA&t=290s)** — walk can burn off that sugar. And that's what happens for the first, I don't know, about 25,
- **[04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Hobt4Pb4iA&t=294s)** — 30 minutes as you burn off all this extra sugar you have and then you start burning fat.
- **[05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Hobt4Pb4iA&t=300s)** — All right, number nine. And this is interesting because yes, it is true when you walk,
- **[05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Hobt4Pb4iA&t=306s)** — you get more oxygen, but it's not about getting more oxygen in your blood. It's about what
- **[05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Hobt4Pb4iA&t=311s)** — happens between your blood cells and your tissue cells. Are you absorbing more oxygen
- **[05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Hobt4Pb4iA&t=318s)** — from that blood saturation? Okay, like even if you do an intense workout where you're
- **[05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Hobt4Pb4iA&t=323s)** — breathing heavily, right? You think you're getting all this air, but it's kind of like having a cup
- **[05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Hobt4Pb4iA&t=329s)** — that's filled with water and then you try to add more water to it. It's already filled.
- **[05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Hobt4Pb4iA&t=334s)** — It just kind of flows over. That's what happens when you exercise intensely when you're
- **[05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Hobt4Pb4iA&t=338s)** — over breathing. You're getting all this oxygen, but it's not being delivered into the tissues.
- **[05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Hobt4Pb4iA&t=342s)** — In fact, you probably feel like you have to breathe harder to get more oxygen into the
- **[05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Hobt4Pb4iA&t=347s)** — But here's the key. It is true that you need oxygen, right? But to deliver and transport that
- **[05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Hobt4Pb4iA&t=354s)** — oxygen, CO2 is needed. CO2 is not just a waste product. It's essential to make sure that
- **[06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Hobt4Pb4iA&t=360s)** — oxygen is delivered deep into the tissues. So whereas certain type of high intensity
- **[06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Hobt4Pb4iA&t=366s)** — exercise is good for certain things, walking is good for getting oxygen deep into the cells
- **[06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Hobt4Pb4iA&t=372s)** — because you're not breathing too much. You're not flooding your body with too much oxygen.
- **[06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Hobt4Pb4iA&t=378s)** — You're getting a nice balance of oxygen and CO2, which is the key to deliver that oxygen,
- **[06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Hobt4Pb4iA&t=386s)** — especially if you breathe through your nose. You'll get like 20% more oxygen if you're
- **[06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Hobt4Pb4iA&t=391s)** — walking. And for people that walk maybe a little bit faster, they are generating
- **[06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Hobt4Pb4iA&t=397s)** — And then acid tends to inhibit oxygen. So what happens in your blood is you have
- **[06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Hobt4Pb4iA&t=404s)** — certain things that are alkaline. They're called bicarbonates and that's going to help
- **[06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Hobt4Pb4iA&t=409s)** — neutralize this lactic acid fairly quickly. And then the byproduct chemistry of that is
- **[06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Hobt4Pb4iA&t=416s)** — H2O, water and carbon dioxide. So your body actually is getting CO2 from that process as
- **[07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Hobt4Pb4iA&t=423s)** — Number 10, bone density increases when walking. Interesting. Number 11, reduced inflammation.
- **[07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Hobt4Pb4iA&t=432s)** — You're also reducing stiffness but motion in general and getting this oxygen to the tissues
- **[07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Hobt4Pb4iA&t=437s)** — is going to help reduce inflammation. And the last thing that walking will do is enhance your
- **[07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Hobt4Pb4iA&t=442s)** — vision and from several different ways. First of all, you get more oxygen to your brain
- **[07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Hobt4Pb4iA&t=446s)** — and your retina is a part of your brain sticking out into your eyeball. And also
- **[07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Hobt4Pb4iA&t=452s)** — you're going to improve insulin sensitivity which is going to help your eyes, your kidneys,
- **[07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Hobt4Pb4iA&t=457s)** — your nerves because it's going to help blood sugars. So this is why you should make walking
- **[07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Hobt4Pb4iA&t=462s)** — a very important good habit in your life. Now just to balance this video, I think the next
- **[07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Hobt4Pb4iA&t=468s)** — video for you to watch is the importance of high intensity interval training. Check it out.
- **[07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Hobt4Pb4iA&t=474s)** — I put it right here.

*Click any timestamp to jump to that moment in the video*

- **[00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ixf0DFExhq0&t=0s)** — I like to talk about the science of inflammation.
- **[00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ixf0DFExhq0&t=2s)** — Unfortunately, a lot of people have inflammation. They go to the doctor.
- **[00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ixf0DFExhq0&t=5s)** — They get put on a certain medication. And that's pretty much it.
- **[00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ixf0DFExhq0&t=8s)** — But they're covering up the root cause. Dealing with inflammation goes way beyond just taking some fish oils.
- **[00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ixf0DFExhq0&t=13s)** — And I've been very lucky to be in practice for over 30 years to really see the underlying root causes of inflammation.
- **[00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ixf0DFExhq0&t=20s)** — Because some of these causes are not in the medical literature.
- **[00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ixf0DFExhq0&t=23s)** — Inflammation is an immune reaction. It's not just about treating a pathogen or some virus or bacteria.
- **[00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ixf0DFExhq0&t=30s)** — The problem is when inflammation goes on too long, that's when we get all sorts of problems.
- **[00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ixf0DFExhq0&t=35s)** — Like cancer. Cancer tends to invade areas of inflammation.
- **[00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ixf0DFExhq0&t=40s)** — And anytime we have inflammation, we also have a lack of oxygen.
- **[00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ixf0DFExhq0&t=44s)** — And both inflammation and hypoxia causes cancer to grow more aggressively.
- **[00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ixf0DFExhq0&t=50s)** — Let's start with the first one. Fibromyalgia.
- **[00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ixf0DFExhq0&t=53s)** — Which is inflammation that spreads throughout the entire body.
- **[00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ixf0DFExhq0&t=56s)** — Now, one time when I was in practice, I reached out to my patients to find out who had fibromyalgia.
- **[01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ixf0DFExhq0&t=62s)** — 100% of all of these patients had fibromyalgia only on the right side of their body.
- **[01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ixf0DFExhq0&t=68s)** — As I was digging in further, I found out that they all had problems underneath the red rib cage.
- **[01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ixf0DFExhq0&t=74s)** — That's where you have the little tubes that are called bile ducts.
- **[01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ixf0DFExhq0&t=78s)** — And sometimes the bile that's supposed to flow from the liver into the gallbladder becomes thickened.
- **[01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ixf0DFExhq0&t=84s)** — And it can create a backup of bile into the liver.
- **[01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ixf0DFExhq0&t=89s)** — And that bile is like a detergent. It can irritate the liver.
- **[01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ixf0DFExhq0&t=92s)** — And it can cause pain that radiates up into the right shoulder, up into the neck, from something called bile sludge.
- **[01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ixf0DFExhq0&t=99s)** — I did something very interesting. I had them massage underneath the right rib cage.
- **[01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ixf0DFExhq0&t=104s)** — Just to hold that pressure for about a minute.
- **[01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ixf0DFExhq0&t=107s)** — And then I would re-evaluate the pain. It went down to almost zero.
- **[01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ixf0DFExhq0&t=111s)** — I put them all on a remedy of taking bile salts with their food and also on an empty stomach.
- **[01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ixf0DFExhq0&t=117s)** — One type of bile salt is called tutka. And that just kind of really opens up that flow.
- **[02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ixf0DFExhq0&t=122s)** — And a person can see huge results very quickly.
- **[02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ixf0DFExhq0&t=126s)** — If someone has fibromyalgia through the entire body, it's usually not coming from the gallbladder.
- **[02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ixf0DFExhq0&t=131s)** — It's usually coming from a virus that has come out of remission.
- **[02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ixf0DFExhq0&t=135s)** — Epstein-Barr virus is shingles. Another one is the herpes viruses.
- **[02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ixf0DFExhq0&t=139s)** — And all those viruses come out when your immune system is weak.
- **[02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ixf0DFExhq0&t=143s)** — What happens with stress is it activates cortisol. And cortisol suppresses the immune system.
- **[02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ixf0DFExhq0&t=148s)** — The next thing that can cause pain is Lyme disease. Lyme can create a lot of inflammation in your body.
- **[02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ixf0DFExhq0&t=153s)** — It downgrades your ability to use vitamin D.
- **[02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ixf0DFExhq0&t=158s)** — Vitamin D, hands down, is the most important vitamin for your immune system.
- **[02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ixf0DFExhq0&t=162s)** — Vitamin D does two things. It will increase the immune system or bring down the immune system
- **[02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ixf0DFExhq0&t=168s)** — if your immune system is overactive. So it's the ultimate solution for both problems.
- **[02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ixf0DFExhq0&t=174s)** — Next one is old injuries. As you age, you get things like arthritis, stiffness.
- **[03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ixf0DFExhq0&t=181s)** — I am the poster child of old injuries. I broke my left elbow in 30 places.
- **[03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ixf0DFExhq0&t=186s)** — My left shoulder. I broke my neck. Other than that, I did pretty good.
- **[03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ixf0DFExhq0&t=190s)** — You are going to have to constantly work on stretching, not just your ligaments and muscles,
- **[03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ixf0DFExhq0&t=195s)** — but something more important. And that's called your fascia.
- **[03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ixf0DFExhq0&t=199s)** — My worst enemy, and your worst enemy if you have this, is being sedentary.
- **[03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ixf0DFExhq0&t=204s)** — You have to keep moving, keep stretching. The next one is inflammatory oncotaxis.
- **[03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ixf0DFExhq0&t=210s)** — That is a situation where cancer spreads into areas of inflammation.
- **[03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ixf0DFExhq0&t=215s)** — For example, if you are a smoker, you'll have inflammation in the lungs from damage.
- **[03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ixf0DFExhq0&t=220s)** — Cancer will spread into that area a lot easier. I will get to some really powerful strategies in a minute.
- **[03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ixf0DFExhq0&t=226s)** — Next one is food allergies. If you're eating something that is irritating your colon,
- **[03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ixf0DFExhq0&t=231s)** — whether it's gluten or a peanut or soy, you're going to get constant inflammation.
- **[03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ixf0DFExhq0&t=238s)** — This is basically the gut-brain axis. Whatever is going down here, it's going to affect up here.
- **[04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ixf0DFExhq0&t=243s)** — It's pretty wild how whole grains are really promoted as a health food, and we should eat more of them.
- **[04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ixf0DFExhq0&t=249s)** — Not if we don't want gut inflammation. When you have leaky gut or bleeding gums,
- **[04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ixf0DFExhq0&t=254s)** — what happens is certain microbes can get into the body, go into the bloodstream, and create a lot of problems.
- **[04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ixf0DFExhq0&t=261s)** — One of the things that can create gingivitis is a severe vitamin C deficiency,
- **[04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ixf0DFExhq0&t=265s)** — because you're eating too much sugar or carbs, and then you start getting a breakdown in the collagen.
- **[04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ixf0DFExhq0&t=270s)** — The microbes are there to help build up this mucus layer, to kind of create a barrier.
- **[04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ixf0DFExhq0&t=276s)** — If those microbes are missing because you took an antibiotic, now we don't have that protective layer,
- **[04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ixf0DFExhq0&t=282s)** — and now we have an imbalance between the good bacteria and the bad bacteria.
- **[04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ixf0DFExhq0&t=286s)** — We get an overgrowth, and then we have all sorts of issues with the gut.
- **[04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ixf0DFExhq0&t=289s)** — Next one involves cortisol. People that have high levels of cortisol have a lot of inflammation
- **[04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ixf0DFExhq0&t=294s)** — because they have developed something called cortisol resistance,
- **[04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ixf0DFExhq0&t=299s)** — where you have too much of a certain hormone, and then all of a sudden the receptors don't work anymore.
- **[05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ixf0DFExhq0&t=304s)** — Now we have the opposite effect. If cortisol is an anti-inflammatory, now we just get more inflammation.
- **[05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ixf0DFExhq0&t=309s)** — Another big one is consuming junk food. I'm really talking about sugar, and I'm not talking about just regular sugar,
- **[05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ixf0DFExhq0&t=315s)** — I'm talking about the junky industrial synthetic sugars.
- **[05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ixf0DFExhq0&t=319s)** — And then we have something else, which is interesting. It's a hidden sugar. It's actually a starch.
- **[05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ixf0DFExhq0&t=323s)** — Modified corn starch, modified food starch, maltodextrin.
- **[05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ixf0DFExhq0&t=327s)** — And an average person consumes over 150 pounds of this stuff every single year.
- **[05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ixf0DFExhq0&t=332s)** — It will spike your blood sugar super high, and it will keep you inflamed.
- **[05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ixf0DFExhq0&t=336s)** — I said sugar, starch, and seed oils. It's the worst of the worst.
- **[05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ixf0DFExhq0&t=341s)** — These seed oils are fats that don't really provide energy.
- **[05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ixf0DFExhq0&t=345s)** — There's a cell right here. These seed oils get locked into the membranes,
- **[05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ixf0DFExhq0&t=349s)** — and they affect the function of the cell. It's very hard to get these seed oils out of the body.
- **[05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ixf0DFExhq0&t=355s)** — If you stop eating them, it will probably take a year and a half to completely get them out of the system,
- **[06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ixf0DFExhq0&t=360s)** — and I highly recommend you do that. And an average person consumes between five and eight gallons every single year.
- **[06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ixf0DFExhq0&t=366s)** — Next one is having too much visceral fat. That's the fat around the organs.
- **[06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ixf0DFExhq0&t=372s)** — If you consume too much sugar, starch, or seed oil, you start developing insulin resistance.
- **[06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ixf0DFExhq0&t=377s)** — Insulin is not going into the fat cell. All that fat now is stored outside the fat cell.
- **[06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ixf0DFExhq0&t=382s)** — And that's all the fat in your liver, around your organs.
- **[06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ixf0DFExhq0&t=386s)** — Next one, autoimmune diseases are even more common than heart disease and cancer.
- **[06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ixf0DFExhq0&t=392s)** — Normally you have certain T-cells, it's part of the immune system, to prevent that from happening.
- **[06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ixf0DFExhq0&t=398s)** — And when that cell becomes diminished or dysfunctional, a person will develop an autoimmune disease.
- **[06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ixf0DFExhq0&t=404s)** — We have an overreactive immune system. Another one is soy protein isolates.
- **[06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ixf0DFExhq0&t=411s)** — It's in protein powders, fake meats, and even certain diets.
- **[06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ixf0DFExhq0&t=415s)** — And then you're going to use that as a protein to help your body.
- **[06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ixf0DFExhq0&t=418s)** — I know people that came into my practice consuming a lot of that protein.
- **[07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ixf0DFExhq0&t=422s)** — And a large percentage of them came in with a lot of inflammation around the liver.
- **[07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ixf0DFExhq0&t=428s)** — I took them off that product and it cleared up.
- **[07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ixf0DFExhq0&t=432s)** — Next one is EMF, electromagnetic fields.
- **[07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ixf0DFExhq0&t=436s)** — If you do a lot of talking like this, you're going to get a lot of electromagnetic fields into your brain.
- **[07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ixf0DFExhq0&t=444s)** — That can create inflammation.
- **[07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ixf0DFExhq0&t=446s)** — I had someone come in my house and scan the entire house for EMF radiation.
- **[07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ixf0DFExhq0&t=452s)** — At the time I had palpitations and I was trying every nutritional remedy.
- **[07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ixf0DFExhq0&t=457s)** — And I also had insomnia.
- **[07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ixf0DFExhq0&t=458s)** — As soon as this individual came close to scanning around my bed, the meter just went off the chart.
- **[07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ixf0DFExhq0&t=465s)** — It just started buzzing.
- **[07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ixf0DFExhq0&t=467s)** — It was behind the headboard and the wall where my bed was.
- **[07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ixf0DFExhq0&t=471s)** — And there were wires that were crossed, creating a magnetic field that extended 8 feet from the wall.
- **[07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ixf0DFExhq0&t=477s)** — I was literally being bathed in a magnet.
- **[08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ixf0DFExhq0&t=481s)** — As soon as we fixed that, all my palpitations completely went away and I started sleeping like a baby.
- **[08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ixf0DFExhq0&t=487s)** — Next one, certain medications.
- **[08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ixf0DFExhq0&t=489s)** — I'll guarantee you're going to have more inflammation as a side effect.
- **[08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ixf0DFExhq0&t=491s)** — That will lead to a problem and that will be treated with another medication and it just keeps going.
- **[08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ixf0DFExhq0&t=496s)** — There are people that I know on 15 different drugs, 20 different drugs.
- **[08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ixf0DFExhq0&t=500s)** — And I'll guarantee you some of the side effects from one drug is being treated by another drug.
- **[08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ixf0DFExhq0&t=505s)** — Their body is in a massive confusion.
- **[08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ixf0DFExhq0&t=506s)** — I recommend finding a good doctor to see what actual medications you absolutely need to take.
- **[08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ixf0DFExhq0&t=511s)** — And I would also ask them to help you wean off certain medications that you could potentially find another remedy to treat it for.
- **[08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ixf0DFExhq0&t=518s)** — Like a natural remedy.
- **[08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ixf0DFExhq0&t=519s)** — Next item to talk about is too much iron.
- **[08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ixf0DFExhq0&t=522s)** — Iron is very inflammatory to the point where you could develop cirrhosis of the liver just from having too much iron.
- **[08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ixf0DFExhq0&t=528s)** — Never take iron in a supplement.
- **[08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ixf0DFExhq0&t=529s)** — If you donate blood and you feel better, then you know you have an iron problem.
- **[08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ixf0DFExhq0&t=534s)** — One antidote is to increase your copper, which actually allows the iron to be more protected.
- **[09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ixf0DFExhq0&t=541s)** — Next one, if you have a fibroid, that can refer a lot of pain to the back.
- **[09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ixf0DFExhq0&t=545s)** — Well, one simple remedy is to up your vitamin D to 30,000 I use every single day.
- **[09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ixf0DFExhq0&t=550s)** — Next one, one really important clue for heart is if you exercise and you get winded too easily, get your heart checked out.
- **[09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ixf0DFExhq0&t=558s)** — A lot of times, that's the only symptom you're going to have with a heart problem. If any.
- **[09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ixf0DFExhq0&t=562s)** — Let's now talk about some common remedies that you want to add to these problems.
- **[09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ixf0DFExhq0&t=566s)** — Let's first talk about autoimmune diseases.
- **[09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ixf0DFExhq0&t=568s)** — You need to add vitamin D3.
- **[09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ixf0DFExhq0&t=570s)** — Anytime you take vitamin D3, always take magnesium, zinc, and K2.
- **[09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ixf0DFExhq0&t=574s)** — That way you have less side effects and things work a lot better.
- **[09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ixf0DFExhq0&t=577s)** — If you have autoimmune disease, you want to do this dairy probiotic using Elruderi.
- **[09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ixf0DFExhq0&t=582s)** — It's a dynamite remedy for many things. I will put that link down below.
- **[09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ixf0DFExhq0&t=585s)** — If you have autoimmune of your gut, I highly recommend you do the carnivore diet for a few months.
- **[09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ixf0DFExhq0&t=592s)** — And then maybe slowly reintroduce something like sauerkraut.
- **[09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ixf0DFExhq0&t=595s)** — Go on a low carb diet, cut down your sugars, starches, and seed oils.
- **[09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ixf0DFExhq0&t=599s)** — What's really important is intermittent fasting.
- **[10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ixf0DFExhq0&t=601s)** — I would do two meals a day. If you go to one meal a day, that's even better.
- **[10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ixf0DFExhq0&t=606s)** — That's automatically going to reduce your fat on your liver, your visceral fat.
- **[10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ixf0DFExhq0&t=610s)** — There goes inflammation. I do want to mention omega-3 fatty acids.
- **[10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ixf0DFExhq0&t=614s)** — Cobb liver oil is the best.
- **[10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ixf0DFExhq0&t=615s)** — And of course, with any inflammation at all, you always want to take vitamin D.
- **[10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ixf0DFExhq0&t=619s)** — I personally have been taking 40, maybe 50,000 I use of vitamin D every day.
- **[10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ixf0DFExhq0&t=625s)** — And don't forget about the sun. The sun will give you vitamin D for free.
- **[10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ixf0DFExhq0&t=628s)** — Last thing I want to mention, and this is fascinating.
- **[10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ixf0DFExhq0&t=631s)** — I develop a technique. I call it the opposite technique.
- **[10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ixf0DFExhq0&t=634s)** — Anywhere you hurt on the body, you can press on the opposite side and get rid of the pain.
- **[10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ixf0DFExhq0&t=640s)** — It's pretty wild. This is something they don't teach you in school.
- **[10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ixf0DFExhq0&t=642s)** — I will put a couple links down below so you can kind of see.
- **[10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ixf0DFExhq0&t=645s)** — If you have any pain or inflammation anywhere in the body, you might want to try that technique as well.
- **[10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ixf0DFExhq0&t=649s)** — And you'll be very impressed.
- **[10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ixf0DFExhq0&t=650s)** — Thanks for watching. I will see you in the next video.

- **[00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-7pN5UMV-Q&t=0s)** — Probably out of all the things to figure out if you're on the right diet or not, it's bloating.
- **[00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-7pN5UMV-Q&t=6s)** — When we're dealing with bloating, we're dealing with the small intestine. This is a tube that's
- **[00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-7pN5UMV-Q&t=10s)** — 22 feet long and it has a very large surface area. If we open it up and stretch it out,
- **[00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-7pN5UMV-Q&t=17s)** — the surface area is roughly about 2,700 square feet or about 250 square meters.
- **[00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-7pN5UMV-Q&t=24s)** — The bottom line is you have a lot of service area for absorption of food because 90% of
- **[00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-7pN5UMV-Q&t=29s)** — all your digestion and nutrition happens in the small intestine. If you get inflammation,
- **[00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-7pN5UMV-Q&t=35s)** — if you get an infection, or you take a medication, or you have food allergies,
- **[00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-7pN5UMV-Q&t=40s)** — all of this can irritate that lining and cut down the surface area of that absorption of
- **[00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-7pN5UMV-Q&t=47s)** — nutrients. And then you're left with nutritional deficiencies, vitamin D, as well as bile salts.
- **[00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-7pN5UMV-Q&t=53s)** — You're supposed to recycle these bile salts. So if you run out of bile, now we can't absorb
- **[00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-7pN5UMV-Q&t=58s)** — one of the purposes of bile is to get rid of excess cholesterol. There's a condition called
- **[01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-7pN5UMV-Q&t=64s)** — SIBO, small intestinal bacterial overgrowth. That's where you have a lot of microbes that
- **[01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-7pN5UMV-Q&t=72s)** — normally should be in the large intestine, but they're in the wrong place. When you eat food,
- **[01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-7pN5UMV-Q&t=76s)** — especially fiber and things like that, you start getting tremendous amounts of bloating
- **[01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-7pN5UMV-Q&t=81s)** — because you're getting this fermentation. See, fermentation is a different process,
- **[01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-7pN5UMV-Q&t=86s)** — that's supposed to be in the large intestine. And if it's in the small intestine, boy, you're
- **[01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-7pN5UMV-Q&t=91s)** — going to get gas in the wrong place, and it's going to extend and create a lot of bloating,
- **[01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-7pN5UMV-Q&t=96s)** — pain and discomfort. There are apparently certain microbes that can help it, but generally
- **[01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-7pN5UMV-Q&t=102s)** — speaking, I wouldn't recommend adding more probiotics down there because you already have
- **[01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-7pN5UMV-Q&t=106s)** — microbes there. On the flip side, let's say you don't have SIBO, you just have some type
- **[01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-7pN5UMV-Q&t=111s)** — of inflammation or damage or scar tissue in that small intestine. Why would that be? How
- **[01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-7pN5UMV-Q&t=115s)** — would you end up with that? Well, usually it comes from eating processed foods early on,
- **[02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-7pN5UMV-Q&t=121s)** — seed oils, the synthetic starches, the synthetic sugars too. So all that creates inflammation,
- **[02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-7pN5UMV-Q&t=127s)** — it depletes your nutrients, it feeds the pathogens, and now you have this inflammatory
- **[02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-7pN5UMV-Q&t=133s)** — condition. Realize the more inflammation you have, the less you can absorb in the small
- **[02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-7pN5UMV-Q&t=138s)** — intestine. The solution is to do carnivore for a couple months, at least to clean out the gut
- **[02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-7pN5UMV-Q&t=144s)** — while you also do intermittent fasting. It'd probably be beneficial if you took
- **[02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-7pN5UMV-Q&t=148s)** — betaine hydrochloride as an acidifier to actually help strengthen the stomach. If
- **[02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-7pN5UMV-Q&t=154s)** — you're constantly shoving food down this pipe, you don't have a chance to let it go through,
- **[02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-7pN5UMV-Q&t=159s)** — it keeps the bacteria just growing. So we have those two conditions, but we also have
- **[02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-7pN5UMV-Q&t=165s)** — another condition where you don't have SIBO, but you have bloating. And you might have other
- **[02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-7pN5UMV-Q&t=170s)** — issues too, like constipation. And your stool might float, which means you're not digesting
- **[02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-7pN5UMV-Q&t=179s)** — your fats. And it could be either your gallbladder, your pancreas,
- **[03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-7pN5UMV-Q&t=183s)** — or it could be some type of dysfunction with your digestion. So in some cases,
- **[03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-7pN5UMV-Q&t=188s)** — it might be beneficial to cut back on your fiber and then slowly increase it, because
- **[03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-7pN5UMV-Q&t=195s)** — that way you're feeding the microbes, you have better digestion, and you have better stool.
- **[03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-7pN5UMV-Q&t=199s)** — I consume a lot of fiber from plants, right, from salads and things like that. I don't get
- **[03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-7pN5UMV-Q&t=204s)** — them from grain or bran, because it's too much of a refined product. When you have a salad,
- **[03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-7pN5UMV-Q&t=208s)** — you're eating the whole thing. There's just a lot of benefits in that salad,
- **[03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-7pN5UMV-Q&t=212s)** — beyond the fiber to the microbes, even the phytonutrients can help these microbes to a
- **[03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-7pN5UMV-Q&t=217s)** — certain degree. But the way to get more microbes is to slowly increase the amount of like
- **[03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-7pN5UMV-Q&t=223s)** — salads you eat, starting off with maybe a couple cups to then gradually over some weeks,
- **[03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-7pN5UMV-Q&t=228s)** — more and more and more and more, where you're doing like seven or more cups per day. But if
- **[03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-7pN5UMV-Q&t=234s)** — you want to increase the diversity of microbes, which will make things even better, then you use
- **[03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-7pN5UMV-Q&t=238s)** — different types of plants. You can also do fasting to increase the diversity as well.
- **[04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-7pN5UMV-Q&t=243s)** — Vitamin B1, though, is another really important factor for constipation, because B1
- **[04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-7pN5UMV-Q&t=249s)** — is all about supporting the nervous system. Another thing that can help that is having
- **[04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-7pN5UMV-Q&t=253s)** — magnesium, as well as potassium, and even sodium. So you need these electrolytes
- **[04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-7pN5UMV-Q&t=260s)** — for the prefrontal cramping of the colon. The absolute best way to know if what you're eating
- **[04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-7pN5UMV-Q&t=265s)** — is the right diet is to see how you bloat. Okay, to see if there's any bloating or not.
- **[04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-7pN5UMV-Q&t=272s)** — If the stools are coming out really good, there's no bloating, no pain, you're feeling good,
- **[04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-7pN5UMV-Q&t=277s)** — then whatever diet you're on, don't change anything. And I created another really popular
- **[04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-7pN5UMV-Q&t=283s)** — video that's a little bit more in depth on bloating. And if you haven't seen that one,
- **[04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-7pN5UMV-Q&t=286s)** — I put it up right here. Check it out.

- **[00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmkoFDMAvkc&t=0s)** — So let's talk about the best oil to deep fry your foods in. Well, you should probably use
- **[00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmkoFDMAvkc&t=5s)** — something healthy like vegetable oil, right? Because you can see these healthy vegetables here.
- **[00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmkoFDMAvkc&t=11s)** — And you can see this one is Clover Valley. So it's probably a beautiful farm, rolling hills,
- **[00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmkoFDMAvkc&t=16s)** — and Clover where they make this vegetable oil. And it's pure vegetable oil. It's actually
- **[00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmkoFDMAvkc&t=22s)** — considered heart healthy on the label. There's just a little bit of saturated fat in here.
- **[00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmkoFDMAvkc&t=26s)** — It's two grams. There's no sugar. There's no trans fats. And there's no gluten. And so this
- **[00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmkoFDMAvkc&t=34s)** — is pretty much the best oil you should use to deep fry your food. And I hope you know that I
- **[00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmkoFDMAvkc&t=39s)** — am completely and utterly sarcastic today. We're going to talk about seed oils right here.
- **[00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmkoFDMAvkc&t=47s)** — And then I'm going to show you what I think you should do regarding the deep fried oils.
- **[00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmkoFDMAvkc&t=52s)** — Seed oils are called polyunsaturated fatty acids. Poly meaning many. Unsaturated
- **[00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmkoFDMAvkc&t=59s)** — mean a type of oil that it's very, very fragile and unstable. Now the first thing you need to
- **[01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmkoFDMAvkc&t=65s)** — know is that when they talk about vegetable oils, they're really talking about seed oils.
- **[01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmkoFDMAvkc&t=70s)** — I know they have pictures of vegetables, but this is not where they're getting the oil from.
- **[01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmkoFDMAvkc&t=73s)** — It comes from corn, soy, canola, things like that. They're considered one part of the
- **[01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmkoFDMAvkc&t=82s)** — processing where they're heating, adding hexane, which is a solvent that's in gasoline.
- **[01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmkoFDMAvkc&t=88s)** — And so they go through this incredible refining process where you end up with this
- **[01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmkoFDMAvkc&t=91s)** — very refined empty oil. And one of the reasons they do this is so it can sit on the shelf
- **[01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmkoFDMAvkc&t=97s)** — for a long period of time. We consume like 25 to 30% of our calories with this right here.
- **[01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmkoFDMAvkc&t=105s)** — Yeah, incredible. You start reading the ingredients and it's in almost everything.
- **[01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmkoFDMAvkc&t=110s)** — When you fry foods in these oils, you're basically frying other
- **[01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmkoFDMAvkc&t=115s)** — alter process ingredients in this alter process ingredient. For example, let's say you have a
- **[02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmkoFDMAvkc&t=121s)** — donut, right? Which is pure alter process food and you're going to deep fry it in the seed
- **[02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmkoFDMAvkc&t=126s)** — oil. You're going to heat a starch or sugar with a fat. That's going to create
- **[02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmkoFDMAvkc&t=133s)** — really sticky proteins in our bodies. It's called glycation and that sticky protein is
- **[02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmkoFDMAvkc&t=139s)** — going to gunk everything up and make it dysfunctional. And let's say, for example,
- **[02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmkoFDMAvkc&t=143s)** — we're going to deep fry some chicken, right? We're not just going to deep fry chicken. We
- **[02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmkoFDMAvkc&t=146s)** — have to coat the chicken with an alter process ingredient, maybe with a starch, right?
- **[02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmkoFDMAvkc&t=153s)** — So now we're combining heat with fat with protein. That's again going to create this
- **[02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmkoFDMAvkc&t=160s)** — sticky substance that's going to kind of clog everything up. Now, when you go to a fast
- **[02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmkoFDMAvkc&t=165s)** — food restaurant, they don't just use this oil once. They use it like a hundred times
- **[02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmkoFDMAvkc&t=171s)** — and they're going to keep reheating it and reheating it and reheating it day after day
- **[02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmkoFDMAvkc&t=175s)** — cooking your food. And the more they heat it, the more toxic the food is. And a couple
- **[03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmkoFDMAvkc&t=182s)** — more things I want to bring up about seed oils before I move on. But seed oils were
- **[03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmkoFDMAvkc&t=186s)** — never meant to be consumed, okay? Even like in 1865, when they kind of found a process to
- **[03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmkoFDMAvkc&t=194s)** — develop these seed oils, it wasn't meant for human consumption, okay? These polyunsaturated
- **[03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmkoFDMAvkc&t=199s)** — fatty acids are meant to support our membranes of ourselves. Now the membranes are around our
- **[03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmkoFDMAvkc&t=208s)** — cells. Also, if you look inside the cell, you have all these little things that do the work.
- **[03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmkoFDMAvkc&t=214s)** — Each thing has a bag around it, which is a membrane. They allow things to communicate back
- **[03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmkoFDMAvkc&t=220s)** — and forth. But you also have the mitochondria in here. And the mitochondria is really important
- **[03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmkoFDMAvkc&t=224s)** — because nearly every disease relates to dysfunctional mitochondria. And the seed oils can actually
- **[03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmkoFDMAvkc&t=230s)** — get into the membranes and replace the membranes. And so if you're replacing the
- **[03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmkoFDMAvkc&t=234s)** — membranes with this material, it's not good. So I'm studying a book on membranes right
- **[04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmkoFDMAvkc&t=240s)** — here, Basic Principle of Membrane Technology. It's fascinating because it goes into the
- **[04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmkoFDMAvkc&t=245s)** — chemistry of membranes and how amazing they are. And also in this book right here,
- **[04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmkoFDMAvkc&t=251s)** — The Ancestral Diet Revolution, How Vegetable Oils and Processed Foods
- **[04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmkoFDMAvkc&t=255s)** — Destroy Our Health and How to Recover. Here's a picture of a kid who's smoking, right? Well,
- **[04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmkoFDMAvkc&t=262s)** — the oxidative stress that occurs with smoking kind of poisons us for about six months to a
- **[04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmkoFDMAvkc&t=268s)** — year after quitting. But we consume the seed oils, right? It's going to poison us for about
- **[04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmkoFDMAvkc&t=274s)** — three years after just one serving in cooking oil. Yeah, there's some fascinating data. So
- **[04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmkoFDMAvkc&t=282s)** — these oils were never meant for fuel, like other fats. And the biggest damaging effect from
- **[04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmkoFDMAvkc&t=288s)** — these seed oils is what they do to your mitochondria. And this is why seed oils lead
- **[04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmkoFDMAvkc&t=293s)** — to insulin resistance. Of course, from there you have a fatty liver, obesity, heart
- **[04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmkoFDMAvkc&t=299s)** — disease, increase your risk for cancer, etc, etc, etc. So anytime you add heat to seed oils,
- **[05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmkoFDMAvkc&t=304s)** — and by the way, they're already heated when you get them, you create more toxicity and they
- **[05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmkoFDMAvkc&t=310s)** — actually give off a lot of byproducts that creates a lot of... it's called oxidation.
- **[05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmkoFDMAvkc&t=316s)** — You can look at oxidation like rusting out something, but the seed oils are not being
- **[05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmkoFDMAvkc&t=321s)** — burned up as fuel in the body. So they kind of get lodged and stored in the body. And they
- **[05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmkoFDMAvkc&t=326s)** — gunk up everything. Now let's look at the oils that you could use if you wanted to deep fry
- **[05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmkoFDMAvkc&t=331s)** — something. So this graph represents something called the peroxidation. That's that in the
- **[05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmkoFDMAvkc&t=337s)** — process of being oxidized stage, soybean is the highest, right? So it creates a lot of
- **[05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmkoFDMAvkc&t=344s)** — problems. And then we have corn oil, then we have sunflower oil, and then canola. And then
- **[05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmkoFDMAvkc&t=350s)** — beef, tailo, and coconut. So if you wanted to deep fry something, you have options. You have
- **[05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmkoFDMAvkc&t=358s)** — avocado oil, you have coconut oil, you have palm oil, you have olive oil, then you have
- **[06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmkoFDMAvkc&t=366s)** — tailo, and then you have butter or ghee. So you could potentially use any one of those
- **[06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmkoFDMAvkc&t=372s)** — oils. Now here's the problem. You probably shouldn't be deep frying any food at high heat
- **[06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmkoFDMAvkc&t=378s)** — because no matter what oil that you use, high heat is going to create problems. Avocado oil,
- **[06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmkoFDMAvkc&t=384s)** — if you get it really refined, it's going to create more damage. If you get it like healthier
- **[06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmkoFDMAvkc&t=389s)** — when we're actually the color of its green and it's cold process, you probably should just put
- **[06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmkoFDMAvkc&t=394s)** — on your salad and not use it with heat. But avocado oil does have higher amounts of
- **[06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmkoFDMAvkc&t=400s)** — monounsaturated, which is going to oxidize less. Just like olive oil, which is high in
- **[06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmkoFDMAvkc&t=404s)** — monounsaturated fats, you get a lot of the protective factors as well. Same with coconut
- **[06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmkoFDMAvkc&t=409s)** — oil and palm oil, but those may smoke a lot more when heating. So maybe like a moderate heat
- **[06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmkoFDMAvkc&t=414s)** — or maybe a stir fry or even pan-fried, that would be a lot better. And then you get to
- **[07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmkoFDMAvkc&t=421s)** — tailo, beef fat, because that's going to be much better for you. You can also use ghee,
- **[07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmkoFDMAvkc&t=425s)** — which is a little bit better than butter if you're cooking it to a higher heat. But with
- **[07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmkoFDMAvkc&t=430s)** — with like eggs and things or stir frying vegetables, you're not going to heat it
- **[07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmkoFDMAvkc&t=436s)** — to the point where it's so hot that you're going to get smoking. And I think you're going
- **[07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmkoFDMAvkc&t=440s)** — to enjoy the flavor from just using butter. I think pan-frying is going to be much better.
- **[07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmkoFDMAvkc&t=445s)** — If you can do an air fryer, that would be awesome because you don't have to use any oils.
- **[07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmkoFDMAvkc&t=451s)** — And then of course you have stir frying. That's a good one too. Now, since I did
- **[07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmkoFDMAvkc&t=454s)** — mention this deep fried chicken, I know you're probably hungry right now and you're

- **[00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2JcmyEoKos&t=0s)** — You know, the worst thing you could do to a person is take away their peanuts.
- **[00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2JcmyEoKos&t=3s)** — Okay, and I'm not going to do that.
- **[00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2JcmyEoKos&t=5s)** — I'm just going to talk about what type of peanuts you should focus more on.
- **[00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2JcmyEoKos&t=9s)** — Because if you end up buying the wrong type of peanuts or peanut butter,
- **[00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2JcmyEoKos&t=13s)** — you may find that your health is going to suffer.
- **[00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2JcmyEoKos&t=16s)** — There's this one ingredient in 80% of all peanut butter you don't want in your body.
- **[00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2JcmyEoKos&t=22s)** — And if you eat the right type of peanut butter or peanuts,
- **[00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2JcmyEoKos&t=25s)** — I don't think there's going to be a lot of health issues.
- **[00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2JcmyEoKos&t=28s)** — But I recently started the carnivore diet just to test it out for a couple of weeks.
- **[00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2JcmyEoKos&t=32s)** — From the elimination of the nuts, my bloating went away.
- **[00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2JcmyEoKos&t=36s)** — So I'm not going back to peanuts. You can if it doesn't bloat you.
- **[00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2JcmyEoKos&t=41s)** — But I have also gone back to vegetables as well.
- **[00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2JcmyEoKos&t=44s)** — So my diet right now is a combination.
- **[00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2JcmyEoKos&t=46s)** — It's like 50% carnivore and 50% plant-based because I do like my salads.
- **[00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2JcmyEoKos&t=51s)** — But let's talk about the difference between conventional peanut butter or peanuts.
- **[00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2JcmyEoKos&t=55s)** — Now when you're consuming conventional peanuts,
- **[00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2JcmyEoKos&t=59s)** — unfortunately peanuts are probably one of the most heavily sprayed with pesticides and insecticides
- **[01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2JcmyEoKos&t=65s)** — and especially fungicides out of many different things that you might eat.
- **[01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2JcmyEoKos&t=70s)** — A peanut is not an actual nut. It's a legume.
- **[01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2JcmyEoKos&t=73s)** — And so when they spray, it gets into soil and it gets down into where the peanut is.
- **[01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2JcmyEoKos&t=78s)** — And this peanut shell is very, very thin.
- **[01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2JcmyEoKos&t=80s)** — Unlike a walnut, which has a hard shell, you really need to do organic peanuts or peanut butter.
- **[01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2JcmyEoKos&t=87s)** — Okay, that's number one.
- **[01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2JcmyEoKos&t=88s)** — There's also an herbicide called glyphosate, which can act like an antibiotic.
- **[01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2JcmyEoKos&t=93s)** — It's in a lot of different GMO foods.
- **[01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2JcmyEoKos&t=95s)** — And that's been known to be in peanuts simply because they rotate the crops from a GMO food to a peanut back and forth.
- **[01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2JcmyEoKos&t=102s)** — I think it's cottonseed or it could be canola.
- **[01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2JcmyEoKos&t=105s)** — I'm not 100% sure.
- **[01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2JcmyEoKos&t=106s)** — The other thing is you must read the label because if it says hydrogenated anything, don't consume that.
- **[01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2JcmyEoKos&t=115s)** — Now, you maybe have heard of partially hydrogenated, which gave you all these trans fats.
- **[02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2JcmyEoKos&t=120s)** — Well, what's the difference between hydrogenated and partially hydrogenated?
- **[02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2JcmyEoKos&t=124s)** — Really, I think from my own viewpoint, it's very, very similar.
- **[02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2JcmyEoKos&t=127s)** — Even though they say that hydrogenate doesn't have the trans fats,
- **[02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2JcmyEoKos&t=130s)** — you're basically using the same process of adding hydrogens under high heat and then it becomes partially hydrogenated.
- **[02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2JcmyEoKos&t=138s)** — And then they leave it in longer and then becomes fully hydrogenated.
- **[02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2JcmyEoKos&t=142s)** — And so you want to avoid anything that says hydrogenated or partially hydrogenated.
- **[02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2JcmyEoKos&t=146s)** — Also, they sneak in vegetable oils, which are not vegetables.
- **[02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2JcmyEoKos&t=151s)** — They're seed oils.
- **[02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2JcmyEoKos&t=152s)** — They put this in the peanut butter.
- **[02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2JcmyEoKos&t=155s)** — So you just don't want to even have that in your body.
- **[02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2JcmyEoKos&t=157s)** — The other thing that slips in there is this sugar.
- **[02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2JcmyEoKos&t=160s)** — Sometimes family members will buy peanut butter, right?
- **[02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2JcmyEoKos&t=162s)** — And I'll start consuming it on something.
- **[02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2JcmyEoKos&t=164s)** — I'm like, wow, this is really good.
- **[02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2JcmyEoKos&t=165s)** — And I'm like, oh, let me read the label.
- **[02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2JcmyEoKos&t=168s)** — This is why it's so good because it has sugar in it.
- **[02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2JcmyEoKos&t=170s)** — But there's one more ingredient that's a carcinogen.
- **[02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2JcmyEoKos&t=173s)** — It can increase the risk of certain cancers by 46 percent.
- **[02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2JcmyEoKos&t=177s)** — And that ingredient is monoglycerides.
- **[03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2JcmyEoKos&t=181s)** — There's a French study that links it to cancer.
- **[03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2JcmyEoKos&t=185s)** — So we don't want that in our diets.
- **[03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2JcmyEoKos&t=187s)** — And they use it just to kind of break things up.
- **[03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2JcmyEoKos&t=189s)** — So you don't have that layer of oil at the top.
- **[03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2JcmyEoKos&t=191s)** — So if you find a peanut butter that has all of those factors,
- **[03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2JcmyEoKos&t=195s)** — I would upgrade to a better quality peanut butter.
- **[03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2JcmyEoKos&t=198s)** — Okay, peanuts and salt. Pretty natural.
- **[03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2JcmyEoKos&t=201s)** — If we want to improve it more, we want organic peanuts and sea salt.
- **[03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2JcmyEoKos&t=205s)** — If we want to improve it even a little bit more,
- **[03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2JcmyEoKos&t=207s)** — I would recommend Valencia organic peanuts.
- **[03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2JcmyEoKos&t=211s)** — They're the ones that have the least amount of potential aflatoxin,
- **[03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2JcmyEoKos&t=215s)** — which is a toxin from certain molds that can grow on peanuts,
- **[03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2JcmyEoKos&t=220s)** — which is very, very damaging to the liver.
- **[03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2JcmyEoKos&t=223s)** — And they use sea salt, which is better than regular table salt.
- **[03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2JcmyEoKos&t=226s)** — Sometimes it's really hard to not overdo it with peanuts or peanut butter.
- **[03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2JcmyEoKos&t=230s)** — I know if I sit down and start eating peanuts,
- **[03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2JcmyEoKos&t=232s)** — I will pretty much eat the whole bag.
- **[03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2JcmyEoKos&t=234s)** — And I can feel this like heavy feeling underneath my rib cage.
- **[03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2JcmyEoKos&t=238s)** — That's my gallbladder trying to digest these fats.
- **[04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2JcmyEoKos&t=242s)** — One more point about peanuts and peanut butter.
- **[04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2JcmyEoKos&t=244s)** — If you can have them with the meal, that's better than a snack,
- **[04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2JcmyEoKos&t=248s)** — especially if you're snacking late at night,
- **[04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2JcmyEoKos&t=250s)** — because anything that you consume of any significance as far as calories
- **[04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2JcmyEoKos&t=254s)** — can spike the insulin.
- **[04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2JcmyEoKos&t=256s)** — And if you're into intermittent fasting,
- **[04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2JcmyEoKos&t=259s)** — nuts are a dangerous item to have around, especially late at night.
- **[04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2JcmyEoKos&t=264s)** — Now, since we're on the topic of nuts,
- **[04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2JcmyEoKos&t=265s)** — if you have not seen my video on walnuts,
- **[04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2JcmyEoKos&t=268s)** — you might want to check that out.
- **[04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2JcmyEoKos&t=270s)** — I put it up right here.

## Full Transcript with Timestamps

*Click any timestamp to jump to that moment in the video*

- **[00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJeTsPEiXRA&t=0s)** — Today I want to discuss the real common mistakes that people make that end up keeping them very unhealthy.
- **[00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJeTsPEiXRA&t=7s)** — This information becomes very important as you age, especially over 50, but if you're younger, take notes.
- **[00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJeTsPEiXRA&t=12s)** — And you're definitely not going to find this information if you just ask your average doctor.
- **[00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJeTsPEiXRA&t=16s)** — They're not expert in nutrition. They just don't get the training.
- **[00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJeTsPEiXRA&t=20s)** — Whatever they recommend, go in the opposite direction. It's about giving you a label for a certain condition that's very descriptive and then matching that with a medication.
- **[00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJeTsPEiXRA&t=29s)** — I'm a lot more interested in getting to the root cause.
- **[00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJeTsPEiXRA&t=32s)** — Number one, you want to really make sure that the source of your information that you get is based on someone who has a lot of experience and results in the problem you're trying to solve.
- **[00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJeTsPEiXRA&t=40s)** — Number two, be very careful about accepting a diagnosis that just doesn't seem right.
- **[00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJeTsPEiXRA&t=44s)** — Number three, make sure that the solution or the treatment that you get doesn't create more problems than your current symptoms, aka side effects.
- **[00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJeTsPEiXRA&t=53s)** — And that relates to this next point.
- **[00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJeTsPEiXRA&t=55s)** — If you expose yourself to too much stress, it kind of gets stuck into your mind and you're trying to go to bed and you can't sleep and you're worrying and you're in this constant state of fear.
- **[01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJeTsPEiXRA&t=63s)** — Unfortunately, nowadays it's almost impossible to avoid it because it's everywhere.
- **[01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJeTsPEiXRA&t=67s)** — The next thing I want to talk about before I get into nutrition is your environment.
- **[01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJeTsPEiXRA&t=71s)** — I didn't realize at first how important your environment was until I had this great opportunity to move out of the city into the farm.
- **[01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJeTsPEiXRA&t=79s)** — I'm going to tell you, having that space is such a therapy.
- **[01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJeTsPEiXRA&t=83s)** — It's going into nature. It's so important to do this on a regular basis.
- **[01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJeTsPEiXRA&t=86s)** — And the next thing is regular, consistent exercise.
- **[01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJeTsPEiXRA&t=90s)** — And what exercise does is it kind of flushes out the cortisol and the adrenaline that builds up just from being on this planet.
- **[01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJeTsPEiXRA&t=99s)** — If you exercise more on a wave versus a sustained high pulse rate exercise, it's healthier.
- **[01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJeTsPEiXRA&t=106s)** — Next point, what are the most important nutrients that you should be getting on a regular basis?
- **[01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJeTsPEiXRA&t=113s)** — The most important one is vitamin D.
- **[01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJeTsPEiXRA&t=116s)** — Think about your genetics. You have like 20,000 to 25,000 different genes.
- **[02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJeTsPEiXRA&t=122s)** — Did you know that vitamin D influences 10% of those genes?
- **[02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJeTsPEiXRA&t=125s)** — To create a therapeutic effect for vitamin D, you need to use 10,000, 20,000, 30,000, 50,000 or more of vitamin D3
- **[02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJeTsPEiXRA&t=135s)** — to really create an effect.
- **[02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJeTsPEiXRA&t=138s)** — There's a medical doctor who specializes in autoimmune diseases.
- **[02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJeTsPEiXRA&t=142s)** — This medical doctor gets results.
- **[02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJeTsPEiXRA&t=144s)** — He has over 900 videos on testimonials before and after that you can see just using high doses of vitamin D3.
- **[02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJeTsPEiXRA&t=153s)** — There's certain doctors that are using high doses of vitamin D3 to remodel certain parts of the eye and repair really difficult things like glaucoma.
- **[02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJeTsPEiXRA&t=163s)** — There's other doctors using high doses of vitamin D3 to shrink fibroids.
- **[02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJeTsPEiXRA&t=168s)** — So vitamin D is super super important for your health and of course getting more sun too and we just don't go outside enough.
- **[02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJeTsPEiXRA&t=173s)** — The second most important nutrient is magnesium.
- **[02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJeTsPEiXRA&t=176s)** — It's very rare that anyone gets enough magnesium.
- **[02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJeTsPEiXRA&t=179s)** — Magnesium is involved in thousands of different things in the body.
- **[03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJeTsPEiXRA&t=184s)** — Every different type of heart disease usually has a magnesium deficiency.
- **[03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJeTsPEiXRA&t=188s)** — But magnesium goes way beyond the heart.
- **[03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJeTsPEiXRA&t=189s)** — If you don't have enough magnesium, you can't make energy.
- **[03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJeTsPEiXRA&t=192s)** — So vitamin D, magnesium and number three is zinc.
- **[03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJeTsPEiXRA&t=195s)** — Zinc is a trace mineral. Zinc is very very important and a lot of people are deficient in zinc.
- **[03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJeTsPEiXRA&t=199s)** — And they all really depend on each other.
- **[03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJeTsPEiXRA&t=201s)** — In other words, you could be taking a lot of vitamin D3 and be very deficient in magnesium and zinc and vitamin D won't work.
- **[03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJeTsPEiXRA&t=207s)** — So you kind of need all three of those.
- **[03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJeTsPEiXRA&t=209s)** — And then the flip side, what are the two nutrients that you have to be careful of taking because they become very toxic?
- **[03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJeTsPEiXRA&t=215s)** — Number one, calcium.
- **[03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJeTsPEiXRA&t=216s)** — As we age, calcium tends to plug everything up.
- **[03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJeTsPEiXRA&t=220s)** — And guess what? Magnesium is the regulator of that.
- **[03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJeTsPEiXRA&t=222s)** — And so if you don't take magnesium enough on a regular basis, you're going to put yourself at risk for heart disease.
- **[03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJeTsPEiXRA&t=227s)** — Why? Because you don't have the controlling factor of calcium and it gets into the soft tissues.
- **[03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJeTsPEiXRA&t=233s)** — And then the other nutrient that's even more deadly than too much calcium is too much iron.
- **[03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJeTsPEiXRA&t=238s)** — We have an extreme difficulty in getting rid of iron.
- **[04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJeTsPEiXRA&t=242s)** — At the very most per day, we only get rid of 0.5 to 1 milligram of iron.
- **[04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJeTsPEiXRA&t=249s)** — Yet the RDA for iron is 8 milligrams.
- **[04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJeTsPEiXRA&t=253s)** — And if you're women of childbearing age, it's like 18 milligrams.
- **[04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJeTsPEiXRA&t=259s)** — We're taking in way too much iron.
- **[04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJeTsPEiXRA&t=261s)** — If you have too much iron, you're going to rust out your organs.
- **[04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJeTsPEiXRA&t=264s)** — You want to start looking at labels, start avoiding certain things to make sure you don't overload yourself with iron.
- **[04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJeTsPEiXRA&t=269s)** — Even if you have a genetic problem with iron, which is the person really is not deficient in iron.
- **[04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJeTsPEiXRA&t=274s)** — They just have an accumulation of iron in the wrong place.
- **[04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJeTsPEiXRA&t=277s)** — Iron is very, very toxic and I never recommend taking it in a supplement.
- **[04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJeTsPEiXRA&t=281s)** — Next mistake is to avoid salt.
- **[04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJeTsPEiXRA&t=283s)** — There's a difference between sea salt and table salt.
- **[04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJeTsPEiXRA&t=286s)** — I always recommend sea salt because sea salt has 84 minerals.
- **[04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJeTsPEiXRA&t=290s)** — If someone is salt sensitive, in reality, they're just deficient in potassium.
- **[04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJeTsPEiXRA&t=295s)** — Because potassium and sodium work together.
- **[04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJeTsPEiXRA&t=298s)** — And we need a considerable amount of sodium and you get that from sea salt.
- **[05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJeTsPEiXRA&t=301s)** — And when you're deficient in salt, your cortisol goes up.
- **[05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJeTsPEiXRA&t=304s)** — This can affect your sleeping. This can make you stressed.
- **[05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJeTsPEiXRA&t=307s)** — It's a very important electrolyte.
- **[05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJeTsPEiXRA&t=309s)** — The RDAs for potassium, you need 4,700 milligrams.
- **[05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJeTsPEiXRA&t=313s)** — That's also really important for generating energy for your nerves and your muscles every single day.
- **[05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJeTsPEiXRA&t=318s)** — I don't think anyone gets that.
- **[05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJeTsPEiXRA&t=319s)** — Next point, someone recently asked a question.
- **[05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJeTsPEiXRA&t=321s)** — What should I be doing as I go through menopause?
- **[05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJeTsPEiXRA&t=325s)** — And I said, well, make sure you're consuming enough cholesterol foods.
- **[05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJeTsPEiXRA&t=329s)** — You're like, what? Are you kidding?
- **[05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJeTsPEiXRA&t=331s)** — Doctor's trying to lower my cholesterol.
- **[05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJeTsPEiXRA&t=332s)** — Well, what happens when we age is we start having a decrease in hormones, testosterone.
- **[05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJeTsPEiXRA&t=337s)** — estrogen, things like that.
- **[05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJeTsPEiXRA&t=339s)** — And all of those hormones are built out of cholesterol.
- **[05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJeTsPEiXRA&t=343s)** — When you start to cut down your cholesterol,
- **[05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJeTsPEiXRA&t=345s)** — or you take certain medications that cut down your cholesterol,
- **[05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJeTsPEiXRA&t=348s)** — you really cut down those hormones that are already tanked and very, very low.
- **[05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJeTsPEiXRA&t=353s)** — So having sufficient amounts of the raw material cholesterol in your diet is very,
- **[05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJeTsPEiXRA&t=356s)** — very important, especially as you age.
- **[05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJeTsPEiXRA&t=358s)** — We need cholesterol for our brain, bile salts to help digest fats.
- **[06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJeTsPEiXRA&t=361s)** — Most importantly, we need cholesterol to make hormones.
- **[06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJeTsPEiXRA&t=364s)** — Where do we get cholesterol?
- **[06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJeTsPEiXRA&t=365s)** — Butter, eggs, dairy, shellfish.
- **[06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJeTsPEiXRA&t=368s)** — And just as a side note, just think about this.
- **[06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJeTsPEiXRA&t=370s)** — Diabetes is too much sugar in your blood.
- **[06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJeTsPEiXRA&t=373s)** — Wouldn't it make logical sense to start cutting down sugar and carbohydrates?
- **[06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJeTsPEiXRA&t=377s)** — In fact, what they focus more on is making sure you have
- **[06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJeTsPEiXRA&t=381s)** — some glucose tablets in your pocket or candy in your pocket if your blood
- **[06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJeTsPEiXRA&t=385s)** — sugars become too low because the medication is pushing it too low.
- **[06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJeTsPEiXRA&t=388s)** — Why not just take less medication if you come off the carbs?
- **[06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJeTsPEiXRA&t=392s)** — This whole thing is insane.
- **[06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJeTsPEiXRA&t=393s)** — But it's not just about cutting down the sugar carbohydrates.
- **[06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJeTsPEiXRA&t=397s)** — It's cutting down this other carbohydrate called starch.
- **[06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJeTsPEiXRA&t=401s)** — Most of the starch that people are eating is not really listed as starch on the labels.
- **[06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJeTsPEiXRA&t=406s)** — It's listed as these other words, modified food,
- **[06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJeTsPEiXRA&t=410s)** — starch, but then you get into the wheat flour.
- **[06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJeTsPEiXRA&t=413s)** — All of that is starch.
- **[06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJeTsPEiXRA&t=414s)** — Next point. In your diet, you have proteins,
- **[06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJeTsPEiXRA&t=417s)** — carbohydrates, and fats.
- **[06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJeTsPEiXRA&t=419s)** — Which one would be the most important to focus on as far as to create health?
- **[07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJeTsPEiXRA&t=425s)** — Proteins are the most important. Why?
- **[07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJeTsPEiXRA&t=428s)** — Because most of your body is protein. Not just muscle, connective tissue,
- **[07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJeTsPEiXRA&t=432s)** — but your immune system, antibodies, white blood cells, and a person,
- **[07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJeTsPEiXRA&t=436s)** — an insect, an animal will continue to eat until their protein requirements are satisfied.
- **[07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJeTsPEiXRA&t=442s)** — So just take a look at junk food, right?
- **[07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJeTsPEiXRA&t=444s)** — There's not a lot of protein in junk food.
- **[07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJeTsPEiXRA&t=446s)** — The cereal boxes, the crackers, the cookies.
- **[07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJeTsPEiXRA&t=449s)** — Look at the protein. It's just like missing.
- **[07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJeTsPEiXRA&t=451s)** — What food would give you the most healing?
- **[07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJeTsPEiXRA&t=453s)** — Right off the bat, grass-fed beef, grass-fed lamb.
- **[07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJeTsPEiXRA&t=457s)** — That's the most nutrient-dense food to heal the gut,
- **[07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJeTsPEiXRA&t=460s)** — to give you trace minerals, to give you B vitamins,
- **[07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJeTsPEiXRA&t=462s)** — but also to give you the highest quality protein.
- **[07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJeTsPEiXRA&t=464s)** — Think about it. As we age, especially over 50, we start losing our muscle.
- **[07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJeTsPEiXRA&t=469s)** — You need to keep your protein at a higher level with each meal.
- **[07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJeTsPEiXRA&t=473s)** — You can also get a super concentrated amount of these nutrients from organ meats.
- **[07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJeTsPEiXRA&t=478s)** — I wish I liked liver. I don't like it. I'm not going to eat it.
- **[08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJeTsPEiXRA&t=481s)** — However, there's another liver that I love.
- **[08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJeTsPEiXRA&t=484s)** — In fact, sometimes I crave it and it's really delicious.
- **[08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJeTsPEiXRA&t=487s)** — It's cod liver. And the reason I'm bringing up this cod liver is because
- **[08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJeTsPEiXRA&t=490s)** — it's one of the best sources. I consume it probably twice a week.
- **[08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJeTsPEiXRA&t=493s)** — All right. Next point is very, very important.
- **[08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJeTsPEiXRA&t=496s)** — The frequency of eating. Let's say you're consuming 2,500 calories per day
- **[08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJeTsPEiXRA&t=502s)** — and you were to consume them just twice a day versus six times a day.
- **[08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJeTsPEiXRA&t=506s)** — All those extra meals creates more of a problem for you because every time you eat,
- **[08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJeTsPEiXRA&t=511s)** — you stimulate insulin. Producing too much insulin is probably the single biggest problem
- **[08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJeTsPEiXRA&t=515s)** — right now behind so many chronic illnesses, not just diabetes, but a fatty liver,
- **[08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJeTsPEiXRA&t=521s)** — high blood pressure. We talked about reducing the carbohydrates.
- **[08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJeTsPEiXRA&t=524s)** — Now we're talking about reducing snacking, grazing at night. It's just not good.
- **[08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJeTsPEiXRA&t=528s)** — If you could just take your snacks, if it's nuts or whatever,
- **[08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJeTsPEiXRA&t=531s)** — just push them to the meal and just had two meals a day, I think that would be awesome
- **[08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJeTsPEiXRA&t=536s)** — because then you can actually do intermittent fasting and you can create a lot of improvements
- **[09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJeTsPEiXRA&t=540s)** — with that because it's going to reduce your insulin.
- **[09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJeTsPEiXRA&t=543s)** — Next point you should know about autoimmune diseases.
- **[09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJeTsPEiXRA&t=545s)** — It's where your immune system is attacking itself. It's the number one problem out there.
- **[09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJeTsPEiXRA&t=551s)** — I think it's a combination of a couple things. Number one, the person has low vitamin D,
- **[09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJeTsPEiXRA&t=556s)** — but I don't think it's the only cause. And it has to do with microbes, viruses,
- **[09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJeTsPEiXRA&t=561s)** — and other pathogens that are constantly trying to invade our body and create all these problems.
- **[09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJeTsPEiXRA&t=566s)** — And one of the strategies that they do is they downgrade your vitamin D receptor.
- **[09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJeTsPEiXRA&t=570s)** — Now, normal amounts of vitamin D don't do anything for you because the
- **[09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJeTsPEiXRA&t=574s)** — microbe is really smart. There's something else that occurs just before this infection.
- **[09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJeTsPEiXRA&t=581s)** — Because in practice, I ran into this. These people almost always had a stress event right
- **[09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJeTsPEiXRA&t=588s)** — before they developed this autoimmune disease. Loss of a loved one, loss of a job, loss of
- **[09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJeTsPEiXRA&t=594s)** — something. What happens when a person goes through a severe shock? What happens to the
- **[09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJeTsPEiXRA&t=599s)** — immune system? It becomes suppressed with high levels of cortisol. Things can happen to
- **[10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJeTsPEiXRA&t=603s)** — the immune system. And if you're already low in vitamin D3, you can have this shift in the
- **[10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJeTsPEiXRA&t=608s)** — system where this immune system starts inappropriately attacking its own tissue and
- **[10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJeTsPEiXRA&t=612s)** — develops an autoimmune disease. Not only that, prednisone, which is a synthetic type of cortisol,
- **[10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJeTsPEiXRA&t=618s)** — will shut down the immune system too. This is why they use it for autoimmune diseases,
- **[10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJeTsPEiXRA&t=622s)** — anything like rashes on the skin. The greatest single thing you can do for stress
- **[10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJeTsPEiXRA&t=627s)** — is exercise and do things to change the environment that you're in. It's not exposing
- **[10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJeTsPEiXRA&t=632s)** — yourself to so much insanity. Now the last thing, and I think one of the most important
- **[10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJeTsPEiXRA&t=637s)** — things you need to know about in relationship to your health is the recognition that your
- **[10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJeTsPEiXRA&t=643s)** — microbiome in your gut actually is an organ. People think it's like some extra thing that's
- **[10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJeTsPEiXRA&t=648s)** — really not part of us. It is part of us. It's way more than our own cells. And it's
- **[10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJeTsPEiXRA&t=653s)** — called the gut microbiome. And the significance or impact that those microbes create on your
- **[10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJeTsPEiXRA&t=659s)** — health is huge. Why the heck would we ever want to even take an antibiotic and kill them
- **[11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJeTsPEiXRA&t=665s)** — is beyond me. What you have to realize is when you take an antibiotic, you will never have the
- **[11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJeTsPEiXRA&t=670s)** — same microbes ever again. Allow these microbes never grow back. It's a lie that they told you
- **[11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJeTsPEiXRA&t=676s)** — that, oh yeah, you're just going to actually decrease the number of microbes and they're
- **[11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJeTsPEiXRA&t=680s)** — just going to come back to normal just like before. No, that's a lie. The importance of
- **[11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJeTsPEiXRA&t=684s)** — supporting the gut microbes as an organ is vital. For what? Immune protection, the
- **[11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJeTsPEiXRA&t=690s)** — neurotransmitters that are created, your mood, your cognitive function is influenced by
- **[11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJeTsPEiXRA&t=694s)** — microbes. There are certain vitamins that are made by these microbes. A lot of your digestion
- **[11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJeTsPEiXRA&t=698s)** — is related to microbes. Your ability to get rid of cancer is related to these microbes. Your
- **[11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJeTsPEiXRA&t=704s)** — ability to sleep good is related to these microbes. The list goes on and on and on.
- **[11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJeTsPEiXRA&t=708s)** — That's why it's so important to on a regular basis consume fermented foods. Sauerkraut,
- **[11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJeTsPEiXRA&t=714s)** — kimchi, yogurt, and taking a very good probiotic would be very, very smart. I covered
- **[12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJeTsPEiXRA&t=720s)** — a lot of stuff in this video. I think all of it's super important, especially if you're over 50,
- **[12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJeTsPEiXRA&t=725s)** — but I would apply a lot of this information before you're 50. Start creating your health
- **[12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJeTsPEiXRA&t=729s)** — right now because health has to be created. It doesn't just automatically happen. But I've
- **[12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJeTsPEiXRA&t=735s)** — given you the key ingredients for creating health. And I think the next most relevant
- **[12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJeTsPEiXRA&t=739s)** — video for you to watch would be on the best foods to eat to create health. And for that,
- **[12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJeTsPEiXRA&t=745s)** — I put this video up right here. Check it out.

- **[00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZEmzXJEmdw&t=0s)** — Foods that put you at risk if you're over 50 years old. I also want to extend this to things that you can be drinking.
- **[00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZEmzXJEmdw&t=6s)** — As we age our bodies become more vulnerable to certain things. The older you get, the healthier you should eat.
- **[00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZEmzXJEmdw&t=12s)** — Let's start with number one. Water. I want to show you something. I just tested my water. I'm going to show you what I found.
- **[00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZEmzXJEmdw&t=17s)** — There is one chemical called perfluoroctanoic acid. That's a forever chemical widely used to make products more resistant to water and grease.
- **[00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZEmzXJEmdw&t=26s)** — This chemical has been used in nonstick cookware cosmetics and cleaning products. The level of this chemical in my water supply exceeds the acceptable level by 98,650%.
- **[00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZEmzXJEmdw&t=42s)** — Literally, I'm poisoning myself by drinking the water. What is my concern about that chemical? Cancer, liver problems, kidney problems.
- **[00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZEmzXJEmdw&t=50s)** — When my grandkids come to the house, you know, exposing them to this water. In the water system you have forever chemicals that just don't break down for a thousand years.
- **[00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZEmzXJEmdw&t=58s)** — You have plastics. Most of the plastic in your body is accumulated in your brain, which can affect your cognitive function and keep your brain inflamed.
- **[01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZEmzXJEmdw&t=67s)** — The solution to that is to find a good filter. You want to get a filter that filters out forever chemicals.
- **[01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZEmzXJEmdw&t=73s)** — As you age, your liver has less ability to detoxify things. Your kidneys can't get rid of things like you used to when you were 18 years old.
- **[01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZEmzXJEmdw&t=82s)** — The next thing I want to talk about is anything that you eat that depletes you of zinc. Zinc is really important to have enough of when you get older.
- **[01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZEmzXJEmdw&t=92s)** — Zinc supports testosterone, which tanks as you get older in men and women.
- **[01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZEmzXJEmdw&t=98s)** — Testosterone is not just about libido. It's about your muscle mass, your thymus, which is above the heart that controls your immune system.
- **[01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZEmzXJEmdw&t=104s)** — Zinc is involved in making hydrochloric acid. And when we get older, our hydrochloric acid decreases so we can't kill off microbes, we can't digest protein, we can't absorb nutrients.
- **[01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZEmzXJEmdw&t=114s)** — The question is what foods are depleting zinc? Any of the refined carbohydrates. Starches, maltodextrin, modified food starch, even wheat flour. All of that depletes you of zinc.
- **[02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZEmzXJEmdw&t=126s)** — Of course, refined carbohydrates also deplete you of vitamin B1, which will create a whole set of other problems, especially related to a blood sugar issue.
- **[02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZEmzXJEmdw&t=135s)** — If your blood sugars stay high, as in diabetes, or you're pre-diabetic, or you just eat a lot of carbs, there are four different tissues that are going to age a lot faster than they should.
- **[02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZEmzXJEmdw&t=146s)** — That's because of a deficiency of B1, but it's also because of something else. When sugar gets stuck to protein in your body and makes sticky protein, and then it builds up in the body, and it creates all sorts of problems, especially to the lens of the eye as cataracts, it really ages your skin.
- **[02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZEmzXJEmdw&t=163s)** — So you get wrinkles, and then you lose that elasticity. This is why as people get older, they can't sprint like they used to. They don't have that balance in their step.
- **[02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZEmzXJEmdw&t=171s)** — Some other foods that you want to avoid. Barbecue anything where they're adding this sugar sauce to meat and then they cook it? Deadly.
- **[02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZEmzXJEmdw&t=177s)** — Think about how many restaurants add sugar to meat, or even sugar to fat. De-fried doughnut or a de-fried french fry. This is going to really age you. It also affects the cognitive function as well as the mood.
- **[03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZEmzXJEmdw&t=189s)** — And then the last one is the heart. It also affects the elasticity, so the arteries get hardened. I just want to mention one additional mineral, silica.
- **[03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZEmzXJEmdw&t=199s)** — If you want strong bones, strong hair, really strong elastic skin, silica is something you don't want to become deficient in.
- **[03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZEmzXJEmdw&t=207s)** — So what foods are high in silica? Bamboo shoots are really high. Horsetail, spring water, or just a silica supplement.
- **[03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZEmzXJEmdw&t=214s)** — Another food, if you want to call it that, that ages you is seed oils. Seed oils tend to get stored in your membranes and all the cells.
- **[03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZEmzXJEmdw&t=224s)** — They start to replace your membranes in your brain and your nervous system. And it takes like a year and a half to get it out once you stop eating these seed oils.
- **[03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZEmzXJEmdw&t=231s)** — But you don't want these industrial, refined, rancid fats being stored in your membranes. They create inflammation of your brain.
- **[04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZEmzXJEmdw&t=240s)** — It's in all the deep-fried foods. It's in a lot of the junk foods. But do not cook with it. Use butter, tailo, lard, or olive oil.
- **[04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZEmzXJEmdw&t=248s)** — And consume a lot of fish oil to replace that lower quality fat in your brain and your nervous system.
- **[04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZEmzXJEmdw&t=255s)** — The next food I'm going to tell you to avoid is the refined soy products, especially the soy protein isolates.
- **[04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZEmzXJEmdw&t=261s)** — It's in a lot of protein bars. It's very refined, but it's not that clean.
- **[04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZEmzXJEmdw&t=265s)** — Because we don't know this for sure, but there's reports that there's residue of hexane.
- **[04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZEmzXJEmdw&t=270s)** — Because in order to make that, you have to use a solvent. And you don't want to be consuming such a refined, unnatural protein.
- **[04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZEmzXJEmdw&t=277s)** — When I was in practice, a lot of people were doing ideal protein. I noticed when they lost weight, they also looked really old and unhealthy and dried out.
- **[04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZEmzXJEmdw&t=288s)** — Their hair was bad and brittle and breaking. Their skin looked older. They had a lot of gallbladder and liver problems.
- **[04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZEmzXJEmdw&t=294s)** — I really think it was that soy protein isolate. So you want to avoid that.
- **[04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZEmzXJEmdw&t=298s)** — One day I was at Whole Foods and I was looking in their deli part and it looked like they had some chicken wings.
- **[05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZEmzXJEmdw&t=303s)** — So I ordered some and I'm like, wow, these are really good, but they're all the same shape.
- **[05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZEmzXJEmdw&t=307s)** — And then I'm like, wait a second, these aren't chicken wings. So I called the store and I've been eating soy wings.
- **[05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZEmzXJEmdw&t=314s)** — I took a nap for three hours. I woke up. My eyes were bloodshot. Like I felt sick. I don't recommend consuming refined soy.
- **[05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZEmzXJEmdw&t=322s)** — Another thing that you want to avoid is anything low fat. Because one really important nutrient, especially as we age, is vitamin K2.
- **[05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZEmzXJEmdw&t=329s)** — And that's in the fatty cheese. It's in goose liver. And when you go low fat, you're depriving yourself of this really key nutrient that can make your bones really solid.
- **[05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZEmzXJEmdw&t=337s)** — By taking the calcium out of the arteries and keeping your joints free of calcium so you don't have arthritis.
- **[05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZEmzXJEmdw&t=344s)** — If you have those problems with calcium in the artery and you also have calcium in the joints and you have a lot of stiffness, you maybe want to take a vitamin K2 supplement.
- **[05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZEmzXJEmdw&t=353s)** — And I would find a company that sells it in higher amounts.
- **[05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZEmzXJEmdw&t=356s)** — Another really important nutrient that you want to make sure you get enough of when you get older is something to really support the deep sleep.
- **[06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZEmzXJEmdw&t=365s)** — Because as we age, we lose the sleep. The absolute best nutrient for that is magnesium.
- **[06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZEmzXJEmdw&t=370s)** — Yes, you can eat your magnesium from salad and things like that, but that might not be enough. You might need to take a supplement.
- **[06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZEmzXJEmdw&t=376s)** — I recommend magnesium glycinate. You want to try to get it in a powder because it's easier to consume, especially like an hour before bed.
- **[06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZEmzXJEmdw&t=384s)** — But if you took a scoop of that before bed, boy, you sleep through the whole night. It relaxes you.
- **[06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZEmzXJEmdw&t=391s)** — And of course, the things that block magnesium are all the refined foods, the junk foods.
- **[06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZEmzXJEmdw&t=396s)** — Also, it's very important not to necessarily just focus on restricting your salt as you age, but instead having more quality salt like Himalayan sea salt and then increase your potassium.
- **[06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZEmzXJEmdw&t=409s)** — Because you need salt and sodium as you age to build your hydrochloric acid.
- **[06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZEmzXJEmdw&t=413s)** — It's much better to increase potassium so you can handle that little bit of salt and you'll feel much, much better.
- **[07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZEmzXJEmdw&t=420s)** — Because the RDAs for potassium are 4,700 milligrams and most people don't even get close to that.
- **[07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZEmzXJEmdw&t=426s)** — I wanted to give you a list of things to focus on, to put your attention on as you age so you can extend your age.
- **[07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZEmzXJEmdw&t=433s)** — Thanks for watching and I will see you in the next video.

- **[00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FA_VgCFnueE&t=0s)** — You do not want to get a surgery unless you do this one thing first.
- **[00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FA_VgCFnueE&t=5s)** — And this is really, really important. There's a lot of risks when you go into a surgery.
- **[00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FA_VgCFnueE&t=9s)** — One is dying. This video is not just for patients. It's for doctors too.
- **[00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FA_VgCFnueE&t=13s)** — So they can look at the research and this simple thing, which basically costs pennies,
- **[00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FA_VgCFnueE&t=20s)** — can create a massive improvement in your outcomes of the surgery you get.
- **[00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FA_VgCFnueE&t=24s)** — Getting your vitamin D tested and making sure you have sufficient vitamin D before surgery.
- **[00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FA_VgCFnueE&t=29s)** — All surgeries. What is so special about vitamin D in relationship to a surgery?
- **[00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FA_VgCFnueE&t=34s)** — Doing the surgery itself lowers your vitamin D because there's trauma involved.
- **[00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FA_VgCFnueE&t=39s)** — If you're deficient in vitamin D, blood pressure can go up.
- **[00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FA_VgCFnueE&t=43s)** — Vitamin D is one of the best remedies for high blood pressure because vitamin D increases
- **[00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FA_VgCFnueE&t=47s)** — something called nitric oxide, which helps vasodilation of the arteries.
- **[00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FA_VgCFnueE&t=51s)** — Your immune system depends on enough vitamin D to prevent infections like sepsis, inflammation.
- **[00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FA_VgCFnueE&t=58s)** — Vitamin D is really important to reduce cardiovascular complications after a surgery.
- **[01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FA_VgCFnueE&t=63s)** — And once steady, before the operation, there was an average of 42.7.
- **[01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FA_VgCFnueE&t=68s)** — And take a wild guess what the average vitamin D was after the surgery. 28.
- **[01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FA_VgCFnueE&t=72s)** — In your mind, you might think I might need to take 2,000 IUs.
- **[01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FA_VgCFnueE&t=76s)** — No. People are taking like 100,000 or even 300,000 or more before surgery.
- **[01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FA_VgCFnueE&t=83s)** — Then you also have vitamin D affecting your muscles.
- **[01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FA_VgCFnueE&t=85s)** — If you don't have enough vitamin D to the muscles, the muscles can become weak.
- **[01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FA_VgCFnueE&t=89s)** — And your risk of falling down greatly goes up.
- **[01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FA_VgCFnueE&t=92s)** — If you're elderly, this is a problem because you might end up fracturing yourself.
- **[01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FA_VgCFnueE&t=95s)** — I mean, even if you do a search on Google Scholar and found six studies involving vitamin D
- **[01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FA_VgCFnueE&t=100s)** — and surgery for osteoporosis, another 10 studies on bone in general and vitamin D
- **[01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FA_VgCFnueE&t=106s)** — in relationship to healing after surgery. If someone has low vitamin D, their post-operative
- **[01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FA_VgCFnueE&t=112s)** — inflammatory indicators actually increase by 200%.
- **[01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FA_VgCFnueE&t=115s)** — And the wound that they just created takes longer to heal.
- **[01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FA_VgCFnueE&t=118s)** — I'm excited to tell you a little bit about a new product called Natural B12
- **[02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FA_VgCFnueE&t=122s)** — Methylcobalamin with the B complex blend.
- **[02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FA_VgCFnueE&t=125s)** — What's really unique about this product is the B complex vitamins actually come from food,
- **[02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FA_VgCFnueE&t=131s)** — which is very different from most B vitamins, which come from petroleum.
- **[02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FA_VgCFnueE&t=135s)** — This B12 is not synthetic. It's the natural version called methylcobalamin.
- **[02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FA_VgCFnueE&t=140s)** — If you want a really high quality B12, you might want to try this. Take one a day.
- **[02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FA_VgCFnueE&t=144s)** — I take this in the morning, but some people find it more convenient to take it with a meal.
- **[02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FA_VgCFnueE&t=147s)** — This one bottle will last you two months, 60 days.
- **[02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FA_VgCFnueE&t=150s)** — Vitamin D also controls this antimicrobial peptide,
- **[02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FA_VgCFnueE&t=156s)** — which is a compound to help your immune system kill microbes.
- **[02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FA_VgCFnueE&t=158s)** — Vitamin D has the potential to increase those antimicrobial peptides by 4,000%,
- **[02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FA_VgCFnueE&t=164s)** — keeping the complication of an infection way down.
- **[02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FA_VgCFnueE&t=166s)** — Surgical complications are cut in half with sufficient vitamin D.
- **[02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FA_VgCFnueE&t=171s)** — In one study, I found as much as half of atrial fibrillation was reduced with enough vitamin D.
- **[02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FA_VgCFnueE&t=176s)** — In that study, it actually blew my mind. They were using 600,000 IUs of vitamin D3.
- **[03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FA_VgCFnueE&t=183s)** — We definitely want to make sure we have enough vitamin D if you're going into an open
- **[03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FA_VgCFnueE&t=187s)** — heart surgery, if you're having your thyroid taken out, surgery to remove cancer.
- **[03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FA_VgCFnueE&t=191s)** — If someone is low in vitamin D, the post-surgical cognitive side effects or dysfunction
- **[03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FA_VgCFnueE&t=199s)** — are 8 times more likely to have cognitive dysfunction after a surgery if you don't have
- **[03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FA_VgCFnueE&t=203s)** — enough vitamin D. Having enough vitamin D can decrease your risk of having some type of
- **[03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FA_VgCFnueE&t=209s)** — rejection when you're doing an organ transplant. In one study, I found there were fewer
- **[03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FA_VgCFnueE&t=214s)** — complications, especially in the area of ventilators. When 120,000 IUs of vitamin D
- **[03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FA_VgCFnueE&t=221s)** — were used. When you think about vitamin D, think of fewer days in the hospital after the surgery,
- **[03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FA_VgCFnueE&t=226s)** — faster healing rates. There was a study involving children in intensive care.
- **[03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FA_VgCFnueE&t=231s)** — They loaded up these children 10,000 IUs per kilogram. At first, I thought it was a typo.
- **[03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FA_VgCFnueE&t=237s)** — It should have been 1,000 IUs, but it was actually 10,000 IUs. Some people are going to
- **[04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FA_VgCFnueE&t=243s)** — ask, well, what about the toxic effects? We're only talking about using these high doses,
- **[04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FA_VgCFnueE&t=247s)** — three days before surgery. We're not talking about using the high doses long term. You're not getting
- **[04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FA_VgCFnueE&t=253s)** — all that vitamin D to go in there, but you're at least saturating the body with enough
- **[04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FA_VgCFnueE&t=257s)** — to make sure that there's no cells that are insufficient. Now, there's also some interesting
- **[04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FA_VgCFnueE&t=263s)** — data about your adrenal glands. Because going through a surgery puts a lot of stress
- **[04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FA_VgCFnueE&t=267s)** — on your adrenals. This is why they monitor your heart, because sometimes your adrenals
- **[04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FA_VgCFnueE&t=272s)** — might overcompensate with adrenaline and you can end up with high blood pressure. So there's
- **[04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FA_VgCFnueE&t=276s)** — definitely an adrenal stress surgery connection, giving you a risk of adrenal
- **[04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FA_VgCFnueE&t=281s)** — insufficiency. They've even tested a cortisol spike after a surgery. It can increase by 4x
- **[04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FA_VgCFnueE&t=287s)** — if you're low in vitamin D, which can worsen your ability to heal your regulation of
- **[04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FA_VgCFnueE&t=292s)** — inflammation. Your adrenals do not want to go through a surgery with low vitamin D. Vitamin
- **[04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FA_VgCFnueE&t=297s)** — D influences over 2,000 genes, but there's 200 of those genes relate to your adrenals. This
- **[05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FA_VgCFnueE&t=304s)** — video is not just to remind you to get your vitamin D tested before surgery, but to make
- **[05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FA_VgCFnueE&t=310s)** — sure you have sufficient amounts. And I'm not talking about just a little bit. I'm talking
- **[05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FA_VgCFnueE&t=314s)** — about a lot before you go into surgery. You want to take this additional vitamin D three
- **[05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FA_VgCFnueE&t=320s)** — days before a surgery. So it has time to really penetrate and get into your cells and
- **[05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FA_VgCFnueE&t=325s)** — act as a protective mechanism against the complications of surgery. Thanks for watching.
- **[05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FA_VgCFnueE&t=331s)** — Spread this video to your friends and families so they can have this knowledge of doing
- **[05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FA_VgCFnueE&t=334s)** — something extremely simple and inexpensive to create a lot of good or protect you
- **[05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FA_VgCFnueE&t=340s)** — against a lot of bad things that can happen as you go through a surgery.

*Click any timestamp to jump to that moment in the video*

- **[00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CD2vs-Ud6bo&t=0s)** — Drink this every single day until you don't have joint pain anymore.
- **[00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CD2vs-Ud6bo&t=3s)** — If we talk about joint pain, just because someone has inflammation in the joint doesn't mean they have arthritis.
- **[00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CD2vs-Ud6bo&t=8s)** — If you're eating things that are going to negate or even cause inflammation,
- **[00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CD2vs-Ud6bo&t=13s)** — this little remedy that you take to counter that is not going to work.
- **[00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CD2vs-Ud6bo&t=15s)** — Before I talk about what you need to add into the diet to resolve your joint pain,
- **[00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CD2vs-Ud6bo&t=20s)** — let's talk about what you need to avoid in the diet.
- **[00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CD2vs-Ud6bo&t=22s)** — Sugar, high fructose corn syrup.
- **[00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CD2vs-Ud6bo&t=24s)** — If you're doing too much of that, you're going to literally put fire into your joints.
- **[00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CD2vs-Ud6bo&t=29s)** — The second thing is to avoid this stuff right here. Seed oils.
- **[00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CD2vs-Ud6bo&t=33s)** — Seed oils like corn oil, soy oil, canola are very high in omega-6 fatty acids.
- **[00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CD2vs-Ud6bo&t=39s)** — It creates more inflammation versus the omega-3 fatty acids, fish oils, cod liver oil,
- **[00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CD2vs-Ud6bo&t=45s)** — that's very anti-inflammatory.
- **[00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CD2vs-Ud6bo&t=47s)** — Then we have gluten. Anything with gluten, we're talking about wheat and other grains,
- **[00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CD2vs-Ud6bo&t=51s)** — has a potential for causing a lot of inflammation, not just in your joints but also in your gut.
- **[00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CD2vs-Ud6bo&t=56s)** — You also have something called oxalates.
- **[00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CD2vs-Ud6bo&t=57s)** — Oxalates are crystal-like sharp things that can go into the joints and cause inflammation,
- **[01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CD2vs-Ud6bo&t=64s)** — and they can also cause kidney stones.
- **[01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CD2vs-Ud6bo&t=66s)** — And I really think that the people that have problems with oxalates
- **[01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CD2vs-Ud6bo&t=69s)** — are people that had a history of antibiotics,
- **[01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CD2vs-Ud6bo&t=71s)** — because you have the microbe in your gut that's supposed to eat up these oxalates.
- **[01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CD2vs-Ud6bo&t=76s)** — And if it's missing because you had an antibiotic long ago,
- **[01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CD2vs-Ud6bo&t=80s)** — then you're more susceptible to having this arthritic pain from oxalates,
- **[01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CD2vs-Ud6bo&t=84s)** — especially when you have spinach, chocolate, almonds, and Swiss chard.
- **[01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CD2vs-Ud6bo&t=88s)** — If you consume more magnesium in your diet,
- **[01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CD2vs-Ud6bo&t=91s)** — you can actually really bring these oxalates way down, even if you eat the foods high in oxalates.
- **[01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CD2vs-Ud6bo&t=96s)** — Then you have other things too that can flare up your joints like MSG.
- **[01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CD2vs-Ud6bo&t=100s)** — You're going to find that in fast food restaurants.
- **[01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CD2vs-Ud6bo&t=102s)** — Multidextrin is a highly refined starch that can also flare up your joints.
- **[01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CD2vs-Ud6bo&t=105s)** — It's in a lot of processed foods.
- **[01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CD2vs-Ud6bo&t=107s)** — Then you have nightshades, potatoes, peppers, tomatoes.
- **[01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CD2vs-Ud6bo&t=111s)** — The last chemical I want to talk about is lectins.
- **[01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CD2vs-Ud6bo&t=114s)** — That would be in beans, peanuts, wheat, and especially soy products.
- **[02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CD2vs-Ud6bo&t=120s)** — Lectins can increase inflammation.
- **[02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CD2vs-Ud6bo&t=122s)** — And of course, the diet that I recommend doesn't include any of those.
- **[02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CD2vs-Ud6bo&t=125s)** — So if you just follow that diet, which I'll put a link down below, you'll be really safe.
- **[02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CD2vs-Ud6bo&t=129s)** — Let's get right into that drink I'm going to recommend for getting rid of inflammation in your joints.
- **[02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CD2vs-Ud6bo&t=134s)** — And the big ingredient in this is turmeric.
- **[02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CD2vs-Ud6bo&t=136s)** — And I recommend getting turmeric in a powder.
- **[02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CD2vs-Ud6bo&t=139s)** — And we're just going to add a teaspoon of turmeric.
- **[02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CD2vs-Ud6bo&t=141s)** — Take this glass, half water and half coconut milk.
- **[02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CD2vs-Ud6bo&t=146s)** — Because it's going to be really creamy if you do that.
- **[02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CD2vs-Ud6bo&t=148s)** — It's going to taste great.
- **[02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CD2vs-Ud6bo&t=150s)** — And you're going to stir this up really nice.
- **[02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CD2vs-Ud6bo&t=152s)** — And I would take like a little pinch of black pepper because that'll increase the absorption by 2000%.
- **[02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CD2vs-Ud6bo&t=157s)** — And then on top of that, I recommend putting a scoop of collagen powder.
- **[02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CD2vs-Ud6bo&t=161s)** — For most people, it should taste fine. It should taste quite delicious.
- **[02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CD2vs-Ud6bo&t=165s)** — For some people, you might need to add a couple drops of liquid stevia if you really need to.
- **[02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CD2vs-Ud6bo&t=169s)** — But I think you'll just like the taste of it.
- **[02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CD2vs-Ud6bo&t=172s)** — It's kind of a creamy aromatic turmeric flavor with a little taste of coconut.
- **[02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CD2vs-Ud6bo&t=177s)** — But that is going to be the shake.
- **[02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CD2vs-Ud6bo&t=179s)** — And you want to drink that down every single day.
- **[03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CD2vs-Ud6bo&t=181s)** — And for some people, they actually heat it up a little bit.
- **[03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CD2vs-Ud6bo&t=184s)** — Not too hot, just so it becomes nice and warm.
- **[03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CD2vs-Ud6bo&t=187s)** — And they might drink that as a nice warm drink.
- **[03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CD2vs-Ud6bo&t=189s)** — It really doesn't matter if you're having it in the morning and at night.
- **[03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CD2vs-Ud6bo&t=193s)** — But I do recommend for most people have it in the morning.
- **[03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CD2vs-Ud6bo&t=195s)** — That way, you can kind of be pain-free all day long.
- **[03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CD2vs-Ud6bo&t=199s)** — The thing you need to realize is turmeric compares in effectiveness to ibuprofen
- **[03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CD2vs-Ud6bo&t=205s)** — and other non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs.
- **[03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CD2vs-Ud6bo&t=208s)** — If you take turmeric in the supplement, I would recommend 1,000 or 1,500 milligram doses per day.
- **[03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CD2vs-Ud6bo&t=215s)** — But turmeric inhibits at least four major inflammatory pathways.
- **[03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CD2vs-Ud6bo&t=221s)** — And then the black pepper increases the absorption.
- **[03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CD2vs-Ud6bo&t=224s)** — And then there's also great things in coconut too.
- **[03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CD2vs-Ud6bo&t=226s)** — Especially being a nice fat to help this fat soluble compound be absorbed even more.
- **[03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CD2vs-Ud6bo&t=232s)** — And of course, the collagen can help build up your joints on top of everything else I talked about.
- **[03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CD2vs-Ud6bo&t=237s)** — Now let's talk about Baswellia serrata.
- **[04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CD2vs-Ud6bo&t=240s)** — In research in 2018, in the Phyto-medicine journal,
- **[04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CD2vs-Ud6bo&t=244s)** — Baswellia serrata showed significant joint pain relief and as effective as NSAIDs.
- **[04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CD2vs-Ud6bo&t=251s)** — And guess what? Without side effects.
- **[04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CD2vs-Ud6bo&t=253s)** — It's amazing. This plant lives in very dry, harsh climates.
- **[04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CD2vs-Ud6bo&t=258s)** — In certain countries like India and Asian countries,
- **[04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CD2vs-Ud6bo&t=261s)** — regions of the earth where there's harsh deserts.
- **[04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CD2vs-Ud6bo&t=264s)** — And there's a resin that is formed and created when there's damage to the bark.
- **[04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CD2vs-Ud6bo&t=271s)** — This particular chemical, it's a response to a physical wound in the bark, which is wild.
- **[04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CD2vs-Ud6bo&t=277s)** — So basically, you're consuming something from stressed out trees.
- **[04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CD2vs-Ud6bo&t=281s)** — And then when we consume this particular thing,
- **[04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CD2vs-Ud6bo&t=284s)** — it creates a low dose stress in our bodies that then cause our own body to create antioxidant
- **[04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CD2vs-Ud6bo&t=291s)** — chemicals to then get rid of inflammation. The term for that is called hormesis,
- **[04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CD2vs-Ud6bo&t=296s)** — which is like a controlled stress to improve our survival.
- **[05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CD2vs-Ud6bo&t=300s)** — Just like exercise is hormesis. We're actually adding stress to make us healthier.
- **[05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CD2vs-Ud6bo&t=305s)** — Well, we can do that with various compounds in plants.

- **[05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CD2vs-Ud6bo&t=313s)** — potently decrease our inflammation in our joints.
- **[05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CD2vs-Ud6bo&t=316s)** — It compares with medications, but without side effects.
- **[05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CD2vs-Ud6bo&t=320s)** — Now that you have the drink for joint pain,

- **[05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CD2vs-Ud6bo&t=326s)** — And it's called walking. Walking compares to

- **[05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CD2vs-Ud6bo&t=332s)** — It's not just for your joints. It's for extending your life.

- **[00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G0lWRnh0GfI&t=0s)** — So I want to revisit this topic of everyone needs to drink more water. I know last time I did a
- **[00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G0lWRnh0GfI&t=5s)** — video on this stirred up a lot of opinions on this topic. So before you click off, just please hear
- **[00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G0lWRnh0GfI&t=12s)** — me out. I will say right up front that I do drink water and I'm not against water. I drink about
- **[00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G0lWRnh0GfI&t=18s)** — two and a half liters of water every single day. However, there's some really interesting
- **[00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G0lWRnh0GfI&t=22s)** — information about water because you may think that water hydrates you. It actually doesn't.
- **[00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G0lWRnh0GfI&t=29s)** — It could even dehydrate you. And I'm primarily talking about drinking excessive amounts of water.
- **[00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G0lWRnh0GfI&t=35s)** — There's a term for this. It's called water intoxication or water poisoning or over-hydration
- **[00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G0lWRnh0GfI&t=40s)** — because if you think about it, how does this water get into your cells? Is it a passive thing?
- **[00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G0lWRnh0GfI&t=46s)** — Does it just kind of go into your cells and start hydrating? No. There are very specific
- **[00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G0lWRnh0GfI&t=51s)** — proteins that allow this water to go into your cells and with the help of electrolytes. And so
- **[00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G0lWRnh0GfI&t=58s)** — what happens when you drink a lot of water without electrolytes? You can dilute the body's
- **[01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G0lWRnh0GfI&t=65s)** — electrolytes, mainly sodium, but other electrolytes as well. And that condition is called
- **[01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G0lWRnh0GfI&t=72s)** — hyponatremia. And here are the symptoms. Headache, nausea, confusion, irritability,
- **[01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G0lWRnh0GfI&t=79s)** — muscle cramping, as well as brain swelling. There's even a condition called EAH. That's a
- **[01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G0lWRnh0GfI&t=86s)** — condition where the person is waterlogged and it's creating a lot of swelling in the brain.
- **[01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G0lWRnh0GfI&t=90s)** — And that could easily come from just drinking too much water. And this often occurs when
- **[01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G0lWRnh0GfI&t=96s)** — someone is exercising. And so this really pertains to athletes and people that exercise a
- **[01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G0lWRnh0GfI&t=101s)** — lot, especially people that do marathons and they're drinking a lot of water. It could be
- **[01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G0lWRnh0GfI&t=105s)** — quite dangerous. In fact, in the Boston Marathon 2005, at the end of the finish line, they
- **[01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G0lWRnh0GfI&t=116s)** — had this hyponatremia, which is basically a diluted fluid in your body where you don't have
- **[02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G0lWRnh0GfI&t=121s)** — enough sodium. Now there's other things that also can cause hyponatremia other than just
- **[02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G0lWRnh0GfI&t=127s)** — drinking too much water. It could be that you had diarrhea, vomiting, you're just sweating
- **[02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G0lWRnh0GfI&t=131s)** — too much. Because think about it, like when you sweat, it's really salty. And then also,
- **[02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G0lWRnh0GfI&t=137s)** — if you're drinking a lot of plain water without salt, you're just going to create
- **[02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G0lWRnh0GfI&t=141s)** — a situation where you're going to actually be very deficient in salt. Just as a side note,
- **[02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G0lWRnh0GfI&t=144s)** — the first symptoms of a salt or sodium deficiency is muscle weakness. You feel very, very weak.
- **[02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G0lWRnh0GfI&t=152s)** — And this could easily occur if you're doing some type of sport or exercising and you just
- **[02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G0lWRnh0GfI&t=157s)** — you feel like your muscles are weaker and weaker. Well, obviously you need more salt.
- **[02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G0lWRnh0GfI&t=161s)** — And some people that have these sports drinks might not have enough salt or other
- **[02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G0lWRnh0GfI&t=166s)** — electrolytes in them. Instead, they might have a few electrolytes and a lot of glucose,
- **[02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G0lWRnh0GfI&t=171s)** — which by the way can tie up a lot of these electrolytes, especially potassium. It kind of
- **[02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G0lWRnh0GfI&t=175s)** — locks it up. There's another condition where a person is... they have very weak adrenals,
- **[03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G0lWRnh0GfI&t=180s)** — right? Adrenals are very, very weak and that's called adenosines. And that person
- **[03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G0lWRnh0GfI&t=185s)** — can't hold sodium. And so that person is very susceptible to having this hyponatremia
- **[03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G0lWRnh0GfI&t=191s)** — situation. So people that have that condition need to consume a lot of salt just to balance
- **[03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G0lWRnh0GfI&t=197s)** — out the fluids. Now also when someone drinks alcohol, a lot of beer, you know, I remember one
- **[03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G0lWRnh0GfI&t=202s)** — time I was in high school and I drank a case of beer, which is very, very dangerous. And of
- **[03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G0lWRnh0GfI&t=208s)** — course I didn't drink any salt with that. So that created a major imbalance with my electrolytes.
- **[03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G0lWRnh0GfI&t=213s)** — And my brain felt like it was going to explode because that's what happens when you
- **[03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G0lWRnh0GfI&t=218s)** — actually have this hyponatremia is you get swelling in the brain. You also have those that
- **[03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G0lWRnh0GfI&t=223s)** — a hypothyroid condition. You have people that are on diuretics, which can really throw off your
- **[03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G0lWRnh0GfI&t=228s)** — electrolytes because it's meant to get rid of this sodium. And the person is usually on a
- **[03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G0lWRnh0GfI&t=233s)** — low sodium diet. You see, I really think there's more problems with having low sodium than high
- **[03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G0lWRnh0GfI&t=239s)** — sodium. And by the way, if you do consume a lot of sodium, you can always balance out that
- **[04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G0lWRnh0GfI&t=245s)** — with more potassium. People who are salt sensitive are really potassium deficient. Infants are also
- **[04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G0lWRnh0GfI&t=252s)** — susceptible to having this hyponatremia situation. People who are on SSRIs are susceptible as well.
- **[04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G0lWRnh0GfI&t=262s)** — And diabetics are also susceptible to having this situation because of the different fluid
- **[04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G0lWRnh0GfI&t=266s)** — electrolyte imbalances. And also they have higher sugar and they're going to be peeing out
- **[04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G0lWRnh0GfI&t=271s)** — more fluid. And so they can easily be dehydrated. So drinking more water is not the
- **[04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G0lWRnh0GfI&t=276s)** — only cause of this hyponatremia. If the person has diarrhea or is vomiting or is exercising and
- **[04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G0lWRnh0GfI&t=283s)** — sweating all these salts out or is on certain medications that can be also creating a situation,
- **[04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G0lWRnh0GfI&t=288s)** — you'd want to advise them to also add sodium and not go crazy with too much water. So if
- **[04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G0lWRnh0GfI&t=294s)** — you're checked out in this video, check back in because this next thing I want to tell you
- **[04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G0lWRnh0GfI&t=298s)** — very, very important. There has been deaths occurring from people drinking about six
- **[05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G0lWRnh0GfI&t=305s)** — liters of water within a three hour period. What is six liters of fluid? That is 1.5 gallons.
- **[05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G0lWRnh0GfI&t=315s)** — I'm sure you've known people who have just guzzled a gallon of water in one sitting
- **[05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G0lWRnh0GfI&t=321s)** — very quickly. Not smart. When I was in the military, when I would march 17 miles,
- **[05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G0lWRnh0GfI&t=327s)** — we'd drink a tremendous amount of water, but we'd also take salt with that. Typically now,
- **[05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G0lWRnh0GfI&t=332s)** — at least in the military, when you're training, the most that you're supposed to drink per hour
- **[05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G0lWRnh0GfI&t=338s)** — is 1 to 1.5 liters of fluid per hour. So you don't want to drink way too much fluid
- **[05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G0lWRnh0GfI&t=345s)** — too fast, even if you're sweating. Now, of course, on the flip side, if you're susceptible
- **[05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G0lWRnh0GfI&t=350s)** — to kidney stones, you should be drinking at least two and a half liters of fluid a day,
- **[05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G0lWRnh0GfI&t=355s)** — even if you're not thirsty. But the point is you do want to pay attention to your thirst
- **[06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G0lWRnh0GfI&t=360s)** — and drink when you're thirsty and not go crazy with too much. But I think two to two and a
- **[06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G0lWRnh0GfI&t=366s)** — half liters of fluid is totally reasonable. Of course, if you're doing exercise or doing
- **[06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G0lWRnh0GfI&t=370s)** — marathons, you really want to make sure you don't create this condition called hyponatremia,
- **[06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G0lWRnh0GfI&t=376s)** — where you're just guzzling all this water with very little electrolytes. The last point I'm
- **[06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G0lWRnh0GfI&t=383s)** — making, which is very important, if you're exercising and you're sweating, and you're
- **[06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G0lWRnh0GfI&t=386s)** — taking a regular electrolyte powder that's not necessarily meant for sports or exercise,
- **[06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G0lWRnh0GfI&t=393s)** — you might want to either add more sodium to that electrolyte or use some type of sport
- **[06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G0lWRnh0GfI&t=399s)** — hydration electrolyte with more sodium. Now, because of the censoring and the suppressing
- **[06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G0lWRnh0GfI&t=404s)** — of the algorithms on YouTube, it's becoming more difficult to find my content. And there's
- **[06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G0lWRnh0GfI&t=410s)** — a lot of content that I cannot put on YouTube, unfortunately. So to make sure you have full

- **[00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XyX98bnDaow&t=0s)** — What is going on now with bird flu is very close to an exact replay of what happened with COVID.
- **[00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XyX98bnDaow&t=6s)** — Egg prices are not something that is random. It's something else. And you have to follow the money.
- **[00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XyX98bnDaow&t=12s)** — Today, we're going to talk about what's really behind the scarcity of eggs, the price. I'm
- **[00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XyX98bnDaow&t=18s)** — interviewing Clayton Baker, MD, Doctor of Internal Medicine for over 25 years. Doc,
- **[00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XyX98bnDaow&t=23s)** — it's a pleasure to meet you. Now you have some amazing insights to this bird flu, which is a
- **[00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XyX98bnDaow&t=29s)** — deja vu of a playbook that I think just happened recently. I wanted to bring you on because maybe
- **[00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XyX98bnDaow&t=35s)** — you can kind of give us the simple version of what potentially could be going on. As far as
- **[00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XyX98bnDaow&t=42s)** — could this be something that is accidental or maybe manufactured? Yes. Well, thanks for having
- **[00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XyX98bnDaow&t=49s)** — me very much. I appreciate the opportunity to be here and to speak. And thanks for taking time
- **[00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XyX98bnDaow&t=54s)** — to read my article. If we just use basic pattern recognition skills, we can see that
- **[01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XyX98bnDaow&t=60s)** — what is going on now with bird flu is very close to an exact replay of what happened with
- **[01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XyX98bnDaow&t=65s)** — COVID. What we see is a several step process by which people intentionally are creating fear
- **[01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XyX98bnDaow&t=72s)** — and creating a pandemic or attempting to create a pandemic in order to obtain some kind of
- **[01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XyX98bnDaow&t=80s)** — control over us. This is clearly what happened with COVID as even the CIA has admitted now
- **[01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XyX98bnDaow&t=87s)** — that the virus came out of the lab in Wuhan, that it was an engineered virus. Around 2012 or
- **[01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XyX98bnDaow&t=94s)** — somewhere about thereabouts was found in a cave of bats in China and was brought to the
- **[01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XyX98bnDaow&t=99s)** — lab and was manipulated for several years to essentially weaponize it. Late in 2019, that
- **[01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XyX98bnDaow&t=105s)** — virus was released. Whether it was intentional or unintentional remains unclear, but it
- **[01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XyX98bnDaow&t=110s)** — came out of the lab. They allowed the World Military Games, which is an Olympic type event,
- **[01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XyX98bnDaow&t=115s)** — to take place in Wuhan, China, of all places. Brought all kinds of people from all over the
- **[02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XyX98bnDaow&t=121s)** — world, allowed it to spread, and then by early 2020 it was declared to be this pandemic.
- **[02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XyX98bnDaow&t=129s)** — We had all of these civil rights violations locking us down, not allowing us to earn a
- **[02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XyX98bnDaow&t=135s)** — name of protecting us from this virus. They have a countermeasure and the countermeasure
- **[02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XyX98bnDaow&t=141s)** — is to develop these vaccines. They could compel us, they could kind of coerce us into taking
- **[02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XyX98bnDaow&t=146s)** — these highly profitable and turns out quite toxic vaccines. For what reason? Because they
- **[02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XyX98bnDaow&t=152s)** — would make a lot of money and because they would exert control over us to continue to
- **[02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XyX98bnDaow&t=158s)** — take these vaccines in the future. So now let's fast forward to what's happening right
- **[02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XyX98bnDaow&t=162s)** — now with the bird flu. There are multiple labs that have taken a previously naturally occurring
- **[02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XyX98bnDaow&t=170s)** — H5N1 bird flu. They've been manipulating it in the lab doing gain of function, which means
- **[02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XyX98bnDaow&t=175s)** — trying to make it more transmissible and more virulent. And in fact, they're very aggressively
- **[03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XyX98bnDaow&t=180s)** — trying to get it to jump species, which is there's no good reason to do this. Two of the
- **[03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XyX98bnDaow&t=185s)** — prominent labs in the United States that are doing this are the Southeast Poultry Research
- **[03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XyX98bnDaow&t=189s)** — Laboratory, which is owned and operated by our own USDA is doing this crazy research in Athens,
- **[03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XyX98bnDaow&t=195s)** — Georgia. And it's almost certain that this is the location by which the current circulating
- **[03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XyX98bnDaow&t=201s)** — plate, as they call it, of this virus leaked out of. Now, whether it leaked out intentionally
- **[03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XyX98bnDaow&t=207s)** — or unintentionally, I don't know, but we're pretty confident that's where it came from.
- **[03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XyX98bnDaow&t=211s)** — And Peter McCulloch and Nick Hulsher and some other people have done some incredible work to
- **[03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XyX98bnDaow&t=215s)** — trace this down. They've published it and no one's even bothered to try and refute it. Of
- **[03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XyX98bnDaow&t=222s)** — course, our FDA is now claiming that they're doing all they can to contain this, when in fact,
- **[03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XyX98bnDaow&t=226s)** — they almost certainly leaked the virus out. I don't know whether it was intentional or not.
- **[03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XyX98bnDaow&t=231s)** — The other lab, and there's multiple labs that do this type of gain of function research on
- **[03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XyX98bnDaow&t=236s)** — bird flu that's really implicated in this, is at the University of Wisconsin Veterinary
- **[04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XyX98bnDaow&t=241s)** — School. There's a guy, a Japanese national by the name of Yoshihiro Kawaoka. He's been there for
- **[04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XyX98bnDaow&t=246s)** — many years, funded by all kinds of sources. He's funded by NIH. He's funded by Gates Foundation.
- **[04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XyX98bnDaow&t=252s)** — There's all kinds of just really ill-advised stuff. President Obama, back in 2014, put a
- **[04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XyX98bnDaow&t=258s)** — temporary ban on gain of function research in the United States. Some of the people that blew
- **[04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XyX98bnDaow&t=262s)** — the whistle on, you wouldn't believe. Paul Offit, who's one of the big apologists for vaccines,
- **[04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XyX98bnDaow&t=266s)** — was one of the people who was so alarmed by what this guy Kawaoka was doing that even he blew the
- **[04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XyX98bnDaow&t=271s)** — whistle on him. Anthony Fauci found a way around this largely by outsourcing the stuff to China
- **[04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XyX98bnDaow&t=276s)** — for the coronavirus work, and to some extent just ignoring Obama's ban. But that's how bad
- **[04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XyX98bnDaow&t=282s)** — these gain of function people are. Now you've got these leaked lab-manipulated viruses that
- **[04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XyX98bnDaow&t=287s)** — are out there. And fortunately, what we're seeing in the population is not as bad as
- **[04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XyX98bnDaow&t=294s)** — they're advertising. Birds that are getting sick, occasional cows that are getting the
- **[04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XyX98bnDaow&t=299s)** — virus as well, although the cows don't get very sick. I'm not aware of any. There may be
- **[05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XyX98bnDaow&t=304s)** — some, but I'm not aware of any cow deaths. And 67 human beings in North America in the last
- **[05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XyX98bnDaow&t=310s)** — couple of years have gotten this. And for the overwhelming majority of them, it's been
- **[05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XyX98bnDaow&t=314s)** — conjunctivitis. It's been pink-eyed. There was one report of a person who died in Louisiana
- **[05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XyX98bnDaow&t=321s)** — with the bird flu. They would not go so far as to say that the person died of the bird flu,
- **[05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XyX98bnDaow&t=327s)** — although some of the media outlets claimed that. But that has not been stated. They are
- **[05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XyX98bnDaow&t=332s)** — encouraging the farmers to do willy-nilly PCR testing on their flocks. If they test positive,
- **[05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XyX98bnDaow&t=338s)** — what they're doing is mass slaughtering the entire flock. If so much as one bird,
- **[05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XyX98bnDaow&t=343s)** — test positive for the illness. A PCR test, which has a lot of false positives, they have
- **[05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XyX98bnDaow&t=347s)** — one positive. They will kill the entire flock. Some of these farms have millions of chickens,
- **[05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XyX98bnDaow&t=353s)** — correct? Correct. So they can kill hundreds of thousands, maybe millions of birds at once
- **[05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XyX98bnDaow&t=358s)** — because of one or two positive PCR tests. That's why this is important for listeners to
- **[06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XyX98bnDaow&t=365s)** — know. That's why we have a shortage. The shortage is not because the birds are dying of
- **[06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XyX98bnDaow&t=369s)** — the bird flu. The shortage is because they're being mass slaughtered. If there's even one or
- **[06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XyX98bnDaow&t=374s)** — two positive tests. Have you heard anything about this happening in smaller backyard farms,
- **[06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XyX98bnDaow&t=383s)** — people having chickens in their backyards? Is that occurring in that environment at all?
- **[06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XyX98bnDaow&t=387s)** — Or is it just mainly the industrial size chicken farms? It's an excellent question. I
- **[06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XyX98bnDaow&t=391s)** — don't have a definitive answer. But what I would say is that supposedly this individual
- **[06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XyX98bnDaow&t=396s)** — that got extremely sick in Louisiana caught it from their backyard chicken farm. However,
- **[06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XyX98bnDaow&t=403s)** — what's causing the price of eggs to go up is this ridiculous policy of slaughtering whole
- **[06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XyX98bnDaow&t=409s)** — flocks when you have one or a few positive tests. And of course, just to show you how
- **[06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XyX98bnDaow&t=415s)** — dishonest the whole process is, they call it culling. Well, you can look up the definition
- **[07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XyX98bnDaow&t=420s)** — of culling in the dictionary. It has nothing to do with mass slaughter. Mass slaughter is the
- **[07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XyX98bnDaow&t=424s)** — opposite of culling. That's how dishonest this process is. And according to those sources I've
- **[07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XyX98bnDaow&t=431s)** — heard from, we've spent our taxpayer dollars over $1.25 billion to fund this mass slaughter of
- **[07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XyX98bnDaow&t=439s)** — these animals. So we are paying with our own tax dollars to kill these animals, to drive up
- **[07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XyX98bnDaow&t=445s)** — food prices, to make a shortage of eggs. And this is driving this whole thing, not the flu
- **[07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XyX98bnDaow&t=452s)** — itself. Basically, the farmers get paid for that loss from the taxpayers? Correct. So the
- **[07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XyX98bnDaow&t=459s)** — farmers have a perverse incentive. And I don't blame the farmers because the farmers are
- **[07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XyX98bnDaow&t=463s)** — caught between a rock and a hard place. They've got the government coming in and telling them,
- **[07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XyX98bnDaow&t=468s)** — we need to test your birds. But don't worry if they test positive, we'll pay to kill them
- **[07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XyX98bnDaow&t=473s)** — and we'll pay you at least market price, maybe more, in order to solve the problem.
- **[07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XyX98bnDaow&t=478s)** — What it's doing is artificially creating a shortage. It's artificially creating fear. It's
- **[08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XyX98bnDaow&t=489s)** — physically or metaphorically until we accept the human vaccines, what they're doing instead is
- **[08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XyX98bnDaow&t=495s)** — they're destroying a important element of our food supply, unless we allow them to mass
- **[08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XyX98bnDaow&t=500s)** — vaccinate all these birds. So that's really the agenda is they want to mass vaccinate now
- **[08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XyX98bnDaow&t=505s)** — entire farms. That's really what they want to do. There's no other way around it because
- **[08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XyX98bnDaow&t=508s)** — right before Trump took office, what did they do? They gave a conditional approval to
- **[08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XyX98bnDaow&t=516s)** — Zoetis, which is a very large animal vaccine company. A couple days before Trump was
- **[08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XyX98bnDaow&t=522s)** — inaugurated, the Biden administration gave a $590 million grant to our old friends,
- **[08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XyX98bnDaow&t=529s)** — Moderna, to start developing mRNA-based technologies for bird flu.
- **[08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XyX98bnDaow&t=535s)** — So again, what does it come down to? We come down to it just like with COVID,
- **[08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XyX98bnDaow&t=539s)** — a big payoff for Moderna to force us all to accept mRNA vaccines.
- **[09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XyX98bnDaow&t=544s)** — What do we really need to do to stop this? What are some things that need to happen?
- **[09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XyX98bnDaow&t=549s)** — You need to acknowledge what's going on. This is not a bunch of well-meaning scientists
- **[09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XyX98bnDaow&t=555s)** — trying to stamp out disease. This is a criminal enterprise. This is basically a
- **[09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XyX98bnDaow&t=560s)** — protection racket. Nice little farm you got there. It'd be a shame, if anything,
- **[09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XyX98bnDaow&t=565s)** — where to happen to it. Don't worry, we'll protect it. And then we pay you off to do
- **[09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XyX98bnDaow&t=570s)** — we want with it. If Paul Offit could figure it out in 2012 and Barack Obama could figure
- **[09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XyX98bnDaow&t=575s)** — out in 2014, why on earth after all this we've been put through in COVID are we not
- **[09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XyX98bnDaow&t=581s)** — realizing it right now? This gain of function research has to stop. I've said in other places,
- **[09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XyX98bnDaow&t=588s)** — you don't save Tokyo by creating Godzilla. And this is what they were doing. They're
- **[09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XyX98bnDaow&t=593s)** — saying we're going to create Godzilla so we can create a vaccine against Godzilla.
- **[09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XyX98bnDaow&t=597s)** — What on earth are we doing here? Unfortunately, you can't speak freely about certain topics,
- **[10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XyX98bnDaow&t=602s)** — but I think things are going to change. Primary target needs to be shutting down these
- **[10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XyX98bnDaow&t=607s)** — gain of function labs immediately because it's like, why do we need those? It's like it's,
- **[10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XyX98bnDaow&t=612s)** — you're producing weapons that are against humanity. It is completely criminal and insane
- **[10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XyX98bnDaow&t=617s)** — to the nth degree. So many people are embedded in this to some extent or another. And I
- **[10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XyX98bnDaow&t=622s)** — think some people that are low to mid level don't realize exactly why they're doing what
- **[10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XyX98bnDaow&t=627s)** — they're doing. They believe that what they're being told to do is appropriate. I'll tell you
- **[10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XyX98bnDaow&t=632s)** — just a funny story. One of the people who is a placeholder at HHS, or rather the CDC right
- **[10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XyX98bnDaow&t=639s)** — now, he was the former state health commissioner in Maine during COVID. So very much in line
- **[10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XyX98bnDaow&t=644s)** — with the lockdowns and all that kind of stuff. One of the things that's stated on the CDC
- **[10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XyX98bnDaow&t=649s)** — website is that he was involved back earlier in his career with bird flu mitigation in
- **[10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XyX98bnDaow&t=655s)** — Cambodia. Now, of course, Cambodia is a relatively poor country in Southeast Asia where supposedly
- **[11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XyX98bnDaow&t=660s)** — these viruses originate. The current recommendations in Cambodia, where about 95% of chickens are
- **[11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XyX98bnDaow&t=667s)** — owned by family farms, you know, maybe 50 to 100 chickens maximum, is if your bird gets sick,
- **[11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XyX98bnDaow&t=675s)** — you separate the bird from the rest of the flock, preferably you sacrifice that animal.
- **[11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XyX98bnDaow&t=682s)** — Don't eat it. Wash your hands. Common sense. One solution too is to have a lot more small farms
- **[11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XyX98bnDaow&t=689s)** — and start buying eggs from smaller farms. Your local farmers markets. Find a local farmer
- **[11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XyX98bnDaow&t=694s)** — because that way we keep things not so centralized where all of our eggs are in one basket,
- **[11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XyX98bnDaow&t=701s)** — so to speak. Yes, I agree. I'll tell you though one thing is that this is interesting. I
- **[11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XyX98bnDaow&t=710s)** — UK is just an absolute mess in so many different ways, but UK is trying to force people, I don't
- **[11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XyX98bnDaow&t=716s)** — know exactly where it's at right now, but to force people to register any home poultry that
- **[12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XyX98bnDaow&t=721s)** — they have. And the National Association for Veterinary Medicine, which is highly beholden to
- **[12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XyX98bnDaow&t=729s)** — pharma, has put out a release recently that, you know, small family poultry holdings may be
- **[12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XyX98bnDaow&t=737s)** — risk to public health. So don't think that they're not going to come after your backyard
- **[12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XyX98bnDaow&t=742s)** — chickens. You can't run and hide from this. We have to take action. We have to make sure
- **[12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XyX98bnDaow&t=746s)** — that these people are stopped. I really appreciate you doing the work consolidating
- **[12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XyX98bnDaow&t=750s)** — all this information and making it easy to understand. And for those of you watching,
- **[12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XyX98bnDaow&t=754s)** — spread this video out to your friends and family because we need to get the word out.
- **[12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XyX98bnDaow&t=759s)** — So we don't go into this mass agreement that this is what we want. We want to change.
- **[12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XyX98bnDaow&t=765s)** — I'm really adamant about making sure this data goes right into the new administration so they
- **[12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XyX98bnDaow&t=770s)** — can do something about it. Thank you so much, Dr. Baker. I really appreciate you coming on and
- **[12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XyX98bnDaow&t=774s)** — we'll stay in touch and we'll collaborate very soon. Very good. Thanks for having me. I
- **[12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XyX98bnDaow&t=779s)** — appreciate it. Absolutely.

- **[00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN9e99iRTCQ&t=0s)** — Let's talk about the earliest sign of a magnesium deficiency that you do not want to ignore.
- **[00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN9e99iRTCQ&t=5s)** — There are 22 signs, but the earliest sign will shock you, so stay tuned for that.
- **[00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN9e99iRTCQ&t=10s)** — Now check this out. Most of your magnesium is right inside the bone. 60%. 20% is in your muscles.
- **[00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN9e99iRTCQ&t=18s)** — 19% is in the soft tissues in the different organs. And only 1% of all the magnesium
- **[00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN9e99iRTCQ&t=25s)** — is in your blood. Magnesium is the most overlooked nutrient by doctors. You cannot
- **[00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN9e99iRTCQ&t=32s)** — determine a magnesium deficiency by a blood test because half of the magnesium in your bones,
- **[00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN9e99iRTCQ&t=39s)** — 30%, can be used as a reservoir for extra magnesium for your blood. So you can be very
- **[00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN9e99iRTCQ&t=47s)** — magnesium deficient in your body, yet have normal magnesium on your blood test. There's
- **[00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN9e99iRTCQ&t=52s)** — no single quick way to determine your magnesium status in an accurate way. But first let's talk
- **[01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN9e99iRTCQ&t=60s)** — about how someone would be deficient. Let's first go through the things that can deplete
- **[01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN9e99iRTCQ&t=65s)** — you of magnesium. Of course you have the sugar, the refined carbohydrates, you have the alcohol,
- **[01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN9e99iRTCQ&t=71s)** — you have cirrhosis of the liver. You also have even in the farms they put this fertilizer
- **[01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN9e99iRTCQ&t=77s)** — NPK stands for nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium. They don't put magnesium back in the soil. And then
- **[01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN9e99iRTCQ&t=84s)** — if we eat the plants that are low in magnesium, we become deficient in magnesium. Malabsorption is
- **[01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN9e99iRTCQ&t=90s)** — another common reason that means you have inflammation in your gut, which prevents you
- **[01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN9e99iRTCQ&t=94s)** — from absorbing magnesium and other nutrients. If you're on a diuretic, if you are on a PPI,
- **[01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN9e99iRTCQ&t=100s)** — that's something that helps with acid reflux. If you had gastric bypass, if you're low in
- **[01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN9e99iRTCQ&t=106s)** — MND, you're not going to be able to absorb magnesium. If you have inflammation, you won't be
- **[01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN9e99iRTCQ&t=111s)** — able to absorb magnesium. And there are also magnesium deficiency diseases like diabetes, high
- **[01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN9e99iRTCQ&t=119s)** — blood pressure, arthritis, osteoporosis, and cardiovascular disease. Because there's a huge
- **[02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN9e99iRTCQ&t=126s)** — association between all of those diseases and low magnesium. But now let's talk about the diet.
- **[02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN9e99iRTCQ&t=131s)** — What foods are high in magnesium? Well, if you guess leafy greens, you are correct. These are
- **[02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN9e99iRTCQ&t=139s)** — vegetables. Anytime you see green, think chlorophyll. Chlorophyll is the blood of the plant.
- **[02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN9e99iRTCQ&t=145s)** — So if you want more magnesium, think more green. And I'm not talking about pistachio
- **[02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN9e99iRTCQ&t=150s)** — ice cream or lime green jello. If you do certain vegetables like spinach that have high
- **[02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN9e99iRTCQ&t=157s)** — oxalates, that can reduce the absorption. So in other words, some of the foods that do have
- **[02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN9e99iRTCQ&t=164s)** — magnesium like almonds, chocolate also have oxalates, which can block the absorption.
- **[02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN9e99iRTCQ&t=172s)** — Now people will tell you that grains are high in magnesium, right? Well, grains also have
- **[02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN9e99iRTCQ&t=177s)** — phytates, which block magnesium. Those are whole grains. But you say, well, I'm eating
- **[03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN9e99iRTCQ&t=181s)** — refined grains. Well, when they refine the grain, or any food, they get rid of most of the
- **[03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN9e99iRTCQ&t=188s)** — magnesium. So grains are not a good source of magnesium, whether they're whole grains or
- **[03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN9e99iRTCQ&t=192s)** — refined grains. Also, when you boil food, you end up leaching out some of the magnesium.
- **[03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN9e99iRTCQ&t=198s)** — Roughly the RDAs for the recommended amount of magnesium is between like 300 and 400,
- **[03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN9e99iRTCQ&t=204s)** — maybe a little bit more. There's some data that shows that ancient man needed a lot more,
- **[03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN9e99iRTCQ&t=208s)** — double that. And so most people don't even meet the minimum amounts that we need to prevent
- **[03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN9e99iRTCQ&t=214s)** — a magnesium deficiency. And this is why between 48 and 90% of the population is deficient in
- **[03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN9e99iRTCQ&t=221s)** — magnesium. Also realize you can get magnesium from various meats, chicken, especially pork.
- **[03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN9e99iRTCQ&t=228s)** — You can even get it from red meat and even cheeses, especially Parmesan cheese and
- **[03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN9e99iRTCQ&t=235s)** — shellfish. So now let me go through some of the body clues that might indicate that you're low
- **[04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN9e99iRTCQ&t=241s)** — in magnesium. And then I'll get to the first earliest sign, because the earlier you know you
- **[04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN9e99iRTCQ&t=247s)** — have a deficiency, the better. Okay, anxiety, insomnia, depression, migraine headaches,
- **[04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN9e99iRTCQ&t=254s)** — restless leg syndrome, muscle cramps, fatigue, Tourette's, oxidative cholesterol,
- **[04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN9e99iRTCQ&t=261s)** — high homocysteine levels, high blood pressure, calcification in the arteries, arrhythmias, risk
- **[04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN9e99iRTCQ&t=268s)** — for getting a stroke, metabolic syndrome, polycystic ovarian syndrome, it's PCOS,
- **[04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN9e99iRTCQ&t=273s)** — risk for kidney stones, higher levels of calcium in the blood, inflammation, nystigmas,
- **[04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN9e99iRTCQ&t=280s)** — where are your eyes going back and forth, and asthma. So you're probably kind of surprised
- **[04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN9e99iRTCQ&t=286s)** — how many different symptoms could occur if you're deficient in magnesium. But just realize
- **[04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN9e99iRTCQ&t=290s)** — if you have sufficient magnesium in your body, all 350 different enzymes can finally work,
- **[04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN9e99iRTCQ&t=297s)** — and the body can actually do its job. But now let's get to the number one earliest
- **[05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN9e99iRTCQ&t=301s)** — sign that you have a magnesium deficiency. Neuromuscular hyper excitability. Now what the
- **[05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN9e99iRTCQ&t=308s)** — heck does that mean? That's a fancy word for tetany, or twitching of your muscles. Whether
- **[05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN9e99iRTCQ&t=315s)** — you get it underneath your left eye, like a tch tch tch, or even on your arm like this,
- **[05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN9e99iRTCQ&t=319s)** — starts to twitch like that. Any of those little twitching sensations are the earliest signs of
- **[05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN9e99iRTCQ&t=326s)** — a magnesium deficiency. You have to realize that your nerves require magnesium to work. And
- **[05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN9e99iRTCQ&t=333s)** — apparently when you're deficient in magnesium, the nerves become more excited. You get faster
- **[05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN9e99iRTCQ&t=340s)** — nerve impulses, not slower. And if you really want to know what's happening, we don't have
- **[05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN9e99iRTCQ&t=344s)** — magnesium to push the calcium out of the cell. So now we have this buildup of calcium inside
- **[05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN9e99iRTCQ&t=351s)** — the cell. It can't come out because we don't have enough magnesium. So we don't have the
- **[05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN9e99iRTCQ&t=355s)** — normal contraction relaxation. So with magnesium and calcium, we have this whole dynamic between
- **[06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN9e99iRTCQ&t=364s)** — nerve impulses and muscle contraction and relaxation. Now since I brought up
- **[06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN9e99iRTCQ&t=370s)** — these right here, it's called leafy greens. If you want to know how much you really need to
- **[06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN9e99iRTCQ&t=376s)** — not only get your magnesium but your potassium, you should watch this video right here.

- **[00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EHvvVzWT2oY&t=0s)** — Let's talk about rhomboid pain on the scapula. On the right side also you have one on the left side.
- **[00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EHvvVzWT2oY&t=5s)** — We're primarily going to be talking about the one on the right side. Either if there's pain or
- **[00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EHvvVzWT2oY&t=11s)** — tightness or soreness. You may think that you just need to lay on a tennis ball or get it
- **[00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EHvvVzWT2oY&t=16s)** — massaged or do some type of stretching exercise. But you may find that if you do that it comes
- **[00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EHvvVzWT2oY&t=21s)** — right back about an hour later. I used to have rhomboid pain for literally years and I
- **[00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EHvvVzWT2oY&t=27s)** — had no idea what it was. Being a chiropractor I thought everything was basically a bone out of
- **[00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EHvvVzWT2oY&t=33s)** — place and you just adjust it and the problem's gone. I wish I would have known what I know
- **[00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EHvvVzWT2oY&t=38s)** — now back then because the actual cause was referred from something else. Like when you
- **[00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EHvvVzWT2oY&t=45s)** — step in a dog's tail he barks through his mouth, right? Are you going to mess with the
- **[00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EHvvVzWT2oY&t=50s)** — mouth? No, you're going to take the pressure off the tail. So a lot of people with muscular
- **[00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EHvvVzWT2oY&t=55s)** — problems in one part of their body don't realize that it can be referred from a completely
- **[01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EHvvVzWT2oY&t=62s)** — different area. And so there's this one nerve called the dorsal scapular nerve. It comes out
- **[01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EHvvVzWT2oY&t=67s)** — of the fifth cervical vertebra and it connects to the rhomboid as well as another muscle called
- **[01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EHvvVzWT2oY&t=74s)** — the levator scapula muscle which is right here just beneath your trap. So that one
- **[01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EHvvVzWT2oY&t=80s)** — nerve coming from c5 connects to this muscle and your rhomboid. And if there's any pressure on
- **[01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EHvvVzWT2oY&t=87s)** — that nerve you can have discomfort in those areas where it's just it's always irritating,
- **[01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EHvvVzWT2oY&t=92s)** — it's always tight, it's always in a spasm. But what I didn't know at the time I had this
- **[01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EHvvVzWT2oY&t=97s)** — problem was there's another connection to those group of nerves in this lower part of the neck
- **[01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EHvvVzWT2oY&t=104s)** — called the phrenic nerve. So the phrenic nerve goes from the diaphragm from your neck
- **[01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EHvvVzWT2oY&t=110s)** — all the way down to the diaphragm in the front part here on both sides. And when it connects to
- **[01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EHvvVzWT2oY&t=114s)** — the neck it connects to several nerves. And so if there's a problem in the diaphragm area
- **[02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EHvvVzWT2oY&t=121s)** — that can send signals back up to your neck and cause a little tension causing a little bit of a
- **[02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EHvvVzWT2oY&t=126s)** — rotation, an irritation to the nerve, and keep you with tightness in those two muscles
- **[02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EHvvVzWT2oY&t=133s)** — on the right side. And any amount of massage or trigger point therapy is never going to
- **[02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EHvvVzWT2oY&t=140s)** — how to resolve it. I will say there maybe five percent of the time there's an actual problem in
- **[02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EHvvVzWT2oY&t=146s)** — those muscles that you need to do some stretching. And I'm going to show you a really
- **[02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EHvvVzWT2oY&t=149s)** — good way to handle that. But the great majority of the time the problem is at the
- **[02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EHvvVzWT2oY&t=155s)** — bottom part of the phrenic nerve underneath your diaphragm in an area involving three things.
- **[02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EHvvVzWT2oY&t=161s)** — One is the gallbladder. Two is the little tubes that connect the gallbladder with the liver.
- **[02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EHvvVzWT2oY&t=166s)** — Those are called bile ducts. And three, your liver. You could have any number of problems.
- **[02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EHvvVzWT2oY&t=172s)** — You can have gallstones. You can have an irritation with the gallbladder. You can have
- **[02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EHvvVzWT2oY&t=177s)** — bile sludge that is causing distension in your tubes. The bile ducts. That's called
- **[03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EHvvVzWT2oY&t=183s)** — choleostasis. And that really comes from a lacubile. Or you can actually have an enlargement
- **[03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EHvvVzWT2oY&t=189s)** — in the liver. That's called a paddle megaly. And that can actually even come from having a
- **[03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EHvvVzWT2oY&t=194s)** — If you've ever heard of foie gras, which is a French word, what they basically do is force feed
- **[03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EHvvVzWT2oY&t=199s)** — like corn or other grains into these geese or a duck to fatten up the liver. And that liver
- **[03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EHvvVzWT2oY&t=207s)** — can enlarge by 10 times. Okay? So when we eat corn or carbs or sugars, our livers also
- **[03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EHvvVzWT2oY&t=215s)** — get fatty. And they can enlarge to the point where they can press on that nerve as well
- **[03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EHvvVzWT2oY&t=220s)** — and cause that same problem on the right side. And of course, some people watching this video
- **[03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EHvvVzWT2oY&t=225s)** — might have the problem on the left side. Well, this same thing applies because if you have
- **[03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EHvvVzWT2oY&t=231s)** — this sludge blocking the bile ducts right by your gallbladder, they do cross over to the
- **[03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EHvvVzWT2oY&t=238s)** — pancreatic tubes and ducts. And it can cause a backup in the pancreas as well, causing the
- **[04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EHvvVzWT2oY&t=244s)** — pain on the left side in the back part. The same thing I'm going to talk about applies to
- **[04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EHvvVzWT2oY&t=249s)** — you on the right side or the left side. So the real problem with this pain back here is either
- **[04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EHvvVzWT2oY&t=253s)** — a problem with the gallbladder, the bile ducts, or your liver. You can do a real simple experiment
- **[04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EHvvVzWT2oY&t=258s)** — to figure this out. You can massage or press underneath your right rib cage, right where your
- **[04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EHvvVzWT2oY&t=264s)** — gallbladder is, about an inch down and an inch off the midline, okay, to the right.
- **[04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EHvvVzWT2oY&t=269s)** — And just start massaging this area. It'll be a little bit sore, but if you massage it for
- **[04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EHvvVzWT2oY&t=275s)** — 10 seconds, it should give you relief on your right shoulder area into the rhomboid. Now the
- **[04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EHvvVzWT2oY&t=282s)** — pain and discomfort will come right back, but just the fact that it produces some relief tells
- **[04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EHvvVzWT2oY&t=287s)** — you there's something going on in the right lower area. Whether it could be the gallbladder
- **[04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EHvvVzWT2oY&t=293s)** — or bile duct, liver, we don't know yet. But my suggestion is just to start eating to improve
- **[04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EHvvVzWT2oY&t=299s)** — that whole area. Avoiding certain things and eating certain things to improve it to the point
- **[05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EHvvVzWT2oY&t=305s)** — that problem completely goes away. And I can tell you from firsthand experience, I no longer have
- **[05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EHvvVzWT2oY&t=310s)** — that problem because I changed my diet. So what are the top foods that irritate the liver,
- **[05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EHvvVzWT2oY&t=316s)** — the bile ducts, and the gallbladder? Grains. Then you also have sugars, and you have omega-6
- **[05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EHvvVzWT2oY&t=321s)** — oils. And they're very irritating to your your gallbladder and your liver, and they're
- **[05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EHvvVzWT2oY&t=328s)** — inflammatory. So if you were to go out to a restaurant and order something deep-fried,
- **[05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EHvvVzWT2oY&t=332s)** — they're going to use some of these oils in the process. And when you eat them, you're going to
- **[05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EHvvVzWT2oY&t=335s)** — feel bloated underneath the right rib cage and you're going to feel tension in those muscles
- **[05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EHvvVzWT2oY&t=340s)** — eventually. And then you also have other things that are deep-fried like chips. Just take a
- **[05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EHvvVzWT2oY&t=345s)** — look at what the ingredients are. It's going to be some type of oil they fry the corn or
- **[05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EHvvVzWT2oY&t=349s)** — the potato in, and that would also aggravate it. Other foods that are high in omega-6 would be
- **[05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EHvvVzWT2oY&t=355s)** — the nut butters, almond butter, peanut butter. But any of the nuts could irritate this
- **[06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EHvvVzWT2oY&t=361s)** — area as well. Then you have alcohol that can irritate it, junk foods, processed foods,
- **[06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EHvvVzWT2oY&t=367s)** — heavy meals, eating frequently, keeping your whole digestive tract filled with food all the
- **[06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EHvvVzWT2oY&t=373s)** — time. It's going to be very irritating to this area. It's going to cause the liver to
- **[06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EHvvVzWT2oY&t=376s)** — have to work constantly, creating more problems. So those are all the big culprits. Now what I
- **[06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EHvvVzWT2oY&t=382s)** — recommend is to have moderate amount of protein with your meals. Not necessarily eat
- **[06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EHvvVzWT2oY&t=389s)** — high-fat, but don't avoid saturated fats, but eat high-quality protein like from eggs, fish,
- **[06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EHvvVzWT2oY&t=396s)** — grass-fed meats, things like that, as well as consuming a good amount of vegetables or salad
- **[06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EHvvVzWT2oY&t=403s)** — at the same time you're eating these proteins and fats. So have your big salad first and
- **[06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EHvvVzWT2oY&t=410s)** — then have your protein or fat with each meal. The vegetables or the fiber in the vegetables
- **[06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EHvvVzWT2oY&t=415s)** — will help you to increase the flow of cholesterol through the liver and through the
- **[07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EHvvVzWT2oY&t=421s)** — bile ducts. And the vegetables are really, really good for the liver in general. Eating
- **[07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EHvvVzWT2oY&t=426s)** — just meat or fat without vegetables is a bit hard on the liver. And of course, when you
- **[07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EHvvVzWT2oY&t=432s)** — cook the heck out of the vegetables, don't eat them raw, you don't get to have the enzymes in
- **[07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EHvvVzWT2oY&t=439s)** — those raw vegetables to help you. And then the other thing that's really important is not to eat
- **[07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EHvvVzWT2oY&t=443s)** — frequent. Do intermittent fasting. There's a couple things I'm going to recommend to help
- **[07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EHvvVzWT2oY&t=449s)** — thin the bile to allow things to kind of flow through. There's a product that you can just
- **[07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EHvvVzWT2oY&t=454s)** — look online and get it. Amazon is called Tudka. T-U-D-C-A. So Tudka is a type of
- **[07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EHvvVzWT2oY&t=462s)** — bile salt that helps to thin the bile. You would take two of those in the morning on an
- **[07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EHvvVzWT2oY&t=474s)** — good bile salt supplement that you can take with a meal. And you would take two of those
- **[08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EHvvVzWT2oY&t=480s)** — after the meal. So now this extra bile will just help to take the relief off the liver,
- **[08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EHvvVzWT2oY&t=486s)** — the gallbladder, and the bile ducts and allow bile to flow through this area nicely.
- **[08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EHvvVzWT2oY&t=491s)** — And you're going to find over the course of a week or two weeks, there's going to be a lot
- **[08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EHvvVzWT2oY&t=494s)** — of relief in this back part. So that solution is pretty much going to handle like 95% of
- **[08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EHvvVzWT2oY&t=502s)** — all cases. Let's say there's problems in that actual area because of your posture,
- **[08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EHvvVzWT2oY&t=507s)** — the way you're sitting with the computer, or an injury. For that I would recommend getting
- **[08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EHvvVzWT2oY&t=511s)** — the mobility sticks. These are really cool exercise... I don't know if you call them
- **[08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EHvvVzWT2oY&t=516s)** — tools or exercise equipment. There's these sticks that you can do. These amazing stretching
- **[08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EHvvVzWT2oY&t=522s)** — exercises. I recently got them and I love them. I'm not affiliated with the company but
- **[08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EHvvVzWT2oY&t=526s)** — I'm going to put a link down below to check them out because the exercises you can do
- **[08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EHvvVzWT2oY&t=530s)** — are amazing for not just for your rhomboid and the muscles up through in the shoulder
- **[08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EHvvVzWT2oY&t=535s)** — but the entire body. I'm always investigating different pieces of equipment and different
- **[09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EHvvVzWT2oY&t=541s)** — exercises and I really like this one a lot. Now since we're on the topic of referred pain,
- **[09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EHvvVzWT2oY&t=547s)** — okay, there's a really interesting video that talks about other parts of your body that are
- **[09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EHvvVzWT2oY&t=553s)** — painful. The cause is not coming from where you think it is. And if you haven't seen this
- **[09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EHvvVzWT2oY&t=558s)** — video, I put it up right here. Check it out.

- **[00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCRrD-4G0Ic&t=0s)** — I want to share some information that every person who had their gallbladder removed should know about.
- **[00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCRrD-4G0Ic&t=5s)** — Unfortunately, they're not told this information. Now, maybe you have a gallbladder problem,
- **[00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCRrD-4G0Ic&t=10s)** — let's say gallstones, and you're considering getting surgery. I also want to cover some
- **[00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCRrD-4G0Ic&t=15s)** — data about that. And I will cover all the complications that can happen once they remove
- **[00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCRrD-4G0Ic&t=20s)** — the gallbladder and then what you can do about it naturally. But you can live a long life and
- **[00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCRrD-4G0Ic&t=25s)** — be perfectly healthy without a gallbladder. Okay, but 40% of the people who had their gallbladder
- **[00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCRrD-4G0Ic&t=32s)** — removed end up having persisting complications and pain and symptoms for at least a year,
- **[00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCRrD-4G0Ic&t=39s)** — sometimes a lot longer, either constipation or diarrhea, anal leakage. And you might even
- **[00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCRrD-4G0Ic&t=45s)** — feel like a full sensation underneath your right rib cage that could refer to the right
- **[00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCRrD-4G0Ic&t=49s)** — shoulder. Or you might have something called Collins sign, which is the discomfort on the
- **[00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCRrD-4G0Ic&t=55s)** — tip of your scapula on the right side. So if you reach your hand back there, it's like you
- **[00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCRrD-4G0Ic&t=59s)** — might feel some weird thing going on. Now, let's say you have gallstones and they're
- **[01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCRrD-4G0Ic&t=63s)** — recommending getting surgery. Well, I'm going to show you some other things that you might want
- **[01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCRrD-4G0Ic&t=67s)** — to look at. But there's also the option of what's called lithotripsy, which is using
- **[01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCRrD-4G0Ic&t=73s)** — sound waves to break up those stones versus doing a surgery to remove the gallbladder.
- **[01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCRrD-4G0Ic&t=79s)** — If anyone tells you that the gallbladder is an extra organ that is not needed, they are lying
- **[01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCRrD-4G0Ic&t=86s)** — to you because we need the gallbladder has a very important function. So the gallbladder is
- **[01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCRrD-4G0Ic&t=92s)** — an extension of the liver. So every time you eat, your gallbladder contracts and it releases
- **[01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCRrD-4G0Ic&t=99s)** — this super concentrated fluid called bile that empties into the small intestine. And so the
- **[01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCRrD-4G0Ic&t=107s)** — gallbladder is just a sack to hold and concentrate the bile. Well, what bile does is it starts to
- **[01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCRrD-4G0Ic&t=116s)** — break down the fats into smaller little bits like detergent. So it's kind of like
- **[02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCRrD-4G0Ic&t=125s)** — dissolving the grease. Okay, I'm just going to break it down into smaller little pieces
- **[02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCRrD-4G0Ic&t=129s)** — until we have these tiny little, you know, this is basically the end product of bile salts
- **[02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCRrD-4G0Ic&t=136s)** — right here. So now the pancreas can come in there and do the rest of the work. It releases
- **[02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCRrD-4G0Ic&t=144s)** — an enzyme to help you dissolve fats called lipase and it'll take these little small little
- **[02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCRrD-4G0Ic&t=149s)** — particles and break them down further because now there's more surface area for the enzyme to
- **[02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCRrD-4G0Ic&t=156s)** — attack to dissolve. So then you have the benefit of certain things in fats like fat
- **[02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCRrD-4G0Ic&t=168s)** — and the essential fatty acids. Omega 3, Omega 6. Without bile you will not be able to extract
- **[02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCRrD-4G0Ic&t=176s)** — the fat nutrients from the fat that you eat. So bile is really important and it's the bile
- **[03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCRrD-4G0Ic&t=184s)** — that also helps you get rid of excess cholesterol. Bile has some other purposes too. Bile
- **[03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCRrD-4G0Ic&t=193s)** — stimulates the bile flow. So in other words, if you don't have enough bile, okay, bile salts,
- **[03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCRrD-4G0Ic&t=202s)** — what will happen is things will kind of, they won't move that well through the ducts
- **[03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCRrD-4G0Ic&t=207s)** — because you see there's a condition which is called bile sludge which is basically a
- **[03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCRrD-4G0Ic&t=213s)** — deficiency of bile that you get this kind of the stagnant flow of bile into the bile ducts.
- **[03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCRrD-4G0Ic&t=220s)** — If we take a look at what is a gall stone, it's basically a super concentrated cholesterol
- **[03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCRrD-4G0Ic&t=227s)** — stone. And the reason why it turned into a cholesterol stone that's super concentrated
- **[03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCRrD-4G0Ic&t=232s)** — is because you didn't have enough bile to keep it loose. And this is why one of the
- **[03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCRrD-4G0Ic&t=238s)** — remedies for dissolving a stone is to take bile salts after you eat. If you're low in
- **[04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCRrD-4G0Ic&t=247s)** — guess what your liver is going to do. It's going to make more bile and make more cholesterol.
- **[04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCRrD-4G0Ic&t=254s)** — 75% of all the cholesterol in your body actually is made by your own body. It's not all diet.
- **[04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCRrD-4G0Ic&t=262s)** — Only 25% is diet. So this is really important to know if you have a cholesterol problem. It
- **[04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCRrD-4G0Ic&t=267s)** — could just be a gallbladder issue or a liver problem because you're not making enough
- **[04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCRrD-4G0Ic&t=273s)** — bile. Now bile is also made by your microbes and so that's called secondary bile.
- **[04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCRrD-4G0Ic&t=278s)** — This bile thing is really important. Bile salts also help get rid of microbes in the
- **[04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCRrD-4G0Ic&t=286s)** — small intestine. So in other words, we don't want a lot of microbes in the small intestine.
- **[04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCRrD-4G0Ic&t=291s)** — So the bile that's dumped into the small intestine kind of clears out the microbes
- **[04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCRrD-4G0Ic&t=297s)** — in the small intestine. And then once the bile gets to the last part of the small intestine,
- **[05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCRrD-4G0Ic&t=302s)** — it gets reabsorbed and gets recycled. So I want to talk about what creates a bile deficiency.
- **[05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCRrD-4G0Ic&t=309s)** — Estrogen is one. That would include birth control pills, being pregnant, you know,
- **[05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCRrD-4G0Ic&t=314s)** — any type of estrogen can do it. And this is probably why women have more gallstones than
- **[05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCRrD-4G0Ic&t=318s)** — men, which is related to stress. But also prednisone, the medication prednisone could also
- **[05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCRrD-4G0Ic&t=324s)** — set you up for this. This is why diabetics have a higher risk of getting gallstones.
- **[05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCRrD-4G0Ic&t=330s)** — And people that have higher carbohydrate diets also are at more risk of getting gallstones.
- **[05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCRrD-4G0Ic&t=335s)** — If someone is overweight, they could actually be at risk because people that are overweight
- **[05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCRrD-4G0Ic&t=341s)** — have higher amounts of fasting insulin. Anyone with liver disease, either a fatty liver,
- **[05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCRrD-4G0Ic&t=347s)** — cirrhosis, or hepatitis, why? Because the very cells that make bile are in your liver.
- **[05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCRrD-4G0Ic&t=354s)** — Being in the low fat diet can set you up for a problem with gallstones too. Why? Because take
- **[06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCRrD-4G0Ic&t=361s)** — a while guess what triggers the release of bile? Fat in the diet. Also, if you're taking
- **[06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCRrD-4G0Ic&t=368s)** — PPIs, okay, and acids, why? Because part of the digestive process involves hydrochloric acid.
- **[06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCRrD-4G0Ic&t=375s)** — And if you don't have enough hydrochloric acid, then there's going to be an alteration
- **[06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCRrD-4G0Ic&t=381s)** — in pH in your small intestine. There's going to be a lack of stimulus of the release of
- **[06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCRrD-4G0Ic&t=386s)** — the gallbladder. Also, if you're low on folate, magnesium, vitamin C, and even calcium,
- **[06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCRrD-4G0Ic&t=394s)** — can all set you up for a gallstone. If you're low in melatonin, you can be at risk
- **[06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCRrD-4G0Ic&t=400s)** — significantly of getting a gallstone. Now, what is this melatonin connection? Melatonin is
- **[06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCRrD-4G0Ic&t=405s)** — used in the mitochondria. The little cells in the bile ducts actually make melatonin.
- **[06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCRrD-4G0Ic&t=411s)** — And melatonin can act as an antioxidant to protect the lining of the bile ducts
- **[06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCRrD-4G0Ic&t=418s)** — from developing inflammation and developing fibrosis within the bile ducts.
- **[07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCRrD-4G0Ic&t=426s)** — Let's say, for example, you had the gallbladder removed and now you have
- **[07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCRrD-4G0Ic&t=430s)** — problems. You have symptoms. There's a couple things that I would highly recommend. Do some
- **[07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCRrD-4G0Ic&t=437s)** — gentle acupressure, not on the scar or not over the gallbladder, but on the opposite
- **[07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCRrD-4G0Ic&t=445s)** — mirror image side, which is over your pancreas. So I'm going to stand up and show you right
- **[07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCRrD-4G0Ic&t=450s)** — here. So this is where the gallbladder is. It's underneath the right rib cage,
- **[07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCRrD-4G0Ic&t=453s)** — right through in here. It's about an inch off the midline, right through in here.
- **[07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCRrD-4G0Ic&t=459s)** — So what you do is you would work on the mirror image side on the opposite side and just press
- **[07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCRrD-4G0Ic&t=464s)** — deep inside here. So what's going to happen is it's actually going to stimulate the pancreas
- **[07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCRrD-4G0Ic&t=468s)** — to work better to help in your digestive flows. Because the problem is that now that you
- **[07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCRrD-4G0Ic&t=477s)** — don't have a gallbladder and you may be deficient in bile, the other organs have to
- **[08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCRrD-4G0Ic&t=481s)** — take up the slack and have to work harder. And the pancreas definitely is the organ that's
- **[08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCRrD-4G0Ic&t=486s)** — going to have to kick in there and produce more enzymes to do the work of what the gallbladder
- **[08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCRrD-4G0Ic&t=491s)** — or a bile should be doing. You'll find when you press into that left side, it's going to be
- **[08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCRrD-4G0Ic&t=496s)** — very tender. Just go at your own pace and then keep working on it like maybe two minutes
- **[08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCRrD-4G0Ic&t=501s)** — twice a day. And you're going to find you're going to have better digestion, less pain,
- **[08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCRrD-4G0Ic&t=507s)** — where the gallbladder was, you'll have more drainage. Also, your stool can tell you a lot
- **[08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCRrD-4G0Ic&t=512s)** — what's going on with your bile. If the stool is gray or pale or white colored, then chances are
- **[08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCRrD-4G0Ic&t=520s)** — you need bile. If the stool floats, that means there's fat in it because you didn't break it
- **[08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCRrD-4G0Ic&t=526s)** — down. That could mean you need more bile. The simple solution is just to take some
- **[08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCRrD-4G0Ic&t=531s)** — bile salts after you eat. You see, they removed the gallbladder, but they didn't really
- **[08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCRrD-4G0Ic&t=537s)** — real problem, which is the concentrated mixture of cholesterol versus the bile.
- **[09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCRrD-4G0Ic&t=543s)** — Let's say, for example, you had your gallbladder out and now you have diarrhea.
- **[09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCRrD-4G0Ic&t=548s)** — In this situation, it's the opposite of constipation. You don't want to take bile
- **[09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCRrD-4G0Ic&t=554s)** — salts. Why? Because taking more bile salts is going to loosen up your stool even more
- **[09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCRrD-4G0Ic&t=560s)** — and give you more diarrhea. There's a certain medication that you have to get with your doctor
- **[09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCRrD-4G0Ic&t=566s)** — to get that kind of slows down this release of bile. And the other thing is, let's say you
- **[09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCRrD-4G0Ic&t=572s)** — start taking bile salts and, oh, wow, that really handled my constipation. But then all of
- **[09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCRrD-4G0Ic&t=576s)** — a sudden you got diarrhea. Well, that could mean that you just back off and take a lot
- **[09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCRrD-4G0Ic&t=581s)** — less. So you really want to evaluate the symptoms, the bowel movements and the stool
- **[09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCRrD-4G0Ic&t=588s)** — as to how much bile, if any, you need. I mentioned bile sludge, right, which is basically a thickened
- **[09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCRrD-4G0Ic&t=598s)** — material of cholesterol. And it's not developed into a stone yet, but it's on its way.
- **[10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCRrD-4G0Ic&t=603s)** — There's a great remedy for that called TUTCA. That is a remedy that should be taken on an
- **[10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCRrD-4G0Ic&t=609s)** — empty stomach because you don't necessarily want that to help you to digest. You want that
- **[10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCRrD-4G0Ic&t=614s)** — to, like I said before, increase the flow of bile through these bile ducts. Any time you take
- **[10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCRrD-4G0Ic&t=621s)** — bile and things get worse, you don't feel right, it doesn't help you, then what that means is
- **[10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCRrD-4G0Ic&t=630s)** — you don't need bile. You need more hydrochloric acid in the stomach. And I would take betaine
- **[10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCRrD-4G0Ic&t=636s)** — hydrochloride. Okay, you can get them in little pills. Now you might say, well, wow,
- **[10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCRrD-4G0Ic&t=640s)** — I just wasted money buying the bile salts. Well, I mean, you could spend a lot of money
- **[10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCRrD-4G0Ic&t=643s)** — on a functional gallbladder test and a certain test to put a scope down your
- **[10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCRrD-4G0Ic&t=649s)** — esophagus to measure the pH of your acid in your stomach. I think spending a little money
- **[10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCRrD-4G0Ic&t=653s)** — on a couple different remedies to see what helps you might be a little bit cheaper.
- **[10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCRrD-4G0Ic&t=658s)** — Now, another thing that I think would be very beneficial is to increase your melatonin in
- **[11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCRrD-4G0Ic&t=663s)** — your body. One way to do that is just to get a good night's sleep and make sure it's
- **[11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCRrD-4G0Ic&t=668s)** — in the room before you go to sleep. But you can also expose yourself to infrared
- **[11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCRrD-4G0Ic&t=673s)** — by going outside more from the sun, you get infrared or candles around at night or a
- **[11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCRrD-4G0Ic&t=680s)** — fireplace or a campfire all gives you this infrared, which will increase melatonin.
- **[11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCRrD-4G0Ic&t=685s)** — And then another remedy that can help increase the production of bile from the
- **[11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCRrD-4G0Ic&t=691s)** — liver is milk thistle. Also, beets can help dandelion greens is another one that can help
- **[11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCRrD-4G0Ic&t=699s)** — artichoke is something that can help increase bile production. And as far as the diet in
- **[11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCRrD-4G0Ic&t=704s)** — general, the macros should be low carb, moderate fat, not low fat, and moderate protein.
- **[11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCRrD-4G0Ic&t=713s)** — And have a salad each day. Now, since we're on the topic of bile salts, I have a very
- **[11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCRrD-4G0Ic&t=718s)** — interesting video on tatka that I think you will really like. So I put that up right here.
- **[12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCRrD-4G0Ic&t=723s)** — Check it out.

- **[00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjfyBJcyoJI&t=0s)** — So, when we talk about essential fatty acids,
- **[00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjfyBJcyoJI&t=3s)** — primarily we're talking about two different kinds.
- **[00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjfyBJcyoJI&t=6s)** — We have omega-6 and omega-3.
- **[00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjfyBJcyoJI&t=9s)** — I want to focus on both of them today because
- **[00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjfyBJcyoJI&t=11s)** — we have a big problem.
- **[00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjfyBJcyoJI&t=14s)** — The ratios at which people are consuming the omega-6 to omega-3
- **[00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjfyBJcyoJI&t=17s)** — are way, way, way, way off.
- **[00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjfyBJcyoJI&t=19s)** — On an average American, they're at 20 to 1
- **[00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjfyBJcyoJI&t=22s)** — to sometimes 70 to 1 or more.
- **[00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjfyBJcyoJI&t=25s)** — And this introduction of the seed oils
- **[00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjfyBJcyoJI&t=28s)** — are a relatively new thing for humans.
- **[00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjfyBJcyoJI&t=31s)** — And I know people call them vegetable oils,
- **[00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjfyBJcyoJI&t=33s)** — but there's no vegetables in these oils.
- **[00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjfyBJcyoJI&t=35s)** — They're seed oils.
- **[00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjfyBJcyoJI&t=36s)** — So this whole seed oil thing started in 1866
- **[00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjfyBJcyoJI&t=39s)** — with cotton seed oil.
- **[00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjfyBJcyoJI&t=41s)** — I mean, before this, we used cotton seed oil
- **[00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjfyBJcyoJI&t=44s)** — in lamps as a fuel.
- **[00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjfyBJcyoJI&t=47s)** — We used it as a lubricant in machinery.
- **[00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjfyBJcyoJI&t=49s)** — And then someone had a great idea to put it in the food supply
- **[00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjfyBJcyoJI&t=53s)** — and turn it into edible oil.
- **[00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjfyBJcyoJI&t=55s)** — In fact, all the information I'm sharing with you
- **[00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjfyBJcyoJI&t=57s)** — is out of this book right here,
- **[00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjfyBJcyoJI&t=58s)** — The Ancestral Diet Revolution by Dr. Chris Kenobemdi.
- **[01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjfyBJcyoJI&t=63s)** — An incredible textbook on everything you'd ever want to know
- **[01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjfyBJcyoJI&t=68s)** — about these seed oils and the effects that it can create
- **[01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjfyBJcyoJI&t=72s)** — for our health.
- **[01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjfyBJcyoJI&t=74s)** — But I want to read you a quote on page 30.
- **[01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjfyBJcyoJI&t=77s)** — On the topic of cotton seed oil use,
- **[01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjfyBJcyoJI&t=79s)** — an issue of popular science
- **[01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjfyBJcyoJI&t=82s)** — from the turn of the 20th century era,
- **[01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjfyBJcyoJI&t=86s)** — summed up cotton seed and cotton seed oil
- **[01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjfyBJcyoJI&t=87s)** — with a single phrase.
- **[01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjfyBJcyoJI&t=90s)** — What was garbage in 1860 was fertilizer in 1870,
- **[01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjfyBJcyoJI&t=95s)** — cattle feed in 1880, and table food in 1890.
- **[01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjfyBJcyoJI&t=101s)** — There's so many things we have in our environments
- **[01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjfyBJcyoJI&t=104s)** — that are considered waste that we somehow turn it into food.
- **[01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjfyBJcyoJI&t=107s)** — I mean, even toxic sewage sludge
- **[01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjfyBJcyoJI&t=109s)** — is recycled into biosolids and used as fertilizer.
- **[01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjfyBJcyoJI&t=115s)** — You have a restaurant grease is recycled
- **[01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjfyBJcyoJI&t=118s)** — and put in the food supply.
- **[01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjfyBJcyoJI&t=119s)** — But let me not divert from this topic.
- **[02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjfyBJcyoJI&t=121s)** — Let's get back to this omega-6, omega-3 fatty acid ratio.
- **[02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjfyBJcyoJI&t=126s)** — We need both of these essential fatty acids,
- **[02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjfyBJcyoJI&t=129s)** — but we definitely don't need it in the imbalanced amounts.
- **[02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjfyBJcyoJI&t=131s)** — Not to mention the source of the seed oils, right?
- **[02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjfyBJcyoJI&t=134s)** — You're talking about using petroleum-derived hexane,
- **[02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjfyBJcyoJI&t=139s)** — which is a solvent in this process,
- **[02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjfyBJcyoJI&t=141s)** — chemical alkalization, bleaching, deodorizing,
- **[02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjfyBJcyoJI&t=146s)** — and you're heating these very unstable oils
- **[02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjfyBJcyoJI&t=148s)** — many different times.
- **[02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjfyBJcyoJI&t=150s)** — And what's really wild about this
- **[02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjfyBJcyoJI&t=151s)** — is roughly about a fourth to a third
- **[02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjfyBJcyoJI&t=155s)** — of all your calories.
- **[02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjfyBJcyoJI&t=156s)** — It's not just in cooking oil,
- **[02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjfyBJcyoJI&t=158s)** — it's in a lot of different things.
- **[02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjfyBJcyoJI&t=159s)** — We already have a problem with inflammation.
- **[02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjfyBJcyoJI&t=161s)** — The number one selling drug on the planet
- **[02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjfyBJcyoJI&t=164s)** — is an anti-inflammatory.
- **[02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjfyBJcyoJI&t=166s)** — And when your fat cell becomes inflamed,
- **[02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjfyBJcyoJI&t=168s)** — that can produce insulin resistance.
- **[02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjfyBJcyoJI&t=171s)** — And then also at the heart of this inflammation,
- **[02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjfyBJcyoJI&t=174s)** — we have a lot of associated mitochondrial dysfunction.
- **[02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjfyBJcyoJI&t=178s)** — The majority of illnesses and disease
- **[03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjfyBJcyoJI&t=180s)** — are in mitochondrial origin.
- **[03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjfyBJcyoJI&t=182s)** — Now I'll just show you two graphs right here.
- **[03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjfyBJcyoJI&t=184s)** — The top graph is the omega-6 fatty acids.
- **[03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjfyBJcyoJI&t=189s)** — Okay?
- **[03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjfyBJcyoJI&t=189s)** — The bottom graph is the omega-3 fatty acids.
- **[03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjfyBJcyoJI&t=191s)** — As you can see, the trend for omega-3
- **[03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjfyBJcyoJI&t=194s)** — is not nearly as high as omega-6.
- **[03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjfyBJcyoJI&t=197s)** — I'm going to show you this graph right here.
- **[03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjfyBJcyoJI&t=199s)** — If you look at heart disease going up
- **[03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjfyBJcyoJI&t=201s)** — and look at saturated fat right in the center there.
- **[03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjfyBJcyoJI&t=204s)** — That is not spiking parallel with seed oils.
- **[03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjfyBJcyoJI&t=209s)** — So in other words, we've replaced our saturated fats
- **[03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjfyBJcyoJI&t=211s)** — with seed oils with this false idea
- **[03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjfyBJcyoJI&t=214s)** — that the saturated fats are the problem
- **[03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjfyBJcyoJI&t=216s)** — and the unsaturated fats are the solution.
- **[03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjfyBJcyoJI&t=219s)** — Unsaturated fats do have the capacity to lower cholesterol
- **[03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjfyBJcyoJI&t=224s)** — but they're not heart protective.
- **[03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjfyBJcyoJI&t=226s)** — There's a lot of data that indicates that
- **[03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjfyBJcyoJI&t=227s)** — these highly processed industrial seed oils
- **[03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjfyBJcyoJI&t=230s)** — create a lot of damage at the cellular level.
- **[03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjfyBJcyoJI&t=233s)** — You can see total meat, okay?
- **[03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjfyBJcyoJI&t=237s)** — And you can also see over time red meat
- **[04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjfyBJcyoJI&t=240s)** — is not really a big spike.
- **[04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjfyBJcyoJI&t=244s)** — But poultry is. Interesting.
- **[04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjfyBJcyoJI&t=246s)** — So the big spike in meat is really chicken
- **[04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjfyBJcyoJI&t=250s)** — which is very high in omega-6 fatty acids.
- **[04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjfyBJcyoJI&t=253s)** — If you're doing grass-fed meats
- **[04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjfyBJcyoJI&t=255s)** — it's going to be very low in this omega-6 fatty acid.
- **[04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjfyBJcyoJI&t=258s)** — In this graph right here we have cardiovascular deaths
- **[04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjfyBJcyoJI&t=261s)** — correlate more with vegetable oils
- **[04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjfyBJcyoJI&t=264s)** — than it does with sugar.
- **[04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjfyBJcyoJI&t=267s)** — Seed oils are in so many different foods
- **[04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjfyBJcyoJI&t=270s)** — and it's definitely part of pretty much
- **[04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjfyBJcyoJI&t=272s)** — every single ultra-processed food.
- **[04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjfyBJcyoJI&t=275s)** — A.K.A. junk foods.
- **[04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjfyBJcyoJI&t=278s)** — A lot of times people think that
- **[04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjfyBJcyoJI&t=280s)** — ultra-processed foods are just saturated fats.
- **[04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjfyBJcyoJI&t=284s)** — Well, really the only saturated fats
- **[04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjfyBJcyoJI&t=286s)** — in these ultra-processed foods
- **[04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjfyBJcyoJI&t=287s)** — is palm oil in very small amounts.
- **[04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjfyBJcyoJI&t=291s)** — I mean, really no one's talking about
- **[04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjfyBJcyoJI&t=292s)** — the seed oils in these ultra-processed foods.
- **[04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjfyBJcyoJI&t=294s)** — The unsaturated fatty acids
- **[04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjfyBJcyoJI&t=296s)** — which are very unstable.
- **[04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjfyBJcyoJI&t=298s)** — That's enough for omega-6 fatty acids.
- **[05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjfyBJcyoJI&t=300s)** — Now what about omega-3 fatty acids?
- **[05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjfyBJcyoJI&t=302s)** — Where do we get that?
- **[05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjfyBJcyoJI&t=303s)** — We get it from fish.
- **[05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjfyBJcyoJI&t=305s)** — Cod liver oil.
- **[05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjfyBJcyoJI&t=306s)** — Cod liver has probably the most omega-3 fatty acids.
- **[05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjfyBJcyoJI&t=310s)** — Sardines and wild caught shellfish.
- **[05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjfyBJcyoJI&t=313s)** — But the animals that consume these grains
- **[05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjfyBJcyoJI&t=317s)** — like pigs and chickens and even the grain-fed beef
- **[05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjfyBJcyoJI&t=320s)** — are much higher in omega-6 fatty acids.
- **[05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjfyBJcyoJI&t=323s)** — So this is one reason why a lot of people
- **[05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjfyBJcyoJI&t=326s)** — are turning to grass-fed, grass-finished beef.
- **[05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjfyBJcyoJI&t=329s)** — Because it's going to contribute to the omega-3 fatty acids.
- **[05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjfyBJcyoJI&t=332s)** — People are doing more and more fish
- **[05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjfyBJcyoJI&t=334s)** — which is also going to contribute.
- **[05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjfyBJcyoJI&t=336s)** — Now when we have this omega-6 fatty acid
- **[05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjfyBJcyoJI&t=338s)** — and omega-3 fatty acid
- **[05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjfyBJcyoJI&t=340s)** — they go through a series of pathways
- **[05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjfyBJcyoJI&t=342s)** — to be able to turn into certain compounds
- **[05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjfyBJcyoJI&t=344s)** — that benefit our bodies.
- **[05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjfyBJcyoJI&t=346s)** — And the enzymes that allow
- **[05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjfyBJcyoJI&t=348s)** — this biochemical conversions
- **[05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjfyBJcyoJI&t=350s)** — are shared by both the omega-6 and omega-3.
- **[05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjfyBJcyoJI&t=354s)** — In other words, both of these oils
- **[05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjfyBJcyoJI&t=356s)** — compete with each other.
- **[05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjfyBJcyoJI&t=358s)** — And so if there's any problem
- **[06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjfyBJcyoJI&t=360s)** — in this biochemical pathway
- **[06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjfyBJcyoJI&t=363s)** — because maybe we are missing cofactors
- **[06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjfyBJcyoJI&t=367s)** — then you're going to get dysfunctional fats.
- **[06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjfyBJcyoJI&t=370s)** — You're not going to get the benefit of the omega-3
- **[06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjfyBJcyoJI&t=372s)** — and we're not going to be able to use
- **[06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjfyBJcyoJI&t=374s)** — some of these oils.
- **[06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjfyBJcyoJI&t=375s)** — Now don't get me wrong, we do need omega-6 as well
- **[06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjfyBJcyoJI&t=378s)** — but we don't need it in such high quantities.
- **[06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjfyBJcyoJI&t=380s)** — And we also need it from a much higher quality source.
- **[06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjfyBJcyoJI&t=383s)** — So the cofactors that allow this to happen
- **[06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjfyBJcyoJI&t=385s)** — include like magnesium, B2, B3, B6
- **[06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjfyBJcyoJI&t=390s)** — vitamin C, and, and this is interesting, insulin.
- **[06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjfyBJcyoJI&t=394s)** — Now you have to realize that the great majority of people
- **[06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjfyBJcyoJI&t=396s)** — are insulin resistant, which means
- **[06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjfyBJcyoJI&t=399s)** — they're deficient in insulin.
- **[06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjfyBJcyoJI&t=402s)** — So therefore they're not going to have the cofactor
- **[06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjfyBJcyoJI&t=405s)** — to allow this to happen.
- **[06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjfyBJcyoJI&t=407s)** — So I really think based on that data
- **[06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjfyBJcyoJI&t=409s)** — that if you're doing a lot of seed oils
- **[06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjfyBJcyoJI&t=411s)** — and you're insulin resistant
- **[06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjfyBJcyoJI&t=414s)** — there's going to be a lot more compounded damage
- **[06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjfyBJcyoJI&t=416s)** — versus if you were to correct insulin resistance
- **[06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjfyBJcyoJI&t=419s)** — through a diet that's low on carb
- **[07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjfyBJcyoJI&t=422s)** — and doing intermittent fasting for a period of time
- **[07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjfyBJcyoJI&t=424s)** — you're going to be able to utilize
- **[07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjfyBJcyoJI&t=426s)** — more of the benefits of these essential fatty acids
- **[07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjfyBJcyoJI&t=428s)** — and not have dysfunctional problems with them.
- **[07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjfyBJcyoJI&t=431s)** — Primarily we have like EPA in DHA.
- **[07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjfyBJcyoJI&t=434s)** — EPA is more for inflammation.
- **[07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjfyBJcyoJI&t=437s)** — DHA is really important in cognitive function,
- **[07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjfyBJcyoJI&t=441s)** — attention, focus, learning.
- **[07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjfyBJcyoJI&t=443s)** — And that's going to come from fatty fish in fish oil.
- **[07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjfyBJcyoJI&t=447s)** — Now there's also a precursor that turns into EPA
- **[07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjfyBJcyoJI&t=450s)** — that's called ALA.
- **[07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjfyBJcyoJI&t=452s)** — Sometimes you'll see in various articles that
- **[07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjfyBJcyoJI&t=456s)** — you know, consume more flax and chia seed
- **[07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjfyBJcyoJI&t=458s)** — and walnuts if you want to get more omega-3 fatty acids
- **[07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjfyBJcyoJI&t=462s)** — but they're not talking about EPA
- **[07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjfyBJcyoJI&t=464s)** — they're talking about the precursor.
- **[07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjfyBJcyoJI&t=466s)** — There's a really important test
- **[07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjfyBJcyoJI&t=469s)** — that measures your omega-6 to your omega-3 fatty acid ratio.
- **[07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjfyBJcyoJI&t=474s)** — And so that way you can actually know if you're okay or not.
- **[07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjfyBJcyoJI&t=477s)** — They'll tell you based on a simple blood spot test
- **[08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjfyBJcyoJI&t=481s)** — where you just take a drop of blood
- **[08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjfyBJcyoJI&t=482s)** — put it on this little card, send it in.
- **[08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjfyBJcyoJI&t=483s)** — It'll give you more information
- **[08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjfyBJcyoJI&t=485s)** — into what's happening internally in your body.
- **[08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjfyBJcyoJI&t=487s)** — And I highly recommend that test done over time
- **[08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjfyBJcyoJI&t=491s)** — to be able to correct these ratios if they're off.
- **[08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjfyBJcyoJI&t=494s)** — So in summary, start to consume
- **[08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjfyBJcyoJI&t=497s)** — wild-caught fish on a regular basis
- **[08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjfyBJcyoJI&t=499s)** — like salmon and sardines, things like that.
- **[08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjfyBJcyoJI&t=501s)** — And at the same time start limiting
- **[08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjfyBJcyoJI&t=503s)** — the amount of omega-6 fatty acids
- **[08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjfyBJcyoJI&t=506s)** — because never in history have we consumed
- **[08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjfyBJcyoJI&t=509s)** — the quantities and the out of balance ratios
- **[08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjfyBJcyoJI&t=512s)** — of omega-6 to omega-3.
- **[08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjfyBJcyoJI&t=515s)** — And I'm going to put a link down below
- **[08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjfyBJcyoJI&t=517s)** — for Dr. Kenobi's book
- **[08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjfyBJcyoJI&t=519s)** — as well as a link if you wanted to get that test
- **[08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjfyBJcyoJI&t=522s)** — to evaluate.
- **[08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjfyBJcyoJI&t=524s)** — And instead of me taking an affiliate commission
- **[08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjfyBJcyoJI&t=527s)** — I'm going to share that commission with you as a discount
- **[08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjfyBJcyoJI&t=531s)** — so you pay the least amount possible.
- **[08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjfyBJcyoJI&t=534s)** — So I'll put that link down below.
- **[08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjfyBJcyoJI&t=535s)** — You can get that test and see where you're at.
- **[08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjfyBJcyoJI&t=537s)** — So thanks for watching.
- **[08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjfyBJcyoJI&t=538s)** — And if you have not seen my video on cod liver oil,
- **[09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjfyBJcyoJI&t=542s)** — that's a good one to watch too.
- **[09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjfyBJcyoJI&t=543s)** — I put it up right here.

- **[00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWrzH4IBs-Q&t=0s)** — I want to share some very important information about preserving your muscle for longevity.
- **[00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWrzH4IBs-Q&t=5s)** — Did you realize that when certain people lose weight, it actually shortens their lifespan?
- **[00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWrzH4IBs-Q&t=11s)** — Now, how can that be? I mean, we all know that losing weight helps you live longer,
- **[00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWrzH4IBs-Q&t=15s)** — right? As you get older, it's very important that you maintain a good amount of lean muscle
- **[00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWrzH4IBs-Q&t=20s)** — mass. As a side note, I do want to mention something that's very popular right now.
- **[00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWrzH4IBs-Q&t=24s)** — People going on Ozempic that manipulate certain hormones to help you establish better blood
- **[00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWrzH4IBs-Q&t=30s)** — sugar and decrease hunger and slow down digestion. What you should also know is it comes with
- **[00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWrzH4IBs-Q&t=35s)** — a package. In certain trials, they showed that these drugs can actually significantly
- **[00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWrzH4IBs-Q&t=40s)** — cause muscle loss. The weight that the person is losing is not all fat. In one
- **[00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWrzH4IBs-Q&t=45s)** — study, they compared it to a decade or more of aging. It would be terrible for
- **[00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWrzH4IBs-Q&t=50s)** — someone to go on that drug, lose all this weight, and find out that it actually also
- **[00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWrzH4IBs-Q&t=55s)** — lost a lot of muscle and then put them at risk for not living as long. As I read
- **[01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWrzH4IBs-Q&t=60s)** — the study, it became very apparent what you're losing really, really is important.
- **[01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWrzH4IBs-Q&t=64s)** — And when we're talking about preserving lean muscle mass out of all the things
- **[01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWrzH4IBs-Q&t=68s)** — that you can do for longevity, that is at the top of the list. Muscle loss actually
- **[01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWrzH4IBs-Q&t=74s)** — starts for most people in their thirties. That's right. We have this peak muscle
- **[01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWrzH4IBs-Q&t=78s)** — mass, let's say, you know, 18, 19, 20 years old. And then in your thirties, it starts to kind of
- **[01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWrzH4IBs-Q&t=84s)** — slightly go downward. I want to mention sarcopenia for a second because this is
- **[01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWrzH4IBs-Q&t=88s)** — age-related muscle loss. And one of the ways they define it is that when you
- **[01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWrzH4IBs-Q&t=92s)** — lose 20% or more of your muscle, that would be considered sarcopenia.
- **[01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWrzH4IBs-Q&t=96s)** — Muscle helps regulate blood sugar. Muscle supports your metabolism and how
- **[01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWrzH4IBs-Q&t=102s)** — you metabolize energy. When people start developing this sarcopenia, their
- **[01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWrzH4IBs-Q&t=105s)** — risk for diabetes goes up, their risk for immune problems goes up, their overall
- **[01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWrzH4IBs-Q&t=110s)** — mortality, the risk of dying goes up as well. On average, an 80-year-old will
- **[01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWrzH4IBs-Q&t=114s)** — lose about 50% of their muscle. However, I am going to explain how you
- **[01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWrzH4IBs-Q&t=119s)** — can avoid that. Of course, one of the most important things you can do
- **[02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWrzH4IBs-Q&t=123s)** — for your muscle is called exercise, right? Did you realize that inactivity
- **[02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWrzH4IBs-Q&t=127s)** — can decrease your muscle mass? How many people are sitting in their
- **[02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWrzH4IBs-Q&t=130s)** — couch just like watching a lot of TV after they retire and they pretty
- **[02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWrzH4IBs-Q&t=134s)** — much don't exercise anymore? The worst thing you can do for your muscles is
- **[02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWrzH4IBs-Q&t=138s)** — not move. And the other point about that is, of course, you want to have
- **[02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWrzH4IBs-Q&t=142s)** — the raw material to build proteins. So that would be grass-fed. Red meat is
- **[02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWrzH4IBs-Q&t=147s)** — at the top of the list. But what do they tell you to avoid as you get
- **[02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWrzH4IBs-Q&t=152s)** — older, right? Avoid red meat because it's going to cause cancer. That's a
- **[02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWrzH4IBs-Q&t=156s)** — total lie. I think it's very, very important to spread out your protein
- **[02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWrzH4IBs-Q&t=161s)** — throughout the day. You should probably do maybe two meals a day or even three
- **[02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWrzH4IBs-Q&t=165s)** — meals a day, depending on how much muscle loss that you have. And then you
- **[02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWrzH4IBs-Q&t=169s)** — should actually take that protein and even it out through the entire day
- **[02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWrzH4IBs-Q&t=174s)** — to keep a valuable protein there for your muscles to take in through the
- **[02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWrzH4IBs-Q&t=179s)** — day. And this is one of the problems I have with a person being a vegan,
- **[03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWrzH4IBs-Q&t=182s)** — especially as they get older, getting the quality amount of protein into
- **[03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWrzH4IBs-Q&t=186s)** — their muscles. Another thing that's really fascinating about this topic is
- **[03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWrzH4IBs-Q&t=190s)** — that insomnia is very deadly to your muscles. Poor sleep will drain muscle
- **[03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWrzH4IBs-Q&t=196s)** — mass more than a poor diet. When you're sleeping, this is where all the
- **[03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWrzH4IBs-Q&t=202s)** — recovery occurs with your muscles. All of the benefit of exercise occurs at
- **[03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWrzH4IBs-Q&t=207s)** — night, not during the day or not during a stress event. And the type
- **[03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWrzH4IBs-Q&t=211s)** — of exercise that you do is very, very important, too. You want to do
- **[03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWrzH4IBs-Q&t=215s)** — something that creates resistance on your muscles. We need to be able to
- **[03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWrzH4IBs-Q&t=219s)** — generate enough stimulus to cause the muscles to react and adapt to that
- **[03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWrzH4IBs-Q&t=224s)** — stress. And resistance training is the most important secret to reversing
- **[03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWrzH4IBs-Q&t=230s)** — age-related muscle loss. This should be a priority for you as you
- **[03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWrzH4IBs-Q&t=234s)** — get older. It's very, very important. Regular resistance training,
- **[03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWrzH4IBs-Q&t=238s)** — regular strength training. Your fat is a reserve for energy. Your muscle
- **[04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWrzH4IBs-Q&t=244s)** — also has a reserve. And this is why your body can fast for a period of
- **[04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWrzH4IBs-Q&t=249s)** — time. It could not eat for days or weeks. Where is it getting the
- **[04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWrzH4IBs-Q&t=253s)** — protein? From your muscle. This reserve in your muscle is also
- **[04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWrzH4IBs-Q&t=257s)** — there to be able to heal from an injury, to allow your immune system
- **[04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWrzH4IBs-Q&t=262s)** — to tap into these amino acids because your immune system is all
- **[04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWrzH4IBs-Q&t=266s)** — protein. The white blood cells, the repair enzymes, the enzymes to
- **[04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWrzH4IBs-Q&t=269s)** — help grow your body are all protein. You also use amino acids to
- **[04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWrzH4IBs-Q&t=274s)** — make glucose for certain tissues that are dependent on glucose.
- **[04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWrzH4IBs-Q&t=280s)** — Called gluconeogenesis. The formation of new sugar from non-carbohydrate
- **[04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWrzH4IBs-Q&t=286s)** — sources. This muscle reserve matters. It's super important. Our
- **[04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWrzH4IBs-Q&t=291s)** — body requires more protein during infection, during an immune
- **[04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWrzH4IBs-Q&t=295s)** — process, after exercise. Having enough muscle also can influence
- **[05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWrzH4IBs-Q&t=300s)** — your cognitive state. All these neurotransmitters are made out
- **[05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWrzH4IBs-Q&t=303s)** — of protein. The muscles are important in your lymphatic
- **[05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWrzH4IBs-Q&t=306s)** — system because it's dependent on your muscles and how well
- **[05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWrzH4IBs-Q&t=309s)** — that you use your muscles. When you exercise and you do some
- **[05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWrzH4IBs-Q&t=311s)** — type of intense exercise, you also release anti-aging molecules.
- **[05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWrzH4IBs-Q&t=317s)** — They're called myokines. They help with pain. They help with
- **[05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWrzH4IBs-Q&t=325s)** — muscle loss called kaketsia. This is muscle loss at any age.
- **[05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWrzH4IBs-Q&t=329s)** — It's dependent on a chronic illness, whether it's cancer or
- **[05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWrzH4IBs-Q&t=332s)** — some type of disease. Like in cancer, the body is stealing
- **[05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWrzH4IBs-Q&t=336s)** — all that protein for its fuel. In summary, these are the
- **[05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWrzH4IBs-Q&t=339s)** — things that you should focus on as you age. Increase your
- **[05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWrzH4IBs-Q&t=342s)** — lean body mass. And at the top of the list, consistent
- **[05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWrzH4IBs-Q&t=345s)** — exercise, high intensity interval training, doing strength
- **[05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWrzH4IBs-Q&t=348s)** — training, walking, stretching. Number two, your diet. And I'm
- **[05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWrzH4IBs-Q&t=355s)** — talking about high quality amino acids from red meat. Now it
- **[05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWrzH4IBs-Q&t=359s)** — is not true that red meat causes cancer. Okay, grass fed
- **[06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWrzH4IBs-Q&t=362s)** — red meat. I'm talking about beef, lamb, super important.
- **[06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWrzH4IBs-Q&t=366s)** — If you have any problems digesting red meat, which a
- **[06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWrzH4IBs-Q&t=369s)** — lot of people do as they age, you should acidify the
- **[06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWrzH4IBs-Q&t=372s)** — stomach instead of avoiding red meat. How do you do that?
- **[06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWrzH4IBs-Q&t=375s)** — You start taking betaine hydrochloride, like maybe
- **[06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWrzH4IBs-Q&t=377s)** — four or five of them before you eat the red meat. Build up
- **[06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWrzH4IBs-Q&t=380s)** — the stomach acid. It's going to help you absorb not just
- **[06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWrzH4IBs-Q&t=382s)** — the protein, but also minerals as well. Remember, we need
- **[06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWrzH4IBs-Q&t=386s)** — this high quality protein for our immune system, for enzymes,
- **[06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWrzH4IBs-Q&t=389s)** — for antioxidants, for the ability to detox, the ability
- **[06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWrzH4IBs-Q&t=393s)** — to repair, the ability to maintain your muscle. Also
- **[06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWrzH4IBs-Q&t=398s)** — make a point of this collagen. 30% of your muscles
- **[06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWrzH4IBs-Q&t=401s)** — are collagen. Take a collagen supplement. Trace minerals and
- **[06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWrzH4IBs-Q&t=405s)** — other nutrients are very important in the formation of
- **[06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWrzH4IBs-Q&t=408s)** — muscle. I'm going to list the most important ones first.
- **[06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWrzH4IBs-Q&t=412s)** — Number one, magnesium glycinate. Super, super important.
- **[06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWrzH4IBs-Q&t=415s)** — Magnesium and the exercise will help you sleep, which will
- **[06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWrzH4IBs-Q&t=419s)** — also help your muscles. Number two, vitamin D. Number
- **[07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWrzH4IBs-Q&t=421s)** — three, zinc. Very important. And then we get other trace
- **[07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWrzH4IBs-Q&t=424s)** — minerals like selenium and copper. The B vitamins are
- **[07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWrzH4IBs-Q&t=426s)** — very important. Coenzyme Q10. Very important. Iron is
- **[07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWrzH4IBs-Q&t=430s)** — important, but I don't recommend taking them as a
- **[07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWrzH4IBs-Q&t=432s)** — supplement. Get that from your red meat. But there's one
- **[07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWrzH4IBs-Q&t=434s)** — more little cool thing I'm going to bring up that I'm
- **[07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWrzH4IBs-Q&t=437s)** — glad that you stayed this far because this is like really
- **[07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWrzH4IBs-Q&t=440s)** — important. I recently went from 185 to 191 pounds and it
- **[07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWrzH4IBs-Q&t=448s)** — was all muscle and I didn't change anything but one thing.
- **[07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWrzH4IBs-Q&t=452s)** — There's a certain type of cultured microbe that you can
- **[07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWrzH4IBs-Q&t=455s)** — make and the microbe you would use is called L-ruderide.
- **[07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWrzH4IBs-Q&t=459s)** — I did a whole video on this, but this microbe has
- **[07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWrzH4IBs-Q&t=461s)** — some fascinating research with increasing oxytocin, which is
- **[07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWrzH4IBs-Q&t=466s)** — going to decrease stress. It's going to help your
- **[07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWrzH4IBs-Q&t=468s)** — muscle. And I think it's doing it for myself and I'm going to
- **[07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWrzH4IBs-Q&t=475s)** — keep doing this. And if you haven't seen the video of me
- **[07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWrzH4IBs-Q&t=478s)** — talking about it, I'm going to put it up right here. Check
- **[08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWrzH4IBs-Q&t=480s)** — it out.

- **[00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iseMJEZvC1E&t=0s)** — This is a master class on how to perfect your sleep and wake up feeling really refreshed.
- **[00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iseMJEZvC1E&t=5s)** — I don't care what diet you're on, what supplements you take, what type of exercise you do.
- **[00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iseMJEZvC1E&t=8s)** — All of that is not going to work unless your sleep is good.
- **[00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iseMJEZvC1E&t=12s)** — We sleep to detoxify our brains.
- **[00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iseMJEZvC1E&t=14s)** — If you notice when you don't sleep, it feels like your brain is toxic.
- **[00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iseMJEZvC1E&t=18s)** — Let's first talk about the diet.
- **[00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iseMJEZvC1E&t=19s)** — Especially if you're doing refined sugars and junk food.
- **[00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iseMJEZvC1E&t=22s)** — If you snack late at night and you go to bed loaded,
- **[00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iseMJEZvC1E&t=26s)** — that stress in your gut is going to prevent you from going to sleep.
- **[00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iseMJEZvC1E&t=28s)** — If you want better sleep, eat earlier in the day.
- **[00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iseMJEZvC1E&t=31s)** — If you really want a good sleep, have your last meal like 4 or 5 o'clock.
- **[00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iseMJEZvC1E&t=35s)** — If you have urination problems at night, just do intermittent fasting.
- **[00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iseMJEZvC1E&t=38s)** — Cut out the snacks. Go low carb.
- **[00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iseMJEZvC1E&t=40s)** — If you eat inflammatory foods like the grains, that will also keep you up.
- **[00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iseMJEZvC1E&t=45s)** — When you eat a lot of carbohydrates, it takes a lot of vitamin B1
- **[00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iseMJEZvC1E&t=48s)** — to break down those carbohydrates and utilize them.
- **[00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iseMJEZvC1E&t=51s)** — When you don't have enough B1, your legs start just feeling so energetic.
- **[00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iseMJEZvC1E&t=56s)** — Vitamin B1 helps reduce nervous anxiety and tension.
- **[01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iseMJEZvC1E&t=60s)** — One thing that is really good to consume to help you sleep at night is kefir.
- **[01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iseMJEZvC1E&t=65s)** — Kefir has probiotics which will then build up things like serotonin,
- **[01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iseMJEZvC1E&t=70s)** — which then turns into melatonin.
- **[01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iseMJEZvC1E&t=72s)** — And melatonin is a sleep hormone.
- **[01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iseMJEZvC1E&t=75s)** — An even better probiotic to take is the L-ruderi yogurt.
- **[01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iseMJEZvC1E&t=79s)** — Super beneficial for sleep.
- **[01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iseMJEZvC1E&t=80s)** — You just need a half of a cup of that per day.
- **[01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iseMJEZvC1E&t=82s)** — It doesn't have to be before bed. It could be any time during the day.
- **[01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iseMJEZvC1E&t=85s)** — What about the environment that you sleep in?
- **[01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iseMJEZvC1E&t=87s)** — Let's talk about the temperature first.
- **[01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iseMJEZvC1E&t=89s)** — If you ever try to go to bed when it's too hot, it just won't work.
- **[01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iseMJEZvC1E&t=92s)** — Turn down the thermostat down to between 65 and 68 degrees.
- **[01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iseMJEZvC1E&t=97s)** — Some people that have cold feet sleep much better if they warm up some socks
- **[01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iseMJEZvC1E&t=102s)** — and at least keep their feet warm.
- **[01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iseMJEZvC1E&t=104s)** — Plants in your room, that oxygen from the plants can help you sleep.
- **[01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iseMJEZvC1E&t=108s)** — The darker it is, the better.
- **[01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iseMJEZvC1E&t=110s)** — Any light inhibits melatonin.
- **[01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iseMJEZvC1E&t=113s)** — If you're staying inside all day, sitting behind a computer,
- **[01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iseMJEZvC1E&t=116s)** — getting all this blue light, or you're on your cell phone
- **[01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iseMJEZvC1E&t=119s)** — and getting a lot of blue light, blue light stimulates energy.
- **[02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iseMJEZvC1E&t=123s)** — This is why even in the early morning, when the sun rises,
- **[02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iseMJEZvC1E&t=126s)** — there's a lot of blue that will wake you up.
- **[02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iseMJEZvC1E&t=128s)** — In the evening, you'll see these yellow, purple, reddish type colors.
- **[02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iseMJEZvC1E&t=131s)** — Now we're going to get a little bit more infrared,
- **[02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iseMJEZvC1E&t=134s)** — which will actually help wind us down.
- **[02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iseMJEZvC1E&t=136s)** — Over 50% of the sun's rays are infrared.
- **[02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iseMJEZvC1E&t=138s)** — It can penetrate several inches into our body
- **[02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iseMJEZvC1E&t=142s)** — and help you make vitamin D, which is crucial for sleep.
- **[02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iseMJEZvC1E&t=146s)** — One thing it does is it increases something called melatonin.
- **[02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iseMJEZvC1E&t=148s)** — Fortunately, since the 80s, when we've been avoiding the sun,
- **[02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iseMJEZvC1E&t=152s)** — we've been having a lot of sleep problems.
- **[02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iseMJEZvC1E&t=154s)** — Also, alcohol.
- **[02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iseMJEZvC1E&t=155s)** — Alcohol will make you feel like you are tired and want to go to sleep,
- **[02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iseMJEZvC1E&t=159s)** — but it doesn't really give you the quality of sleep.
- **[02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iseMJEZvC1E&t=160s)** — It actually prevents the deep sleep.
- **[02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iseMJEZvC1E&t=162s)** — And then we have caffeine.
- **[02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iseMJEZvC1E&t=164s)** — Caffeine, coffee, tea, chocolate can also act as a stimulant.
- **[02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iseMJEZvC1E&t=169s)** — That can prevent sleeping because your liver doesn't have a chance
- **[02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iseMJEZvC1E&t=172s)** — to really detoxify those stimulants.
- **[02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iseMJEZvC1E&t=174s)** — Also, the more exercise you do, the better you're going to sleep as well.
- **[02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iseMJEZvC1E&t=178s)** — The next thing I want to talk about is old injuries.
- **[03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iseMJEZvC1E&t=181s)** — So if you injure your lower back,
- **[03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iseMJEZvC1E&t=183s)** — one of the things that I do every single night is stretching
- **[03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iseMJEZvC1E&t=185s)** — to help myself sleep.
- **[03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iseMJEZvC1E&t=187s)** — You'll notice when you do a lot of stretching,
- **[03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iseMJEZvC1E&t=189s)** — your body goes into this relaxed mode.
- **[03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iseMJEZvC1E&t=191s)** — One of the things that you can do is lie on your back with your arms
- **[03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iseMJEZvC1E&t=194s)** — stretched above you and just do these stretches from your lower feet,
- **[03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iseMJEZvC1E&t=199s)** — trying to push your feet going this way and your arms going this way.
- **[03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iseMJEZvC1E&t=202s)** — I'm going to put a video down below to show you how to do that.
- **[03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iseMJEZvC1E&t=205s)** — This is a little device that I invented and developed.
- **[03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iseMJEZvC1E&t=208s)** — It's a plastic device.
- **[03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iseMJEZvC1E&t=210s)** — It's modeled after my hand.
- **[03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iseMJEZvC1E&t=212s)** — And I will lay back on it and I will hold pressure from the top of my
- **[03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iseMJEZvC1E&t=217s)** — mid back to the lower part of my mid back until the muscles relax.
- **[03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iseMJEZvC1E&t=221s)** — Now there's another area of your body.
- **[03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iseMJEZvC1E&t=223s)** — It's in the brain stem.
- **[03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iseMJEZvC1E&t=224s)** — I'll take this on the back of a tall back chair or my couch
- **[03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iseMJEZvC1E&t=228s)** — and I'll place it right underneath my skull and lean back,
- **[03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iseMJEZvC1E&t=232s)** — pressing underneath the skull.
- **[03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iseMJEZvC1E&t=235s)** — That really helps as well.
- **[03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iseMJEZvC1E&t=237s)** — I also use it and actually press up underneath the rib cage to take
- **[04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iseMJEZvC1E&t=243s)** — tension out of your abdomen.
- **[04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iseMJEZvC1E&t=245s)** — Because if you've ever noticed when you have problems with sleep,
- **[04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iseMJEZvC1E&t=247s)** — there's going to be a lot of tension and muscle spasm in your stomach area
- **[04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iseMJEZvC1E&t=251s)** — and underneath your rib cage, probably because you have a lot of bloating.
- **[04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iseMJEZvC1E&t=256s)** — So this is a great way to kind of take the bloating out.
- **[04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iseMJEZvC1E&t=260s)** — Another thing to help yourself sleep is to start sleeping on the right side.
- **[04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iseMJEZvC1E&t=264s)** — Why do I do that?
- **[04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iseMJEZvC1E&t=265s)** — I just find that when I sleep on the left side or at least starting out,
- **[04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iseMJEZvC1E&t=268s)** — if there's some type of congestion in my liver,
- **[04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iseMJEZvC1E&t=271s)** — it kind of presses on my heart and it doesn't help me sleep or feel relaxed.
- **[04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iseMJEZvC1E&t=275s)** — The other thing that I focus on is nose breathing.
- **[04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iseMJEZvC1E&t=279s)** — You will get more oxygen if you breathe through your nose than from your mouth.
- **[04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iseMJEZvC1E&t=284s)** — You're going to put your body in a relaxed state really quickly,
- **[04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iseMJEZvC1E&t=289s)** — slowly in and a little bit slower out.
- **[04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iseMJEZvC1E&t=292s)** — Sometimes people ask me my opinion on meditation.
- **[04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iseMJEZvC1E&t=295s)** — The best way that I think you can get rid of your stress
- **[04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iseMJEZvC1E&t=298s)** — is to get yourself out of your head and not do more of that thinking.
- **[05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iseMJEZvC1E&t=303s)** — This is why I like hobbies are really great.
- **[05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iseMJEZvC1E&t=306s)** — Bird watching, hiking, woodworking, painting.
- **[05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iseMJEZvC1E&t=311s)** — Another key part of sleeping is getting enough sodium.
- **[05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iseMJEZvC1E&t=315s)** — When you are low in sodium, salt, your cortisol goes up.
- **[05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iseMJEZvC1E&t=320s)** — An average person needs more than even a teaspoon of sea salt per day.
- **[05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iseMJEZvC1E&t=325s)** — If you start adding more sodium to the diet,
- **[05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iseMJEZvC1E&t=327s)** — whether you put a little pinch of sea salt in your coffee in the morning,
- **[05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iseMJEZvC1E&t=331s)** — you're going to sleep better.
- **[05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iseMJEZvC1E&t=332s)** — And that brings up the other mineral.
- **[05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iseMJEZvC1E&t=334s)** — Because if you're low in potassium, you're also going to have a problem with sleeping.
- **[05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iseMJEZvC1E&t=338s)** — Because potassium is a physiological relaxer.
- **[05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iseMJEZvC1E&t=341s)** — If you're deficient in potassium, guess what?
- **[05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iseMJEZvC1E&t=343s)** — Your pulse rate goes up.
- **[05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iseMJEZvC1E&t=345s)** — Another thing that I do about an hour before bed is take some magnesium glycinate powder.
- **[05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iseMJEZvC1E&t=352s)** — Magnesium helps with muscle tightness and muscle spasm and muscle cramps.
- **[05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iseMJEZvC1E&t=357s)** — Magnesium also helps calm your body.
- **[05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iseMJEZvC1E&t=359s)** — I'll take this magnesium glycinate in a warm glass of water and I might add some tea to it.
- **[06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iseMJEZvC1E&t=365s)** — And there's several teas that I might use.
- **[06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iseMJEZvC1E&t=368s)** — Like chamomile tea is a great one to also help wind you down.
- **[06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iseMJEZvC1E&t=371s)** — What about sound?
- **[06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iseMJEZvC1E&t=373s)** — You can get a machine that kind of gives you this background static.
- **[06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iseMJEZvC1E&t=381s)** — I mean, when you think about it, complete silence in nature is very unnatural.
- **[06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iseMJEZvC1E&t=384s)** — This is why I always sleep better if I'm camping, for example.
- **[06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iseMJEZvC1E&t=388s)** — There's also something called binaural beats,
- **[06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iseMJEZvC1E&t=390s)** — where you're putting two different beats in each ear.
- **[06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iseMJEZvC1E&t=393s)** — Two slightly different sounds, but that definitely has been shown to help you sleep.
- **[06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iseMJEZvC1E&t=399s)** — There's one last really cool thing that can help you sleep.
- **[06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iseMJEZvC1E&t=402s)** — Certain essential oils that have kind of a sedative effect, but they're natural.
- **[06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iseMJEZvC1E&t=407s)** — And you don't have to consume them. You just breathe in the vapor.
- **[06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iseMJEZvC1E&t=410s)** — The first one is called spikenard.
- **[06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iseMJEZvC1E&t=413s)** — It's a sedative and it's going to calm you down.
- **[06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iseMJEZvC1E&t=416s)** — If you get that, I recommend you pair it with another essential oil, vetiver.
- **[07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iseMJEZvC1E&t=420s)** — Vetiver helps induce a deeper sleep and you don't have to consume it.
- **[07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iseMJEZvC1E&t=424s)** — You can just breathe it in or rub it onto your temples or even on your chest.
- **[07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iseMJEZvC1E&t=429s)** — Fixing your sleep is super powerful, but if you're still waking up tired,
- **[07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iseMJEZvC1E&t=434s)** — you are missing out on something that is incredibly powerful, and it's salt.
- **[07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iseMJEZvC1E&t=438s)** — I'm about to flip everything you've ever been told about salt completely upside down.
- **[07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iseMJEZvC1E&t=442s)** — You've got to check out this video right here.

- **[00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mNJF5i8GzU&t=0s)** — Let's talk about the basics of how to burn fat.
- **[00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mNJF5i8GzU&t=3s)** — It's very important and this is not about cutting calories. This is about your hormones.
- **[00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mNJF5i8GzU&t=8s)** — If you understand the hormones that burn fat and how to trigger them
- **[00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mNJF5i8GzU&t=12s)** — versus the hormones that store fat and how to avoid triggering those,
- **[00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mNJF5i8GzU&t=15s)** — you can be very successful. I mean, it blows me away when someone goes to the doctor.
- **[00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mNJF5i8GzU&t=19s)** — They go to an endocrinologist and they assess their hormones.
- **[00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mNJF5i8GzU&t=23s)** — And they might say that you have low testosterone, so we're gonna give you
- **[00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mNJF5i8GzU&t=27s)** — testosterone. But what about the diet? That is rarely talked about. But today I'm going to
- **[00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mNJF5i8GzU&t=33s)** — talk about natural things to either increase or decrease your hormones related to one thing,
- **[00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mNJF5i8GzU&t=40s)** — fat burning. Out of all the hormones related to fat burning is this hormone called insulin.
- **[00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mNJF5i8GzU&t=46s)** — It's made by the pancreas. It does a lot of things, but one of the main things it does
- **[00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mNJF5i8GzU&t=50s)** — is it helps you store fat. Let's take a look at this book right here called Medical Physiology.
- **[00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mNJF5i8GzU&t=58s)** — In the absence of insulin, all of the effects of insulin causing storage of fat are reversed.
- **[01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mNJF5i8GzU&t=66s)** — So if we want to increase fat burning, we must lower insulin. You cannot burn fat
- **[01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mNJF5i8GzU&t=74s)** — if insulin is too high. You can be doing all these other things to increase all the fat
- **[01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mNJF5i8GzU&t=79s)** — burning hormones. But if this fat making hormone called insulin is elevated, it nullifies
- **[01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mNJF5i8GzU&t=85s)** — all of the other hormones that help you lose weight. This is why this information
- **[01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mNJF5i8GzU&t=89s)** — is very important because let's say for example you go to the gym or you're exercising,
- **[01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mNJF5i8GzU&t=94s)** — right? And then you have this pre-workout protein bar that's loaded with sugar.
- **[01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mNJF5i8GzU&t=99s)** — You basically nullified your ability to burn fat. Or let's say you're working out and you
- **[01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mNJF5i8GzU&t=104s)** — your gatorade filled with glucose. You just nullified that workout. The other really
- **[01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mNJF5i8GzU&t=110s)** — interesting thing about insulin is all it takes is a little bit of carb to block a lot of weight
- **[01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mNJF5i8GzU&t=117s)** — loss for a period of time. So let's say for example, I don't know, every other day you
- **[02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mNJF5i8GzU&t=122s)** — drink a little bit of wine or maybe you have a piece of bread, just a little bit of
- **[02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mNJF5i8GzU&t=125s)** — carbohydrate. Your ability to burn fat just went way down. Now it could take 24 hours or
- **[02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mNJF5i8GzU&t=131s)** — to burn fat. You can't just sort of do it a little bit. You have to just be all in and
- **[02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mNJF5i8GzU&t=137s)** — do it for a period of time to see the results. When we talk about what triggers insulin, we have
- **[02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mNJF5i8GzU&t=142s)** — carbohydrates, okay? What are carbohydrates? You have starches, you have fiber and sugars.
- **[02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mNJF5i8GzU&t=148s)** — Fiber is the only one that will not elevate insulin. So you don't have to worry about
- **[02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mNJF5i8GzU&t=153s)** — foods very very high in fiber like green vegetables, like salad. They have so much
- **[02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mNJF5i8GzU&t=158s)** — so little starch that it's not going to elevate insulin hardly at all. But typically you want
- **[02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mNJF5i8GzU&t=165s)** — to aim for less than 50 grams of carbs per day. Not per meal, per day. But if you really
- **[02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mNJF5i8GzU&t=172s)** — want to speed it up, I would bring it down to like 20 or even less than 20 carbs per day.
- **[02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mNJF5i8GzU&t=177s)** — The other thing that elevates insulin is eating in general. It's better to eat less
- **[03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mNJF5i8GzU&t=182s)** — frequent. So this is called intermittent fasting. It's not just the carbs. It's not
- **[03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mNJF5i8GzU&t=186s)** — the frequency of eating that causes the elevation of insulin. It is also the seed oils.
- **[03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mNJF5i8GzU&t=193s)** — They basically trigger insulin resistance. They create a lot of inflammation, cellular damage.
- **[03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mNJF5i8GzU&t=200s)** — And out of all the things that parallel the trend of obesity, it's the seed oils
- **[03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mNJF5i8GzU&t=207s)** — that parallel obesity the most, which is interesting. Be careful at restaurants.
- **[03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mNJF5i8GzU&t=212s)** — It's in salad dressing. The other thing that elevates insulin is MSG. Monosodium glutamate.
- **[03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mNJF5i8GzU&t=220s)** — There's a debate with monosodium glutamate. I mean, there's... if you look this up, it'll
- **[03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mNJF5i8GzU&t=224s)** — say, oh yeah, no, it doesn't elevate insulin. It won't cause weight gain. Have you ever been
- **[03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mNJF5i8GzU&t=228s)** — to a fast food restaurant where they just load you up with MSG or even like a Chinese
- **[03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mNJF5i8GzU&t=233s)** — restaurant? What you're going to notice is that about an hour later you are hungry
- **[03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mNJF5i8GzU&t=238s)** — and it's a lot of hidden sodium which is going to make you thirsty. And if we trick the brain
- **[04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mNJF5i8GzU&t=244s)** — into thinking it's getting some protein when it's really not, you know, within probably an
- **[04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mNJF5i8GzU&t=248s)** — hour and a half you're going to like start craving something. The next hormone is estrogen.
- **[04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mNJF5i8GzU&t=254s)** — Estrogen can make you fat too. If you've ever heard about estrogen dominance, that's like
- **[04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mNJF5i8GzU&t=260s)** — a woman that has excess weight in the lower part of her body. And you can elevate estrogen
- **[04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mNJF5i8GzU&t=265s)** — by giving someone birth control pills, hormonal placement therapy, things like that. All right,
- **[04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mNJF5i8GzU&t=270s)** — the third hormone to talk about is cortisol. Very important. I'm going to show you this book
- **[04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mNJF5i8GzU&t=274s)** — right here. This is called Encyclopedia of Medical Illustration's Endocrine System. Okay,
- **[04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mNJF5i8GzU&t=281s)** — let's take a look at this right here. You see this guy right here? See that belly?
- **[04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mNJF5i8GzU&t=288s)** — It's coming from the adrenals. So the adrenal glands are pumping out the stress hormone
- **[04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mNJF5i8GzU&t=293s)** — called cortisol and it's pushing the fat in the midsection. Let's take a look at this one right
- **[05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mNJF5i8GzU&t=300s)** — here too. Boom! This is too much cortisol. You can see the belly. So the body is going to
- **[05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mNJF5i8GzU&t=309s)** — grab protein from the leg and the glutamous maximus, which is your butt muscle, and convert
- **[05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mNJF5i8GzU&t=314s)** — that into sugar and then fat right in the belly. When you go through stress or you take
- **[05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mNJF5i8GzU&t=321s)** — prednisone, which is a synthetic version of cortisol, you can gain a lot of weight,
- **[05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mNJF5i8GzU&t=326s)** — not just in your belly but in your face too, like they call it a moon face. So cortisol
- **[05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mNJF5i8GzU&t=332s)** — directs the fat more in the midsection, more than any other place around the gut as a
- **[05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mNJF5i8GzU&t=339s)** — survival mechanism. You also sometimes will get a buffalo hump in the back of your upper
- **[05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mNJF5i8GzU&t=344s)** — and this cortisol will also nullify the fat burning hormones, which I'm going to talk about
- **[05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mNJF5i8GzU&t=352s)** — next, like testosterone. And also, and this is very important, insulin will nullify all of your
- **[06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mNJF5i8GzU&t=360s)** — fat burning hormones. How do we lower insulin? This is like the most important action. Number
- **[06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mNJF5i8GzU&t=366s)** — one, to lower insulin you must lower your carbohydrate below 50 grams. I would lower it
- **[06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mNJF5i8GzU&t=371s)** — below 20 grams per day. I would do intermittent fasting, eat less frequently. I would also take
- **[06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mNJF5i8GzU&t=378s)** — apple cider vinegar in your water. I would consume berberine. It kind of mimics the
- **[06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mNJF5i8GzU&t=384s)** — medication mitformin, which has to do with controlling insulin resistance but without the
- **[06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mNJF5i8GzU&t=389s)** — side effects. Cinnamon is another really good herb as well. And then estrogen. It's just
- **[06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mNJF5i8GzU&t=396s)** — about avoiding estrogen, avoiding things that mimic estrogen. That would be like certain
- **[06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mNJF5i8GzU&t=402s)** — chemicals in the environment. So you want to do more organic. And then cortisol. How do we
- **[06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mNJF5i8GzU&t=406s)** — lower cortisol? Stress reduction. Physical work around the house to get your attention off
- **[06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mNJF5i8GzU&t=413s)** — stress. Go for long walks. Take vitamin B1. All of those are very important. But there's one
- **[07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mNJF5i8GzU&t=422s)** — vitamin D. Vitamin D will help you lower cortisol. Alright, let's switch over to the fat
- **[07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mNJF5i8GzU&t=429s)** — burning hormones. There are two main hormones that kind of work together. Growth hormone,
- **[07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mNJF5i8GzU&t=435s)** — which is also an anti-aging hormone. And another hormone called IGF number one. Insulin-like
- **[07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mNJF5i8GzU&t=441s)** — growth factor number one. It's a similar function to growth hormone. Probably the best
- **[07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mNJF5i8GzU&t=447s)** — ultimate workout would be sprinting. With growth hormone and IGF number one. Intense exercise,
- **[07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mNJF5i8GzU&t=454s)** — good sleeping, moderate protein, and intermittent fasting. The next hormone is testosterone. Here's
- **[07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mNJF5i8GzU&t=463s)** — a hormone that a lot of men are taking. And you can increase it by making sure that you
- **[07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mNJF5i8GzU&t=469s)** — either consume foods high in zinc or make sure you're eating enough cholesterol.
- **[07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mNJF5i8GzU&t=476s)** — Cholesterol is the building block of testosterone and other hormones. So if you're on a statin,
- **[08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mNJF5i8GzU&t=483s)** — or if you're on a low saturated fat diet, you could be starving off your testosterone.
- **[08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mNJF5i8GzU&t=489s)** — The next fat burning hormone, glucagon. Glucagon will be nullified when you increase insulin.
- **[08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mNJF5i8GzU&t=499s)** — Glucagon is triggered by a moderate amount of protein and intense exercise. Very similar
- **[08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mNJF5i8GzU&t=506s)** — to growth hormone in IGF number one. All right, the next one is adrenaline. Adrenaline is
- **[08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mNJF5i8GzU&t=512s)** — increased with exercise. Adrenaline is also a neurotransmitter. And then you have the
- **[08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mNJF5i8GzU&t=517s)** — thyroid hormones. T3, that's the active form of the thyroid hormone. The way that you increase
- **[08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mNJF5i8GzU&t=522s)** — thyroid hormone is to remove the things that are blocking the thyroid hormone.
- **[08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mNJF5i8GzU&t=527s)** — Like a fatty liver, like a problem with your kidney, like an iodine deficiency, or a selenium
- **[08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mNJF5i8GzU&t=535s)** — deficiency, or an estrogen dominant situation. Because if you have too much estrogen, that
- **[09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mNJF5i8GzU&t=540s)** — can block your thyroid. But the thing you need to know about exercise is that exercise
- **[09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mNJF5i8GzU&t=546s)** — really only contributes to about 15% of your overall weight loss. However, it can really
- **[09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mNJF5i8GzU&t=553s)** — greatly lower your stress and help you sleep to really make this whole program work. So even
- **[09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mNJF5i8GzU&t=559s)** — though it contributes 15%, if you don't exercise, my viewpoint is it's going to
- **[09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mNJF5i8GzU&t=565s)** — take a lot longer to get where you need to go. Based on this information, you now know
- **[09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mNJF5i8GzU&t=569s)** — how to burn fat and you know the relative importance between the fat burning hormones
- **[09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mNJF5i8GzU&t=575s)** — and the fat making hormones. Especially insulin and cortisol. Those are the dominating
- **[09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mNJF5i8GzU&t=581s)** — hormones that will nullify the rest. Now since we're on the topic of weight loss,
- **[09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mNJF5i8GzU&t=585s)** — there's one more associated condition that's very important to get a full understanding on
- **[09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mNJF5i8GzU&t=591s)** — and that is insulin resistance. I put the video up on that right here. Check it out.

- **[00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxd8Zui3v5Y&t=0s)** — I have some more bad news for you guys.
- **[00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxd8Zui3v5Y&t=4s)** — It's just been reported on the news...
- **[00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxd8Zui3v5Y&t=19s)** — This sucks because I have to now change 442 of my videos.
- **[00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxd8Zui3v5Y&t=26s)** — So I got my work cut out for me this weekend.
- **[00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxd8Zui3v5Y&t=28s)** — So just to be safe, I think what you should start doing is you should start eating at night, snacking.
- **[00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxd8Zui3v5Y&t=34s)** — Between your dinner and right before you go to bed. And then as soon as you wake up, start eating.
- **[00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxd8Zui3v5Y&t=40s)** — Because we have to save your heart.
- **[00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxd8Zui3v5Y&t=43s)** — Now apparently this study is mainly focused on cardiovascular mortality.
- **[00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxd8Zui3v5Y&t=48s)** — But they did find that if you do fast for longer than 16 hours, it does lower your risk for cancer.
- **[00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxd8Zui3v5Y&t=56s)** — So you need to choose, do you want to lower your risk for heart attack or cancer?
- **[01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxd8Zui3v5Y&t=60s)** — Now of course I am being super sarcastic again. This was an abstract.
- **[01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxd8Zui3v5Y&t=64s)** — That means a short summary of an observational study.
- **[01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxd8Zui3v5Y&t=68s)** — It was based on a 24 hour dietary recall.
- **[01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxd8Zui3v5Y&t=71s)** — It's based on having that person remember what they ate.
- **[01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxd8Zui3v5Y&t=76s)** — Which I don't even know what I ate two days ago.
- **[01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxd8Zui3v5Y&t=79s)** — And they mainly looked at this pattern of 16 hour fasting with an 8 hour eating window.
- **[01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxd8Zui3v5Y&t=84s)** — Now this was sponsored by the American Heart Association.
- **[01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxd8Zui3v5Y&t=88s)** — So we know it's legitimate because they are very unbiased.
- **[01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxd8Zui3v5Y&t=92s)** — The findings set to be presented at an American Heart Association conference.
- **[01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxd8Zui3v5Y&t=95s)** — But this is just another one of those studies where all you have to do is put a little doubt in the consumer's mind.
- **[01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxd8Zui3v5Y&t=102s)** — And that's enough to get people to question, you know, should I do it, should I not?
- **[01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxd8Zui3v5Y&t=106s)** — Is it going to be dangerous? Am I going to have a heart attack?
- **[01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxd8Zui3v5Y&t=108s)** — This is a tactic that the tobacco industry has used for many, many years.
- **[01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxd8Zui3v5Y&t=112s)** — Now what I found about the author, Victor Wenzheng from China.
- **[01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxd8Zui3v5Y&t=118s)** — I've heard about this author before.
- **[02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxd8Zui3v5Y&t=120s)** — Which directly opposed red meat and eggs and cholesterol.
- **[02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxd8Zui3v5Y&t=124s)** — And of course all of these studies are also observational studies.
- **[02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxd8Zui3v5Y&t=128s)** — And so apparently these studies were sponsored by the American Heart Association strategically focused research networks.
- **[02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxd8Zui3v5Y&t=136s)** — But the American Heart Association is the same association that promotes healthy seed oils for your heart.
- **[02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxd8Zui3v5Y&t=146s)** — Personally, my viewpoint is they're not very heart healthy.
- **[02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxd8Zui3v5Y&t=149s)** — But the reason they can get away with it is because it does apparently lower cholesterol.
- **[02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxd8Zui3v5Y&t=154s)** — But that's a whole different topic.
- **[02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxd8Zui3v5Y&t=155s)** — What I want to just kind of mention right now is four more credible studies that were peer reviewed that talk about the benefits of intermittent fasting.
- **[02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxd8Zui3v5Y&t=166s)** — And supporting cardiovascular health.
- **[02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxd8Zui3v5Y&t=170s)** — So the first one was a single blinded randomized study.
- **[02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxd8Zui3v5Y&t=173s)** — I'm going to put all these down below in the description.
- **[02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxd8Zui3v5Y&t=176s)** — Long term effects of time restricted eating with resistance training.
- **[03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxd8Zui3v5Y&t=181s)** — This was over 12 months.
- **[03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxd8Zui3v5Y&t=184s)** — Significant decrease in body mass, fat mass, decrease in inflammation, increase in insulin sensitivity, and also a more balanced lipid profile.
- **[03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxd8Zui3v5Y&t=194s)** — Without adverse effects, it was safe and effective for improving cardiovascular function.
- **[03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxd8Zui3v5Y&t=200s)** — Number two, this was a non-randomized control clinical trial for time restricted feeding on body composition and cardiovascular risk.
- **[03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxd8Zui3v5Y&t=209s)** — So they did an 18 hour fast, significant decrease in waist circumference, and significant decrease in cardiovascular risk.
- **[03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxd8Zui3v5Y&t=217s)** — Alright, number three, systematic review, impact on intermittent fasting with cardio metabolic risk factors through four randomized control trials.
- **[03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxd8Zui3v5Y&t=229s)** — The results were intermittent fasting demonstrated significant reduction in body weight, waist circumference, body mass, fat mass, blood pressure, decrease in cholesterol, triglycerides, fasting insulin levels, and improvement in insulin resistance.
- **[04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxd8Zui3v5Y&t=247s)** — The four also evaluated this pattern of 16 and 8. 16 hour fasting and 8 hour eating window.
- **[04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxd8Zui3v5Y&t=253s)** — This was on breast cancer survivors. It was just for eight weeks, but there was a significant decrease in cardiovascular risk.
- **[04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxd8Zui3v5Y&t=261s)** — There was decreased risk in visceral adipose tissue.
- **[04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxd8Zui3v5Y&t=265s)** — And so, you know, as much as I hate doing another video on something ridiculous like this, someone's going to read it and someone might have some doubt. You don't have to have any doubt.
- **[04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxd8Zui3v5Y&t=276s)** — This so-called study was completely ridiculous and you pretty much can ignore it.
- **[04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxd8Zui3v5Y&t=281s)** — And since we're talking about cardiovascular health, if you have not seen this video, you should really check it out. I put it up right here.

## Video 32: How to Fix the Adrenal Body Type - Dr. Berg

**Watch on YouTube:** [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhSo8N5-Ars](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhSo8N5-Ars)

## Full Transcript with Timestamps

*Click any timestamp to jump to that moment in the video*

- **[00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhSo8N5-Ars&t=0s)** — Let's talk about how to fix the adrenal body type.
- **[00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhSo8N5-Ars&t=4s)** — Okay, so are we talking about adrenal fatigue?
- **[00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhSo8N5-Ars&t=6s)** — Are we talking about some adrenal disease?
- **[00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhSo8N5-Ars&t=9s)** — Well, the medical profession doesn't acknowledge adrenal fatigue.
- **[00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhSo8N5-Ars&t=14s)** — They don't really think that it exists.
- **[00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhSo8N5-Ars&t=16s)** — And that's totally fine because what are they going to do?
- **[00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhSo8N5-Ars&t=18s)** — Just give you another drug, give you a steroid?
- **[00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhSo8N5-Ars&t=21s)** — I think if you have adrenal stress, adrenal burnout, adrenal fatigue,
- **[00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhSo8N5-Ars&t=23s)** — whatever you want to call it, I think you should use natural type remedies.
- **[00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhSo8N5-Ars&t=27s)** — So the first question is where are the adrenals?
- **[00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhSo8N5-Ars&t=30s)** — Well, they're located right above the kidney, right on top of the kidneys.
- **[00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhSo8N5-Ars&t=34s)** — Okay, you have two of them.
- **[00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhSo8N5-Ars&t=35s)** — And they're little triangle glands.
- **[00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhSo8N5-Ars&t=37s)** — And they have an inside and an outside.
- **[00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhSo8N5-Ars&t=40s)** — The outside is called the cortex, adrenal cortex.
- **[00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhSo8N5-Ars&t=44s)** — And then the inside is called the medulla, the adrenal medulla.
- **[00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhSo8N5-Ars&t=48s)** — The main hormone that we're going to focus on on the outside is called cortisol.
- **[00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhSo8N5-Ars&t=52s)** — And then the neurotransmitter on the inside
- **[00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhSo8N5-Ars&t=56s)** — that we're going to focus on is called adrenaline.
- **[00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhSo8N5-Ars&t=59s)** — And the entire adrenal system relates to something called flight or flight.
- **[01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhSo8N5-Ars&t=64s)** — And that relates to its purpose, which is to adapt the body to a stress state.
- **[01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhSo8N5-Ars&t=71s)** — Now, what does that mean, adapt the body to a stress state?
- **[01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhSo8N5-Ars&t=74s)** — Well, it's quite interesting that you have an entire system
- **[01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhSo8N5-Ars&t=78s)** — that adapts your body to this very interesting condition or state,
- **[01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhSo8N5-Ars&t=84s)** — which is during stress.
- **[01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhSo8N5-Ars&t=86s)** — Whether you're attacking something, fighting something,
- **[01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhSo8N5-Ars&t=89s)** — or you're running away from something, okay, you have a system to help you survive.
- **[01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhSo8N5-Ars&t=94s)** — So what this system does through all of its different adaptations
- **[01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhSo8N5-Ars&t=98s)** — is to prepare your body to survive during a stress mode.
- **[01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhSo8N5-Ars&t=103s)** — And of course, this was designed to be more short term,
- **[01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhSo8N5-Ars&t=106s)** — not long term, like we experience nowadays with sustained chronic mental stress.
- **[01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhSo8N5-Ars&t=113s)** — Our bodies were designed to handle a bit more physical stress.
- **[01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhSo8N5-Ars&t=117s)** — So you need more blood flow to certain muscles.
- **[02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhSo8N5-Ars&t=121s)** — You need more heightened energy in your brain to focus in on certain things
- **[02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhSo8N5-Ars&t=125s)** — and solve certain problems relating to survival.
- **[02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhSo8N5-Ars&t=130s)** — You need quick energy, as in glucose energy.
- **[02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhSo8N5-Ars&t=134s)** — And you don't need energy to certain body systems like reproduction,
- **[02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhSo8N5-Ars&t=139s)** — like the immune system, like your digestion.
- **[02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhSo8N5-Ars&t=142s)** — So that's the function of the adrenals.
- **[02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhSo8N5-Ars&t=144s)** — And these hormones go through almost every cell in the body
- **[02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhSo8N5-Ars&t=147s)** — and start to change certain things to adapt the body to prepare for this stress situation.
- **[02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhSo8N5-Ars&t=154s)** — So what's the significance of that?
- **[02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhSo8N5-Ars&t=155s)** — Well, if you're under chronic mental stress, okay, or you have major losses in your life,
- **[02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhSo8N5-Ars&t=162s)** — or you have surgeries or traumas, which by the way, all these stresses accumulate over time,
- **[02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhSo8N5-Ars&t=168s)** — and then they create situations where the adrenals become dysfunctional to a certain degree.
- **[02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhSo8N5-Ars&t=173s)** — And I'm not even talking about a disease.
- **[02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhSo8N5-Ars&t=175s)** — I'm talking about like a subclinical problem with the adrenal.
- **[02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhSo8N5-Ars&t=179s)** — At first, you have a higher level of these hormones.
- **[03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhSo8N5-Ars&t=181s)** — And then over time, you start developing like cortisol resistance,
- **[03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhSo8N5-Ars&t=186s)** — just like insulin resistance, where now the cortisol doesn't work,
- **[03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhSo8N5-Ars&t=189s)** — but you have high levels of cortisol and symptoms of low cortisol.
- **[03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhSo8N5-Ars&t=192s)** — It makes it really confusing.
- **[03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhSo8N5-Ars&t=193s)** — But let's go through the symptoms that someone might experience if they have adrenal fatigue
- **[03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhSo8N5-Ars&t=198s)** — or adrenal dysfunction.
- **[03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhSo8N5-Ars&t=200s)** — Number one, their tolerance for stress is lowered.
- **[03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhSo8N5-Ars&t=205s)** — They can't tolerate babysitting a room full of small children
- **[03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhSo8N5-Ars&t=208s)** — at a daycare center for more than eight hours.
- **[03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhSo8N5-Ars&t=212s)** — They can't tolerate a slow driver in front of them for a period of,
- **[03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhSo8N5-Ars&t=217s)** — you know, two and a half hours where they're on the freeway.
- **[03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhSo8N5-Ars&t=220s)** — For some reason, that bothers them.
- **[03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhSo8N5-Ars&t=221s)** — They definitely can't tolerate incompetent people or people that are considered more stupid.
- **[03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhSo8N5-Ars&t=228s)** — Or people that make maybe stupid decisions.
- **[03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhSo8N5-Ars&t=230s)** — They just have a low tolerance for that.
- **[03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhSo8N5-Ars&t=232s)** — Unless they're in an environment where everything is logical and perfect,
- **[03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhSo8N5-Ars&t=236s)** — they get impatient.
- **[03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhSo8N5-Ars&t=238s)** — They become irritable and they have sometimes even anxiety.
- **[04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhSo8N5-Ars&t=241s)** — And anxiety is like worry and an inability to decide on something
- **[04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhSo8N5-Ars&t=246s)** — because there's a chronic problem.
- **[04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhSo8N5-Ars&t=249s)** — The moment someone decides and solves a problem, the anxiety is less.
- **[04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhSo8N5-Ars&t=252s)** — Now, it can also affect excessive thinking, analyzing things,
- **[04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhSo8N5-Ars&t=257s)** — especially when you're trying to sleep.
- **[04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhSo8N5-Ars&t=259s)** — You know, in the middle of the night, you're solving all these problems
- **[04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhSo8N5-Ars&t=261s)** — and just keep going and going and going.
- **[04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhSo8N5-Ars&t=264s)** — That's an adrenal symptom.
- **[04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhSo8N5-Ars&t=266s)** — And because the adrenals, the cortisol is another name for that,
- **[04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhSo8N5-Ars&t=269s)** — it's called glucocorticoid.
- **[04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhSo8N5-Ars&t=271s)** — You actually turn protein into glucose.
- **[04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhSo8N5-Ars&t=274s)** — So you're running your body on glucose.
- **[04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhSo8N5-Ars&t=277s)** — And that's something that your adrenals basically cause your liver to make more sugar
- **[04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhSo8N5-Ars&t=281s)** — to run on sugar fuel because it's quick energy.
- **[04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhSo8N5-Ars&t=284s)** — The problem is stress really equals sugar.
- **[04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhSo8N5-Ars&t=288s)** — And even though you're not eating sugar,
- **[04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhSo8N5-Ars&t=290s)** — you're getting a lot of sugar in the bloodstream.
- **[04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhSo8N5-Ars&t=292s)** — And that can cause blood sugar problems and even, believe it or not, diabetes.
- **[05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhSo8N5-Ars&t=300s)** — And what's happening with all the sugar is that
- **[05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhSo8N5-Ars&t=302s)** — it's going to be converted to cholesterol, not the friendly type.
- **[05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhSo8N5-Ars&t=307s)** — Also, you're getting conversion into fat on the liver,
- **[05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhSo8N5-Ars&t=311s)** — fat in the visceral organs right here,
- **[05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhSo8N5-Ars&t=314s)** — because that's a survival mechanism to hold fat in the midsection.
- **[05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhSo8N5-Ars&t=318s)** — In fact, in really extreme examples,
- **[05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhSo8N5-Ars&t=320s)** — I'll show you in this book right here,
- **[05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhSo8N5-Ars&t=321s)** — SIBA collection of medical illustrations, volume four, endocrine system.
- **[05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhSo8N5-Ars&t=328s)** — And see, this is an adrenal body type right here.
- **[05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhSo8N5-Ars&t=330s)** — You can see the person's holding fat right here.
- **[05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhSo8N5-Ars&t=333s)** — And then the body is extracting protein from the glutamate maximus
- **[05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhSo8N5-Ars&t=339s)** — and putting it right into that part right here.
- **[05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhSo8N5-Ars&t=342s)** — And then taking muscle from this extra muscle here called the quads,
- **[05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhSo8N5-Ars&t=347s)** — putting that right in that midsection right here.
- **[05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhSo8N5-Ars&t=350s)** — So there's all these physiological things that happen throughout the body,
- **[05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhSo8N5-Ars&t=354s)** — which I'm going to get into.
- **[05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhSo8N5-Ars&t=356s)** — Another thing that happens with the adrenal is they get hyperacidity, gastritis.
- **[06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhSo8N5-Ars&t=362s)** — And this is why some people can experience ulcers from stress,
- **[06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhSo8N5-Ars&t=367s)** — because the stress activates this acidity,
- **[06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhSo8N5-Ars&t=370s)** — which then burns a hole right through your stomach.
- **[06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhSo8N5-Ars&t=373s)** — The blood pressure goes up with adrenal.
- **[06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhSo8N5-Ars&t=376s)** — Okay, you have increased pulse rate.
- **[06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhSo8N5-Ars&t=379s)** — You can have the symptom of asthma.
- **[06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhSo8N5-Ars&t=381s)** — And because you get cortisol resistance,
- **[06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhSo8N5-Ars&t=384s)** — cortisol is normally an anti-inflammatory,
- **[06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhSo8N5-Ars&t=386s)** — but now you have the opposite of that,
- **[06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhSo8N5-Ars&t=389s)** — which is a deficiency of cortisol in the cell.
- **[06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhSo8N5-Ars&t=392s)** — And this is why a lot of people with adrenal problems
- **[06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhSo8N5-Ars&t=394s)** — develop inflammation that won't go away.
- **[06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhSo8N5-Ars&t=397s)** — They start developing all sorts of inflammatory disorders
- **[06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhSo8N5-Ars&t=401s)** — and problems within the immune system.
- **[06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhSo8N5-Ars&t=403s)** — In fact, if we just look at inflammation, where that comes from.
- **[06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhSo8N5-Ars&t=406s)** — It comes from the healing response.
- **[06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhSo8N5-Ars&t=409s)** — It can come from an injury.
- **[06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhSo8N5-Ars&t=411s)** — It can come from the immune system.
- **[06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhSo8N5-Ars&t=413s)** — But the immune system controls inflammation in the body,
- **[06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhSo8N5-Ars&t=417s)** — regardless of where it comes from.
- **[06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhSo8N5-Ars&t=418s)** — But the unique thing about the adrenal system
- **[07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhSo8N5-Ars&t=421s)** — is that it's shunting energy away from the immune system.
- **[07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhSo8N5-Ars&t=425s)** — And this is why the white blood cells,
- **[07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhSo8N5-Ars&t=427s)** — which is your entire immune system,
- **[07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhSo8N5-Ars&t=429s)** — is suppressed during stress.
- **[07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhSo8N5-Ars&t=432s)** — And cortisol, this is why they use cortisol or prednisone
- **[07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhSo8N5-Ars&t=435s)** — as a treatment with immune overactivity type inflammatory conditions.
- **[07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhSo8N5-Ars&t=441s)** — So in other words, when you go through stress
- **[07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhSo8N5-Ars&t=443s)** — and you have high levels of cortisol,
- **[07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhSo8N5-Ars&t=445s)** — your immune system becomes paralyzed.
- **[07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhSo8N5-Ars&t=447s)** — Okay. And you can even develop in that state
- **[07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhSo8N5-Ars&t=451s)** — autoimmune diseases.
- **[07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhSo8N5-Ars&t=453s)** — And so many people develop an autoimmune disease
- **[07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhSo8N5-Ars&t=456s)** — right after a stress event or a major loss.
- **[07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhSo8N5-Ars&t=460s)** — So any condition that involves inflammation
- **[07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhSo8N5-Ars&t=463s)** — is a condition that involves the adrenal glands.
- **[07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhSo8N5-Ars&t=466s)** — You're also losing certain things like calcium.
- **[07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhSo8N5-Ars&t=469s)** — You're losing potassium for sure.
- **[07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhSo8N5-Ars&t=473s)** — And initially you're retaining sodium,
- **[07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhSo8N5-Ars&t=475s)** — but then eventually when the adrenals burn out,
- **[07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhSo8N5-Ars&t=477s)** — you'll lose sodium.
- **[07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhSo8N5-Ars&t=479s)** — So you're losing these electrolytes.
- **[08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhSo8N5-Ars&t=481s)** — And a little point about potassium is
- **[08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhSo8N5-Ars&t=483s)** — when you start losing potassium,
- **[08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhSo8N5-Ars&t=486s)** — the pH changes in the body to a more alkaline state.
- **[08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhSo8N5-Ars&t=491s)** — So anytime you're looking at a loss of potassium,
- **[08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhSo8N5-Ars&t=493s)** — that's associated with an alkaline state.
- **[08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhSo8N5-Ars&t=495s)** — So when people are burnt out,
- **[08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhSo8N5-Ars&t=498s)** — they're not more acidic, they're more alkaline.
- **[08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhSo8N5-Ars&t=500s)** — And that affects their breathing.
- **[08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhSo8N5-Ars&t=503s)** — They tend to get hypoxia or breathing problems.
- **[08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhSo8N5-Ars&t=507s)** — They can't breathe as well.
- **[08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhSo8N5-Ars&t=508s)** — They accumulate a bit too much CO2 and not enough oxygen.
- **[08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhSo8N5-Ars&t=514s)** — I mean, even if you look at someone
- **[08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhSo8N5-Ars&t=515s)** — that is in a panic state, right?
- **[08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhSo8N5-Ars&t=517s)** — They're breathing and they're breathing like crazy.
- **[08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhSo8N5-Ars&t=521s)** — They basically are getting too much oxygen
- **[08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhSo8N5-Ars&t=523s)** — and not the right balance of CO2
- **[08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhSo8N5-Ars&t=525s)** — because CO2 is needed in a certain amount
- **[08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhSo8N5-Ars&t=527s)** — to help them absorb oxygen.
- **[08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhSo8N5-Ars&t=528s)** — But they have this imbalance of air
- **[08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhSo8N5-Ars&t=531s)** — and they're just suffocating
- **[08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhSo8N5-Ars&t=533s)** — when they're under a panic attack
- **[08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhSo8N5-Ars&t=535s)** — or even in an anxiety state.
- **[08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhSo8N5-Ars&t=538s)** — If you take a look at someone that's in anxiety,
- **[09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhSo8N5-Ars&t=541s)** — look at their breathing.
- **[09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhSo8N5-Ars&t=542s)** — It's not regular.
- **[09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhSo8N5-Ars&t=544s)** — It's like...
- **[09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhSo8N5-Ars&t=547s)** — It's kind of like it's not balanced.
- **[09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhSo8N5-Ars&t=549s)** — And this is why regulating the breath
- **[09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhSo8N5-Ars&t=551s)** — can correct an anxiety state really fast
- **[09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhSo8N5-Ars&t=555s)** — and even take someone out of a panic attack,
- **[09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhSo8N5-Ars&t=558s)** — especially if they breathe through their nose
- **[09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhSo8N5-Ars&t=559s)** — and they breathe slowly in and they breathe slowly out.
- **[09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhSo8N5-Ars&t=563s)** — Another thing that's interesting with the adrenals
- **[09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhSo8N5-Ars&t=564s)** — is vitamin D.
- **[09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhSo8N5-Ars&t=566s)** — You tend to lose vitamin D very easily
- **[09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhSo8N5-Ars&t=570s)** — with an adrenal situation.
- **[09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhSo8N5-Ars&t=572s)** — And so the need for certain nutrients,
- **[09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhSo8N5-Ars&t=574s)** — especially vitamin D, goes up
- **[09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhSo8N5-Ars&t=575s)** — as you lose the adrenal function.
- **[09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhSo8N5-Ars&t=579s)** — Now, if we talk about cortisol,
- **[09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhSo8N5-Ars&t=580s)** — cortisol is very similar in function to vitamin D.
- **[09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhSo8N5-Ars&t=583s)** — They act in similar ways.
- **[09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhSo8N5-Ars&t=585s)** — They're both anti-inflammatory.
- **[09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhSo8N5-Ars&t=588s)** — And so any condition that you have
- **[09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhSo8N5-Ars&t=590s)** — that has a problem with cortisol,
- **[09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhSo8N5-Ars&t=593s)** — I would recommend using vitamin D
- **[09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhSo8N5-Ars&t=595s)** — as a remedy. Okay?
- **[09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhSo8N5-Ars&t=597s)** — So that conclude any of the anti-inflammatory conditions
- **[10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhSo8N5-Ars&t=600s)** — like back pain or knee pain or any of that stuff
- **[10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhSo8N5-Ars&t=603s)** — versus a shot of prednisone.
- **[10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhSo8N5-Ars&t=605s)** — So here's the picture of the adrenal body type,
- **[10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhSo8N5-Ars&t=607s)** — an exaggerated picture.
- **[10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhSo8N5-Ars&t=609s)** — Like I said, the midsection, no butt,
- **[10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhSo8N5-Ars&t=612s)** — weakened thigh muscles.
- **[10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhSo8N5-Ars&t=613s)** — You can have memory loss, brain fog,
- **[10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhSo8N5-Ars&t=616s)** — but at night everything becomes more active,
- **[10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhSo8N5-Ars&t=619s)** — especially around two o'clock in the morning
- **[10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhSo8N5-Ars&t=621s)** — where you wake up and you're thinking about problems,
- **[10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhSo8N5-Ars&t=623s)** — things like that.
- **[10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhSo8N5-Ars&t=624s)** — In fact, with the classical adrenal problems,
- **[10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhSo8N5-Ars&t=626s)** — you're more awake at two o'clock than you are
- **[10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhSo8N5-Ars&t=628s)** — in the morning when you're trying to wake up.
- **[10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhSo8N5-Ars&t=631s)** — Climbing up a flight of stairs,
- **[10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhSo8N5-Ars&t=633s)** — you get out of breath easier
- **[10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhSo8N5-Ars&t=635s)** — and you might possibly even crave salty things
- **[10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhSo8N5-Ars&t=639s)** — like chips, things like that.
- **[10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhSo8N5-Ars&t=641s)** — Now, when you go to sleep at night,
- **[10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhSo8N5-Ars&t=642s)** — there's four waves of sleep that you go through.
- **[10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhSo8N5-Ars&t=646s)** — Okay?
- **[10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhSo8N5-Ars&t=646s)** — And there's really deep levels of sleep
- **[10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhSo8N5-Ars&t=649s)** — called the delta wave sleep.
- **[10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhSo8N5-Ars&t=650s)** — And then you have the superficial ones,
- **[10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhSo8N5-Ars&t=652s)** — which are called REM.
- **[10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhSo8N5-Ars&t=653s)** — So when you go to sleep, the purpose of sleep
- **[10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhSo8N5-Ars&t=654s)** — is just to get rid of a lot of toxins in the brain
- **[10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhSo8N5-Ars&t=657s)** — and metabolites that are generated through the day,
- **[10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhSo8N5-Ars&t=659s)** — which are kind of byproducts of metabolism.
- **[11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhSo8N5-Ars&t=661s)** — Also, you're getting kind of a rejuvenation
- **[11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhSo8N5-Ars&t=664s)** — of neurotransmitters when you're sleeping.
- **[11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhSo8N5-Ars&t=666s)** — And so sleep is necessary for the recovery of stress,
- **[11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhSo8N5-Ars&t=671s)** — yet stress inhibits sleep.
- **[11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhSo8N5-Ars&t=674s)** — So it's definitely a catch-22.
- **[11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhSo8N5-Ars&t=677s)** — Cortisol just messes up the adrenal circadian wave
- **[11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhSo8N5-Ars&t=681s)** — because everything is backwards with the adrenals.
- **[11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhSo8N5-Ars&t=684s)** — The lowest point of cortisol is at 2 o'clock or 2.30 a.m.
- **[11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhSo8N5-Ars&t=688s)** — Right? And the highest point is at 8 a.m. in the morning.
- **[11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhSo8N5-Ars&t=692s)** — So with adrenal fatigue, you'll see it's just the opposite.
- **[11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhSo8N5-Ars&t=696s)** — You're very awake at 2, but you really want to sleep
- **[11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhSo8N5-Ars&t=698s)** — like 7 or 8 o'clock in the morning.
- **[11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhSo8N5-Ars&t=700s)** — But yeah, that's when you have to get up.
- **[11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhSo8N5-Ars&t=702s)** — I had this adrenal problem so bad in my 20s and 30s as well,
- **[11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhSo8N5-Ars&t=708s)** — mainly in my late 20s.
- **[11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhSo8N5-Ars&t=709s)** — I started to get better actually at 28,
- **[11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhSo8N5-Ars&t=710s)** — but here's the thing.
- **[11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhSo8N5-Ars&t=711s)** — It would take me until 11 o'clock a.m.
- **[11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhSo8N5-Ars&t=714s)** — to finally wake up in my head.
- **[11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhSo8N5-Ars&t=716s)** — Now, of course, my diet wasn't helping
- **[11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhSo8N5-Ars&t=718s)** — because I would be living on carbs.
- **[12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhSo8N5-Ars&t=721s)** — But boy, did I have adrenal problems big time.
- **[12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhSo8N5-Ars&t=725s)** — I would wake up at 2, 2.30.
- **[12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhSo8N5-Ars&t=727s)** — There is one night, or multiple nights,
- **[12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhSo8N5-Ars&t=729s)** — but I remember one, that I didn't even sleep one minute.
- **[12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhSo8N5-Ars&t=733s)** — I laid there all night long,
- **[12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhSo8N5-Ars&t=736s)** — listening to my wife Karen saw logs.
- **[12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhSo8N5-Ars&t=739s)** — It was torture.
- **[12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhSo8N5-Ars&t=742s)** — I remember it was like 7 or 8 o'clock,
- **[12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhSo8N5-Ars&t=744s)** — and I'd get up and I didn't even sleep one minute.
- **[12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhSo8N5-Ars&t=747s)** — I was like, this is driving me crazy.
- **[12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhSo8N5-Ars&t=749s)** — You talk about stress, like just not sleeping.
- **[12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhSo8N5-Ars&t=753s)** — I mean, it's terrible.
- **[12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhSo8N5-Ars&t=754s)** — Here's a question.
- **[12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhSo8N5-Ars&t=755s)** — How can someone know what's wrong in the body
- **[12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhSo8N5-Ars&t=756s)** — in relationship to adrenals?
- **[12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhSo8N5-Ars&t=758s)** — Is there a test that can be done?
- **[12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhSo8N5-Ars&t=759s)** — Is there a blood test?
- **[12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhSo8N5-Ars&t=760s)** — Is there a saliva test?
- **[12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhSo8N5-Ars&t=762s)** — The problem is those aren't really good testing
- **[12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhSo8N5-Ars&t=765s)** — because these hormones travel on this circadian wave.
- **[12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhSo8N5-Ars&t=769s)** — If you just check one blood test,
- **[12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhSo8N5-Ars&t=771s)** — or one saliva test with your cortisol,
- **[12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhSo8N5-Ars&t=774s)** — you're just getting a snapshot of what's happening
- **[12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhSo8N5-Ars&t=776s)** — at that period of time.
- **[12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhSo8N5-Ars&t=777s)** — To really know what's going on,
- **[12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhSo8N5-Ars&t=779s)** — you have to check it every four hours,
- **[13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhSo8N5-Ars&t=781s)** — which is a real pain in the butt.
- **[13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhSo8N5-Ars&t=783s)** — There is a saliva test that you can do that,
- **[13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhSo8N5-Ars&t=785s)** — and I've done that, and that's good.
- **[13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhSo8N5-Ars&t=787s)** — But it's kind of a pain in the butt to do,
- **[13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhSo8N5-Ars&t=790s)** — and also takes time and it's a little expensive.
- **[13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhSo8N5-Ars&t=793s)** — I'm going to show you a way better test
- **[13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhSo8N5-Ars&t=796s)** — that's dynamic, that's inexpensive,
- **[13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhSo8N5-Ars&t=800s)** — virtually free.
- **[13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhSo8N5-Ars&t=801s)** — And it really tells you the function of the adrenals
- **[13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhSo8N5-Ars&t=804s)** — versus a very static test.
- **[13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhSo8N5-Ars&t=806s)** — And that is the problem nowadays
- **[13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhSo8N5-Ars&t=807s)** — with testing just about anything.
- **[13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhSo8N5-Ars&t=810s)** — They use static tests.
- **[13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhSo8N5-Ars&t=811s)** — They do CAT scans, MRIs,
- **[13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhSo8N5-Ars&t=813s)** — which is fine to measure tumors and masses
- **[13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhSo8N5-Ars&t=815s)** — and stuff like that.
- **[13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhSo8N5-Ars&t=816s)** — But that doesn't check the function of something,
- **[13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhSo8N5-Ars&t=819s)** — whether it's the gallbladder
- **[13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhSo8N5-Ars&t=820s)** — or the digestive system or the hormone flow.
- **[13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhSo8N5-Ars&t=823s)** — It doesn't look at that.
- **[13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhSo8N5-Ars&t=825s)** — The first one is called the Raglands test.
- **[13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhSo8N5-Ars&t=828s)** — And all you need is a blood pressure cuff.
- **[13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhSo8N5-Ars&t=830s)** — That's all you need.
- **[13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhSo8N5-Ars&t=831s)** — So that's the expense of it.
- **[13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhSo8N5-Ars&t=833s)** — And you check your blood pressure laying down
- **[13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhSo8N5-Ars&t=835s)** — while you're relaxing.
- **[13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhSo8N5-Ars&t=837s)** — And you're checking the top number
- **[13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhSo8N5-Ars&t=839s)** — and the bottom number.
- **[14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhSo8N5-Ars&t=840s)** — You have the systolic top number
- **[14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhSo8N5-Ars&t=841s)** — and the bottom number is the diastolic.
- **[14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhSo8N5-Ars&t=843s)** — You're primarily interested in the systolic number.
- **[14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhSo8N5-Ars&t=846s)** — That's the top number only.
- **[14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhSo8N5-Ars&t=849s)** — So you check your blood pressure lying down
- **[14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhSo8N5-Ars&t=851s)** — and then you stand up
- **[14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhSo8N5-Ars&t=852s)** — and you check the blood pressure.
- **[14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhSo8N5-Ars&t=853s)** — That's all you have to do.
- **[14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhSo8N5-Ars&t=854s)** — Just record it.
- **[14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhSo8N5-Ars&t=856s)** — The difference between the systolic and the diastolic
- **[14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhSo8N5-Ars&t=858s)** — is that the systolic is measuring
- **[14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhSo8N5-Ars&t=861s)** — the sympathetic nervous system, the contraction.
- **[14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhSo8N5-Ars&t=865s)** — And the diastolic is measuring the parasympathetic.
- **[14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhSo8N5-Ars&t=868s)** — It just so happens to be a 50-50 split
- **[14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhSo8N5-Ars&t=871s)** — of sympathetic and parasympathetic.
- **[14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhSo8N5-Ars&t=874s)** — And what's interesting about the adrenals
- **[14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhSo8N5-Ars&t=876s)** — is it has no parasympathetic innervation.
- **[14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhSo8N5-Ars&t=881s)** — Okay, so in other words, it only has an on switch,
- **[14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhSo8N5-Ars&t=885s)** — sympathetic and no off switch.
- **[14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhSo8N5-Ars&t=887s)** — And I think this is one of the reasons why
- **[14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhSo8N5-Ars&t=889s)** — when you go through stress,
- **[14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhSo8N5-Ars&t=890s)** — sometimes it's hard to turn it off
- **[14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhSo8N5-Ars&t=892s)** — because we don't just have an off switch on your adrenals.
- **[14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhSo8N5-Ars&t=895s)** — There's no parasympathetic involvement.
- **[14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhSo8N5-Ars&t=898s)** — So you're looking at this systolic number, right?
- **[15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhSo8N5-Ars&t=901s)** — Now, normally when you lie down and stand up,
- **[15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhSo8N5-Ars&t=903s)** — there's an adrenal adaptation that increases the blood pressure
- **[15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhSo8N5-Ars&t=908s)** — in the pulse rate to be able to push the blood
- **[15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhSo8N5-Ars&t=910s)** — up into the brain or you would literally pass out.
- **[15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhSo8N5-Ars&t=914s)** — Have you ever like stood up real quickly and felt dizzy?
- **[15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhSo8N5-Ars&t=917s)** — Well, that is a failure of the adrenal system
- **[15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhSo8N5-Ars&t=921s)** — to pump the blood pressure and blood
- **[15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhSo8N5-Ars&t=923s)** — up to your brain fast enough so you don't pass out.
- **[15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhSo8N5-Ars&t=926s)** — There's a severe condition called POTS,
- **[15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhSo8N5-Ars&t=929s)** — which I'm not going to get into,
- **[15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhSo8N5-Ars&t=930s)** — but that's a severe adrenal problem.
- **[15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhSo8N5-Ars&t=932s)** — So anyway, when you lie down and stand up,
- **[15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhSo8N5-Ars&t=934s)** — that top number should go up a certain amount,
- **[15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhSo8N5-Ars&t=937s)** — like six to ten points.
- **[15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhSo8N5-Ars&t=940s)** — If it goes up a lot more or it drops down,
- **[15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhSo8N5-Ars&t=945s)** — there's an adrenal dysfunction.
- **[15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhSo8N5-Ars&t=948s)** — Okay, usually if it goes up too fast,
- **[15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhSo8N5-Ars&t=950s)** — it's usually more of an earlier sign of adrenal fatigue
- **[15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhSo8N5-Ars&t=953s)** — where your adrenals are overreacting.
- **[15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhSo8N5-Ars&t=955s)** — And then when it starts to go down,
- **[15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhSo8N5-Ars&t=957s)** — I've seen this all the time,
- **[15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhSo8N5-Ars&t=958s)** — where the systolic just drops way down by ten points
- **[16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhSo8N5-Ars&t=961s)** — and the person feels really dizzy.
- **[16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhSo8N5-Ars&t=963s)** — This is just the lack of adrenal gland function.
- **[16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhSo8N5-Ars&t=966s)** — The adrenals are weak. They can't adapt to stress.
- **[16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhSo8N5-Ars&t=968s)** — So if they were to run up stairs,
- **[16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhSo8N5-Ars&t=971s)** — boy, they would feel very, very weak
- **[16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhSo8N5-Ars&t=973s)** — and they just wouldn't have the endurance.
- **[16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhSo8N5-Ars&t=976s)** — And that's one good test is,
- **[16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhSo8N5-Ars&t=978s)** — can you do an incline easily or not?
- **[16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhSo8N5-Ars&t=983s)** — People that have good adrenals can,
- **[16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhSo8N5-Ars&t=984s)** — well, they can go incline.
- **[16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhSo8N5-Ars&t=986s)** — They can do rock climbing.
- **[16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhSo8N5-Ars&t=988s)** — They can run up a hill, no problem,
- **[16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhSo8N5-Ars&t=990s)** — with no side effects at all.
- **[16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhSo8N5-Ars&t=992s)** — But the simple dynamic adaptive stress test,
- **[16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhSo8N5-Ars&t=996s)** — Ryglin's test, is a good clue
- **[16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhSo8N5-Ars&t=998s)** — on what's going on with the adrenals.
- **[16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhSo8N5-Ars&t=1000s)** — So that's number one.
- **[16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhSo8N5-Ars&t=1001s)** — Number two evaluates your CO2 tolerance.
- **[16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhSo8N5-Ars&t=1006s)** — Remember I talked about breathing and oxygen
- **[16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhSo8N5-Ars&t=1008s)** — and your pH being off?
- **[16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhSo8N5-Ars&t=1010s)** — Well, that relates to adrenal fatigue.
- **[16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhSo8N5-Ars&t=1012s)** — And this test is going to measure your tolerance to CO2.
- **[16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhSo8N5-Ars&t=1017s)** — So you see you have oxygen and then you have CO2.
- **[17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhSo8N5-Ars&t=1020s)** — And as you know, you need oxygen.
- **[17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhSo8N5-Ars&t=1021s)** — It takes a little bit of CO2 for oxygen to go into the cells,
- **[17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhSo8N5-Ars&t=1026s)** — but you can't live off just CO2.
- **[17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhSo8N5-Ars&t=1028s)** — There's going to be a sensation of anxiety
- **[17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhSo8N5-Ars&t=1031s)** — if you have too much CO2 and not enough oxygen.
- **[17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhSo8N5-Ars&t=1034s)** — In fact, if you suffocate someone,
- **[17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhSo8N5-Ars&t=1036s)** — they're going to go immediately into anxiety
- **[17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhSo8N5-Ars&t=1038s)** — and then panic attack.
- **[17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhSo8N5-Ars&t=1040s)** — So here's what you do.
- **[17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhSo8N5-Ars&t=1041s)** — Breathe through your nose, step one.
- **[17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhSo8N5-Ars&t=1042s)** — Okay, you're going to breathe in,
- **[17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhSo8N5-Ars&t=1046s)** — breathe in and breathe out three times through your nose.
- **[17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhSo8N5-Ars&t=1049s)** — Okay, on the fourth inhalation,
- **[17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhSo8N5-Ars&t=1053s)** — you're going to take it as much air as you can.
- **[17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhSo8N5-Ars&t=1057s)** — Okay, and then what you're going to do is
- **[17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhSo8N5-Ars&t=1059s)** — you're going to have a timer
- **[17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhSo8N5-Ars&t=1060s)** — and you're going to time in seconds.
- **[17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhSo8N5-Ars&t=1063s)** — What is the time of exhalation?
- **[17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhSo8N5-Ars&t=1066s)** — You're going to breathe out slowly, okay,
- **[17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhSo8N5-Ars&t=1069s)** — after this very large inhalation.
- **[17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhSo8N5-Ars&t=1072s)** — If at the end of the exhalation
- **[17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhSo8N5-Ars&t=1075s)** — where you can't have any more air come out,
- **[17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhSo8N5-Ars&t=1077s)** — equals 20 seconds or less,
- **[18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhSo8N5-Ars&t=1080s)** — this means that you don't have
- **[18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhSo8N5-Ars&t=1082s)** — a very good tolerance to CO2.
- **[18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhSo8N5-Ars&t=1083s)** — This is a poor adaptation.
- **[18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhSo8N5-Ars&t=1086s)** — This means you have adrenal fatigue.
- **[18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhSo8N5-Ars&t=1089s)** — If your number is between 20 and 40 seconds,
- **[18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhSo8N5-Ars&t=1092s)** — this is like average.
- **[18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhSo8N5-Ars&t=1093s)** — If the seconds are between 40 and 60 seconds,
- **[18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhSo8N5-Ars&t=1097s)** — this is kind of like a little bit above average,
- **[18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhSo8N5-Ars&t=1100s)** — but not quite great.
- **[18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhSo8N5-Ars&t=1103s)** — But if you can do this between 60 and 80 seconds,
- **[18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhSo8N5-Ars&t=1106s)** — you're advanced or even over 80 seconds,
- **[18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhSo8N5-Ars&t=1108s)** — you're an elite athlete.
- **[18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhSo8N5-Ars&t=1110s)** — And this brings up a really important
- **[18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhSo8N5-Ars&t=1113s)** — thing about exercise.
- **[18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhSo8N5-Ars&t=1115s)** — The more fit that you can get your body,
- **[18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhSo8N5-Ars&t=1118s)** — the more capacity you can handle stress in life.
- **[18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhSo8N5-Ars&t=1121s)** — And that's one important reason
- **[18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhSo8N5-Ars&t=1123s)** — why you should get in shape and start exercising.
- **[18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhSo8N5-Ars&t=1126s)** — All right, so what does the adrenal need to recover?
- **[18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhSo8N5-Ars&t=1129s)** — The most important vitamin, okay,
- **[18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhSo8N5-Ars&t=1133s)** — is vitamin C for the adrenals.
- **[18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhSo8N5-Ars&t=1135s)** — Why?
- **[18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhSo8N5-Ars&t=1135s)** — Because both cortisol and adrenaline
- **[18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhSo8N5-Ars&t=1138s)** — and these other neurotransmitters
- **[19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhSo8N5-Ars&t=1140s)** — in the inside of the adrenal
- **[19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhSo8N5-Ars&t=1141s)** — need vitamin C as a precursor.
- **[19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhSo8N5-Ars&t=1144s)** — Very, very important.
- **[19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhSo8N5-Ars&t=1145s)** — If you don't have enough vitamin C,
- **[19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhSo8N5-Ars&t=1147s)** — you're going to have all sorts of problems.
- **[19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhSo8N5-Ars&t=1151s)** — And probably the fatigue that you get from scurvy,
- **[19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhSo8N5-Ars&t=1154s)** — which is a severe vitamin C deficiency,
- **[19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhSo8N5-Ars&t=1156s)** — is probably a similar thing.
- **[19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhSo8N5-Ars&t=1158s)** — You're experiencing an adrenal fatigue.
- **[19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhSo8N5-Ars&t=1160s)** — But if you look at this image right here,
- **[19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhSo8N5-Ars&t=1162s)** — I have a picture of ascorbic acid,
- **[19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhSo8N5-Ars&t=1164s)** — which most people think is vitamin C,
- **[19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhSo8N5-Ars&t=1167s)** — but really it's just the shell.
- **[19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhSo8N5-Ars&t=1169s)** — It's the artificial or synthetic part
- **[19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhSo8N5-Ars&t=1172s)** — or one part of the vitamin C complex.
- **[19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhSo8N5-Ars&t=1174s)** — In nature, you never see just pure ascorbic acid.
- **[19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhSo8N5-Ars&t=1177s)** — You have the whole ball of wax, the whole complex.
- **[19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhSo8N5-Ars&t=1180s)** — And this is why it's so important
- **[19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhSo8N5-Ars&t=1181s)** — to get a vitamin C from a food extract.
- **[19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhSo8N5-Ars&t=1184s)** — The best source would be sauerkraut.
- **[19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhSo8N5-Ars&t=1187s)** — Make sure it's raw.
- **[19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhSo8N5-Ars&t=1188s)** — You can have like just like 700 milligrams.
- **[19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhSo8N5-Ars&t=1191s)** — That's 7X what you normally need
- **[19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhSo8N5-Ars&t=1194s)** — with vitamin C from sauerkraut.
- **[19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhSo8N5-Ars&t=1195s)** — Also, bell peppers,
- **[19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhSo8N5-Ars&t=1198s)** — any of the leafy green vegetables,
- **[20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhSo8N5-Ars&t=1200s)** — lemons, limes, berries,
- **[20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhSo8N5-Ars&t=1202s)** — all are loaded with vitamin C.
- **[20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhSo8N5-Ars&t=1204s)** — Another really important nutrient is potassium.
- **[20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhSo8N5-Ars&t=1208s)** — You get that from large salads.
- **[20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhSo8N5-Ars&t=1210s)** — People that don't have a lot of salad or vegetables
- **[20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhSo8N5-Ars&t=1213s)** — and have adrenal fatigue,
- **[20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhSo8N5-Ars&t=1215s)** — boy, they have a hard time winding down.
- **[20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhSo8N5-Ars&t=1218s)** — You see potassium is kind of like
- **[20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhSo8N5-Ars&t=1220s)** — a physiological tranquilizer.
- **[20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhSo8N5-Ars&t=1222s)** — It calms things down.
- **[20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhSo8N5-Ars&t=1223s)** — If you ever hear your pulse rate pound in your ear
- **[20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhSo8N5-Ars&t=1227s)** — when you're trying to sleep,
- **[20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhSo8N5-Ars&t=1228s)** — that's a potassium deficiency.
- **[20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhSo8N5-Ars&t=1230s)** — Potassium is going to help you relax.
- **[20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhSo8N5-Ars&t=1232s)** — When I don't consume enough salad,
- **[20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhSo8N5-Ars&t=1234s)** — for example, to get my potassium,
- **[20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhSo8N5-Ars&t=1236s)** — my sleep isn't that great.
- **[20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhSo8N5-Ars&t=1238s)** — I'm kind of on edge.
- **[20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhSo8N5-Ars&t=1239s)** — But when I do have enough potassium from salads
- **[20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhSo8N5-Ars&t=1241s)** — and things like that, I feel better.
- **[20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhSo8N5-Ars&t=1243s)** — I just feel calm.
- **[20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhSo8N5-Ars&t=1245s)** — So potassium is necessary.
- **[20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhSo8N5-Ars&t=1247s)** — And then with those vegetables also comes magnesium,
- **[20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhSo8N5-Ars&t=1249s)** — which is also good for the adrenals,
- **[20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhSo8N5-Ars&t=1251s)** — but mainly potassium.
- **[20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhSo8N5-Ars&t=1253s)** — Sodium is also needed in most cases.
- **[20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhSo8N5-Ars&t=1256s)** — If the adrenal glands are really burnt out,
- **[20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhSo8N5-Ars&t=1257s)** — you need more salt, sea salt.
- **[20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhSo8N5-Ars&t=1259s)** — But unfortunately, people get it from the wrong source.
- **[21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhSo8N5-Ars&t=1261s)** — Potato chips, corn chips, things like that.
- **[21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhSo8N5-Ars&t=1263s)** — You want to get it... just salt your food.
- **[21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhSo8N5-Ars&t=1266s)** — More sea salt. That can help as well.
- **[21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhSo8N5-Ars&t=1268s)** — Some people, when they consume sea salt,
- **[21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhSo8N5-Ars&t=1270s)** — they can breathe better.
- **[21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhSo8N5-Ars&t=1272s)** — Because the pH kind of normalizes
- **[21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhSo8N5-Ars&t=1275s)** — from either one extreme to back to normal.
- **[21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhSo8N5-Ars&t=1278s)** — The other nutrient that's really important
- **[21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhSo8N5-Ars&t=1280s)** — with the adrenal is vitamin B1.
- **[21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhSo8N5-Ars&t=1283s)** — Now, vitamin B1 is probably the most important nutrient.
- **[21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhSo8N5-Ars&t=1287s)** — Not necessarily just for the adrenals,
- **[21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhSo8N5-Ars&t=1289s)** — but for the entire autonomic nervous system,
- **[21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhSo8N5-Ars&t=1291s)** — especially starting in the brain stem itself,
- **[21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhSo8N5-Ars&t=1293s)** — right back here.
- **[21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhSo8N5-Ars&t=1295s)** — And that goes right through the adrenal system.
- **[21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhSo8N5-Ars&t=1298s)** — So you have a lot of connections between those two.
- **[21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhSo8N5-Ars&t=1301s)** — But if you're deficient in B1,
- **[21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhSo8N5-Ars&t=1305s)** — boy, you'll have a problem with breathing.
- **[21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhSo8N5-Ars&t=1307s)** — And boy, will you have a problem with stress.
- **[21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhSo8N5-Ars&t=1309s)** — So B1 can very quickly, within minutes,
- **[21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhSo8N5-Ars&t=1312s)** — just calm you down and make things do better
- **[21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhSo8N5-Ars&t=1315s)** — with an autonomic nervous system
- **[21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhSo8N5-Ars&t=1317s)** — from just a different angle.
- **[22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhSo8N5-Ars&t=1320s)** — So what is the plan and protocol for the adrenal?
- **[22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhSo8N5-Ars&t=1322s)** — There's a lot of things that can be done.
- **[22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhSo8N5-Ars&t=1324s)** — Number one, find the source of stress
- **[22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhSo8N5-Ars&t=1328s)** — that you're going through and do whatever you can
- **[22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhSo8N5-Ars&t=1331s)** — to fix it. Very important.
- **[22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhSo8N5-Ars&t=1333s)** — And then with that, change your viewpoint
- **[22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhSo8N5-Ars&t=1336s)** — on just life in general.
- **[22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhSo8N5-Ars&t=1339s)** — Just keep a more relaxed viewpoint on things.
- **[22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhSo8N5-Ars&t=1341s)** — I did a video on this.
- **[22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhSo8N5-Ars&t=1343s)** — Very important just to go through life
- **[22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhSo8N5-Ars&t=1346s)** — with a bit of a carefree viewpoint.

- **[00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9vf2ylY2ds&t=0s)** — Today we are going to talk about how to permanently get rid of blackheads and this other thing called sebaceous filaments.
- **[00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9vf2ylY2ds&t=8s)** — Which actually a lot of people have a confusion between these two and that's what I am going to clarify today.
- **[00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9vf2ylY2ds&t=13s)** — So there are so many treatments out there using various tapes, creams, lotions.
- **[00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9vf2ylY2ds&t=19s)** — Today we are going to talk about how to look deeper inside and correct the imbalances causing this problem.
- **[00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9vf2ylY2ds&t=25s)** — The first let's look at a typical treatment. As you can see in this video, this is what people do.
- **[00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9vf2ylY2ds&t=32s)** — And they are applying it to their nose and then they are removing these little tiny filaments from the different pores in their skin.
- **[00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9vf2ylY2ds&t=39s)** — The actual little pores are called follicles. Sometimes people think follicles are hairs. No.
- **[00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9vf2ylY2ds&t=45s)** — They are the little sac that hold the oil and sometimes the hair.
- **[00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9vf2ylY2ds&t=48s)** — So as you can see you are literally ripping out the material inside these tiny little caverns.
- **[00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9vf2ylY2ds&t=54s)** — They are not getting rid of blackheads. It is completely different.
- **[00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9vf2ylY2ds&t=57s)** — Blackheads are differentiated from whiteheads because there is a little plug on top of the pore that keeps the material, the fats and oils and bacteria from oxidizing.
- **[01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9vf2ylY2ds&t=69s)** — So if we don't have a plug on top of this pore, it is going to be exposed to oxygen.
- **[01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9vf2ylY2ds&t=73s)** — And then we are going to oxidize that material and that material is going to turn darker.
- **[01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9vf2ylY2ds&t=78s)** — Just like if you were to bite into an apple and have it oxidized and turn brown.
- **[01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9vf2ylY2ds&t=84s)** — So that is what a blackhead is.
- **[01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9vf2ylY2ds&t=87s)** — And a blackhead and a whitehead is kind of a precursor to acne.
- **[01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9vf2ylY2ds&t=91s)** — And it most commonly happens during puberty. Of course, I had it really bad.
- **[01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9vf2ylY2ds&t=95s)** — I wish I would have known the information in this video back then because I thought it was dirty in there and I had to clean it and I would be scrubbing my skin for hours.
- **[01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9vf2ylY2ds&t=105s)** — And you know what? They just created more inflammation and more redness.
- **[01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9vf2ylY2ds&t=108s)** — So that is not the way to do it.
- **[01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9vf2ylY2ds&t=110s)** — Now, as far as these sebaceous filaments go, you can get them removed through various ways.
- **[01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9vf2ylY2ds&t=116s)** — Whether it is going to be a tape or a certain type of lotion or compound.
- **[02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9vf2ylY2ds&t=122s)** — But they come right back.
- **[02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9vf2ylY2ds&t=123s)** — So the big question is what is really behind these problems and how can we resolve it permanently?
- **[02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9vf2ylY2ds&t=128s)** — Well, for that I have another review here.
- **[02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9vf2ylY2ds&t=131s)** — And you can see sebaceous filaments and blackheads come from the body producing too much sebum.
- **[02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9vf2ylY2ds&t=138s)** — So the real problem is we have a gland that is overproducing.
- **[02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9vf2ylY2ds&t=143s)** — And the question is why?
- **[02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9vf2ylY2ds&t=145s)** — Well, it is because of this right here, this hormone called androgens.
- **[02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9vf2ylY2ds&t=148s)** — This is why during puberty people have more incidence of these problems, right?
- **[02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9vf2ylY2ds&t=154s)** — But it can also happen at different points of your life as well as during pregnancy.
- **[02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9vf2ylY2ds&t=158s)** — So how do we regulate androgens? That is the big question.
- **[02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9vf2ylY2ds&t=164s)** — To help reduce and balance out sebum, which is the oil gland.
- **[02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9vf2ylY2ds&t=169s)** — Well, the first one is vitamin A.
- **[02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9vf2ylY2ds&t=172s)** — Now, with vitamin A there are certain creams that people rub on their skin to help get rid of blackheads and sebaceous filaments.
- **[02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9vf2ylY2ds&t=179s)** — But that is kind of treating the symptom.
- **[03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9vf2ylY2ds&t=181s)** — Why do not we just fix it by taking more vitamin A?
- **[03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9vf2ylY2ds&t=185s)** — Now, you might say, well, I am eating a lot of carrots.
- **[03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9vf2ylY2ds&t=187s)** — Well, you might be, but that is the precursor called beta-carotene.
- **[03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9vf2ylY2ds&t=191s)** — You need the actual active form of vitamin A, which is retinol, to really make sure it works.
- **[03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9vf2ylY2ds&t=196s)** — So the question is what foods are high in retinol? I am getting to that.
- **[03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9vf2ylY2ds&t=200s)** — Let us go to the next one.
- **[03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9vf2ylY2ds&t=201s)** — Vitamin D. Vitamin D also helps reduce sebum.
- **[03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9vf2ylY2ds&t=207s)** — And omega-3 fatty acids also help reduce sebum.
- **[03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9vf2ylY2ds&t=211s)** — So take a wild guess.
- **[03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9vf2ylY2ds&t=212s)** — What substance has all three of these great nutrients?
- **[03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9vf2ylY2ds&t=216s)** — Well, if you guess cod liver oil, you are correct.
- **[03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9vf2ylY2ds&t=220s)** — It is the cod liver oil that has not just the active form of vitamin A, retinol, but also vitamin D and omega-3.
- **[03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9vf2ylY2ds&t=228s)** — In fact, cod liver oil has the most vitamin A.
- **[03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9vf2ylY2ds&t=232s)** — But you can also get your vitamin A from other foods as well, like egg yolks and fish and sardines.
- **[04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9vf2ylY2ds&t=240s)** — And there is a whole list of things that you can get it from.
- **[04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9vf2ylY2ds&t=243s)** — There is more to the story, okay?
- **[04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9vf2ylY2ds&t=244s)** — You also have high levels of seed oil.
- **[04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9vf2ylY2ds&t=247s)** — That is omega-6 fatty acids.
- **[04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9vf2ylY2ds&t=249s)** — It just so happens when you consume too much of that, you actually indirectly decrease the omega-3 fatty acids.
- **[04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9vf2ylY2ds&t=257s)** — So my viewpoint is out of all the things that are creating this problem with too much sebum, it is excessive amounts of seed oils.
- **[04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9vf2ylY2ds&t=266s)** — I am talking about the soy oil, the canola, the corn oil in most of our foods.
- **[04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9vf2ylY2ds&t=271s)** — And so we must increase omega-3 and decrease omega-6 fatty acids.
- **[04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9vf2ylY2ds&t=277s)** — Alright, there is more to the story.
- **[04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9vf2ylY2ds&t=278s)** — You see this right here? It is called carbohydrates and sugars.
- **[04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9vf2ylY2ds&t=282s)** — When you have too many carbohydrates and sugars, guess what? You increase insulin.
- **[04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9vf2ylY2ds&t=287s)** — And when you increase insulin, you increase androgens.
- **[04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9vf2ylY2ds&t=291s)** — This is why women who have polycystic ovarian syndrome, which is too much androgens, have way too much insulin.
- **[04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9vf2ylY2ds&t=297s)** — And the way to correct this is simply reducing your insulin levels.
- **[05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9vf2ylY2ds&t=302s)** — You are going to have to lower your carbs and sugars, and you are also going to have to decrease the frequency of how many times you eat.
- **[05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9vf2ylY2ds&t=310s)** — Intermittent fasting helps decrease the sebum as well.
- **[05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9vf2ylY2ds&t=313s)** — And boy, I wish I would have known that in school because I was the king of snacking.
- **[05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9vf2ylY2ds&t=318s)** — I would have so many different meals through the day and snacking at night.
- **[05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9vf2ylY2ds&t=321s)** — I did not know that increases insulin, which then increases androgens and gives me more acne.
- **[05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9vf2ylY2ds&t=327s)** — Again, what we are trying to do is we are trying to get rid of the underlying imbalance using mainly diet with some nutrients.
- **[05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9vf2ylY2ds&t=335s)** — So that way we do not have to put all these topical things on our skin and create the sterilization effect,
- **[05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9vf2ylY2ds&t=340s)** — get rid of all the good friendly bacteria on the skin, create more redness and more aggravation to your skin.
- **[05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9vf2ylY2ds&t=347s)** — But there is one more thing to talk about, and that is this right here, zinc.
- **[05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9vf2ylY2ds&t=352s)** — A deficiency of zinc will increase the oil gland and give you more sebum.
- **[05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9vf2ylY2ds&t=357s)** — So you want to make sure you have enough zinc. Where do you get zinc?
- **[06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9vf2ylY2ds&t=361s)** — Well, shellfish, oysters, things like that, but you can also get it from red meat.
- **[06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9vf2ylY2ds&t=365s)** — But the more likely cause of a zinc deficiency is you are consuming too many carbs and sugars,
- **[06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9vf2ylY2ds&t=370s)** — or going through too much stress. That can deplete zinc as well.
- **[06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9vf2ylY2ds&t=376s)** — When you consume a lot of cereal or grains, especially whole grains, which is high in phytic acid,
- **[06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9vf2ylY2ds&t=383s)** — that is going to pull the zinc out too. So that could be another reason why you might be deficient in zinc.
- **[06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9vf2ylY2ds&t=389s)** — But now you have the plan to not only get rid of blackheads, whiteheads, acne, sebaceous filaments,
- **[06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9vf2ylY2ds&t=396s)** — but you are making sure that these things do not come back because you are getting rid of the deeper cause.
- **[06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9vf2ylY2ds&t=402s)** — And if you have not seen my other video on blackheads, I am going to put it up right here.
- **[06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9vf2ylY2ds&t=406s)** — It was very, very popular and it is a very cool video.

- **[00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uT2zBPmcmsA&t=0s)** — I'm going to show you the best way to get at the root cause of those dark circles underneath your eyes.
- **[00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uT2zBPmcmsA&t=7s)** — It's called periorbital dark circles. Now typically when you look this up you're going to see
- **[00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uT2zBPmcmsA&t=13s)** — a million different remedies, okay? And they do work. The problem is they only work temporarily.
- **[00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uT2zBPmcmsA&t=19s)** — You have to keep applying them over and over and over. You can use kojic acid and you can
- **[00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uT2zBPmcmsA&t=25s)** — vitamin C, aloe vera, niacinamide, which is a type of B3, or you can even use cucumber extract or
- **[00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uT2zBPmcmsA&t=34s)** — cucumbers. So any of these will work temporarily. Simply take the remedy and rub it underneath your
- **[00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uT2zBPmcmsA&t=40s)** — eyes and give it, you know, some days or even weeks. So what do all of these have in common?
- **[00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uT2zBPmcmsA&t=46s)** — They inhibit melanin, okay, which causes this pigmentation in your skin. And that's cool. You
- **[00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uT2zBPmcmsA&t=53s)** — can do that. There's probably not a lot of side effects, but I want to talk about the two underlying
- **[00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uT2zBPmcmsA&t=59s)** — root causes to this problem. So you can actually permanently get rid of this. Now the first one
- **[01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uT2zBPmcmsA&t=64s)** — involves understanding just a little bit about your hormone system, okay? You have this little
- **[01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uT2zBPmcmsA&t=70s)** — gland in the brain called the pituitary and it sends signals down through the body. And one
- **[01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uT2zBPmcmsA&t=76s)** — of the tissues that it controls is the adrenal glands. You have two of them deep into
- **[01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uT2zBPmcmsA&t=81s)** — your abdomen, okay? The adrenal glands produce a lot of different hormones, but there's one that
- **[01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uT2zBPmcmsA&t=86s)** — is called cortisol and that is a stress hormone. So the pituitary sends a signal down to the
- **[01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uT2zBPmcmsA&t=93s)** — adrenal when there's perceived stress and that pituitary hormone is called ACTH. It hits
- **[01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uT2zBPmcmsA&t=100s)** — the adrenal and then the adrenal produces cortisol. Once cortisol is produced, that amount
- **[01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uT2zBPmcmsA&t=106s)** — of cortisol that is produced reaches up to the pituitary and tells the pituitary to turn off
- **[01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uT2zBPmcmsA&t=112s)** — to stop producing this circuit. And so now that ACTH can stop being activated. Now it just so
- **[01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uT2zBPmcmsA&t=119s)** — happens when you go through a period of stress called the chronic stress, which could include
- **[02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uT2zBPmcmsA&t=124s)** — loneliness, losses, or anything to raise your level of cortisol like
- **[02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uT2zBPmcmsA&t=132s)** — synthetic cortisol, prednisone, medications, etc. What's going to happen next is your body's
- **[02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uT2zBPmcmsA&t=138s)** — going to develop this cortisol resistance, very similar to insulin resistance. And if you
- **[02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uT2zBPmcmsA&t=145s)** — want to look this up, this is a real condition. Okay, it's called glucocorticoid
- **[02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uT2zBPmcmsA&t=149s)** — receptor resistance. Now what happens in this situation is because of the excess communication
- **[02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uT2zBPmcmsA&t=157s)** — coming down from the pituitary, that could be a bit too dangerous. So your receptors kind of shut
- **[02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uT2zBPmcmsA&t=162s)** — down and inhibit the absorption of cortisol into the cells. And this is a protective
- **[02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uT2zBPmcmsA&t=168s)** — mechanism. What's going to happen next is you're going to have a deficiency of cortisol.
- **[02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uT2zBPmcmsA&t=173s)** — So the communication is being sent, but it's not being received. So it's kind of like
- **[02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uT2zBPmcmsA&t=177s)** — talking to someone, but they're completely ignoring you. So what are you going to do?
- **[03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uT2zBPmcmsA&t=181s)** — You're going to start shouting at them, right? Eventually you're going to start talking
- **[03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uT2zBPmcmsA&t=185s)** — louder. And that's exactly what the pituitary starts doing. It starts to increase its level
- **[03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uT2zBPmcmsA&t=191s)** — of communication. Why? Because it's not getting through. Okay, your pituitary thinks that you
- **[03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uT2zBPmcmsA&t=198s)** — have a cortisol deficiency, but in reality it's just resistance in the receptor. It's
- **[03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uT2zBPmcmsA&t=203s)** — definitely deficiency, but it's because there's too much cortisol. So anytime you have too much
- **[03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uT2zBPmcmsA&t=209s)** — CTH, you're going to have a big spike in this other hormone called melanocyte stimulating
- **[03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uT2zBPmcmsA&t=217s)** — hormone. And that's where you get the increase in melanin, which is that darkening of your skin.
- **[03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uT2zBPmcmsA&t=222s)** — And very commonly it can occur right underneath your eyes. Now this is a problem because not
- **[03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uT2zBPmcmsA&t=227s)** — only are you going to get this darkening underneath your eyes, but you're going to
- **[03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uT2zBPmcmsA&t=231s)** — have all the other symptoms that come along with cortisol resistance. You see, cortisol
- **[03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uT2zBPmcmsA&t=236s)** — helps you adapt to stress. Okay, put your body into a stress state to help you overcome
- **[04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uT2zBPmcmsA&t=241s)** — a stressful situation. But now we have a situation that we have stress, but unfortunately
- **[04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uT2zBPmcmsA&t=246s)** — without the benefit of cortisol. So now you get more inflammation in the body and that can
- **[04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uT2zBPmcmsA&t=251s)** — happen on the skin as other problems. You're more susceptible to infection. Your immune system
- **[04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uT2zBPmcmsA&t=257s)** — actually becomes very dysfunctional, etc. So what could be done with this cortisol deficiency
- **[04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uT2zBPmcmsA&t=263s)** — that's really causing this problem? Number one, you have to do something about your stress. You
- **[04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uT2zBPmcmsA&t=268s)** — have to reduce it in any way, shape or form. And I'm talking about the actual source of the
- **[04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uT2zBPmcmsA&t=274s)** — stress, no matter what it is. And to flush out the stress, start increasing regular aerobic
- **[04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uT2zBPmcmsA&t=279s)** — exercise where you're actually not producing a lot of stress, but you're running or flushing
- **[04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uT2zBPmcmsA&t=285s)** — out all this adrenaline and cortisol out of the system. Actually, if you do physical work
- **[04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uT2zBPmcmsA&t=291s)** — outside, that is even better than exercise because it also relieves the mental component
- **[04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uT2zBPmcmsA&t=297s)** — to stress because it shifts your attention to something else. Far too often when someone
- **[05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uT2zBPmcmsA&t=302s)** — works out and they're on the treadmill, whatever, or at the gym, they're thinking
- **[05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uT2zBPmcmsA&t=307s)** — about these stressful moments at the same time, unfortunately. So it's really sometimes
- **[05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uT2zBPmcmsA&t=312s)** — hard to extract the attention on that stress situation. Okay, the next thing is sleep.
- **[05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uT2zBPmcmsA&t=318s)** — Okay, get more sleep, take more naps, go to bed earlier, sleep in later. The next thing to do,
- **[05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uT2zBPmcmsA&t=325s)** — and this is something that is very important, vitamin D3. Okay, I would take probably 20 to
- **[05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uT2zBPmcmsA&t=331s)** — 30,000. I use a vitamin D3. Vitamin D3 acts like cortisol in the body, but without the
- **[05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uT2zBPmcmsA&t=338s)** — side effects. So it can give you some benefits of this cortisol immediately. Magnesium is
- **[05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uT2zBPmcmsA&t=344s)** — one of the most important minerals to take. And then also limit the amount of screen time.
- **[05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uT2zBPmcmsA&t=350s)** — Looking into the computer, that can really strain the eyes and it's just unfortunately not
- **[05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uT2zBPmcmsA&t=355s)** — very healthy, even though we all do it. The next thing is reduce insulin. Okay, you see this
- **[06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uT2zBPmcmsA&t=362s)** — in diabetics. Diabetics have this condition where they have kind of this dark,
- **[06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uT2zBPmcmsA&t=367s)** — velvety skin in the folds of their body, sometimes around their neck, armpits. And
- **[06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uT2zBPmcmsA&t=373s)** — what's happening is they have high levels of insulin and insulin resistance that is
- **[06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uT2zBPmcmsA&t=378s)** — raising this melanocyte stimulating hormone. And this is a really easy one to correct if you
- **[06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uT2zBPmcmsA&t=384s)** — understand what's happening. All you have to do is bring your carbs down to 20 grams or
- **[06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uT2zBPmcmsA&t=392s)** — less per day. And then just not eat so frequently. Skip the snacks, skip breakfast,
- **[06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uT2zBPmcmsA&t=397s)** — and just have two or even one meal a day. Okay, you combine that with lowering your stress
- **[06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uT2zBPmcmsA&t=403s)** — and you will see a lightning of these dark circles under your eye, which will then remain
- **[06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uT2zBPmcmsA&t=409s)** — absent. I have a lot more to say on this topic. If you haven't seen
- **[06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uT2zBPmcmsA&t=413s)** — this video on stress, you should check it out. I put it up right here.

- **[00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sTnbzWbKgvE&t=0s)** — Hello and welcome to How to Completely Ruin Your Health and Well-Being.
- **[00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sTnbzWbKgvE&t=4s)** — If you're looking to make terrible choices and sabotage your future health,
- **[00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sTnbzWbKgvE&t=8s)** — you've come to the right place. Let's dive right into my recommendations.
- **[00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sTnbzWbKgvE&t=12s)** — Realize there is no bad food group. As long as you eat in moderation,
- **[00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sTnbzWbKgvE&t=17s)** — you can eat absolutely anything. This includes junk food in moderation.
- **[00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sTnbzWbKgvE&t=22s)** — But let's not call it junk food. Let's call it fast food or ultra-processed food.
- **[00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sTnbzWbKgvE&t=27s)** — That will make you feel a little bit better. The next time you go buy food,
- **[00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sTnbzWbKgvE&t=31s)** — spend most of your time in the center of the grocery store, ignoring the perimeter.
- **[00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sTnbzWbKgvE&t=36s)** — This way you'll save a lot of money. And this is where all the cheap,
- **[00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sTnbzWbKgvE&t=39s)** — empty calorie food is located. And don't forget to bring your kids.
- **[00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sTnbzWbKgvE&t=43s)** — Just make sure they're hungry and tired before you walk into the store.
- **[00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sTnbzWbKgvE&t=47s)** — Make sure you buy no vegetables or meats or cheeses because they go bad very quickly.
- **[00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sTnbzWbKgvE&t=52s)** — Say hello to the ultra-processed sugary starches, seed oils, and processed snacks.
- **[00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sTnbzWbKgvE&t=56s)** — They virtually have no expiration date. Remember, the more artificial, the better.
- **[01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sTnbzWbKgvE&t=61s)** — And regarding red meat, it's like smoking a cigarette. It causes cancer.
- **[01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sTnbzWbKgvE&t=66s)** — So stick with the ultra-processed foods. You will not regret it.
- **[01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sTnbzWbKgvE&t=70s)** — Step number two. Enjoy life. Listen closely to this very important message.
- **[01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sTnbzWbKgvE&t=103s)** — So quench your thirst and get hydrated with these sugary sodas,
- **[01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sTnbzWbKgvE&t=108s)** — energy drinks, and sugar-laden fruit juices. But just make sure you ignore the fact that
- **[01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sTnbzWbKgvE&t=112s)** — they might lead to weight gain, diabetes, and a whole host of other health issues.
- **[01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sTnbzWbKgvE&t=117s)** — But, so as they say, Coke adds life. Take that to the grave. I mean, take that to heart.
- **[02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sTnbzWbKgvE&t=123s)** — Also realize that our food pyramid is based on science. Just ignore the rumor that most
- **[02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sTnbzWbKgvE&t=128s)** — of the scientists that actually created the dietary guidelines have conflict of interest.
- **[02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sTnbzWbKgvE&t=133s)** — You only live once, so enjoy yourself. Those wonderful, delicious chips that are like
- **[02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sTnbzWbKgvE&t=140s)** — hydrogenated seed oils, added synthetic sugars, and monosodium glutamate will comfort your soul.
- **[02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sTnbzWbKgvE&t=146s)** — And as a really great benefit because of all the preservatives, they have no shelf life.
- **[02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sTnbzWbKgvE&t=150s)** — They'll last for years. So don't worry. Not even the bugs weed them.
- **[02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sTnbzWbKgvE&t=154s)** — These comfort foods will comfort you and protect you against the stresses of life.
- **[02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sTnbzWbKgvE&t=159s)** — Step three. Develop a sedentary lifestyle. Avoid any form of exercise and embrace your
- **[02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sTnbzWbKgvE&t=165s)** — inner couch potato. Remember, mobility is overrated. Exercise can be dangerous. I mean,
- **[02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sTnbzWbKgvE&t=171s)** — you could slip and fall. It's much safer to stay inside your house. And studies have shown
- **[02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sTnbzWbKgvE&t=177s)** — that if you just fidget more while you're watching TV and eating that popcorn, you can
- **[03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sTnbzWbKgvE&t=181s)** — actually burn a few more calories per hour. But just make sure you always have plenty of
- **[03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sTnbzWbKgvE&t=186s)** — excuses. The weather, the holidays, your busy schedule. Blame something, anything, because
- **[03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sTnbzWbKgvE&t=191s)** — it's not your fault. Just cycle through your excuses and never admit that you have anything to
- **[03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sTnbzWbKgvE&t=196s)** — do with any of your health problems. You've just been dealt some bad genes. You should
- **[03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sTnbzWbKgvE&t=202s)** — have picked your parents a little bit more wisely. Step four. Always find a way to
- **[03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sTnbzWbKgvE&t=207s)** — sabotage yourself. When you start making headway and make some healthy changes or maybe you
- **[03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sTnbzWbKgvE&t=212s)** — start to lose some weight, reward yourself instantly with a donut, a nice glass of wine,
- **[03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sTnbzWbKgvE&t=218s)** — or a big bowl of ice cream. Step five. Stay inside. Avoid the outdoors at all costs.
- **[03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sTnbzWbKgvE&t=226s)** — Who needs sunshine, fresh air, and nature when you can stay indoors? In your own little bubble,
- **[03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sTnbzWbKgvE&t=231s)** — we do not want to let all that dangerous sun touch your skin. And if you do go outside,
- **[03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sTnbzWbKgvE&t=237s)** — lather your body with sun blocker. That way you can block all your vitamin D. I'm sorry,
- **[04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sTnbzWbKgvE&t=242s)** — I meant UV radiation. Stay indoors because if that nasty air pollution doesn't get you,
- **[04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sTnbzWbKgvE&t=247s)** — the sun will. Couch surfing and binge watching TV should be your next main hobbies. It's much
- **[04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sTnbzWbKgvE&t=253s)** — safer. Stay glued to that screen. And you know, any news about this EMF radiation coming off
- **[04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sTnbzWbKgvE&t=259s)** — your computer screen or your TV screen, it's just fake news. Very soon, the metaverse will
- **[04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sTnbzWbKgvE&t=264s)** — be here. Who needs a real world experience when you can live your entire life in a virtual
- **[04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sTnbzWbKgvE&t=270s)** — reality bubble? Step six. Eat eight meals a day. Now let's talk about your new anti-intermittent
- **[04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sTnbzWbKgvE&t=278s)** — fasting schedule. The eight meal a day strategy really works because you'll never feel hungry
- **[04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sTnbzWbKgvE&t=284s)** — ever again. In fact, you'll be grazing all day long like a friendly cow. And don't forget
- **[04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sTnbzWbKgvE&t=290s)** — to bring those snacks everywhere you go. After all, you never know when you might encounter
- **[04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sTnbzWbKgvE&t=295s)** — a snack emergency. Blood sugar crash? No problem. That's why we have our glucose pills
- **[05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sTnbzWbKgvE&t=301s)** — waiting for you. These will fix your hypoglycemia. Your doctor has got your back and they'll
- **[05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sTnbzWbKgvE&t=306s)** — manage those blood sugar spikes and crashes while you enjoy your never-ending feast. Step
- **[05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sTnbzWbKgvE&t=312s)** — seven. Realize all calories are exactly the same. And don't buy into this idea that certain
- **[05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sTnbzWbKgvE&t=320s)** — certain hormones. Eating a 500 calorie meal of delicious donuts is exactly the same
- **[05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sTnbzWbKgvE&t=326s)** — as eating a balanced whole food nutritionally dense 500 calorie meal. Remember, a calorie
- **[05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sTnbzWbKgvE&t=331s)** — is a calorie. This is science. Step eight. Late night snacking. Develop a late night
- **[05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sTnbzWbKgvE&t=338s)** — snacking habit and those high omega-6 fatty acid seed oil snacks. Hey, just go ahead
- **[05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sTnbzWbKgvE&t=345s)** — and devour that giant bowl of ice cream before bedtime and induce a sugar coma. I'm sorry,
- **[05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sTnbzWbKgvE&t=350s)** — I meant induce a good night's sleep. Step nine. Check with your doctor. Realize that
- **[05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sTnbzWbKgvE&t=357s)** — alternative care could be very dangerous. So always check with your doctor before
- **[06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sTnbzWbKgvE&t=362s)** — taking anything natural because they have the experience and training in nutrition.
- **[06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sTnbzWbKgvE&t=367s)** — They've done studies, you know. 60% of the time it works every time. But if in doubt,
- **[06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sTnbzWbKgvE&t=374s)** — ask Dr. Google. This is your go-to 100% unbiased source of true information. And don't worry,
- **[06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sTnbzWbKgvE&t=381s)** — if you have health and literacy, they will help you identify what true misinformation is as
- **[06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sTnbzWbKgvE&t=386s)** — well. Step 10. Sleep. Listen, you'll have plenty of time to sleep when you're dead.
- **[06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sTnbzWbKgvE&t=391s)** — Sleeping is overrated. This is why God invented coffee. Drink as much coffee as you
- **[06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sTnbzWbKgvE&t=397s)** — need to stay awake. Step 11. Embrace your inner pharmacy. Listen, health is about managing
- **[06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sTnbzWbKgvE&t=404s)** — your diseases. Why bother staying healthy when you can keep your symptoms suppressed
- **[06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sTnbzWbKgvE&t=408s)** — and your symptoms managed until someday when they find the cure? If one medication gives
- **[06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sTnbzWbKgvE&t=413s)** — you a side effect, don't worry, we can give you another medication that can treat that side
- **[06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sTnbzWbKgvE&t=418s)** — effect very easily. But don't worry, they wouldn't sell these drugs unless they were
- **[07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sTnbzWbKgvE&t=422s)** — safe and effective. At least most of the time. I think it's really important to choose your
- **[07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sTnbzWbKgvE&t=427s)** — side effect wisely. And lastly, step 12. Stay blind and unaware. Resist any change. Don't
- **[07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sTnbzWbKgvE&t=434s)** — seek knowledge about nutrition, exercise, or diet. Bad habits are a normal part of life.
- **[07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sTnbzWbKgvE&t=440s)** — Continue to believe that your health condition is genetic and there's nothing you can do about it.

- **[00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhL1mN0uBFw&t=0s)** — I was actually shocked to learn about these forever chemicals. I did a deep dive in this topic and I want to give you a summary of it.
- **[00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhL1mN0uBFw&t=7s)** — Another name for these are PFAS chemicals. And the reason they call them forever chemicals is they stay in the environment for thousands of years.
- **[00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhL1mN0uBFw&t=14s)** — They basically slowly poison us. 97% of Americans were tested positive for these PFAS chemicals.
- **[00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhL1mN0uBFw&t=21s)** — They're in our fat cells. They've been found also in breast milk and especially drinking water.
- **[00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhL1mN0uBFw&t=26s)** — These chemicals are definitely linked to cancer, hormone problems, especially the thyroid, liver damage, reproductive damage.
- **[00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhL1mN0uBFw&t=32s)** — However, despite how depressing this topic is, I have a really good solution. These PFAS chemicals are all over the place.
- **[00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhL1mN0uBFw&t=39s)** — You're exposed to these chemicals using Teflon cookware, food packaging. Firefighters are exposed to it from the foam that they spray.
- **[00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhL1mN0uBFw&t=47s)** — It's in a lot of canning goods, unfortunately. It's all over the place.
- **[00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhL1mN0uBFw&t=50s)** — These chemicals were first introduced into our environment in the early 50s or even late 40s.
- **[00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhL1mN0uBFw&t=56s)** — And of course, you would think there'd be some safety testing going on to allow these chemicals in our environment by either the EPA or the FDA.
- **[01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhL1mN0uBFw&t=63s)** — But it's not until recently that some of these governmental agencies are doing anything about it.
- **[01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhL1mN0uBFw&t=68s)** — But my first question was, why were some of these chemicals considered generally recognized as safe?
- **[01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhL1mN0uBFw&t=74s)** — Well, now I know that that's a loophole that a lot of manufacturer companies use to push their chemicals into the environment by doing their own safety studies and then considering it safe.
- **[01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhL1mN0uBFw&t=84s)** — I mean, even the testing methods that the FDA use right now, it's like they only identify for six compounds, yet there's over 600 different compounds.
- **[01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhL1mN0uBFw&t=93s)** — Of course, the EPA, the Environmental Protection Agency, only tests for a fraction of the chemicals compared to all of the chemicals that are out there.
- **[01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhL1mN0uBFw&t=102s)** — I mean, it wasn't even until the 2020 that the FDA began to phase out voluntary agreement with manufacturing companies to stop using these PFAS chemicals in food packaging.
- **[01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhL1mN0uBFw&t=114s)** — But they have yet to enforce these bans.
- **[01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhL1mN0uBFw&t=117s)** — But of course, they're going to go after the farmers with their raw milk. Apparently, that's more dangerous than these forever chemicals.
- **[02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhL1mN0uBFw&t=124s)** — So the two strategies that I'm going to recommend is to limit the exposure to these chemicals.
- **[02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhL1mN0uBFw&t=130s)** — And so the greatest exposure right now is from your water supply.
- **[02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhL1mN0uBFw&t=134s)** — So I want to talk a little bit about that.
- **[02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhL1mN0uBFw&t=136s)** — The second strategy, which I think is a really good strategy, would be to build up your own body's tolerance for these chemicals.
- **[02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhL1mN0uBFw&t=144s)** — But first, let's just talk about this water thing.
- **[02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhL1mN0uBFw&t=146s)** — There's been some great research by the environmental working group, EWG, on forever chemicals.
- **[02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhL1mN0uBFw&t=152s)** — And what they did is they evaluated 25 PFAS chemicals to see at what percentage these water filters were getting rid of these PFAS forever chemicals.
- **[02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhL1mN0uBFw&t=163s)** — And they tested quite a few, but there's only three filters that actually work by removing 100% of these chemicals.
- **[02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhL1mN0uBFw&t=169s)** — And those are the three that I'm going to recommend.
- **[02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhL1mN0uBFw&t=171s)** — So the first one is called the Travel Berkey Gravity.
- **[02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhL1mN0uBFw&t=175s)** — This one cost around $327.
- **[02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhL1mN0uBFw&t=177s)** — So it's a bit expensive.
- **[02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhL1mN0uBFw&t=179s)** — The next one is called Clearly Filtered.
- **[03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhL1mN0uBFw&t=181s)** — This is the second most expensive, which is $90.
- **[03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhL1mN0uBFw&t=184s)** — And the third one is called Zero Water at roughly about $19.
- **[03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhL1mN0uBFw&t=189s)** — Now, before you invest in anything, let's just take a look at this for a second, because I want you to know how long these water filters last.
- **[03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhL1mN0uBFw&t=196s)** — Let's take a look at the Zero Water filter for $19.
- **[03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhL1mN0uBFw&t=200s)** — The filters only last for 20 gallons.
- **[03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhL1mN0uBFw&t=202s)** — You'd have to buy like 37 filters for the whole year.
- **[03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhL1mN0uBFw&t=205s)** — So it's going to cost you $646 for the entire year.
- **[03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhL1mN0uBFw&t=209s)** — Let's talk about the next one.
- **[03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhL1mN0uBFw&t=210s)** — Clearly Filtered.
- **[03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhL1mN0uBFw&t=212s)** — OK, it's $90.
- **[03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhL1mN0uBFw&t=213s)** — Those filters last for 100 gallons.
- **[03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhL1mN0uBFw&t=215s)** — You're looking at buying about seven filters for the year at a cost of $436.
- **[03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhL1mN0uBFw&t=220s)** — A little bit cheaper than the Zero Water filter.
- **[03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhL1mN0uBFw&t=223s)** — Now, let's look at the most expensive filter, the Travel Berkey Gravity filter, which initially cost like $327.
- **[03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhL1mN0uBFw&t=231s)** — Well, guess how many gallons it filters?
- **[03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhL1mN0uBFw&t=233s)** — Six thousand.
- **[03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhL1mN0uBFw&t=235s)** — It's going to last more than eight years.
- **[03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhL1mN0uBFw&t=237s)** — If you do the math, you're only going to spend like $40 per year.
- **[04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhL1mN0uBFw&t=241s)** — Most of these chemicals come through your water supply.
- **[04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhL1mN0uBFw&t=244s)** — It might be a good idea to invest in something to minimize your exposure because they bio accumulate.
- **[04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhL1mN0uBFw&t=250s)** — These chemicals build up in the body, but they don't come out very easily.
- **[04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhL1mN0uBFw&t=253s)** — There's still ways to eliminate some of these toxins from the body.
- **[04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhL1mN0uBFw&t=258s)** — And that's what I want to talk about right now.
- **[04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhL1mN0uBFw&t=260s)** — Sweating or going into a sauna.
- **[04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhL1mN0uBFw&t=262s)** — You will be able to get rid of some of these chemicals through the sweating.
- **[04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhL1mN0uBFw&t=266s)** — Another interesting way to get rid of the chemicals is through a process called autophagy.
- **[04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhL1mN0uBFw&t=271s)** — Now, autophagy is a condition that you put your body into when you do intermittent fasting and prolonged fasting,
- **[04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhL1mN0uBFw&t=277s)** — where the body recycle old damaged things, as well as get rid of pathogens.
- **[04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhL1mN0uBFw&t=282s)** — It can also help get rid of chemicals and also strengthen your body because there's a lot of positive, great things that fasting will do to your cells.
- **[04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhL1mN0uBFw&t=290s)** — Another thing is infrared helps to detoxify your body as well.
- **[04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhL1mN0uBFw&t=295s)** — So you can get a lot of infrared being exposed to the sun in the morning and then before the sun sets,
- **[05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhL1mN0uBFw&t=300s)** — there's infrared saunas, there's infrared devices you can use.
- **[05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhL1mN0uBFw&t=304s)** — But infrared is one way to detoxify some of these chemicals.
- **[05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhL1mN0uBFw&t=308s)** — Also, spirulina and chlorella.
- **[05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhL1mN0uBFw&t=311s)** — They're like this algae that has properties to detoxify chemicals.
- **[05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhL1mN0uBFw&t=316s)** — And now let's talk about strengthening your body, your biochemistry.
- **[05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhL1mN0uBFw&t=320s)** — You naturally have all these amazing things in your body that help you get rid of poisons.
- **[05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhL1mN0uBFw&t=326s)** — They're called detoxification enzymes.
- **[05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhL1mN0uBFw&t=328s)** — And so strengthening your body's ability to detoxify is going to be very, very important.
- **[05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhL1mN0uBFw&t=333s)** — And so anything that has sulfur in it is going to help you.
- **[05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhL1mN0uBFw&t=337s)** — And that would be like eggs, for example, garlic and especially onion.
- **[05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhL1mN0uBFw&t=341s)** — But these sulfur based compounds will greatly help you detoxify.
- **[05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhL1mN0uBFw&t=345s)** — And you also have the cruciferous vegetables.
- **[05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhL1mN0uBFw&t=348s)** — Cabbage, broccoli, Brussels sprouts.
- **[05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhL1mN0uBFw&t=350s)** — Not only are high in sulfur, but they have many other antioxidants that can help the detoxification process.
- **[05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhL1mN0uBFw&t=356s)** — And of course, the amino acid that's going to be really important in strengthening your glutathione is glutamine.
- **[06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhL1mN0uBFw&t=363s)** — Well, take a while, guess what has the most glutamine.
- **[06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhL1mN0uBFw&t=365s)** — Red meat, the thing that they tell you to start avoiding.
- **[06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhL1mN0uBFw&t=369s)** — Glycine is also important and you can get that in collagen, which happens to be also in red meat.
- **[06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhL1mN0uBFw&t=374s)** — If you're consuming nose to tail, you're eating bone broth or beef collagen.
- **[06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhL1mN0uBFw&t=379s)** — So one of the meals that I normally eat a lot of, which happens to be a really good detox meal,
- **[06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhL1mN0uBFw&t=385s)** — would be I have some steak or some burger patty.
- **[06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhL1mN0uBFw&t=387s)** — And the cruciferous that I like the most is cabbage.
- **[06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhL1mN0uBFw&t=390s)** — And to take it one step further, we could ferment the cabbage.
- **[06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhL1mN0uBFw&t=393s)** — Why would we want to do that? Because probiotics also help eliminate these forever chemicals.
- **[06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhL1mN0uBFw&t=398s)** — But only if that sauerkraut is raw, because when you pasteurize it, you kill all the microbes.
- **[06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhL1mN0uBFw&t=403s)** — Now, if we have the difference between green cabbage and red cabbage,
- **[06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhL1mN0uBFw&t=407s)** — do the red cabbage because then we have some added antioxidants.
- **[06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhL1mN0uBFw&t=411s)** — We can start to avoid the exposure to these chemicals, but it's really, really hard to be in an environment that's toxic free.
- **[06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhL1mN0uBFw&t=418s)** — Why not beef up these biochemical pathways?
- **[07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhL1mN0uBFw&t=420s)** — And there's some really key nutrients to do that.
- **[07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhL1mN0uBFw&t=424s)** — And I'm going to list them right now.
- **[07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhL1mN0uBFw&t=425s)** — Selenium, iodine, copper. The trace minerals are really, really important.
- **[07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhL1mN0uBFw&t=429s)** — Where do these trace minerals come from?
- **[07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhL1mN0uBFw&t=430s)** — You can get them from seafood, shellfish, and you guessed it, grass fed red meat.
- **[07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhL1mN0uBFw&t=436s)** — Because these forever chemicals do affect the thyroid, you really want to make sure you have enough iodine and selenium.
- **[07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhL1mN0uBFw&t=442s)** — Selenium you can get from Brazil nuts, and you can also get it from shellfish and oysters.
- **[07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhL1mN0uBFw&t=446s)** — I just gave you a series of things you should start right now.
- **[07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhL1mN0uBFw&t=449s)** — But I wanted to put this on your radar just because, unfortunately, you're being slowly poisoned.
- **[07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhL1mN0uBFw&t=455s)** — Now you know what to do about it.
- **[07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhL1mN0uBFw&t=456s)** — Thanks for watching, and I will see you in the next video.

- **[00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PiO4QZ6ZAQw&t=0s)** — You know, some people are actually too tired to be able to sleep and rest.
- **[00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PiO4QZ6ZAQw&t=7s)** — No matter how exhausted they get, their body just does not allow them to get into the deep
- **[00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PiO4QZ6ZAQw&t=14s)** — delt wave sleep. Yet other people have way too much energy and they can't sleep because you
- **[00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PiO4QZ6ZAQw&t=20s)** — have too much adrenaline or nervous energy flowing through their bloodstream. So it takes
- **[00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PiO4QZ6ZAQw&t=25s)** — a healthy amount of energy in your energy factories called the mitochondria to be able to
- **[00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PiO4QZ6ZAQw&t=30s)** — have this really wonderful sleep. So today we're going to talk about three things that you can do
- **[00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PiO4QZ6ZAQw&t=36s)** — to improve not just sleeping but resting. There just happens to be a clock in your brain. It's
- **[00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PiO4QZ6ZAQw&t=55s)** — when to wake up. And so I'm going to give you some tips on how to get your clock to work better.
- **[01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PiO4QZ6ZAQw&t=61s)** — All right, let's first talk about energy. We're talking about the mitochondria. And this is in
- **[01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PiO4QZ6ZAQw&t=67s)** — relationship to healing or supporting the mitochondria in the brain. The organs that
- **[01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PiO4QZ6ZAQw&t=75s)** — have the most mitochondria are in the heart and your brain. So both of those organs need a
- **[01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PiO4QZ6ZAQw&t=83s)** — lot of oxygen. And when they don't get oxygen, when they're dysfunctional, you have problems.
- **[01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PiO4QZ6ZAQw&t=92s)** — So there are several things you can do to increase oxygen into the mitochondria, into the
- **[01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PiO4QZ6ZAQw&t=97s)** — brain to help you really sleep and go to sleep quickly. The first one is the obvious one,
- **[01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PiO4QZ6ZAQw&t=105s)** — exercise. So when you exercise you get more oxygen. And so I like to do two types of
- **[01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PiO4QZ6ZAQw&t=111s)** — mainly every day. I do a higher intense exercise and I do weight training. And with the higher
- **[01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PiO4QZ6ZAQw&t=116s)** — intensity exercise, I do really short durations. But I always do long walks or hiking. I go up
- **[02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PiO4QZ6ZAQw&t=125s)** — hills and things like that. So I'm always doing that, which is a low intensity walking. And
- **[02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PiO4QZ6ZAQw&t=130s)** — that's great for sleeping. Okay, so exercise is the top of the list. Number two, B1.
- **[02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PiO4QZ6ZAQw&t=136s)** — Another name for a B1 or thiamine deficiency is called pseudo hypoxia. That's right, hypoxia.
- **[02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PiO4QZ6ZAQw&t=144s)** — That is a lack of oxygen. And so this can occur in the brain at the very heart of the
- **[02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PiO4QZ6ZAQw&t=151s)** — autonomic nervous system, which is in the brainstem, which has everything to do with your
- **[02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PiO4QZ6ZAQw&t=156s)** — breathing. Okay. And so when you're deficient in B1, your breathing is going to suffer and
- **[02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PiO4QZ6ZAQw&t=162s)** — your oxygen is going to suffer and you're going to trigger what's called the stress reflex.
- **[02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PiO4QZ6ZAQw&t=167s)** — And try to sleep when you're stressed. You can't. So it's all about increasing the amount of O2
- **[02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PiO4QZ6ZAQw&t=172s)** — in the mitochondria. And B1 before bed is a great way to do that. The next thing is just
- **[03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PiO4QZ6ZAQw&t=180s)** — to open your windows if you can at night when you're sleeping. That is going to give you more
- **[03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PiO4QZ6ZAQw&t=184s)** — oxygen than trying to recirculate some of this kind of stale air that's in your room.
- **[03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PiO4QZ6ZAQw&t=191s)** — Having plants in your room also will increase the oxygen because they give off oxygen and they take
- **[03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PiO4QZ6ZAQw&t=198s)** — in CO2. Another thing that increases the oxygen is coenzyme Q10. And then another great remedy
- **[03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PiO4QZ6ZAQw&t=205s)** — is called methylene blue. This was the first drug that medicine ever introduced in
- **[03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PiO4QZ6ZAQw&t=212s)** — their healthcare system. Methylene blue. It's been around since the 1800s. Methylene blue
- **[03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PiO4QZ6ZAQw&t=217s)** — will make your urine green. Because the blue mixes with the yellow and then it turns out green.
- **[03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PiO4QZ6ZAQw&t=225s)** — But there's a lot of interesting positive things when you take it in small or diluted amounts.
- **[03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PiO4QZ6ZAQw&t=232s)** — And I'm going to put the link down below on that video so you can learn more about it.
- **[03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PiO4QZ6ZAQw&t=237s)** — But it can greatly increase oxygen in your brain and other parts of your body.
- **[04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PiO4QZ6ZAQw&t=245s)** — All right, so now let's talk about that circadian rhythm controlled by the supra-chiasmatic
- **[04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PiO4QZ6ZAQw&t=250s)** — nucleus. How do you get that to work correctly? It's controlled by light in dark cycles.
- **[04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PiO4QZ6ZAQw&t=260s)** — Okay, so when you are in your house at night with the lights on all the way up until the
- **[04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PiO4QZ6ZAQw&t=267s)** — time you go to bed, that is going to be very, very bad because it's going to work against that
- **[04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PiO4QZ6ZAQw&t=272s)** — rhythm. The ideal situation is to work with this light and dark cycle, with this rhythm,
- **[04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PiO4QZ6ZAQw&t=280s)** — with nature. And that means that you would want to start to turn down the lights at sunset.
- **[04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PiO4QZ6ZAQw&t=288s)** — Okay, now that's really difficult in the winter, isn't it? When it gets dark out at 4 30.
- **[04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PiO4QZ6ZAQw&t=294s)** — But typically in the summertime it starts to get dark at 9 o'clock. So if you were to
- **[04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PiO4QZ6ZAQw&t=298s)** — be in your house and start to use dim lights, that would be a really good thing. So your body
- **[05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PiO4QZ6ZAQw&t=305s)** — is starting to get used to this decrease in light. And you can even replace certain lights
- **[05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PiO4QZ6ZAQw&t=312s)** — in your house with incandescent lights, which give off more infrared, which is very,
- **[05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PiO4QZ6ZAQw&t=318s)** — very good for your sleep cycle. So infrared, you can also avoid blue lights like your computer.
- **[05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PiO4QZ6ZAQw&t=324s)** — Now that's hard for some people, but not for me because I'm not on my computer at night.
- **[05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PiO4QZ6ZAQw&t=328s)** — I'm in the computer in the morning. But the blue light that's emanating from your electrical
- **[05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PiO4QZ6ZAQw&t=334s)** — devices definitely can worsen your melatonin. Okay, the thing that helps you sleep at night.
- **[05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PiO4QZ6ZAQw&t=342s)** — You can get some red lights. You can start dimming your lights, get some incandescent
- **[05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PiO4QZ6ZAQw&t=347s)** — lights and not be around the LEDs. If you had the light from your fireplace or even a campfire
- **[05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PiO4QZ6ZAQw&t=356s)** — where you have that yellow golden light that's giving off a lot of infrared and very low blue
- **[06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PiO4QZ6ZAQw&t=362s)** — light, if any, that's very therapeutic for sleeping. Or let's say you get the blue light,
- **[06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PiO4QZ6ZAQw&t=369s)** — blocker glasses and you can filter out that blue light. That's beneficial. But the point
- **[06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PiO4QZ6ZAQw&t=374s)** — is that if you're going to start watching TV, turn off the lights in the room. Okay,
- **[06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PiO4QZ6ZAQw&t=379s)** — so it's really dark so you have just smaller amounts of light. That is going to be very,
- **[06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PiO4QZ6ZAQw&t=384s)** — very therapeutic for your circadian rhythms. And I even wear an eye mask when I go to sleep
- **[06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PiO4QZ6ZAQw&t=389s)** — because I have to have it pitch black. My wife can sleep if the lights are on. I can't.
- **[06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PiO4QZ6ZAQw&t=396s)** — Your timing of eating, okay, you're going to find that if you don't eat too late,
- **[06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PiO4QZ6ZAQw&t=401s)** — you're going to sleep better. I mean, if you can really do this, if you let's say you ate one meal
- **[06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PiO4QZ6ZAQw&t=407s)** — a day, and that last meal was right around three o'clock, that would be the ideal situation
- **[06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PiO4QZ6ZAQw&t=412s)** — to eat to improve your circadian rhythms. But it might interfere with your social life
- **[06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PiO4QZ6ZAQw&t=417s)** — because a lot of people don't eat at that time. So you might be eating by yourself. Or if
- **[07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PiO4QZ6ZAQw&t=424s)** — you're doing two meals a day, maybe you do the first meal in the morning and the second
- **[07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PiO4QZ6ZAQw&t=427s)** — meal at three, right? That would be ideally the situation. If you can't do that, then do
- **[07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PiO4QZ6ZAQw&t=434s)** — something that's related to that and just avoid eating five hours before you go to bed.
- **[07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PiO4QZ6ZAQw&t=441s)** — So if you go to bed at 10, consume your food at five. Okay, that will at least give you
- **[07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PiO4QZ6ZAQw&t=448s)** — five hours for your system to kind of get settled in to start aligning with their circadian
- **[07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PiO4QZ6ZAQw&t=455s)** — wave. I mean, just do an experiment. Eat a very heavy meal before you go to bed and then see how
- **[07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PiO4QZ6ZAQw&t=459s)** — you sleep. It just doesn't work. So I just want you to experiment with it and see if it doesn't
- **[07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PiO4QZ6ZAQw&t=464s)** — help you. If you're traveling, okay, even in the same time zone, that is going to interfere
- **[07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PiO4QZ6ZAQw&t=471s)** — with this clock in your brain and the GPS that's in your brain that can identify where your
- **[07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PiO4QZ6ZAQw&t=478s)** — location is in space. And so a good way to handle jet lag when you travel is to take
- **[08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PiO4QZ6ZAQw&t=486s)** — a lot more vitamin D3. Apparently that is the key nutrient that helps reset those mechanisms
- **[08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PiO4QZ6ZAQw&t=494s)** — to really help get you on track a lot faster. I do this all the time. So I might take like
- **[08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PiO4QZ6ZAQw&t=499s)** — say 30, 40, 50,000 I use of vitamin D if I'm traveling to a different country. Now what time
- **[08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PiO4QZ6ZAQw&t=507s)** — should you go to bed? Typically the best time to go to bed is like 10 o'clock. I tend to go to
- **[08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PiO4QZ6ZAQw&t=514s)** — bed between 930 and 945. But some people can't do that. There's too much going on.
- **[08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PiO4QZ6ZAQw&t=521s)** — You definitely want to avoid going to bed before 12. Because there's definitely a situation
- **[08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PiO4QZ6ZAQw&t=528s)** — if you go past 12, all of a sudden the body will start waking up and you miss that
- **[08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PiO4QZ6ZAQw&t=532s)** — you have to kind of wait like 90 minutes before your body's tired. And that's happened to me
- **[08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PiO4QZ6ZAQw&t=537s)** — several times where I'm extremely tired at 930. Now push through it and then now I'm awake. Now
- **[09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PiO4QZ6ZAQw&t=544s)** — I have to wait for a period of time until I'm tired again. So you want to work with your
- **[09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PiO4QZ6ZAQw&t=549s)** — body's waves. And you want to catch the wave so you can go right into the deep sleep.
- **[09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PiO4QZ6ZAQw&t=554s)** — You know experiment what works for you. But 10 o'clock on average would be the best for most
- **[09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PiO4QZ6ZAQw&t=559s)** — I do a little bit earlier. And then I will sleep for seven hours. Sometimes seven and a half hours.
- **[09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PiO4QZ6ZAQw&t=566s)** — Some people need eight hours. But anywhere between seven and eight hours is the best
- **[09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PiO4QZ6ZAQw&t=570s)** — situation. If you get up in the middle of night, let's say at two-ish or even one,
- **[09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PiO4QZ6ZAQw&t=576s)** — that usually means that your adrenals are stressed out and you need to support the
- **[09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PiO4QZ6ZAQw&t=580s)** — adrenals with certain types of adaptogens and whole desiccated adrenal supplements. And
- **[09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PiO4QZ6ZAQw&t=587s)** — if you're getting up urinating frequently that means that you still have to deal with insulin
- **[09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PiO4QZ6ZAQw&t=592s)** — resistance. I have videos on that. If a muscle cramp wakes you up you may need more magnesium,
- **[09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PiO4QZ6ZAQw&t=599s)** — potassium, or calcium. Now I think sleep is so important for so many things. And if you
- **[10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PiO4QZ6ZAQw&t=606s)** — haven't seen my more comprehensive video on sleep, you should check that out. And I put it up right here.

- **[00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_-7966jgAQ&t=0s)** — Today you are going to learn an instant plantar fasciitis fix. When I was in practice, I would
- **[00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_-7966jgAQ&t=4s)** — teach people how to do this. And within seconds, the pain goes away. There are three things
- **[00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_-7966jgAQ&t=8s)** — to do. The first one will get rid of the pain instantly. The second and the third
- **[00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_-7966jgAQ&t=11s)** — thing are more permanent fixes for your plantar fasciitis so it doesn't come back.
- **[00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_-7966jgAQ&t=17s)** — And you are definitely not going to have to use things like this to stand down
- **[00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_-7966jgAQ&t=20s)** — with your arch, to help form the arch. That doesn't work. If your bottom of your
- **[00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_-7966jgAQ&t=24s)** — foot is inflamed, you don't want to stretch it. The worst thing you can do is to stretch
- **[00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_-7966jgAQ&t=29s)** — the calf or massage the bottom of the foot. That will never work. That makes it worse
- **[00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_-7966jgAQ&t=34s)** — because you are going to be tearing things. This is what you are going to do. And I want
- **[00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_-7966jgAQ&t=36s)** — you to do this right now while you are watching this video. First thing is to rate on a
- **[00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_-7966jgAQ&t=40s)** — scale from 0 to 10 how bad your pain is. 10 being very severe, 0 being no pain
- **[00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_-7966jgAQ&t=45s)** — at all. And I am talking when you put pressure on it. Now that you have that
- **[00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_-7966jgAQ&t=48s)** — number, we are going to re-rate it after we do this very simple technique. The first
- **[00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_-7966jgAQ&t=51s)** — step is to sit down somewhere where you can cross your leg and you are going to
- **[00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_-7966jgAQ&t=56s)** — bend them downward. We are not stretching the calf. We are stretching the opposite
- **[01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_-7966jgAQ&t=62s)** — muscles on the front part of your leg. You can do the other side. We are stretching
- **[01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_-7966jgAQ&t=67s)** — down this way. I mean you can do it up to 20 times. This is difficult for you.
- **[01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_-7966jgAQ&t=71s)** — You could just go ahead and get on your couch or your bed and sit and let your
- **[01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_-7966jgAQ&t=77s)** — butt sit on the heels and press down. If you can do this. If you can't, you
- **[01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_-7966jgAQ&t=81s)** — can put a pillow between your butt and your legs. But you want to stretch this.
- **[01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_-7966jgAQ&t=85s)** — And do it as much as you can tolerate. It should not hurt. You are stretching the
- **[01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_-7966jgAQ&t=89s)** — opposite muscle and fascia. And that is sending a signal to the bottom part of
- **[01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_-7966jgAQ&t=93s)** — the foot telling the nerve signals to turn off. Now what I want you to do is
- **[01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_-7966jgAQ&t=98s)** — re-rate the pain in your foot. You can go ahead and stand on it. That is
- **[01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_-7966jgAQ&t=101s)** — step number one. The second thing I am going to recommend is go on the
- **[01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_-7966jgAQ&t=104s)** — low carb diet where you are doing intermittent fasting. Two meals, no snacks.
- **[01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_-7966jgAQ&t=110s)** — I have done a million videos on this. I will put one down below because the
- **[01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_-7966jgAQ&t=114s)** — inflammation occurs when your carbs are too high. Now let's go to the big one,
- **[01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_-7966jgAQ&t=117s)** — number three. And the first thing to know about plantar fasciitis is that the
- **[02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_-7966jgAQ&t=122s)** — root cause for this is too much calcium that is not really doing the right
- **[02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_-7966jgAQ&t=126s)** — thing. How do we deal with excess calcium? Number one, magnesium.
- **[02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_-7966jgAQ&t=131s)** — Magnesium is the master controller over calcium in the body. One of the
- **[02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_-7966jgAQ&t=136s)** — first places a magnesium deficiency will show up is in your feet. Either as a
- **[02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_-7966jgAQ&t=144s)** — Why does it show up in the foot first? It is the most peripheral part of your body.
- **[02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_-7966jgAQ&t=149s)** — A person will tend to show up the deficiencies in the areas of the
- **[02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_-7966jgAQ&t=152s)** — tissue which are the farthest from the heart because it is the last place
- **[02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_-7966jgAQ&t=156s)** — to get nutrition. Calcium has everything to do with contracting a muscle.
- **[02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_-7966jgAQ&t=161s)** — When we did that stretch, what were we doing? We were trying to shorten
- **[02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_-7966jgAQ&t=165s)** — some of the muscles and ligaments underneath the foot because they are
- **[02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_-7966jgAQ&t=168s)** — too contracted. We are basically bypassing your body and getting it to
- **[02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_-7966jgAQ&t=172s)** — relax at least temporarily. Magnesium deficiency is extremely common.
- **[02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_-7966jgAQ&t=177s)** — One percent of all of your magnesium is inside the blood. If you test the
- **[03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_-7966jgAQ&t=180s)** — blood, you are not going to really know what is going on deeper in the cells.
- **[03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_-7966jgAQ&t=184s)** — The type of magnesium I would recommend is magnesium glycinate because it gets
- **[03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_-7966jgAQ&t=187s)** — absorbed 80% versus magnesium oxide which you will only absorb 3-4%
- **[03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_-7966jgAQ&t=193s)** — and it can give you diarrhea. You need to take at least 400 milligrams of
- **[03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_-7966jgAQ&t=198s)** — magnesium glycinate every single day. The other piece of the puzzle is
- **[03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_-7966jgAQ&t=202s)** — It helps with all sorts of different issues related to calcium.
- **[03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_-7966jgAQ&t=206s)** — Vitamin D hands down is the most potent anti-inflammatory that you can
- **[03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_-7966jgAQ&t=210s)** — take and it doesn't have any side effects. You are going to need to take
- **[03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_-7966jgAQ&t=213s)** — 20,000 IUs of vitamin D3 every single day. Realize that 20,000 IUs
- **[03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_-7966jgAQ&t=219s)** — of vitamin D3 is equivalent to being out in the summer sun for about
- **[03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_-7966jgAQ&t=223s)** — 40 minutes. It is not a tremendous amount but it is enough to give your
- **[03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_-7966jgAQ&t=226s)** — body the anti-inflammatory effect. Vitamin D has a function of
- **[03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_-7966jgAQ&t=229s)** — remodeling tissue. It can help rebuild tissue back to the normal form
- **[03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_-7966jgAQ&t=235s)** — but only if you take enough. And on top of all that, magnesium won't
- **[04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_-7966jgAQ&t=240s)** — work without vitamin D. And vitamin D won't work without magnesium.
- **[04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_-7966jgAQ&t=245s)** — If you take too much of one of them without the other, it creates
- **[04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_-7966jgAQ&t=249s)** — a deficiency of the other. Taking a lot of vitamin D without magnesium,
- **[04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_-7966jgAQ&t=253s)** — you will end up with a magnesium deficiency. The other thing about
- **[04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_-7966jgAQ&t=261s)** — 2700 genes. This goes way beyond just plantar fasciitis. If you are
- **[04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_-7966jgAQ&t=265s)** — deficient in vitamin D, you are going to notice it in a lot of other
- **[04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_-7966jgAQ&t=267s)** — places too. The lower back, your immune system, but also you are
- **[04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_-7966jgAQ&t=271s)** — going to feel achiness in your muscles and achiness in the
- **[04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_-7966jgAQ&t=275s)** — bottom of your foot. Try to make sure that you have enough magnesium
- **[04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_-7966jgAQ&t=278s)** — so you can actually create more relaxation versus the contraction of
- **[04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_-7966jgAQ&t=282s)** — the bottom of your foot. When you get a vitamin D, make sure it
- **[04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_-7966jgAQ&t=285s)** — comes with K2. Vitamin K2 also helps remove calcium from the
- **[04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_-7966jgAQ&t=290s)** — soft tissues. It's another piece of the puzzle that you need to
- **[04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_-7966jgAQ&t=292s)** — know about, but you can get a vitamin D that already comes with
- **[04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_-7966jgAQ&t=295s)** — K2. You get the vitamin D3 with K2 and the magnesium. Those
- **[04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_-7966jgAQ&t=299s)** — together will be dynamite in helping you get rid of this pain
- **[05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_-7966jgAQ&t=302s)** — long term. Several years ago, I did this video and I want to
- **[05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_-7966jgAQ&t=305s)** — read you just a few of the comments after people have tried
- **[05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_-7966jgAQ&t=311s)** — this technique. Well, I just went from having left foot paint
- **[05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_-7966jgAQ&t=314s)** — over a month. I'm a nurse and I did these stretches and my pain
- **[05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_-7966jgAQ&t=318s)** — went from a six to a zero. Insane. This is a miracle. Next
- **[05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_-7966jgAQ&t=323s)** — one. Eight months of limping around, cortisone injections,
- **[05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_-7966jgAQ&t=326s)** — orthotics, walking boot, ice, stretching the wrong way, night
- **[05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_-7966jgAQ&t=330s)** — brace, even a handicapped parking place. After the first
- **[05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_-7966jgAQ&t=334s)** — stretch, I went from a nine to a three. You are a godsend.
- **[05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_-7966jgAQ&t=337s)** — Thank you. Check this one out. I feel like crying. I've been
- **[05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_-7966jgAQ&t=340s)** — in so much pain, just getting worse doing other
- **[05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_-7966jgAQ&t=343s)** — stretching exercises. I feel like a new woman. Thank you.
- **[05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_-7966jgAQ&t=346s)** — Check this out. I was probably rolling my eyes when I
- **[05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_-7966jgAQ&t=349s)** — initially began the exercise. I did not believe a word until
- **[05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_-7966jgAQ&t=352s)** — I realized I wasn't in pain. I cautiously stood up, put a
- **[05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_-7966jgAQ&t=356s)** — little pressure on my right foot. I'll say 80% reduction
- **[05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_-7966jgAQ&t=359s)** — in pain after the first set of exercises. You have my
- **[06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_-7966jgAQ&t=363s)** — heartfelt gratitude. I will be sharing your videos so
- **[06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_-7966jgAQ&t=366s)** — others can get the same relief as well. Thank you.
- **[06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_-7966jgAQ&t=368s)** — Check out this last one. I've been in pain for two
- **[06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_-7966jgAQ&t=371s)** — years. I went to PT, foot doctor, chiropractor, invested
- **[06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_-7966jgAQ&t=374s)** — in shoes with arches, and you gave me better advice than
- **[06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_-7966jgAQ&t=378s)** — all of them combined. My husband and I did your
- **[06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_-7966jgAQ&t=381s)** — stretches and were in utter shock amazement. We were both
- **[06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_-7966jgAQ&t=384s)** — at a nine for pain and now it's nothing. I wish I
- **[06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_-7966jgAQ&t=388s)** — found you a long ago. You are a blessing from God. And
- **[06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_-7966jgAQ&t=391s)** — I've watched many other videos of yours and learning a
- **[06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_-7966jgAQ&t=394s)** — lot. I love sugar, but you taught me it's a demon. Love
- **[06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_-7966jgAQ&t=398s)** — you, Dr. Berg. You saved me in more and I can't read the
- **[06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_-7966jgAQ&t=401s)** — rest of the comment. Amazing. Do these stretches
- **[06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_-7966jgAQ&t=405s)** — several times a day, every day, until the pain is gone.
- **[06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_-7966jgAQ&t=407s)** — And of course, the vitamin D and the magnesium and the
- **[06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_-7966jgAQ&t=410s)** — K2 will greatly take you to the next level, especially
- **[06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_-7966jgAQ&t=412s)** — if you do the low carb diet with intermittent fasting.
- **[06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_-7966jgAQ&t=415s)** — Please comment below and tell me how it worked for you.

## Video 39: Might Want to Think Twice Before Eating Oatmeal

*Click any timestamp to jump to that moment in the video*

- **[00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Faup23zVDJU&t=0s)** — So the topic of today is oatmeal. And I used to love oatmeal. I used to have it every single day
- **[00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Faup23zVDJU&t=7s)** — as a breakfast. And I was told that it was healthy. And so today I want to share three things that
- **[00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Faup23zVDJU&t=15s)** — you probably have never heard before relating to oatmeal. And the reason I'm bringing this up is
- **[00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Faup23zVDJU&t=20s)** — because if you're consuming oatmeal for health reasons, you may change your mind after watching
- **[00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Faup23zVDJU&t=26s)** — this video. Now of course I'm not telling you not to consume oatmeal. I just want to give you some
- **[00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Faup23zVDJU&t=31s)** — additional information to think with that is not necessarily easy to find when you type oatmeal
- **[00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Faup23zVDJU&t=38s)** — on the internet. And I'm not going to even cover what you probably already know.
- **[00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Faup23zVDJU&t=42s)** — The sugary type of oatmeal in these little packets. This instant oatmeal, tons of sugar.
- **[00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Faup23zVDJU&t=47s)** — You know you already know that's really bad. I want to talk about the oatmeal that's actually
- **[00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Faup23zVDJU&t=51s)** — But it's interesting even in the packets of instant oatmeal that has tons of sugar,
- **[00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Faup23zVDJU&t=58s)** — apparently you could still have a little claim there that says that it's heart healthy.
- **[01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Faup23zVDJU&t=62s)** — I mean you'll see articles out there that will say that oatmeal is one of the
- **[01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Faup23zVDJU&t=66s)** — healthiest foods that you can possibly eat. It's considered a superfood. It will lower your
- **[01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Faup23zVDJU&t=71s)** — cholesterol. It will help your diabetes and blood sugars. It will make your heart healthy.
- **[01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Faup23zVDJU&t=77s)** — So the first thing I want to dive into, I'm going to put a bunch of studies down below so
- **[01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Faup23zVDJU&t=80s)** — you can verify what I'm saying is true, is some studies done on oatmeal in relationship to
- **[01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Faup23zVDJU&t=88s)** — blood sugars and insulin as well as cholesterol. Now when you read these studies it does
- **[01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Faup23zVDJU&t=94s)** — definitely say that there is a significant improvement in cholesterol as well as blood
- **[01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Faup23zVDJU&t=101s)** — sugars. Okay both. And that's pretty exciting. I mean like wow because if something is
- **[01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Faup23zVDJU&t=105s)** — cholesterol friendly or it's blood sugar friendly then you know sign me up. But if you actually
- **[01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Faup23zVDJU&t=110s)** — read the studies it will say there's a significant decrease in cholesterol and blood glucose
- **[01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Faup23zVDJU&t=116s)** — compared to the control. Now what does this mean compared to a control? What is that all
- **[02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Faup23zVDJU&t=124s)** — about? Well you're comparing it to something else right? And that comparison is white bread.
- **[02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Faup23zVDJU&t=130s)** — That's right, white bread. So if you compare anything to white bread it's going to be better
- **[02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Faup23zVDJU&t=137s)** — in a significant way. So let's say for example you eat some white bread okay and let's say
- **[02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Faup23zVDJU&t=143s)** — it spikes your blood sugars by 10 points. And then when you eat the oats it only spikes
- **[02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Faup23zVDJU&t=151s)** — your blood sugars by five points. And then we can say in the study there's a significant
- **[02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Faup23zVDJU&t=155s)** — difference. There's a much less like 50% less spike in blood sugars than the controls. But
- **[02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Faup23zVDJU&t=163s)** — that 50% improvement is not just you know adding this to your diet and seeing an improvement
- **[02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Faup23zVDJU&t=168s)** — in blood sugars. It's compared to something else. And then when you read on in the study
- **[02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Faup23zVDJU&t=172s)** — it says the improvement in blood sugars only occurred right after the meal okay. It didn't
- **[02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Faup23zVDJU&t=178s)** — occur later on probably because there's a nice spike of blood glucose when you eat white bread.
- **[03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Faup23zVDJU&t=185s)** — So that was one point. The other thing that they mentioned in the studies is that part of the
- **[03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Faup23zVDJU&t=189s)** — study was just consuming three grams of beta-glucan. Not consuming oatmeal but just that
- **[03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Faup23zVDJU&t=196s)** — compound and that created a lowering of cholesterol. And so then by inference you know
- **[03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Faup23zVDJU&t=200s)** — we can just say well there's beta-glucan in oats and just by deductive reasoning it then
- **[03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Faup23zVDJU&t=205s)** — must create the same effect. But that's a little confusing because that's an isolated
- **[03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Faup23zVDJU&t=210s)** — compound versus eating it as a whole grain. And then there's other studies that 29 participants
- **[03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Faup23zVDJU&t=216s)** — enrolled in the study. They all had diabetes and they did not see any change with blood
- **[03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Faup23zVDJU&t=222s)** — glucose levels between the two. So when we talk about the benefit there's only certain
- **[03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Faup23zVDJU&t=227s)** — studies are talking about. And so when they quote it's heart healthy they're kind of
- **[03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Faup23zVDJU&t=232s)** — cherry picking certain parts of studies and not giving you the full understanding of what it
- **[03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Faup23zVDJU&t=238s)** — is going to do to your cholesterol levels or blood sugars. In fact the best thing I think
- **[04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Faup23zVDJU&t=243s)** — you should do is just start testing your blood sugars when you consume it and then
- **[04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Faup23zVDJU&t=246s)** — not consume it and then you'll know for yourself. But also I could not find any of
- **[04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Faup23zVDJU&t=251s)** — these studies involving the instant oatmeal with all the added sugar. Okay somehow those
- **[04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Faup23zVDJU&t=256s)** — studies are really hard to find in relationship to them improving your blood glucose levels
- **[04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Faup23zVDJU&t=262s)** — insulin levels or cholesterol levels. The next topic is gluten free right because we all know
- **[04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Faup23zVDJU&t=268s)** — that oats are gluten free. Well apparently they do have a type of gluten. It's called avanin.
- **[04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Faup23zVDJU&t=277s)** — Okay and this protein has been known to increase cytokines which are like an inflammatory
- **[04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Faup23zVDJU&t=284s)** — response in your body. But here's the catch 22 it's delayed you may not feel any symptoms
- **[04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Faup23zVDJU&t=293s)** — for days later so it's going to be very hard to make the connection between
- **[04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Faup23zVDJU&t=297s)** — the two. But if you have irritable bowel syndrome or inflammation or celiac you may find
- **[05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Faup23zVDJU&t=306s)** — that eating oats can worsen the situation. And you have to realize that these glutens,
- **[05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Faup23zVDJU&t=312s)** — which is just a category of a lot of different types of proteins, is like one of the primary
- **[05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Faup23zVDJU&t=318s)** — triggers for autoimmune diseases especially Hashimoto's which is a thyroid problem.
- **[05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Faup23zVDJU&t=325s)** — Number three, wheat killer called glyphosate. It's interesting that the FDA when they did
- **[05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Faup23zVDJU&t=331s)** — the reports for studies on different foods they kind of omitted oats for some reason. But we
- **[05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Faup23zVDJU&t=337s)** — have to worry about that because Monsanto did their own studies and that was the creator of
- **[05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Faup23zVDJU&t=342s)** — glyphosate and they said that it's completely safe so we don't really have to worry about that.
- **[05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Faup23zVDJU&t=348s)** — But of course the World Health Organization did say that glyphosate is a carcinogen and there
- **[05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Faup23zVDJU&t=354s)** — was a lawsuit that was won in court by someone being exposed to glyphosate and winning
- **[06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Faup23zVDJU&t=361s)** — millions of dollars because they developed cancer. And the type of cancer apparently increases the
- **[06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Faup23zVDJU&t=366s)** — risk for is called non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. But another organization called EWG, which I'll put a
- **[06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Faup23zVDJU&t=373s)** — link down below, when they found traces of glyphosate, wheat killer, in over 95% of samples
- **[06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Faup23zVDJU&t=380s)** — of oat products. And it's not that this oat is genetically modified. They use glyphosate
- **[06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Faup23zVDJU&t=388s)** — as a pre-harvest drying agent because it can kill the plant really quick and dry it up.
- **[06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Faup23zVDJU&t=396s)** — And that's what they use not only in oats but in wheat. I mean this kind of goes beyond the
- **[06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Faup23zVDJU&t=402s)** — genetically modified foods like in the corn, the soy, canola, that type of thing. So anyway,
- **[06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Faup23zVDJU&t=408s)** — if you do have oats, of course, you know, steel cut would be much better than the the
- **[06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Faup23zVDJU&t=415s)** — instant oats. And if you're going to eat it, make sure it's organic, okay? Unless you want
- **[07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Faup23zVDJU&t=420s)** — some wheat killer in there. But you may also want to try something. You might want to just
- **[07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Faup23zVDJU&t=424s)** — skip your breakfast altogether and do intermittent fasting. You'll probably be shocked to find out
- **[07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Faup23zVDJU&t=429s)** — how good you actually feel by not doing a breakfast in general. But that being said,
- **[07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Faup23zVDJU&t=434s)** — if you want to do a breakfast, I think eggs would be a much better choice. Now, since we're
- **[07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Faup23zVDJU&t=438s)** — on the topic of breakfast, if you have not seen my video on how to transition out of
- **[07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Faup23zVDJU&t=445s)** — doing a breakfast and the benefits, I put that video up right here. Check it out.

- **[00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0-F3nhHS-Q&t=0s)** — My number one best health hack or tip that ive ever done. I'm going to give you 11 tips.
- **[00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0-F3nhHS-Q&t=6s)** — The last one I think is the most valuable. They don't cost anything and they work within seconds.
- **[00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0-F3nhHS-Q&t=11s)** — You know how much I don't like fluff. So let's dive right in with number one.
- **[00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0-F3nhHS-Q&t=15s)** — It's a brain fog eraser because it works really fast. The best way to handle brain fog,
- **[00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0-F3nhHS-Q&t=20s)** — hands down, is consuming high quality protein. Red meat could be a hamburger. Nutrient dense
- **[00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0-F3nhHS-Q&t=27s)** — meat will work. In fact, any animal protein will work, but it works better with the higher quality
- **[00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0-F3nhHS-Q&t=32s)** — protein. Typically brain fog comes from a hypoglycemic situation where your blood sugar
- **[00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0-F3nhHS-Q&t=37s)** — is low because you ate some carbohydrate previously and then today you have brain fog.
- **[00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0-F3nhHS-Q&t=43s)** — Taking more vitamins is not going to help. You can consume high quality protein and within
- **[00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0-F3nhHS-Q&t=48s)** — maybe a minute your brain is feeling good. Let's go to number two. Increase something
- **[00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0-F3nhHS-Q&t=53s)** — called CO2. When you're stressed out, your breathing is going to be off. You're hyperventilating
- **[00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0-F3nhHS-Q&t=58s)** — and you're getting a lot of oxygen. What allows oxygen to go deep into the cells to be utilized
- **[01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0-F3nhHS-Q&t=64s)** — in the red blood cell is CO2. This is why someone in a panic attack will instantly calm
- **[01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0-F3nhHS-Q&t=70s)** — down because they're actually getting more oxygen. Anytime you're in a state of panic,
- **[01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0-F3nhHS-Q&t=75s)** — stress, especially anxiety, start breathing through your nose to restrict the oxygen.
- **[01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0-F3nhHS-Q&t=80s)** — We're going to increase the ratio, add more CO2 to oxygen, and now that oxygen is going to go
- **[01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0-F3nhHS-Q&t=85s)** — in there, it's going to start to pull you out of this panic attack. It's so simple.
- **[01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0-F3nhHS-Q&t=89s)** — You should know about it and it can also help you go to sleep very quickly if you're
- **[01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0-F3nhHS-Q&t=93s)** — stressed out. Number three is take your hands, okay, both fingers like this, and you press
- **[01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0-F3nhHS-Q&t=99s)** — that underneath the right rib cage about an inch off the midline. You want to feel in around
- **[01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0-F3nhHS-Q&t=106s)** — there until you find it. You're going to find like a kind of a knot and you're going to hold
- **[01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0-F3nhHS-Q&t=110s)** — that pressure gently for about one to two minutes and you're going to feel like a
- **[01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0-F3nhHS-Q&t=115s)** — draining effect because what you're doing is you're opening up the ducts from the pancreas,
- **[01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0-F3nhHS-Q&t=119s)** — allowing for the food and the digestive juices to travel through. Chances are if you have like
- **[02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0-F3nhHS-Q&t=124s)** — right shoulder pain, that will go away too because there's a connection between the gall
- **[02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0-F3nhHS-Q&t=128s)** — bladder and the right shoulder. Also, you're going to breathe better because there's less
- **[02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0-F3nhHS-Q&t=131s)** — pressure underneath your rib cage. We have kind of a traffic jam because maybe you ate
- **[02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0-F3nhHS-Q&t=135s)** — something that your body has to really release a lot of bile salt or an enzyme or acid to break
- **[02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0-F3nhHS-Q&t=140s)** — it down. I've done this for many years. It works great. You'll get so much relief.
- **[02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0-F3nhHS-Q&t=145s)** — Let's go to number four. Let's say for example you have pain in your left thumb. What
- **[02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0-F3nhHS-Q&t=149s)** — you want to do is you want to work on the opposite thumb, the mirror image location of where
- **[02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0-F3nhHS-Q&t=154s)** — you have the most intense pain and you start to massage it. If you press on the mirror
- **[02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0-F3nhHS-Q&t=158s)** — image exact opposite point, it'll be twice as tender. I know it's weird. You're going to
- **[02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0-F3nhHS-Q&t=164s)** — find that real tender spot. You find it, hold that for a little bit of time and then maybe 20
- **[02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0-F3nhHS-Q&t=169s)** — seconds, this pain completely gone. It really works. What about if you have pain on the
- **[02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0-F3nhHS-Q&t=175s)** — front part of the body right here or even the back part? You can work on the front. What
- **[02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0-F3nhHS-Q&t=179s)** — you want to do is you want to identify at the level of where it is in your back and draw
- **[03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0-F3nhHS-Q&t=183s)** — a line right through the body. Just pretend there's like an arrow going through you.
- **[03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0-F3nhHS-Q&t=188s)** — What you can do is you can press and massage on your sternum on the front part to help the back
- **[03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0-F3nhHS-Q&t=195s)** — part. Number five. This is mainly for tight muscles. You stretch the opposite muscle.
- **[03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0-F3nhHS-Q&t=201s)** — Let's say for example I'm trying to tilt my head back and it's stiff. Stretch the back
- **[03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0-F3nhHS-Q&t=206s)** — part of the muscles just going forward. Stretch it like this and then you'll be able to go
- **[03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0-F3nhHS-Q&t=211s)** — back. So you always stretch the opposite muscles. I don't just focus on the tight muscle. I work
- **[03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0-F3nhHS-Q&t=216s)** — the opposite one too. Number six. Work specifically for a weak muscle but it can also work for
- **[03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0-F3nhHS-Q&t=224s)** — fatigue. This simply is putting a little sea salt underneath your tongue. It gives you a lot of
- **[03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0-F3nhHS-Q&t=229s)** — minerals including sodium and chloride. And sodium is the majority of sea salt. And when
- **[03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0-F3nhHS-Q&t=234s)** — you're deficient in sodium, wow, your muscles will be weak. By putting it underneath the tongue,
- **[03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0-F3nhHS-Q&t=238s)** — it goes right into the body really quickly. Now you could also dissolve some sea salt in
- **[04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0-F3nhHS-Q&t=243s)** — water and drink that too. And you'll feel like an instant change with your muscles. They'll feel
- **[04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0-F3nhHS-Q&t=247s)** — stronger. They feel more energetic and you will have more energy too. Number seven is to create
- **[04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0-F3nhHS-Q&t=255s)** — instant relaxation when you're trying to sleep at night. You will not be able to sleep that
- **[04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0-F3nhHS-Q&t=258s)** — well if your neck is stiff. There is a great technique to relax the neck. It just creates
- **[04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0-F3nhHS-Q&t=264s)** — a instant full body relaxation to the point where you're just going to go to sleep. There's
- **[04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0-F3nhHS-Q&t=272s)** — can have someone do this to you. I'm going to show you a little demo on it right now. Check
- **[04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0-F3nhHS-Q&t=278s)** — it out. In order to sleep, you have to have a very relaxed neck. And if you fell in your
- **[04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0-F3nhHS-Q&t=284s)** — tailbone or had a neck injury, you definitely want to do this. But these specific points,
- **[04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0-F3nhHS-Q&t=289s)** — they're right here and here, are points that are very, very relaxing. And if you press into
- **[04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0-F3nhHS-Q&t=295s)** — them, you can just press like this right into those little spots there. It's going to release
- **[05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0-F3nhHS-Q&t=300s)** — a lot of stress. You can do it yourself. So go ahead and put your arms, your hands in the
- **[05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0-F3nhHS-Q&t=305s)** — right place there. Okay, good. So you see how she interlocks her fingers and then she wants
- **[05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0-F3nhHS-Q&t=310s)** — to put her thumbs. I want to straighten the thumb out and we want the pad right there
- **[05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0-F3nhHS-Q&t=316s)** — and right here. Okay. So you're going to hold that right there and press into that spot.
- **[05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0-F3nhHS-Q&t=322s)** — Okay. And keep your elbows out here. Yeah. Okay. She's going to hold that for, I would
- **[05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0-F3nhHS-Q&t=327s)** — say about two minutes. And it's a little bit easier if she's laying on down her back,
- **[05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0-F3nhHS-Q&t=333s)** — because she can have gravity put the pressure in there. But this, you can do it sitting fine,
- **[05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0-F3nhHS-Q&t=338s)** — but as long as the shoulders are okay. Sometimes if the shoulders are too stiff,
- **[05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0-F3nhHS-Q&t=341s)** — you can't do it. Number eight, take about a tablespoon of apple cider vinegar in maybe
- **[05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0-F3nhHS-Q&t=347s)** — three to four ounces of water, drink it down, wait, I don't know, maybe two minutes
- **[05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0-F3nhHS-Q&t=352s)** — and do another one of those. The acid, which is very strong, it's going to go into
- **[05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0-F3nhHS-Q&t=356s)** — your stomach and it's going to help you digest. It's not just going to help the stomach.
- **[06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0-F3nhHS-Q&t=361s)** — It's going to trigger both the pancreas and the gallbladder to release their juices. But
- **[06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0-F3nhHS-Q&t=367s)** — I do want to add one additional thing, butane, how the chloride and it's an acidifier.
- **[06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0-F3nhHS-Q&t=372s)** — You would have to take like five, six, seven, eight at a time. Wow. That really helps
- **[06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0-F3nhHS-Q&t=378s)** — get rid of the bloating to the point where you're going to feel more comfortable.
- **[06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0-F3nhHS-Q&t=382s)** — Number nine, this technique involves your joints. Usually the joint pain is coming from
- **[06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0-F3nhHS-Q&t=388s)** — a problem with your fascia. Fascia is the wetsuit that is covering everything. It's all
- **[06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0-F3nhHS-Q&t=395s)** — connected. There's some really amazing stretches that you can do on the opposite side of your
- **[06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0-F3nhHS-Q&t=401s)** — body to give yourself some relief. You're going to scissors your legs and come right down
- **[06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0-F3nhHS-Q&t=406s)** — and keep your upper body as straight as possible. And then take your left leg
- **[06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0-F3nhHS-Q&t=414s)** — and straighten out your knee if possible. Okay. So now I'm squatting down with my right leg,
- **[06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0-F3nhHS-Q&t=419s)** — do this for 10 seconds, and then you're going to do the opposite side or which muscle is
- **[07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0-F3nhHS-Q&t=424s)** — tighter left or right. And obviously you're going to spend a little more time on the
- **[07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0-F3nhHS-Q&t=428s)** — area that's tight. Then what you do is do step two, which is simply you're raising your
- **[07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0-F3nhHS-Q&t=433s)** — arm. Okay. Now what we're going to do is we're going to stretch all the muscles and ligaments
- **[07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0-F3nhHS-Q&t=438s)** — that are in the fascia that's connected to the opposite side. Okay. So you'll do that for 10
- **[07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0-F3nhHS-Q&t=446s)** — seconds. Okay. And then do the opposite side. Number 10, people would come in with these
- **[07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0-F3nhHS-Q&t=451s)** — headaches all the time, right? And I would locate where the headache is. And then I would
- **[07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0-F3nhHS-Q&t=455s)** — ask them this one question. Have you ever in your life had a head injury? And they're like,
- **[07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0-F3nhHS-Q&t=461s)** — yes, I have. Okay. What happened? I was in a car. I hit another car and a box flew off and it
- **[07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0-F3nhHS-Q&t=469s)** — hit me right on the head. And I'm like, wow. Okay. A lot of people have had head injuries.
- **[07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0-F3nhHS-Q&t=472s)** — What happens is that tends to create an impact and create some type of stuck energy
- **[07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0-F3nhHS-Q&t=477s)** — that then can give them a headache years later. What you do is you press into it from
- **[08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0-F3nhHS-Q&t=484s)** — the outside, maybe straw circle, you know, an inch around it or two inches around it,
- **[08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0-F3nhHS-Q&t=490s)** — but towards it. It seems to release that energy. For example, if it's right here,
- **[08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0-F3nhHS-Q&t=495s)** — you're going to press into it or up around it. And you're going to come around and back into it.
- **[08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0-F3nhHS-Q&t=499s)** — If it's on the forehead right here, you can press into it like this, into it like that.
- **[08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0-F3nhHS-Q&t=505s)** — That releases that tension and creates an instant headache relief. Number 11,
- **[08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0-F3nhHS-Q&t=511s)** — sinus problems, any type of breathing problems, whether it's sleep apnea,
- **[08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0-F3nhHS-Q&t=515s)** — deviated septum, sinus issue, you are about to give them a tremendous amount of relief,
- **[08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0-F3nhHS-Q&t=521s)** — treating it like an injury. You press in there and you're just going to hold that pressure
- **[08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0-F3nhHS-Q&t=525s)** — while you're going into the nose. They're going to go, wow, I can breathe better. But
- **[08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0-F3nhHS-Q&t=529s)** — let's say, for example, they never had an injury to the nose. Then you can go the
- **[08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0-F3nhHS-Q&t=533s)** — opposite side. You can take the, these sutures that are right connect and you can press in and out
- **[08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0-F3nhHS-Q&t=538s)** — this way. So you're basically taking the traction and you bring it outward right here,
- **[09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0-F3nhHS-Q&t=542s)** — right there. I'm not flipping off. So you just take that out and you just pull it out this way,
- **[09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0-F3nhHS-Q&t=547s)** — gives you a lot of relief through the sinuses. There you have it. 11 of my favorite health hacks.
- **[09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0-F3nhHS-Q&t=553s)** — Please comment below on any of the ones that you applied that you were successful with.

- **[00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NOV5vIsjQhg&t=0s)** — Why is it that the average person is consuming a very specific type of oil on a regular basis,
- **[00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NOV5vIsjQhg&t=6s)** — not just cooking with their food, but on their food as well? This oil is not just consumed
- **[00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NOV5vIsjQhg&t=11s)** — at home on a daily basis, but every time you go to a restaurant, nearly every single restaurant
- **[00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NOV5vIsjQhg&t=17s)** — is putting gobs of this oil on your food. When you go to the grocery store, over 70%
- **[00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NOV5vIsjQhg&t=24s)** — of those foods have this oil. It comes in a clear bottle. You can open it. You can expose it to air.
- **[00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NOV5vIsjQhg&t=31s)** — It doesn't need to be refrigerated. Unfortunately, this oil is vegetable oil,
- **[00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NOV5vIsjQhg&t=36s)** — which by the way is not even vegetables. Let's just call it what it is. It's seed oils.
- **[00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NOV5vIsjQhg&t=40s)** — Seed oils are so processed with super high heats over 400 degrees Fahrenheit. They use
- **[00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NOV5vIsjQhg&t=47s)** — chemical solvents to extract the oils out. If they didn't deodorize it, it would have
- **[00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NOV5vIsjQhg&t=52s)** — a really bad taste and a bad smell. This is just basically adding more heat. And by the way,
- **[00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NOV5vIsjQhg&t=58s)** — when you add heat to a lot of these oils, you develop all sorts of toxic byproducts
- **[01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NOV5vIsjQhg&t=63s)** — like trans fats. There's actually nine other compounds that are very toxic that are produced
- **[01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NOV5vIsjQhg&t=68s)** — by heating these seed oils. Not to mention, almost every single one of these seed oils
- **[01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NOV5vIsjQhg&t=74s)** — is genetically modified. There's going to be traces of an herbicide called glyphosate.
- **[01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NOV5vIsjQhg&t=79s)** — Just because an oil is deodorized doesn't mean you're getting rid of the rancidity or the
- **[01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NOV5vIsjQhg&t=85s)** — oxidation. It's more like hiding these toxicities because now you can't smell or taste it. It's
- **[01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NOV5vIsjQhg&t=90s)** — kind of like just clear. One of the toxic components, which is BHA, is a possible human
- **[01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NOV5vIsjQhg&t=96s)** — carcinogen. The other ones can affect the immune system, the nervous system, and your liver.
- **[01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NOV5vIsjQhg&t=100s)** — I just need help understanding why are we using this oil? Why is it considered heart
- **[01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NOV5vIsjQhg&t=106s)** — If you watch some of my other videos, Gross, generally recognized as safe, is really something
- **[01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NOV5vIsjQhg&t=112s)** — that the industry itself can put that stamp of approval. They can do their own studies, which
- **[01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NOV5vIsjQhg&t=117s)** — are not independent. If you look at vegetable oils, you'll see this argument that vegetable
- **[02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NOV5vIsjQhg&t=122s)** — oils are fine as long as you don't heat it. Because if you go to a fast food restaurant,
- **[02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NOV5vIsjQhg&t=127s)** — they're going to reheat it like a hundred times, which is going to make it really,
- **[02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NOV5vIsjQhg&t=131s)** — really, really toxic. They'll say if you don't heat it and you put it on your food,
- **[02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NOV5vIsjQhg&t=134s)** — it'll be fine. It's already been heated to over 400 degrees. It's already been manipulated.
- **[02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NOV5vIsjQhg&t=140s)** — This fragile oil has now become degraded and starting to become destroyed. It's just bizarre
- **[02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NOV5vIsjQhg&t=146s)** — how the whole thing flipped, right? They made saturated fats the bad guys and unsaturated fats
- **[02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NOV5vIsjQhg&t=150s)** — the good guys, which is absolutely, positively a big fat lie. Here's the problem that I have
- **[02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NOV5vIsjQhg&t=156s)** — with seed oils. If you look at almost every chronic disease out there, all of these
- **[02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NOV5vIsjQhg&t=163s)** — involve one common denominator and that is inflammation. Why the heck would anyone want
- **[02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NOV5vIsjQhg&t=169s)** — to consume even a drop of this rancid, highly inflammatory oil? I believe that these vegetable
- **[02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NOV5vIsjQhg&t=176s)** — oils are the most inflammatory thing that you can consume. Think about what they do to your
- **[03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NOV5vIsjQhg&t=182s)** — cells. They're creating damage. What this oil does to our bodies is not necessarily converted
- **[03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NOV5vIsjQhg&t=187s)** — to fuel. A lot of it's stored in the fat cell and it's going to make that fat cell very sick.
- **[03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NOV5vIsjQhg&t=193s)** — We have a lot of membranes through our whole body and to detoxify vegetable oils from our
- **[03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NOV5vIsjQhg&t=198s)** — membranes, it takes literally a year and a half to two years by just not eating them.
- **[03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NOV5vIsjQhg&t=202s)** — No wonder why the number one selling drug in the world is Humira, which is an anti-inflammatory
- **[03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NOV5vIsjQhg&t=210s)** — drug. Why do you think that is? Because we have way too much inflammation. I'm excited
- **[03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NOV5vIsjQhg&t=214s)** — about a new product we just released, which is our zinc product. It's a zinc product with
- **[03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NOV5vIsjQhg&t=219s)** — magnesium, with vitamin D3, as well as selenium. This is a great product to help boost the immune
- **[03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NOV5vIsjQhg&t=224s)** — system and to support healthy skin and hair. I added vitamin B6. I also added copper. In each
- **[03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NOV5vIsjQhg&t=231s)** — capsule we have 30 milligrams of zinc to maximize bioavailability. What type of seed
- **[03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NOV5vIsjQhg&t=237s)** — oils are we talking about? We're talking about soy oil, corn oil, sunflower, canola,
- **[04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NOV5vIsjQhg&t=242s)** — cotton seed. But the most dangerous seed oil of all of them is the cotton seed oil. This is the
- **[04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NOV5vIsjQhg&t=247s)** — oil that produces the most toxicity. It has the highest amount of omega-6 fatty acids, making it
- **[04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NOV5vIsjQhg&t=253s)** — very inflammatory. And they hide it in a lot of animal feeds, which ends up in the animal
- **[04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NOV5vIsjQhg&t=258s)** — and ends up indirectly in our body. Anytime you have inflammation, you're going to have a
- **[04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NOV5vIsjQhg&t=262s)** — lack of oxygen. Cancer thrives in an area that's either inflamed and or doesn't have
- **[04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NOV5vIsjQhg&t=268s)** — oxygen. It triggers cancer to grow more. This inflammation can also directly cause
- **[04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NOV5vIsjQhg&t=273s)** — insulin resistance, which a lot of people have as well. Not to mention it's just
- **[04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NOV5vIsjQhg&t=277s)** — accumulating and it's shortening your lifespan. And it's behind a lot of inflammatory
- **[04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NOV5vIsjQhg&t=282s)** — conditions that actually start either in the artery, it might start in the brain, it might
- **[04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NOV5vIsjQhg&t=287s)** — start somewhere in the body that turns into a bigger problem later in life. If you ask someone,
- **[04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NOV5vIsjQhg&t=292s)** — what are some things to be healthy? Well, have lean meats, avoid saturated fats. But in
- **[04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NOV5vIsjQhg&t=297s)** — reality, saturated fats were never the bad guy. Saturated fats are very, very stable.
- **[05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NOV5vIsjQhg&t=302s)** — There's actually not a lot of saturated fats in junk food. It's mostly the unsaturated fatty
- **[05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NOV5vIsjQhg&t=307s)** — acids. You do not want to use vegetable oils at all in the diet. If you have it in the
- **[05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NOV5vIsjQhg&t=314s)** — house, I would take them out, bring them in the garage and use them to lubricate
- **[05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NOV5vIsjQhg&t=318s)** — different car parts or certain mechanical things that require lubrication. That would
- **[05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NOV5vIsjQhg&t=324s)** — be the best use of them. They're toxic. You do not want to cook with them either. If you cook
- **[05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NOV5vIsjQhg&t=328s)** — with them, it's going to be worse because it creates more of these byproducts that create
- **[05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NOV5vIsjQhg&t=332s)** — more damage. What do we want to replace the C2O's with? Well, something like this extra virgin
- **[05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NOV5vIsjQhg&t=338s)** — olive oil, something high quality. I use this in a vinaigrette on all my salads. You can cook
- **[05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NOV5vIsjQhg&t=345s)** — with olive oil. It's not the perfect solution. If you're going to use high heats, I
- **[05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NOV5vIsjQhg&t=352s)** — actually handle a lot of heat or I will use Kerrygold butter or a similar type of butter.
- **[05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NOV5vIsjQhg&t=358s)** — You can also use ghee. It's clarified butter. They take out some of the protein. That way,
- **[06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NOV5vIsjQhg&t=365s)** — when you heat it up, you won't get the smoking or anything that happens with cooking
- **[06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NOV5vIsjQhg&t=369s)** — the protein. If you can find something like this red palm oil that is organic, unrefined
- **[06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NOV5vIsjQhg&t=376s)** — red palm oil, it's going to be a lot better because it's not damaged. It's not processed.
- **[06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NOV5vIsjQhg&t=380s)** — You can use this just like you would use coconut oil, but you can actually put it in your food.
- **[06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NOV5vIsjQhg&t=385s)** — Another thing that has a lot of seed oils is mayonnaise. I like mayonnaise in my food.
- **[06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NOV5vIsjQhg&t=390s)** — You want to find a mayonnaise like this. You just need to read the label. This has
- **[06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NOV5vIsjQhg&t=394s)** — avocado oil, which is a lot better than soy oil, and then filtered water, egg yolks,
- **[06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NOV5vIsjQhg&t=400s)** — organic whole eggs. This is awesome. This is a great mayonnaise. But even some of the ones
- **[06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NOV5vIsjQhg&t=407s)** — say it has avocado oil or even olive oil, if you read them, you'll see that the second ingredient
- **[06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NOV5vIsjQhg&t=414s)** — or the third ingredient or the first ingredient is either soy or canola oil or some other oil.
- **[07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NOV5vIsjQhg&t=420s)** — Another good fat to use in your food is very savory tallow fat. That is basically beef fat.
- **[07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NOV5vIsjQhg&t=426s)** — Long ago, McDonald's used to fry their french fries in tallow. Definitely to give it
- **[07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NOV5vIsjQhg&t=431s)** — a lot more flavor. Lard, pig fat, is another fat that some people use. You just want to find
- **[07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NOV5vIsjQhg&t=436s)** — high quality lard. That lard is great to cook in because it really makes your food taste
- **[07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NOV5vIsjQhg&t=441s)** — incredible. It's a super stable oil. It's not going to go rancid. The best thing to do is not
- **[07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NOV5vIsjQhg&t=446s)** — to necessarily fry anything or eat any deep fried foods at all. That would be the ideal
- **[07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NOV5vIsjQhg&t=451s)** — situation. The air fryer. We use one of those. Works great. You can simulate fried food
- **[07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NOV5vIsjQhg&t=457s)** — in that very easily with the right ingredients and the right breading. So you're not using
- **[07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NOV5vIsjQhg&t=462s)** — actual wheat breading. You're using some other sources like crushed up pork rinds. We can use
- **[07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NOV5vIsjQhg&t=468s)** — it as breading. And then you put that on chicken with certain seasoning and you put that
- **[07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NOV5vIsjQhg&t=473s)** — in the air fryer. Amazing. This heart healthy seed oil is actually very damaging to your heart.
- **[07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NOV5vIsjQhg&t=479s)** — You don't want to eat it. Get it out of the house and make sure they don't hide the
- **[08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NOV5vIsjQhg&t=483s)** — seed oil in the food. Thanks for watching and I will see you in the next video.

## Video 42: NEVER Drink Baking Soda Until You Watch This!

## Full Transcript with Timestamps

*Click any timestamp to jump to that moment in the video*

- **[00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZo7c-nR1Ts&t=0s)** — Do not take baking soda unless you watch this video. Baking soda has the potential to help or even
- **[00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZo7c-nR1Ts&t=6s)** — poison you. Baking soda is sodium bicarbonate. It's an alkaline compound. And guess what? Your
- **[00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZo7c-nR1Ts&t=12s)** — body makes it. Your pancreas makes it. As the strong acid comes from your stomach into the
- **[00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZo7c-nR1Ts&t=17s)** — small intestine, if that pancreas does not release enough sodium bicarbonate, you don't get
- **[00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZo7c-nR1Ts&t=21s)** — any of the benefits from the enzymes coming from the pancreas to help you digest fats
- **[00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZo7c-nR1Ts&t=26s)** — and other things. This is why when someone's pancreas is not working, boy, they can get
- **[00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZo7c-nR1Ts&t=31s)** — severe bloating. They get diarrhea. They get constipation. We need a really strong acid
- **[00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZo7c-nR1Ts&t=37s)** — stomach and then we need an alkaline small intestine. Let's talk first about the benefits
- **[00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZo7c-nR1Ts&t=41s)** — of baking soda. Baking soda, being an alkaline substance, can be beneficial for temporarily
- **[00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZo7c-nR1Ts&t=48s)** — relieving an acid stomach. I have to clarify something because when we talk about an acid
- **[00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZo7c-nR1Ts&t=52s)** — stomach, a lot of things come up. You might have like GERD, acid reflux. All those things
- **[00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZo7c-nR1Ts&t=57s)** — are a little bit different because you never want to take baking soda when you have indigestion.
- **[01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZo7c-nR1Ts&t=63s)** — Indigestion is like this backup of food that just you feel like your stomach is like cramping.
- **[01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZo7c-nR1Ts&t=68s)** — That is a classic low acid or a lack of acid situation. So of course, adding more
- **[01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZo7c-nR1Ts&t=75s)** — baking soda is just going to go from bad to worse. Anytime you have indigestion, you need
- **[01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZo7c-nR1Ts&t=79s)** — to take either apple cider vinegar or something called betaine hydrochloride. It will fix it really
- **[01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZo7c-nR1Ts&t=85s)** — fast. But when we get into more of an acidic stomach, whether it is acid reflux or GERD,
- **[01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZo7c-nR1Ts&t=91s)** — if you wanted some temporary relief as you fix the problem, a little bit of baking soda
- **[01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZo7c-nR1Ts&t=95s)** — would help you. But just a little bit because usually those problems are also a lack of
- **[01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZo7c-nR1Ts&t=100s)** — acid. But the baking soda will at least put the fire out and make you feel more comfortable.
- **[01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZo7c-nR1Ts&t=104s)** — But then you would also want to do apple cider vinegar and or betaine hydrochloride. Now,
- **[01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZo7c-nR1Ts&t=109s)** — what about gastritis? You would want to take baking soda for sure. But also take something
- **[01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZo7c-nR1Ts&t=114s)** — called zinc carnosine so you can actually heal that problem. But you just need to understand
- **[02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZo7c-nR1Ts&t=120s)** — that the normal pH of the stomach is between one and three. That is like battery acid. And
- **[02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZo7c-nR1Ts&t=127s)** — just don't get in habit of taking baking soda for a long period of time because you're
- **[02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZo7c-nR1Ts&t=131s)** — going to neutralize your stomach acids. And now you're going to end up with an inability
- **[02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZo7c-nR1Ts&t=136s)** — to digest protein, the inability to absorb B12, the inability to absorb minerals. And also,
- **[02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZo7c-nR1Ts&t=144s)** — you're not going to be able to kill off any type of microbes or pathogens that might be
- **[02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZo7c-nR1Ts&t=148s)** — in your food. Now, if you take baking soda for a long time chronically, is there really
- **[02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZo7c-nR1Ts&t=153s)** — a chance of your blood becoming too alkaline? And the answer is probably not because the
- **[02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZo7c-nR1Ts&t=159s)** — effect that baking soda has on our bodies is very temporary. If your body is too alkaline,
- **[02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZo7c-nR1Ts&t=164s)** — you're going to have some issues with your muscles because of how that affects the electrolytes.
- **[02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZo7c-nR1Ts&t=169s)** — Another really good benefit of baking soda is to help to neutralize the acid in your mouth
- **[02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZo7c-nR1Ts&t=175s)** — from the bacteria that is forming these little biofilm tartar placking situations. So baking
- **[03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZo7c-nR1Ts&t=181s)** — soda could be one of the ingredients in your toothpaste. And I actually show you how to make
- **[03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZo7c-nR1Ts&t=185s)** — that. I will put that link down below. But ultimately, you got to get the sugar out of
- **[03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZo7c-nR1Ts&t=188s)** — the diet because sugar is what's making that acid. Another benefit of baking soda is to
- **[03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZo7c-nR1Ts&t=193s)** — itching from a kidney problem. When your kidney becomes damaged, you start developing too much
- **[03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZo7c-nR1Ts&t=201s)** — acid and that can affect your skin, especially itching among other symptoms. One of the great
- **[03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZo7c-nR1Ts&t=207s)** — antidotes to that is to take something to neutralize the acid and that takes the stress
- **[03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZo7c-nR1Ts&t=211s)** — off the kidney. In fact, some people with kidney problems even take some baking soda to
- **[03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZo7c-nR1Ts&t=216s)** — prolong going on dialysis because when the kidneys are damaged, it can't regulate the pH
- **[03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZo7c-nR1Ts&t=222s)** — anymore like it used to because a diseased kidney will make more acids. Now, another way I would use
- **[03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZo7c-nR1Ts&t=229s)** — baking soda is let's say, for example, you're doing prolonged fasting or even intermittent
- **[03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZo7c-nR1Ts&t=234s)** — fasting in your carnivore, you're doing a lot of meat and then you start feeling this
- **[03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZo7c-nR1Ts&t=239s)** — acidity coming up through your stomach. Some baking soda here and there can help
- **[04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZo7c-nR1Ts&t=243s)** — chill that out, especially if you're trying to sleep at night and it's kind of coming up
- **[04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZo7c-nR1Ts&t=247s)** — through your esophagus. Another unique beneficial way to take baking soda is if you're
- **[04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZo7c-nR1Ts&t=251s)** — an athlete and you're going to compete in some sport and you wanted the unfair advantage. You
- **[04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZo7c-nR1Ts&t=257s)** — wanted to be able to do more reps. You wanted to go a little longer. You want a little better
- **[04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZo7c-nR1Ts&t=261s)** — performance and less lactic acid buildup, which can actually stop you from using your muscles,
- **[04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZo7c-nR1Ts&t=267s)** — especially with high intensity type activities because if you take all of it at once and
- **[04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZo7c-nR1Ts&t=272s)** — feel nauseous, you want to avoid that. If you really want to know how much you should take,
- **[04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZo7c-nR1Ts&t=276s)** — it's 0.2 grams per kilogram of weight. Another benefit of baking soda is to help prevent
- **[04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZo7c-nR1Ts&t=284s)** — kidney stones. So if you're susceptible to kidney stones, you can take some baking soda
- **[04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZo7c-nR1Ts&t=288s)** — because uric acid dissolves in baking soda. And this is why baking soda is also good in
- **[04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZo7c-nR1Ts&t=294s)** — a gout situation, at least as a temporary action. Of course, ultimately you'd want to
- **[04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZo7c-nR1Ts&t=298s)** — avoid any type of fructose, high fructose corn syrup, especially. Another way you can
- **[05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZo7c-nR1Ts&t=303s)** — baking soda is if you have a UTI. It'll actually change the environment so the microbes or the
- **[05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZo7c-nR1Ts&t=309s)** — pathogens can't exist anymore. And then the last benefit of baking soda would be some topical
- **[05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZo7c-nR1Ts&t=315s)** — applications for some type of insect bite. If the insect's venom is alkaline, that could make
- **[05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZo7c-nR1Ts&t=322s)** — you worse. There are two insects that have an acid venom. So applying baking soda would help
- **[05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZo7c-nR1Ts&t=329s)** — ants, especially fire ants, and bee stings would benefit from putting some topical baking soda
- **[05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZo7c-nR1Ts&t=335s)** — on the actual sting bite. So just get some wet and apply it to your skin. If you get stung by
- **[05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZo7c-nR1Ts&t=341s)** — a wasp, do not put baking soda on that because those venoms are more alkaline. If you add more
- **[05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZo7c-nR1Ts&t=346s)** — alkaline, you're going to make it worse. What you should put on that is vinegar. A spider bite,
- **[05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZo7c-nR1Ts&t=351s)** — don't put baking soda on that. The best thing to put on that is either activated charcoal
- **[05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZo7c-nR1Ts&t=356s)** — or bentonite clay, which has the power of pulling things out of the skin. And then a
- **[06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZo7c-nR1Ts&t=361s)** — snake bite. The best antidote for that is something called milk thistle. And as a side
- **[06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZo7c-nR1Ts&t=367s)** — note, baking soda is also really good for insects, especially cockroaches. Because if you
- **[06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZo7c-nR1Ts&t=372s)** — add sugar with baking soda and you leave it out for the cockroaches, they'll eat it. Then
- **[06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZo7c-nR1Ts&t=378s)** — from the chemical reaction, you'll get carbon dioxide and their digestive systems will rupture
- **[06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZo7c-nR1Ts&t=383s)** — and they will die. So that would be a natural way to get rid of these insects so you don't have
- **[06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZo7c-nR1Ts&t=389s)** — these insecticides around your house. The other thing you need to know about baking soda is you
- **[06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZo7c-nR1Ts&t=393s)** — never want to take it with vinegar or a lemon juice because it's just going to create so much
- **[06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZo7c-nR1Ts&t=399s)** — carbon dioxide, your stomach is going to bloat up with carbon dioxide. Not a good idea. And I
- **[06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZo7c-nR1Ts&t=405s)** — think you already know this too. You can open a container of baking soda and keep it in the
- **[06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZo7c-nR1Ts&t=410s)** — fridge and it gets rid of the odors. So now that you know a little bit more about this
- **[06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZo7c-nR1Ts&t=415s)** — home remedy baking soda, you should check out my apple cider vinegar video right here.

- **[00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku56lZTV7OY&t=0s)** — Are you fed up with using the bathroom several times a night?
- **[00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku56lZTV7OY&t=3s)** — Let's talk about Nocturia.
- **[00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku56lZTV7OY&t=5s)** — Urinating at night when you should be sleeping.
- **[00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku56lZTV7OY&t=7s)** — It can drive people crazy.
- **[00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku56lZTV7OY&t=9s)** — It can be a real pain in the butt because
- **[00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku56lZTV7OY&t=11s)** — it interferes with your sleep.
- **[00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku56lZTV7OY&t=14s)** — So I'm going to show you a very commonly overlooked cause to Nocturia.
- **[00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku56lZTV7OY&t=20s)** — And you're going to be very excited to hear what I'm going to say about this because
- **[00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku56lZTV7OY&t=23s)** — finally you're going to find something that really works.
- **[00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku56lZTV7OY&t=25s)** — As you're trying to get solutions, you go online,
- **[00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku56lZTV7OY&t=28s)** — the first page you're going to see
- **[00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku56lZTV7OY&t=30s)** — Cleveland Clinic, WebMD, Medline Plus,
- **[00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku56lZTV7OY&t=35s)** — all these credible authority sites.
- **[00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku56lZTV7OY&t=38s)** — The same information.
- **[00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku56lZTV7OY&t=40s)** — And they all say it's a normal part of aging,
- **[00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku56lZTV7OY&t=43s)** — which really is absolutely not true.
- **[00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku56lZTV7OY&t=45s)** — And they all recommend medications.
- **[00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku56lZTV7OY&t=48s)** — But some of them have alternatives, right?
- **[00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku56lZTV7OY&t=50s)** — They have alternatives. They'll say, well, you know, you might want to try an herb,
- **[00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku56lZTV7OY&t=53s)** — but there's no evidence.
- **[00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku56lZTV7OY&t=55s)** — And they could be dangerous.
- **[00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku56lZTV7OY&t=58s)** — And herbs are not regulated by the FDA.
- **[01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku56lZTV7OY&t=61s)** — The safety of drugs are regulated by the FDA.
- **[01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku56lZTV7OY&t=64s)** — Well, I guess after the FDA finds that it's safe,
- **[01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku56lZTV7OY&t=68s)** — pretty much stays in the market, right?
- **[01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku56lZTV7OY&t=69s)** — I mean, we don't have recalls. We don't have drugs that
- **[01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku56lZTV7OY&t=72s)** — end up being very harmful. I am being very sarcastic.
- **[01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku56lZTV7OY&t=76s)** — There was an analysis in 2011 on adverse drug reactions.
- **[01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku56lZTV7OY&t=82s)** — In the US alone, 2.1 million serious injuries,
- **[01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku56lZTV7OY&t=89s)** — 128,000 deaths from drugs.
- **[01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku56lZTV7OY&t=92s)** — But drugs are regulated by the FDA.
- **[01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku56lZTV7OY&t=94s)** — I mean, how many people do you know that died from an herb
- **[01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku56lZTV7OY&t=97s)** — or had a lot of serious reactions from herbs? Is it very common?
- **[01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku56lZTV7OY&t=101s)** — That being said, the information on necturia,
- **[01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku56lZTV7OY&t=103s)** — they usually say it's a bladder infection, could be a kidney infection,
- **[01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku56lZTV7OY&t=107s)** — could be a prostate enlargement.
- **[01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku56lZTV7OY&t=109s)** — But what's fascinating is there's one thing
- **[01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku56lZTV7OY&t=112s)** — that is not listed on any of these sites.
- **[01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku56lZTV7OY&t=116s)** — So just envision what the kidneys are.
- **[01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku56lZTV7OY&t=119s)** — The kidneys are a filter and they filter blood.
- **[02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku56lZTV7OY&t=122s)** — And what controls this filtration rate as well as the production of urine
- **[02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku56lZTV7OY&t=129s)** — is the concentration of various things.
- **[02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku56lZTV7OY&t=133s)** — Salts, sugars, waste products, red blood cell breakdown.
- **[02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku56lZTV7OY&t=138s)** — And so you have all these different concentrated particles in there
- **[02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku56lZTV7OY&t=141s)** — and some of it's recycled, some of it does not get recycled.
- **[02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku56lZTV7OY&t=145s)** — When the urine is produced, it goes down these little tubes into the bladder.
- **[02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku56lZTV7OY&t=148s)** — And what's interesting about people that get up several times a night,
- **[02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku56lZTV7OY&t=152s)** — they're not urinating a full bladder of urine.
- **[02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku56lZTV7OY&t=155s)** — It could be just a little bit. So what is up with that?
- **[02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku56lZTV7OY&t=159s)** — There must be something going on with the sensors in the bladder itself
- **[02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku56lZTV7OY&t=165s)** — and maybe the valve of the bladder.
- **[02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku56lZTV7OY&t=168s)** — So in the bladder we have a combination of smooth muscle and valves
- **[02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku56lZTV7OY&t=175s)** — and nerves that are controlled by a part of the nervous system
- **[03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku56lZTV7OY&t=182s)** — called the parasympathetic nervous system.
- **[03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku56lZTV7OY&t=185s)** — So that's like the opposite or partner to the sympathetic nervous system
- **[03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku56lZTV7OY&t=189s)** — which is the flight or fight mechanism.
- **[03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku56lZTV7OY&t=191s)** — This is why you need to relax when you urinate, right?
- **[03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku56lZTV7OY&t=194s)** — If you're stressed in some way, it would be harder to eliminate.
- **[03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku56lZTV7OY&t=199s)** — So I'm just kind of giving you a little background here
- **[03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku56lZTV7OY&t=201s)** — for what I'm going to talk about.
- **[03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku56lZTV7OY&t=203s)** — So the bladder is controlled by the parasympathetic nervous system
- **[03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku56lZTV7OY&t=207s)** — which another name for that is called rest and digest.
- **[03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku56lZTV7OY&t=210s)** — There's another thing related to sugar.
- **[03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku56lZTV7OY&t=214s)** — When there's too much sugar in the blood that gets filtered,
- **[03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku56lZTV7OY&t=219s)** — there's something that occurs that's called,
- **[03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku56lZTV7OY&t=221s)** — and this might be a new term for you, osmotic diuresis.
- **[03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku56lZTV7OY&t=224s)** — Now what does that mean?
- **[03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku56lZTV7OY&t=226s)** — Osmotic has to do with the particles or concentration of sugar.
- **[03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku56lZTV7OY&t=230s)** — Diuresis means increased amount of urine that is coming out.
- **[03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku56lZTV7OY&t=233s)** — So apparently in the little filtration rate in the kidneys,
- **[03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku56lZTV7OY&t=236s)** — if there's too much sugar, that filter will push out the sugar
- **[04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku56lZTV7OY&t=241s)** — and wherever there's sugar there's water.
- **[04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku56lZTV7OY&t=243s)** — Water follows sugar.
- **[04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku56lZTV7OY&t=245s)** — So we get this excessive amount of water and sugar
- **[04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku56lZTV7OY&t=249s)** — with this osmotic diuresis thing.
- **[04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku56lZTV7OY&t=251s)** — And so that really kind of explains why a diabetic, for example,
- **[04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku56lZTV7OY&t=255s)** — has this excessive urination.
- **[04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku56lZTV7OY&t=258s)** — In fact, diabetics have like a 49% increase of nocturia.
- **[04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku56lZTV7OY&t=264s)** — Someone with hypertension has a 39% increase risk of having that.
- **[04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku56lZTV7OY&t=268s)** — And someone who is obese has like a 200% increase risk of having nocturia.
- **[04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku56lZTV7OY&t=275s)** — And obstructive sleep apnea.
- **[04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku56lZTV7OY&t=278s)** — Is at risk like, I think it's 40% of having this excessive urine situation at night.
- **[04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku56lZTV7OY&t=286s)** — Now what's interesting about the sleep apnea situation
- **[04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku56lZTV7OY&t=289s)** — is I found this one paper that did this research
- **[04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku56lZTV7OY&t=295s)** — on the relationship between sleep apnea and kidney physiology
- **[05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku56lZTV7OY&t=301s)** — that includes the bladder.
- **[05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku56lZTV7OY&t=303s)** — And to my knowledge, this is like the only study that was ever done on this.
- **[05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku56lZTV7OY&t=306s)** — But they found that when you have obstructive breathing,
- **[05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku56lZTV7OY&t=311s)** — you create hypoxia in the body. That's a lack of oxygen.
- **[05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku56lZTV7OY&t=315s)** — Blood pressure does go up, but your parasympathetic nervous system goes down.
- **[05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku56lZTV7OY&t=322s)** — Remember that thing that controls not just the smooth muscle around your bladder,
- **[05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku56lZTV7OY&t=329s)** — but the nerves down there and the valves?
- **[05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku56lZTV7OY&t=332s)** — Well, it just so happens that they found an increase association between hypoxia and diuresis.
- **[05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku56lZTV7OY&t=341s)** — Because apparently this lack of oxygen can affect your bladder, which is fascinating.
- **[05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku56lZTV7OY&t=346s)** — So that's an interesting connection.
- **[05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku56lZTV7OY&t=348s)** — But now the question is, what is behind sleep apnea?
- **[05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku56lZTV7OY&t=352s)** — What's behind obesity? What's behind diabetes and hypertension?
- **[05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku56lZTV7OY&t=357s)** — And the answer is insulin resistance.
- **[05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku56lZTV7OY&t=359s)** — And there's some interesting research. I'm going to put a list down below showing that insulin resistance can cause nocturia.
- **[06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku56lZTV7OY&t=368s)** — Now, I did two other videos on this topic, which I'm going to put a link down below.
- **[06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku56lZTV7OY&t=372s)** — And the comments from people who tried it and it worked are overwhelming.
- **[06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku56lZTV7OY&t=376s)** — I mean, you're going to be blown away at how many people just made some slight changes in their diet
- **[06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku56lZTV7OY&t=381s)** — and got rid of this problem within days.
- **[06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku56lZTV7OY&t=385s)** — So how do we fix insulin resistance?
- **[06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku56lZTV7OY&t=387s)** — First, stop snacking at night. And basically stop snacking in general.
- **[06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku56lZTV7OY&t=392s)** — In fact, do intermittent fasting.
- **[06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku56lZTV7OY&t=394s)** — Basically, you're just cutting down the number of meals, not the calories, just the frequency of eating.
- **[06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku56lZTV7OY&t=400s)** — It's going to greatly help insulin resistance.
- **[06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku56lZTV7OY&t=402s)** — And number two, start cutting down your carbs to less than 30 grams per day.
- **[06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku56lZTV7OY&t=409s)** — Those two actions are the most powerful thing you can do.
- **[06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku56lZTV7OY&t=412s)** — And you're going to see amazing changes.
- **[06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku56lZTV7OY&t=414s)** — Now, a couple of things you can do to add to speed things up.
- **[06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku56lZTV7OY&t=418s)** — Take some apple cider vinegar with some water right before your meals.
- **[07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku56lZTV7OY&t=423s)** — Just like a tablespoon of apple cider vinegar. What does that do?
- **[07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku56lZTV7OY&t=426s)** — That is a really good blood sugar regulating natural remedy.
- **[07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku56lZTV7OY&t=431s)** — The other thing you can do is exercise on a regular basis.
- **[07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku56lZTV7OY&t=434s)** — That is another potent way to improve insulin resistance.
- **[07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku56lZTV7OY&t=439s)** — And if you have any questions on what to eat, I have so much data on this topic on my website.
- **[07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku56lZTV7OY&t=444s)** — You can just download exactly what to eat. I'll put DrBurg.com down below.
- **[07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku56lZTV7OY&t=449s)** — You can just click that. But if you want some hope that you can be helped, okay?
- **[07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku56lZTV7OY&t=453s)** — Check out this video right here and read all the comments of people who started to fix their insulin resistance.

- **[00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5qLdSKDkEE&t=0s)** — Okay, so this is what you're going to do about insulin resistance to correct it.
- **[00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5qLdSKDkEE&t=4s)** — So if you have a dysfunction with insulin, you have to understand what triggers insulin, okay?
- **[00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5qLdSKDkEE&t=10s)** — And what will trigger it is consuming sugar, or
- **[00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5qLdSKDkEE&t=14s)** — hidden sugars, or
- **[00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5qLdSKDkEE&t=16s)** — artificial sweeteners, or
- **[00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5qLdSKDkEE&t=18s)** — foods with MSG from going out to the fast food places.
- **[00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5qLdSKDkEE&t=24s)** — Okay, those are all things that trigger it, but there's one additional important thing. This is very very important.
- **[00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5qLdSKDkEE&t=29s)** — So I need your attention right here.
- **[00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5qLdSKDkEE&t=32s)** — It's eating in general will trigger insulin, okay? So that means that all the snacking is
- **[00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5qLdSKDkEE&t=38s)** — really bad because it spikes insulin. If we can keep insulin low, you can actually heal insulin.
- **[00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5qLdSKDkEE&t=46s)** — So if we do breakfast, lunch, and dinner with no snacks in between or at night,
- **[00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5qLdSKDkEE&t=52s)** — we can heal insulin resistance.
- **[00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5qLdSKDkEE&t=54s)** — If you really are serious about losing weight, and you want to take it one step further,
- **[00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5qLdSKDkEE&t=58s)** — over a period of time when you get used to this, and you can do it, you can go to two meals a day.
- **[01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5qLdSKDkEE&t=62s)** — Unless you're a hardcore workout person, and you're going to need a little bit more food, but most people can actually do a later
- **[01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5qLdSKDkEE&t=71s)** — breakfast and
- **[01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5qLdSKDkEE&t=72s)** — maybe a dinner later on, you know, so it's spaced out with no snacks in between.
- **[01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5qLdSKDkEE&t=78s)** — But here's the secret. You need to add
- **[01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5qLdSKDkEE&t=80s)** — some fat at the meal to allow you to be satisfied to the point where you can go from one meal to the next
- **[01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5qLdSKDkEE&t=85s)** — without being terribly, terribly hungry. We're not talking about cutting calories. We're talking about cutting the frequency of
- **[01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5qLdSKDkEE&t=94s)** — eating. This is the most important thing.
- **[01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5qLdSKDkEE&t=96s)** — I think most people eat out of a habit, out of social reasons. They go to dinner or at night
- **[01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5qLdSKDkEE&t=103s)** — they're watching TV and they're bored and they start eating. That's the biggest thing you're going to have to overcome
- **[01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5qLdSKDkEE&t=107s)** — out of boredom. So you got to stop snacking.
- **[01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5qLdSKDkEE&t=111s)** — Lots of potassium foods. Potassium decreases the need for insulin.
- **[01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5qLdSKDkEE&t=115s)** — The B vitamins decrease the need for insulin.
- **[01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5qLdSKDkEE&t=119s)** — Chromium decreases the need for insulin.
- **[02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5qLdSKDkEE&t=125s)** — So all those minerals
- **[02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5qLdSKDkEE&t=127s)** — are really, really good. So how do you get your potassium? From big salads, large salads or vegetables.
- **[02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5qLdSKDkEE&t=133s)** — So you can do a kale shake with beet tops and kale and blend it up. It's a great...
- **[02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5qLdSKDkEE&t=138s)** — I have videos on that. So that will actually help
- **[02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5qLdSKDkEE&t=142s)** — insulin. Three to six ounces of protein with each meal. Don't have a lot of protein because that will mess you up.
- **[02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5qLdSKDkEE&t=149s)** — Just a moderate amount. Okay? High quality protein. And increase the fat.
- **[02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5qLdSKDkEE&t=155s)** — Do not do this program without
- **[02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5qLdSKDkEE&t=158s)** — adding fat because if you do lean proteins, you could spike insulin more than if you just had a fattier protein.
- **[02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5qLdSKDkEE&t=165s)** — I'm talking about healthy fats. Like even
- **[02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5qLdSKDkEE&t=169s)** — grass-fed beef is a healthy fat.
- **[02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5qLdSKDkEE&t=173s)** — Even bacon without sugar, believe it or not, is a... it's healthier than a lot of the chicken that people eat.
- **[02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5qLdSKDkEE&t=178s)** — You can do avocados. You can do coconut. You can do brie cheese. You can do nuts.
- **[03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5qLdSKDkEE&t=183s)** — You can do nut butters. All those are really good fats to help you go from one meal to the next. And of course you want to avoid
- **[03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5qLdSKDkEE&t=191s)** — sugar. Okay? Avoid sugar. That's what you want to do because
- **[03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5qLdSKDkEE&t=196s)** — you will not be able to fix insulin resistance unless you avoid sugar.
- **[03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5qLdSKDkEE&t=201s)** — But you're going to see if you're a pre-diabetic or a diabetic and you have this condition,
- **[03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5qLdSKDkEE&t=206s)** — these are the tools to help you. Now I do have a new
- **[03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5qLdSKDkEE&t=211s)** — supplement that actually is really really beneficial for insulin resistance.
- **[03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5qLdSKDkEE&t=217s)** — So you can click the link down below and check it out. But in this supplement, I have every
- **[03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5qLdSKDkEE&t=223s)** — high-powered superfood to support a healthy insulin and glucose
- **[03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5qLdSKDkEE&t=229s)** — system. So you can check it out and I go through the ingredients and I explain that.
- **[03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5qLdSKDkEE&t=234s)** — But if you were to take that, it would definitely support
- **[03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5qLdSKDkEE&t=237s)** — healthy blood sugars. Okay? Thanks for watching and I hope you enjoy the course.

*Click any timestamp to jump to that moment in the video*

- **[00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO3X3WNR5Jg&t=0s)** — I'd like to show you how to not only get rid of the symptom of peripheral neuropathy,
- **[00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO3X3WNR5Jg&t=6s)** — but also the root cause as well. Now, many doctors, practitioners will just tell you what remedy to
- **[00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO3X3WNR5Jg&t=13s)** — use without really giving you the understanding of this root mechanism in a simple way. That's
- **[00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO3X3WNR5Jg&t=21s)** — what I want to do with you because once you really understand this, it's very unlikely you're
- **[00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO3X3WNR5Jg&t=26s)** — ever going to get it again because you're going to know exactly what to do. Diabetic neuropathy
- **[00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO3X3WNR5Jg&t=31s)** — is a condition that affects usually the bottom of your feet and sometimes the hands. Now, of course,
- **[00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO3X3WNR5Jg&t=38s)** — the question is why does it affect those areas? Well, it's one of the first signs that you're
- **[00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO3X3WNR5Jg&t=44s)** — having some pretty severe problems with your blood sugar. And because you have very long
- **[00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO3X3WNR5Jg&t=48s)** — nerves in the body, the very last end of the nerve is going to be affected first because
- **[00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO3X3WNR5Jg&t=54s)** — that's the area of your body that gets the least amount of oxygen or fuel compared to
- **[01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO3X3WNR5Jg&t=60s)** — some nerves that are closer to the heart. And I'm primarily going to focus on diabetes
- **[01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO3X3WNR5Jg&t=64s)** — and blood sugar problems because there are other causes of peripheral neuropathy, but not
- **[01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO3X3WNR5Jg&t=69s)** — as common. Like, for example, chemotherapy could cause it. Hypothyroidism could cause it.
- **[01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO3X3WNR5Jg&t=75s)** — Some type of autoimmune disease, some medication of virus, and Lyme disease.
- **[01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO3X3WNR5Jg&t=80s)** — Diabetes tends to affect four tissues, nerves, arteries, eyes, kidneys. But this
- **[01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO3X3WNR5Jg&t=88s)** — peripheral neuropathy can be a real pain because you have to walk. Sometimes it's hypersensitive,
- **[01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO3X3WNR5Jg&t=93s)** — sometimes it's burning, sometimes it's severe pain, and sometimes it's just itching. But
- **[01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO3X3WNR5Jg&t=99s)** — there's some weird thing going on with the nerve. And the problem is over time, if we don't
- **[01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO3X3WNR5Jg&t=104s)** — it could end up with ulcers in your lower part of your body, gangrene. But when you understand
- **[01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO3X3WNR5Jg&t=110s)** — the mechanism, the solution is really simple. So a couple things going on with the nerves on
- **[01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO3X3WNR5Jg&t=115s)** — the bottom of your feet. If you look right here, you'll see this insulated wire, right?
- **[02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO3X3WNR5Jg&t=121s)** — This would be compared to an insulation around your nerves. And that insulation is
- **[02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO3X3WNR5Jg&t=126s)** — called myelin. And what happens with a diabetic is the myelin is breaking down to
- **[02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO3X3WNR5Jg&t=132s)** — point where you have like a raw nerve. The second thing is you're getting a lack of blood flow to
- **[02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO3X3WNR5Jg&t=137s)** — or circulation in general, nerve and blood flow to the bottom of your feet. Because you're not
- **[02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO3X3WNR5Jg&t=144s)** — getting the circulation because there's damage in the vascular system, you're going to
- **[02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO3X3WNR5Jg&t=149s)** — basically have nerves that are getting starved. But I'm going to go a little bit deeper, but
- **[02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO3X3WNR5Jg&t=153s)** — in a simple way, because I really want you to understand what's happening at the cellular
- **[02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO3X3WNR5Jg&t=158s)** — level. Because if you remember in some of my other videos, I talk about the mitochondria,
- **[02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO3X3WNR5Jg&t=163s)** — which is this little energy factory. And what happens when you consume too much sugar,
- **[02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO3X3WNR5Jg&t=170s)** — as in a diabetic situation, you overload the motor. Okay, but really there's a kind of a
- **[02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO3X3WNR5Jg&t=177s)** — pre-motor even before the mitochondria that has to break down glucose into something that
- **[03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO3X3WNR5Jg&t=184s)** — mitochondria can use. That is where the real problem is. Because we start with maybe glucose,
- **[03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO3X3WNR5Jg&t=191s)** — and then it goes through all these different steps on this assembly line to the point where
- **[03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO3X3WNR5Jg&t=197s)** — eventually the mitochondria can use that fuel and then everything works nicely, right? But
- **[03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO3X3WNR5Jg&t=203s)** — in the last step of this assembly line, there's an enzyme that stops working because
- **[03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO3X3WNR5Jg&t=209s)** — you're overloading this carburetor with too much fuel and you put out the spark plug
- **[03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO3X3WNR5Jg&t=215s)** — like vitamins and minerals. This problem really is a nutrient deficiency because when you consume
- **[03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO3X3WNR5Jg&t=221s)** — so much sugar going through the bloodstream, the increased demand for nutrients goes way, way,
- **[03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO3X3WNR5Jg&t=227s)** — way, way up. And so eventually you're going to deplete these nutrients from your tissues
- **[03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO3X3WNR5Jg&t=231s)** — and you're going to be high and dry. There's not going to be any nutrients there for the
- **[03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO3X3WNR5Jg&t=235s)** — glucose to be able to convert into the form of fuel that your mitochondria needs. So you can
- **[04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO3X3WNR5Jg&t=242s)** — imagine it's kind of like this biochemical pathway that you now get this bottleneck.
- **[04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO3X3WNR5Jg&t=246s)** — It just kind of dams up and then that backs up in the system and creates lactic acid doses
- **[04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO3X3WNR5Jg&t=252s)** — and for radical damage and all sorts of issues. Enzymes basically do all the work in the body.
- **[04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO3X3WNR5Jg&t=258s)** — They can transform one thing to another thing. And all these enzymes have coenzymes or co
- **[04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO3X3WNR5Jg&t=265s)** — factors, which basically are the vitamins and minerals. But I just want to interject one other
- **[04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO3X3WNR5Jg&t=270s)** — additional thing that happens in this process. Your body has all sorts of backup plans, like a
- **[04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO3X3WNR5Jg&t=276s)** — plan B to try to give the body energy. So one alternative pathway, the byproduct of that
- **[04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO3X3WNR5Jg&t=282s)** — pathway is sorbitol, which is a sugar alcohol. Here's the problem with sorbitol.
- **[04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO3X3WNR5Jg&t=289s)** — Sorbitol gets stuck in certain tissues, like the lens of the eye, to cause cataracts, like the
- **[04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO3X3WNR5Jg&t=299s)** — retina, which causes diabetic retinopathy, which is a problem with the retina. Because
- **[05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO3X3WNR5Jg&t=306s)** — what's happening, the cells are swelling up. Also, sorbitol gets into the cells that make
- **[05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO3X3WNR5Jg&t=312s)** — insulation around the wire, around the nerve. That swells up and that breaks up and goes haywire.
- **[05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO3X3WNR5Jg&t=320s)** — And then sorbitol also can convert to fructose, which creates more problems. The big question is,
- **[05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO3X3WNR5Jg&t=327s)** — what are these co factors that allow that enzyme to work and start to heal these nerves
- **[05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO3X3WNR5Jg&t=333s)** — so you can get rid of the pain? The first one is vitamin B1. But here's the big problem.
- **[05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO3X3WNR5Jg&t=338s)** — If you try to get your B1 from your diet when you've already had diabetes, you're going to have
- **[05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO3X3WNR5Jg&t=343s)** — a really hard time because you would need a lot of it therapeutically to fix this problem. And
- **[05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO3X3WNR5Jg&t=351s)** — this is a common thing that I hear even with doctors that don't really understand nutrition.
- **[05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO3X3WNR5Jg&t=354s)** — They'll say, well, you can get all your nutrients from your food. Well, maybe some,
- **[05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO3X3WNR5Jg&t=358s)** — but it's really hard to get all of your nutrients, especially if you're trying to
- **[06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO3X3WNR5Jg&t=362s)** — therapeutically correct something. Now, can you just take B1? Well, here's the problem with B1.
- **[06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO3X3WNR5Jg&t=369s)** — B1 is water soluble. So the water soluble has a hard time getting into that fat soluble
- **[06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO3X3WNR5Jg&t=375s)** — nerve to fix it. So it's a synthetically made fat soluble B1. It's called Benfotamine.
- **[06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO3X3WNR5Jg&t=382s)** — Normally it comes in, I think 300 milligrams. You take just one of those four times a day.
- **[06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO3X3WNR5Jg&t=387s)** — Sometimes supplements come with the next remedy I'm going to talk about, and that's called
- **[06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO3X3WNR5Jg&t=390s)** — Lipoic acid. Lipoic acid is another co-factor for that enzyme that's not working. And this is
- **[06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO3X3WNR5Jg&t=398s)** — based on working with tens of thousands of people over 30 years. And I had a huge practice
- **[06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO3X3WNR5Jg&t=404s)** — with a lot of diabetics. So I've used this over and over. So I have a lot of experience
- **[06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO3X3WNR5Jg&t=409s)** — getting success with this condition. There's three more nutrients that are involved.
- **[06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO3X3WNR5Jg&t=415s)** — Vitamin B5, vitamin B2, and vitamin B3. Those are all the co-factors for that enzyme to allow
- **[07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO3X3WNR5Jg&t=424s)** — you to metabolize the glucose. So then it can be converted to something that your mitochondria
- **[07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO3X3WNR5Jg&t=431s)** — can actually use. So hypothetically you could actually be a diabetic and not have peripheral
- **[07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO3X3WNR5Jg&t=436s)** — neuropathy if you took a lot of this nutrition. But why would you want to do that?
- **[07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO3X3WNR5Jg&t=440s)** — Why not correct it by lowering the carb? Okay, so you want to go on low carb plus
- **[07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO3X3WNR5Jg&t=445s)** — intermittent fasting. Now there's another reason why you want to do this because diabetes over
- **[07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO3X3WNR5Jg&t=452s)** — time chronically creates a cascade of all sorts of problems that go very deep into your nervous
- **[07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO3X3WNR5Jg&t=460s)** — system up into the brain. On one hand, the first type of symptoms are the foot pain and the
- **[07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO3X3WNR5Jg&t=466s)** — pain. Things like that. But then it can spread to other parts of your body, especially the
- **[07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO3X3WNR5Jg&t=472s)** — autonomic nervous system. Constipation, you might get stomach pain, things like that.
- **[07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO3X3WNR5Jg&t=477s)** — You might start having heart problems. Now you could just change your diet, right? And you're
- **[08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO3X3WNR5Jg&t=483s)** — going to feel great relief on the bottom of your foot. But I've noticed certain people
- **[08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO3X3WNR5Jg&t=489s)** — get relief but it doesn't always go away 100% unless they do high doses of benfotaminolipoic
- **[08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO3X3WNR5Jg&t=496s)** — acid. But ultimately, it's very, very important to correct the real problem,
- **[08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO3X3WNR5Jg&t=500s)** — which is the diet. And for that, you need to study and watch this video right here.

*Click any timestamp to jump to that moment in the video*

- **[00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PYi3yIiMig&t=0s)** — The shocking truth about protein bars. Protein bars are a huge industry. What's in the ingredients?
- **[00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PYi3yIiMig&t=7s)** — Let's first start with an actual candy bar. And then we're going to do a comparison with all the
- **[00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PYi3yIiMig&t=13s)** — healthy protein bars. Now if we take the Snickers bar, a 50 gram bar, 30 grams of carbs,
- **[00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PYi3yIiMig&t=19s)** — 25 grams of that is sugar. So basically we're talking about 58% of this bar is sugar. And
- **[00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PYi3yIiMig&t=25s)** — you look at the first ingredient that makes up most of this bar. And the first ingredient is
- **[00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PYi3yIiMig&t=30s)** — milk chocolate. The second is peanuts. And the third corn syrup. Pretty darn high in the
- **[00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PYi3yIiMig&t=35s)** — glycemic index. Then we have actual sugar. And then it has salt, egg whites, palm oil,
- **[00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PYi3yIiMig&t=41s)** — butter, skim milk, lactose, which is milk sugar, and peanuts. So that's what makes up
- **[00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PYi3yIiMig&t=46s)** — a Snickers bar. Now remember that as we go through these protein bars, because somehow
- **[00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PYi3yIiMig&t=52s)** — there's a perception that these protein bars are healthier than a candy bar. The first one I
- **[00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PYi3yIiMig&t=57s)** — want to go through is this one right here. This is a Cliff bar. So this Cliff bar is 68 grams.
- **[01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PYi3yIiMig&t=64s)** — Okay, so it's a little more than the candy bar. And whereas the candy bar is 58% sugar,
- **[01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PYi3yIiMig&t=70s)** — this one is merely 41% sugar. But they have virtually the same amount of carbohydrates,
- **[01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PYi3yIiMig&t=77s)** — except for the Cliff bar has like one more carbohydrate. So this is 31 grams of carbohydrate.
- **[01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PYi3yIiMig&t=83s)** — And there's three grams of fiber. So you deduct that and you get 28 net carbs. Okay,
- **[01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PYi3yIiMig&t=89s)** — and then we have 17 grams of sugar. Wait a second. So if we have this total carbohydrate
- **[01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PYi3yIiMig&t=95s)** — and we deduct the fiber and the sugar, we still have 11 grams of carbohydrate left.
- **[01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PYi3yIiMig&t=100s)** — So what is making up this 11 grams of carbohydrate? It's starches. Not like the
- **[01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PYi3yIiMig&t=107s)** — typical starches in vegetables. The starches that turn into sugar so quick, they really
- **[01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PYi3yIiMig&t=112s)** — are sugars. Because if you look at what starch is, it's just a chain of sugar molecules
- **[01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PYi3yIiMig&t=117s)** — strung together. So this really doesn't have 17 grams of sugar. When we add the 11 grams
- **[02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PYi3yIiMig&t=122s)** — of starch sugar, it really has 28 grams of sugar, which is seven teaspoons of sugar. But
- **[02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PYi3yIiMig&t=129s)** — I want to know what type of sugar we're dealing with. Well, first one is cane syrup. Then we
- **[02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PYi3yIiMig&t=136s)** — have brown rice syrup. There's some palm oil for the fat. And then here the starches. We
- **[02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PYi3yIiMig&t=141s)** — have soy flour and rice flour. Now the big thing that people are going to look at when
- **[02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PYi3yIiMig&t=146s)** — they look at the label is how much protein. Wow, 20 grams of protein. That's amazing.
- **[02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PYi3yIiMig&t=151s)** — Well, what's the quality of protein? Soy protein concentrate. That is a very low
- **[02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PYi3yIiMig&t=158s)** — quality protein. So basically we have a lot of ultra processed ingredients in this product.
- **[02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PYi3yIiMig&t=162s)** — Okay, so that's the Cliff Builders bar. Now since you're talking about bars, protein bars,
- **[02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PYi3yIiMig&t=166s)** — I want to mention an energy bar by Cliff. Okay, so we'll be talking about this one.
- **[02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PYi3yIiMig&t=172s)** — Maybe you've seen it in the grocery store. This bar is 68 grams. 55.88% of it is
- **[03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PYi3yIiMig&t=181s)** — sugar. Now remember when I talked about sugar with this one, this one has 58% sugars. 58%?
- **[03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PYi3yIiMig&t=188s)** — 56%. This is 43 grams of carbs, 5 grams of fiber, and 17 grams of sugar. Now wait a second,
- **[03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PYi3yIiMig&t=196s)** — we have something that's missing in these carbs, right? There's 21 grams of carbs that's
- **[03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PYi3yIiMig&t=202s)** — unaccounted for. So what makes up the 21 grams of carbs that they're not talking about?
- **[03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PYi3yIiMig&t=207s)** — Starches again. When you think starches, think sugar. So basically we're talking about 5.25
- **[03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PYi3yIiMig&t=214s)** — teaspoons of extra sugar that's hidden as starches. So when you consume this,
- **[03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PYi3yIiMig&t=220s)** — you're consuming 9.5 teaspoons of sugar. And then if we look at the ingredient, we have oats,
- **[03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PYi3yIiMig&t=226s)** — organic brown rice syrup, soy rice crisps, which is soy protein isolates, and rice flour,
- **[03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PYi3yIiMig&t=236s)** — organic tapioca syrup, organic cane syrup, and also the chicory fiber, organic soy flour,
- **[04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PYi3yIiMig&t=243s)** — and the soy oil. So we're dealing with a lot of starches, a lot of sugars, and then some
- **[04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PYi3yIiMig&t=248s)** — seed oil. I'm going to tell you right now, if you consume this, you're not going to have
- **[04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PYi3yIiMig&t=252s)** — sustainable energy. You're going to have some little bit of spike in energy and then you're
- **[04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PYi3yIiMig&t=255s)** — going to crash and burn and you're going to end up with low blood sugars. If you have a very
- **[04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PYi3yIiMig&t=260s)** — fast metabolism and you're exercising, you might be able to deal with it, but I know I would not
- **[04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PYi3yIiMig&t=265s)** — be able to deal with this bar right here. All right, now let's go to the Kine bar. And it
- **[04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PYi3yIiMig&t=270s)** — says the number one ingredient is heart-healthy peanuts. It says on the back, low glycemic
- **[04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PYi3yIiMig&t=277s)** — index, dairy-free, no GMO, very low sodium, no sugar alcohols, zero trans fats, and a good
- **[04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PYi3yIiMig&t=286s)** — source of fiber. Let's see if any of this is actually true. The first thing you need to know
- **[04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PYi3yIiMig&t=290s)** — is this is a 40 gram bar and if we look at the percentage of sugar, it's 37.5% of it is sugar.
- **[04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PYi3yIiMig&t=297s)** — What type of sugar? Well, if we get beyond the first ingredient, which is peanuts,
- **[05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PYi3yIiMig&t=302s)** — second ingredient is glucose syrup. Glucose syrup is not low on the glycemic index. Then
- **[05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PYi3yIiMig&t=308s)** — sugar, then honey, then palm oil, then the soy protein isolate, and they throw in the chicory
- **[05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PYi3yIiMig&t=314s)** — Your perception of healthy protein bars might be changing. Don't worry, it gets worse.
- **[05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PYi3yIiMig&t=321s)** — Okay, the next one I want to talk about is the Quest bars. Okay, the Quest bars. In one of
- **[05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PYi3yIiMig&t=327s)** — these bars, we have 60 grams. And by the way, this is 41% sugar in this bar right here. So
- **[05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PYi3yIiMig&t=334s)** — we have 25 grams of carbs. We have 12 grams of fiber and 9 grams of sugar alcohols. Now
- **[05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PYi3yIiMig&t=340s)** — if you are going to consume 9 grams of sugar alcohols, you're going to have a lot of GI
- **[05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PYi3yIiMig&t=346s)** — problems, a lot of gas, a lot of bloating, maybe some diarrhea. The first ingredient is
- **[05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PYi3yIiMig&t=350s)** — a protein blend, then polydextrose, then water, erythritol, then we get almonds,
- **[05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PYi3yIiMig&t=355s)** — then palm oil, then we have another ingredient called sodium caseinate. It says it's a high
- **[05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PYi3yIiMig&t=359s)** — quality protein, which I disagree with. And then they add a type of sweetener, sucralose,
- **[06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PYi3yIiMig&t=364s)** — milk protein isolate, and whey protein isolate. And they also have this other ingredient,
- **[06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PYi3yIiMig&t=370s)** — polydextrose. Again, we don't know what's going to happen when your good bacteria try to deal
- **[06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PYi3yIiMig&t=375s)** — with it or ferment it. We don't have the long-term safety studies. So right now we're
- **[06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PYi3yIiMig&t=380s)** — doing kind of a human experiment to find out how this affects people. And apparently,
- **[06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PYi3yIiMig&t=385s)** — you are the guinea pig. Now let's get into this one right here called pure protein. When
- **[06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PYi3yIiMig&t=394s)** — 100% of this is protein, in theory, but in reality it's not true. It has 20 grams of protein,
- **[06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PYi3yIiMig&t=403s)** — 2 grams of sugar, and let's take a look at what is in here. It's like 50 grams of product.
- **[06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PYi3yIiMig&t=410s)** — So we have 17 grams of carbohydrate, 1 gram of fiber, but only 2 grams of sugar.
- **[06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PYi3yIiMig&t=416s)** — What's left? Starches. Out of all the carbohydrates, 14 grams of that is starch.
- **[07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PYi3yIiMig&t=422s)** — Basically, we're throwing in 4 more teaspoons of sugar and they're hidden as starches. So you
- **[07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PYi3yIiMig&t=429s)** — don't notice it on the label. 34% of the pure protein is sugar. Let's talk about the ingredients.
- **[07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PYi3yIiMig&t=436s)** — What's in here? Sugar. We have tapioca starch and we also have sucralose,
- **[07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PYi3yIiMig&t=440s)** — multitol syrup, plus they add multitol. It's not low on the glycemic index and they put
- **[07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PYi3yIiMig&t=446s)** — a lot of sugar-free candy and it's the worst sugar alcohol. And of course, the type of protein
- **[07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PYi3yIiMig&t=452s)** — that is in this pure protein product is, you guessed it, soy protein isolate. The cheapest,
- **[07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PYi3yIiMig&t=459s)** — worst type of protein you can consume. All right, next one we're going to talk about
- **[07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PYi3yIiMig&t=464s)** — is this one called One. This one has 20 grams of protein, 1 gram of sugar. Wow,
- **[07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PYi3yIiMig&t=470s)** — sounds pretty good. There's 60 grams of product in this bar and there's 25 grams of carbs,
- **[07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PYi3yIiMig&t=477s)** — 8 grams of fiber, but 6 grams of sugar alcohols. That's quite high. If we look at
- **[08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PYi3yIiMig&t=481s)** — the ingredients, we have this darn multitol again, rice flour, and tapioca starch.
- **[08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PYi3yIiMig&t=486s)** — The type of protein is going to be milk protein some way. And then they add in this
- **[08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PYi3yIiMig&t=492s)** — soluble vegetable fiber, isomalt, oligosaccharide, it's sugar, and then
- **[08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PYi3yIiMig&t=497s)** — oil, which is seed oil, polydextrose, cellulose, which is basically sawdust or wood pulp.
- **[08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PYi3yIiMig&t=503s)** — And then again, the sugar that they're using is sucralose, a low quality artificial
- **[08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PYi3yIiMig&t=507s)** — sugar. 41% of this product is sugar, but probably more because of the isomalt, oligosaccharide.
- **[08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PYi3yIiMig&t=516s)** — Try to say that three times. Now we have something called Metrex or RX. It's a meal
- **[08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PYi3yIiMig&t=522s)** — replacement. So this is not necessarily a protein bar, but even though it has 30
- **[08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PYi3yIiMig&t=526s)** — grams of protein, maybe it is a protein bar, but they advertise it as a meal replacement.
- **[08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PYi3yIiMig&t=531s)** — You can just take this without having to eat. It has 100 grams of product, 30 grams of protein,
- **[08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PYi3yIiMig&t=539s)** — 17 vitamins and minerals, 48 grams of carbs, okay? One gram of fiber and 29 grams of sugar.
- **[09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PYi3yIiMig&t=548s)** — What explains the big gap? If you guessed starches, you are correct. It does have four
- **[09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PYi3yIiMig&t=552s)** — grams of sugar alcohol, 15 grams of rice starch, which is really equivalent to about four teaspoons
- **[09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PYi3yIiMig&t=559s)** — of actual sugar. Now the sugar alcohols is the maltitol syrup. Again, they're corn syrup,
- **[09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PYi3yIiMig&t=565s)** — fructose, soy protein isolate. They throw some whey in there, some milk, some egg whites.
- **[09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PYi3yIiMig&t=571s)** — And this also contains something called bioengineered food ingredients. They don't want
- **[09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PYi3yIiMig&t=576s)** — use the word GMO anymore. This right here is 48% sugar. Then we have this one is called AMRX
- **[09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PYi3yIiMig&t=585s)** — bar. First thing it says is 10 grams of protein, three tablespoons of oats. Sounds healthy.
- **[09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PYi3yIiMig&t=590s)** — Five cashews. That's healthy. Two egg whites. Wow, that's great. Two teaspoons of honey.
- **[09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PYi3yIiMig&t=595s)** — Best form of sweetener. No BS. Now let's make sure that there's nothing else in here,
- **[10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PYi3yIiMig&t=602s)** — because this gives the appearance that there are only these ingredients on here.
- **[10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PYi3yIiMig&t=607s)** — Well, almonds, blueberries, pumpkin seeds, brown rice. Brown rice? Why are they putting
- **[10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PYi3yIiMig&t=613s)** — that in there? High oleic sunflower oil. What is that? That might sound like a healthier
- **[10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PYi3yIiMig&t=618s)** — seed oil, but it's still highly processed. Then we have coconut sugar, oat fiber,
- **[10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PYi3yIiMig&t=625s)** — and sea salt. 52.73% of this is sugar. A lot of these bars are comparable to
- **[10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PYi3yIiMig&t=636s)** — a candy bar. Now if we were to compare all these bars and and try to pick out the worst
- **[10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PYi3yIiMig&t=641s)** — one, my pick would be this one right here being the worst one. And the reason for that
- **[10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PYi3yIiMig&t=646s)** — is not just the that's 41% sugar, which is a big problem, but there's also some hidden
- **[10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PYi3yIiMig&t=652s)** — and some things that are really going to mess up your blood sugars. Things that are
- **[10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PYi3yIiMig&t=656s)** — camouflaged as fiber, but are really sugars. So there's really nothing in here
- **[11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PYi3yIiMig&t=661s)** — that is healthy at all. At least some of these bars have some good ingredients in them,
- **[11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PYi3yIiMig&t=668s)** — but I couldn't really find anything in this one. So tell me what you think about
- **[11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PYi3yIiMig&t=672s)** — these protein bars. And if you found a bar that actually is healthy, please comment down
- **[11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PYi3yIiMig&t=677s)** — below. I've been looking. I just haven't found any. Now since protein is the main
- **[11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PYi3yIiMig&t=682s)** — theme of this video, if you have not seen this video on one of the best protein sources,
- **[11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PYi3yIiMig&t=688s)** — you should check it out. I put it up right here.

- **[00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpOpgq727tk&t=2s)** — Welcome, everyone. We're here with another fascinating interview with Joel Soliton. And if you haven't read his books, you need to. They're awesome.
- **[00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpOpgq727tk&t=13s)** — There's a situation that we want to talk about right now. So welcome, Joel. Can you tell us a little bit about the situation that's happening with small farmers right now in the relationship to selling food?
- **[00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpOpgq727tk&t=29s)** — Yeah, thank you, Dr. Eric. And thank you for having me on. It's a real pleasure and an honor to be with you. You know, when you walk into a Walmart or a supermarket, it's easy to assume that, well, good grief, you know, the cornucopia is here. I can have anything I want.
- **[00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpOpgq727tk&t=46s)** — And the fact is that all the food in a supermarket is carefully sanctioned, if you will, or licensed by a labyrinth of government regulations, not just food regulations, but zoning regulations and all sorts of things that make it very difficult for small farmers to sell food.
- **[01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpOpgq727tk&t=79s)** — I remember one time I had a bunch of vice presidents from, I think it was Sam's Club, Sam's Club or Costco. The nine vice presidents were on a kind of a nature tour around the East Coast. They come from Arkansas, where their headquarters is.
- **[01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpOpgq727tk&t=100s)** — And we were one of their stops. They were going to spend the day out on the Chesapeake Bay and things. And I gave them a farm tour. We're having lunch in the sales building there. And they asked me, well, they were totally impressed. They got it. They got, you know, ecological farming. They got earthworms. I mean, you know, it all resonated. Animal welfare, those sorts of things. And they asked me, well, how do we get your stuff into, you know, a cost-effective way?
- **[02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpOpgq727tk&t=133s)** — And I said, well, the first thing you have to do is allow a truck smaller than a tractor trailer to back up to your loading dock.
- **[02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpOpgq727tk&t=143s)** — Dr. Eric, end of discussion.
- **[02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpOpgq727tk&t=144s)** — And that was it. They could not, they could not even go anywhere. So that's not government regulations. That's just, that's just, you know, the system, the system is, is conceived and continues to evolve to protect the powerful interests that are there.
- **[02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpOpgq727tk&t=173s)** — And I'm not going to suggest it's a conspiracy. I'm not even sure that a lot of these people know the impact of their policies, like not letting up a one-ton truck back up to the dock.
- **[03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpOpgq727tk&t=187s)** — I mean, I could, I could tell by these folks' expression, they, the thought never occurred to them. Oh, well, a small farmer would have trouble coming in a tractor trailer.
- **[03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpOpgq727tk&t=198s)** — I don't think it ever crossed their mind. You know, it's a different world. And so, so I like to use the word conspiracy or evil intent.
- **[03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpOpgq727tk&t=206s)** — I think a lot of this stuff just happens because people aren't thinking about it. And, and, and it just is what it is.
- **[03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpOpgq727tk&t=214s)** — But the fact is that there are many things, if you start thinking about, well, wonder, wonder what it'd be like to have a truly artisanal Kraft cheese, for example, made by a local farmer with unpasteurized milk.
- **[03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpOpgq727tk&t=232s)** — What would it be like to have a, a homemade pepperoni, bologna, charcuterie made by an artisanal pork producer that the pigs ran outside, ate grass and acorns.
- **[04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpOpgq727tk&t=248s)** — And, and, and, you know, this, this person made these real specialty, you know, Polish sausage and things. But, but that none of that exists.
- **[04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpOpgq727tk&t=263s)** — In fact, in Virginia right now, in Virginia right now, there is not, if, if, if as a small farmer, if I want to make and sell a hot dog, I mean, a good hot dog, not, you know, not scrapings off the floor somewhere, but a good all meat hot dog with no, no fillers, no junk in it, just, you know, beef and pork.
- **[04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpOpgq727tk&t=287s)** — Yeah.
- **[04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpOpgq727tk&t=289s)** — There is not a place in Virginia that can, that can make a legal hot dog that I can sell.
- **[04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpOpgq727tk&t=297s)** — Unbelievable.
- **[04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpOpgq727tk&t=298s)** — Incredible.
- **[04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpOpgq727tk&t=299s)** — So in order for me to sell a hot dog, I have to ship, you know, boned, boneless product up to Pennsylvania and pay a large facility there to, you know, to make our hot dogs and then ship them back to ourselves.
- **[05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpOpgq727tk&t=317s)** — Wow.
- **[05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpOpgq727tk&t=319s)** — And, and, and then of course that makes the price of the food a little bit higher. So then, then you get accused of being an, oh, you're a food elitist. Look at your prices.
- **[05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpOpgq727tk&t=329s)** — Yeah.
- **[05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpOpgq727tk&t=329s)** — When I have to...
- **[05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpOpgq727tk&t=331s)** — Yeah.
- **[05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpOpgq727tk&t=332s)** — Yeah.
- **[05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpOpgq727tk&t=333s)** — I want to support a local farmer, a small farmer that's doing it right because that's the type of food I want to eat, but it's, it's becoming very difficult to get that food.
- **[05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpOpgq727tk&t=343s)** — And I can see why all the regulations and the support for the bigger industry. So it's making it harder and harder.
- **[05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpOpgq727tk&t=350s)** — One of the things that you're doing is you're having a conference with a bunch of farmers that are very creative, right?
- **[05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpOpgq727tk&t=357s)** — Can you tell us a little bit about that solution?
- **[06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpOpgq727tk&t=360s)** — Yeah. So, so the rogue food conference was started about four years ago and John Moody and I kind of started it.
- **[06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpOpgq727tk&t=369s)** — I'd been wanting to do this for years, but I needed a, I needed a manager sidekick. I'm a visionary.
- **[06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpOpgq727tk&t=377s)** — Okay. I'm a dreamer. I'm out here in La La Land and I need a stage manager.
- **[06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpOpgq727tk&t=382s)** — You know, I can conceive the theme and the story, but I, you know, I'm not the guy to actually run the stage.
- **[06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpOpgq727tk&t=388s)** — And so John Moody came along and said, yeah, I'll do that.
- **[06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpOpgq727tk&t=392s)** — And so we launched the first one in the spring of 2020, literally one week before the lockdown started.
- **[06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpOpgq727tk&t=399s)** — And, and the theme is circumvention, not compliance.
- **[06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpOpgq727tk&t=405s)** — What happens, Dr. Eric, is that when, when regulations become so onerous that they prohibit competition coming to the table, to the marketplace table,
- **[06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpOpgq727tk&t=418s)** — there comes a time when it's, it's actually more efficient to figure out a circumvented way, you know, an end run than it is to try to run up through the middle with and agree to comply with everything.
- **[07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpOpgq727tk&t=436s)** — And so, so we started looking around the country, said, where are the people that have figured out how to do this, how to make an end run?
- **[07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpOpgq727tk&t=445s)** — And lo and behold, there are a bunch of them. I mean, wow, it not not myriads by any means, but there's enough to actually create a nascent movement.
- **[07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpOpgq727tk&t=455s)** — So this will be our what, seventh or eighth rogue food conference. It's going to be here in Virginia at we're going to be hosting it at our farm.
- **[07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpOpgq727tk&t=463s)** — And, and, and we'll be showcasing people and what we've been doing is showcasing ideas and people. So let me give you a couple of examples.
- **[07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpOpgq727tk&t=476s)** — One is a lady in North Carolina that has started a 501 C3 food church. You join her church, you get the food and your your and her whatever her her protection is freedom of religion.
- **[08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpOpgq727tk&t=496s)** — It's my religion. It's my religion that I'm to take care of my body. It actually doesn't belong to me. It belongs to God. And it's not supposed to have junk.
- **[08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpOpgq727tk&t=510s)** — And so in order for it to not get junk, and in other words, it's it's part of the whole, you know, the whole religious experience.
- **[08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpOpgq727tk&t=518s)** — Okay, so that's one example and the state, North Carolina has tried to shut her down and shut her down. She's had as many as six, six food police cars.
- **[08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpOpgq727tk&t=529s)** — Police are, yeah, parked outside her, her warehouse there, and they can't touch her. She said, you know, you have no jurisdiction here. This is, you know, freedom of religion.
- **[09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpOpgq727tk&t=540s)** — And so far, she's she's winning that that argument. There's a guy in in Florida who has gone under the pet food regulation.
- **[09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpOpgq727tk&t=554s)** — And so about about eight, nine years ago, he was rated for selling unlicensed dairy products. So he was milk and cows and selling ice cream and kefir and yogurt milk and butter, completely unlicensed.
- **[09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpOpgq727tk&t=571s)** — But his customers were thrilled. The stuff was unbelievably good. And they felt better. And, you know, people wanted it. And so he was selling it. Well, he got he got bussed, as they say, he got busted.
- **[09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpOpgq727tk&t=583s)** — And so as a result, working with the Farm to Consumer Legal Defense Fund, which is a group of attorneys that kind of like the Home School Legal Defense Association, they got Florida, whatever, bureaucracy to craft pet food licenses that you could license any food for twenty five dollars and register as a pet food.
- **[10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpOpgq727tk&t=606s)** — I love it. And so he he licenses milk and kefir and yogurt, twenty five dollars a piece as a pet food, and now sells food not fit not for human consumption.
- **[10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpOpgq727tk&t=617s)** — Eric, within within within one year of that new, you know, kind of new policy going into effect, twelve raw full time raw milk dairy sprang up in Florida. And I was down there about two years later, doing some some kind of local local foodie foodie talks in Gainesville, Tallahassee, Orlando, some of the big cities.
- **[10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpOpgq727tk&t=640s)** — And it was interesting, these young, you know, generation C, 30 year old, you know, urban foodies said, hey, we know where the good stuff is. The good stuff is the pet food. And that had completely permeated the local food movement. So, you know, that's that's another one.
- **[11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpOpgq727tk&t=660s)** — That's great.
- **[11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpOpgq727tk&t=660s)** — The lady in Minnesota that went under the fish bait code. So she she was taking these. She was taking cheese and actually she was in Wisconsin, taking cheese in the Minneapolis farmers market.
- **[11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpOpgq727tk&t=675s)** — And she got busted for, you know, unlicensed cheese. And so she called the state said, is there a law? Is there some rule about fish bait? A lot of fishing up in Wisconsin, Minnesota, all the Great Lakes. What regulations do they have? Well, not really any just as long as it's edible.
- **[11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpOpgq727tk&t=692s)** — And so now she sells fish bait coldly fish bait cheddar fish bait Swiss and nobody touches her. Oh, my God.
- **[11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpOpgq727tk&t=702s)** — There's there's there's the private membership association. That's a real hot item. And at this conference, we're actually going to have a public debate.
- **[11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpOpgq727tk&t=710s)** — There are there are defenders and detractors of the private membership association, which is assembly, which is essentially I I join a private member. It was developed in the 1960s in the deep south by country clubs to not comply with the Civil Rights Act.
- **[12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpOpgq727tk&t=730s)** — This is this is not public. And so this is a private club and we can do whatever we want. And and of course, these were powerful, you know, powerful interests, definitely prejudiced.
- **[12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpOpgq727tk&t=744s)** — And and but they created a precedent of a legal entity that is not a public thing. It's in other words, one of the one of the phrases that we hear is we got to protect the public interest, you know, food safety, the public interest, public interest.
- **[12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpOpgq727tk&t=762s)** — But what about what about the private interest? What about the interest of the private? Right. What if I don't want the public to to to agree that the what if I don't want public food or food that passes public muster? Right.
- **[13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpOpgq727tk&t=785s)** — And I want private food. So that's a big one. Here's another one. This is one that's just that's just come out through our movement. And I don't know that anybody's really doing this, but I think it's got some legs for somebody that's creative.
- **[13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpOpgq727tk&t=800s)** — So with the Internet now, you know, you can take all sorts of courses. You can learn how to sew and cook and fly an airplane and, you know, whatever. Make all sorts of things. So are all these courses.
- **[13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpOpgq727tk&t=812s)** — Well, there are people now where you can take, for example, a butchery course and you pay two or three hundred dollars. And part of the the the textbook, the whatever the the tools of the course is you get one hundred pounds of meat or 50 pounds of meat.
- **[13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpOpgq727tk&t=831s)** — And so my customers just sign up. They pay for a course. And part of the course materials are free meat.
- **[14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpOpgq727tk&t=841s)** — That is so creative. Yeah. So the whole principle here, just to cut to the chase, where the government gets involved is in commerce. That freight in commerce. Well, the courts have determined specific things of what what does it mean when there's a sale?
- **[14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpOpgq727tk&t=860s)** — What does what does in commerce mean? And so a lot of this, you know, creativity is surrounding a legal way to transact.
- **[14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpOpgq727tk&t=876s)** — A trade that does not come under the the purview of commerce, because, you know, you can give away all the stuff I've described. You can give it away. You just can't sell it. In fact, you can even buy it. It's not illegal to buy it. It's only illegal to sell it.
- **[14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpOpgq727tk&t=898s)** — Fascinating. Fascinating. So so that's what we're doing. And it's gaining legs. There are people now that are that are hybridizing. And I'll take a piece of this and a piece of that and putting their own creativity.
- **[15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpOpgq727tk&t=910s)** — And so every we're doing two of these a year. The next one's here. The one in the fall is going to be in Dallas, Texas. I think the next one's going to be in Florida.
- **[15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpOpgq727tk&t=920s)** — We just did one in the Pacific Northwest up in Battleground, Washington. And so we're moving it around the country. And every time we have more and more people that are being successful at thwarting the bureaucracy that keeps, you know, small producers from being able to access the market.
- **[15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpOpgq727tk&t=941s)** — So if you wanted to, let's say, for example, sell pot pies from your farm, would you run into a couple barriers?
- **[15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpOpgq727tk&t=951s)** — Oh, man. We we tried this actually about about four years ago. We we had a summer chef who who. So in the summer when we have our stewards, we have a summer chef who cooks for us.
- **[16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpOpgq727tk&t=969s)** — So our whole farm crew, there's about 25 to 27 of us, can all eat, you know, as a as a family together communally. And it's a wonderful way to end the day.
- **[16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpOpgq727tk&t=982s)** — And so so she wanted to stay. The problem is, it's only five months. It's May 1 to September 30. And well, what am I going to do the rest of the seven months?
- **[16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpOpgq727tk&t=991s)** — So she said, I know what we'll do. Let's let's make pot pies. And this gal, this young lady was a graduate of the Culinary Institute of America at Hyde Park, New York.
- **[16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpOpgq727tk&t=1001s)** — She actually had a credential. She was diploma. And so so I have always wanted to make pot pies, chicken pot pie, beef pot pie.
- **[16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpOpgq727tk&t=1012s)** — I love pot pie, you know, and all the permutations, shepherd's pie, you know, all those kinds of things. Pot pie.
- **[17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpOpgq727tk&t=1020s)** — And and our customers are always asking for that. You know, we'd love to get pot pie. So let's make some.
- **[17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpOpgq727tk&t=1028s)** — So she started down this pathway. And, of course, the first thing the first thing she's they told her she needed was a commercial kitchen.
- **[17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpOpgq727tk&t=1037s)** — Well, we have a pretty nice commercial kitchen here at the farm. It's not licensed.
- **[17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpOpgq727tk&t=1044s)** — The problem was it has to have a licensed bathroom. Now, this thing is only 100 yards from our house.
- **[17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpOpgq727tk&t=1055s)** — If she wants to go to the bathroom, she can run to our house and use the bathroom.
- **[17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpOpgq727tk&t=1061s)** — But no, a commercial kitchen has to have an attached bathroom. I said, well, can it be a composting toilet?
- **[17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpOpgq727tk&t=1067s)** — No, it has to be water based, porcelain, you know, the whole nine yards.
- **[17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpOpgq727tk&t=1072s)** — Well, what if I'm happy with it? No, no, no, no, no. It doesn't matter.
- **[17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpOpgq727tk&t=1076s)** — And so suddenly a little trial balloon suddenly costs forty thousand dollars of of licensed lagoons and, you know, bathroom facilities just to try a pot pie.
- **[18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpOpgq727tk&t=1093s)** — So I got to asking them, I said, now, wait a minute. Food trucks.
- **[18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpOpgq727tk&t=1098s)** — I can go to Charlottesville and there's a couple of food trucks over there at the UVA campus selling meat pies.
- **[18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpOpgq727tk&t=1104s)** — They sell them all the time in Australia out of food trucks. Food truck is making meat pies.
- **[18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpOpgq727tk&t=1110s)** — They don't have a bathroom. The inspector said, no, and that's a loophole.
- **[18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpOpgq727tk&t=1115s)** — We'd like to close and we're trying to figure out how to do it.
- **[18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpOpgq727tk&t=1118s)** — I said, wait a minute. Are you telling me that if I put this kitchen we have right here, if I put it on a chassis on a chassis with wheels, then I wouldn't need a bathroom?
- **[18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpOpgq727tk&t=1129s)** — He said, absolutely. That's exactly correct. But then the problem is, then the problem is you can't sell them off site.
- **[18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpOpgq727tk&t=1137s)** — So if it's a food truck, you can't make food in there and sell it on off site. You can only sell it from the food truck.
- **[19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpOpgq727tk&t=1150s)** — So so so we went around and around. I could go into more detail, but you get you get the picture here.
- **[19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpOpgq727tk&t=1157s)** — It's all just to sell a meat pie.
- **[19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpOpgq727tk&t=1161s)** — You know, I think what's happening is the vilification of the foods that have the lowest margins like meat products and things like that, especially.
- **[19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpOpgq727tk&t=1173s)** — I mean, if you take I looked at how much it costs to buy some corn, the dent corn, it's about it's it's two hundred and ninety eight dollars per metric ton.
- **[19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpOpgq727tk&t=1185s)** — You can you can actually create over six thousand boxes of corn flakes from that, which comes out to roughly about a seven thousand percent margin on corn.
- **[19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpOpgq727tk&t=1198s)** — But for these other products that you have to grow. Oh, my gosh. It's like I mean, like incredibly hard.
- **[20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpOpgq727tk&t=1206s)** — So the barriers to entry. So I am all about supporting the person who's doing it right.
- **[20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpOpgq727tk&t=1211s)** — Small farmers. What about is there something somewhere a person can go to maybe find a network or a kind of a place where they could find a to find a place to get food locally.
- **[20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpOpgq727tk&t=1230s)** — Is there already like maybe a database or something you have on your side or somewhere that someone could find that we take everyone and consolidate them into one place so we could find out where we can support these these small farmers?
- **[20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpOpgq727tk&t=1244s)** — Yeah, well, I mean, there are there are shopping sites. I mean, I don't know if I have.
- **[20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpOpgq727tk&t=1255s)** — One right here. I don't I can't put my hands on it, but anyway, Weston A Price Foundation, Weston A Price Foundation has the Smart Smart Shoppers Guide.
- **[21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpOpgq727tk&t=1265s)** — That's a wonderful one. They call it the shop, the shop heard around the world, you know, instead of the shop around the shop heard around the world.
- **[21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpOpgq727tk&t=1273s)** — They have that and, you know, there are some others, but the main thing is you just you just you just start sleuthing.
- **[21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpOpgq727tk&t=1283s)** — I mean, this is an entire local food scene is a kind of a subculture. It's a it's a subculture kind of a tribal subculture, just like any other tribal subculture.
- **[21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpOpgq727tk&t=1296s)** — And, you know, you're not going to find it if you're just perched on your couch watching Netflix and the NFL football game with a with a Pabst blue ribbon beer in your hand.
- **[21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpOpgq727tk&t=1307s)** — Ain't going to happen. OK. You know, the the the most frustrating thing in the whole, you know, authentic integrity food movement, as you know, it's really hard to get people to change their routine.
- **[22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpOpgq727tk&t=1326s)** — Diet is one of the most whatever fundamental routines we have.
- **[22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpOpgq727tk&t=1330s)** — You know, I like this kind of food. I like this kind of food. And and so if you're going to change, it's going to it's going to take a real act of the will and act of conviction to, you know, to make a change.
- **[22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpOpgq727tk&t=1344s)** — And so you have to decide I'm going to participate. I'm going to, you know, I'm going to make a change.
- **[22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpOpgq727tk&t=1353s)** — And so that doesn't happen. You know, fair fairies don't drop all that into your lap. So you have to sleuth it out.
- **[22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpOpgq727tk&t=1362s)** — And every area has its, you know, has its good farmers. I mean, farmers markets are good places to start.
- **[22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpOpgq727tk&t=1370s)** — You know, talk, talk to friends, you know, go see if there's if there's some like a boutique, a boutique market in your area, selling local stuff, go in and buy from them, see who's doing it and then look them up, see where they are, see how far they are.
- **[23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpOpgq727tk&t=1390s)** — And you can start patronizing them. It's really quite a close fraternity. I mean, if somebody asked me, like, we, you know, we don't grow all of our own food. We get our we get our apples, we get about 10 bushels of apples a year from an organic orchard up about an hour and a half away from us in Front Royal.
- **[23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpOpgq727tk&t=1410s)** — And we get we get those apples in and spend a couple days, you know, making applesauce, Teresa cans, I don't know what 80 90 quarts and that's our that's where your supply of apples off, you know, if somebody asked me, where do I get apples? I'll tell them, you know, go there and get them.
- **[23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpOpgq727tk&t=1427s)** — And so there's there's an entire network, you know, under the radar. It's not at Walmart. It's not at Costco. It's not at, you know, by Lowe's, Piggly Wiggly or, you know, any of the any of the regular outfits, you're going to have to go, you know, under the under the orthodoxy and and find it out.
- **[24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpOpgq727tk&t=1450s)** — But it's very it's very much there. And trust me, it's worth the hunt.
- **[24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpOpgq727tk&t=1457s)** — Yeah, yeah.
- **[24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpOpgq727tk&t=1458s)** — Even like, I think you're probably familiar. Are you familiar with Carnivore Snacks, that company?
- **[24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpOpgq727tk&t=1464s)** — Uh huh.
- **[24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpOpgq727tk&t=1465s)** — So they recently kind of the they shut them down.
- **[24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpOpgq727tk&t=1469s)** — I think they got reopened. But they shut them down because of their their dehydrating process. They took these little shavings of carnivore meat and they just put salt and meat on it. And they said, oh, yeah, you can't do that. So they just shut them down.
- **[24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpOpgq727tk&t=1486s)** — But they kind of reopened. They had to change this and that. But I think they'll probably be contacting you or even coming to this event because I think this is really awesome what you're doing because you're you're organizing creative people to gather, gather, share these creative solutions that there's always a solution so more people can do it. I think that's brilliant.
- **[25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpOpgq727tk&t=1511s)** — And there's so many and I know in Virginia, I'm in Virginia, there's so many homesteaders and people getting into this. I think that I'm going to definitely put the date and the location the site down in the description. But I think when is it going to be next month?
- **[25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpOpgq727tk&t=1530s)** — It's actually yes next month, but we're very close to next month now.
- **[25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpOpgq727tk&t=1535s)** — Right.
- **[25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpOpgq727tk&t=1538s)** — It's May 18, I think is I'm right on that. May 18.
- **[25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpOpgq727tk&t=1545s)** — So it's April 26 today. So it's going to be May 18. Yeah, May 18. It's coming up.
- **[25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpOpgq727tk&t=1551s)** — So it's coming up. And of course, you know, on that day, we'll have two, we'll have a wonderful wood, wood fired sausage and egg breakfast for folks on the morning for breakfast. And then we'll have a wonderful probably chicken barbecue for lunch directly from our farm.
- **[26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpOpgq727tk&t=1570s)** — And I mean, it's worth coming just for the food. Yeah. But the fellowship, listen, you know, it's especially for farmers and for, you know, non farmers looking for this kind of food for a city person.
- **[26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpOpgq727tk&t=1589s)** — Sometimes you'll have a friend that would like to do this and they're stuck.
- **[26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpOpgq727tk&t=1593s)** — And you need to be the catalyst. Say, Hey, I went to this thing and there's solutions here. You don't have to spend a half a million dollars building this infrastructure. Let's think about a creative way here to, you know, to market so that we don't have to, you know, go through all that.
- **[26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpOpgq727tk&t=1612s)** — Because there are there are thousands of wannabe entrepreneurs out here in the food space ready to, you know, to serve our neighbors.
- **[27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpOpgq727tk&t=1625s)** — But we're preclude, we're prohibited from doing so because of these extremely high and onerous license barriers.
- **[27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpOpgq727tk&t=1633s)** — Yeah, that's I'm going to try to make it myself because I think the key to our health is this food, this real food. And so this is kind of what I want to keep supporting simply because you go to the grocery store, it's even hard to find food nowadays.
- **[27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpOpgq727tk&t=1648s)** — So you have to really hunt and pick to find real good food. But this is a this is great. I'm going to put your information down below for those of you watching.
- **[27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpOpgq727tk&t=1659s)** — Definitely if you can come and if you can't come, I think there's also you're going to keep you're going to put it on digital format to you have a digital version of that as well. Right.
- **[27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpOpgq727tk&t=1668s)** — It will. It'll be out. I mean, it's not it's not it's not going to be streamed, but it'll be edited and it'll be out, you know, later on later on.
- **[27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpOpgq727tk&t=1677s)** — Yeah. And if I may, you know, make one shameless, a selfish plug. Yeah. If if you have somebody listening and they're they're OK. You know what? I need to do this. I need to make this happen in my life. I need to quit buying, you know, Tyson chicken or organic chicken.
- **[28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpOpgq727tk&t=1694s)** — That's really just in a in a factory confinement house. I want chickens that actually get bugs run around in the fresh air and sunshine and actually eat green grass and aren't just, you know, able to look out and see green grass.
- **[28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpOpgq727tk&t=1708s)** — We ship nationwide. And and as far as I know, what we can tell what we do is legal. But, you know, I wrote a book. Everything. Everything I want to do is illegal.
- **[28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpOpgq727tk&t=1721s)** — Right. And so so and we're pretty high profile. So we try to stay within. But what we push, you know, we push the limits. I mean, it could be that, you know, that we're supposed to get a permit to have this gathering.
- **[28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpOpgq727tk&t=1737s)** — Well, we've never asked for a permit and we just, you know, go on and do it. Don't ask, don't tell. It's easier to ask forgiveness than permission. And so we just go on.
- **[29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpOpgq727tk&t=1746s)** — And so so, you know, even if you're a non farmer, it would do you well to come and a see what farmers go through trying to get good food to you and be learn some of the things that if you if you want to encourage your local farmer who's struggling in this space, you know, you could have some options and say, you know, here's here's a group.
- **[29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpOpgq727tk&t=1771s)** — Because when you as you know, when you don't when you don't cotton will say cotton to the orthodoxy. It's lonely. It's lonely. And and so we need the camaraderie and a fellowship and the encouragement that comes from finding other needs that haven't bowed.
- **[29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpOpgq727tk&t=1793s)** — Absolutely. Absolutely. This is our food at stake. So, very important. So I'll put the information down below. Hopefully everyone could make or not everyone. Of course, those who are interested, come by and thank you, Joel, for being on here and supporting this and putting this on. I think this is an awesome high purpose activity.
- **[30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpOpgq727tk&t=1816s)** — Great. Thank you. Thank you for giving me the platform and I look forward to our next rendezvous.
- **[30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpOpgq727tk&t=1822s)** — Awesome.

- **[00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8kPjMd8akI&t=0s)** — I'm going to show you how to use just two ingredients to whiten your teeth at home.
- **[00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8kPjMd8akI&t=4s)** — You don't need to go to the dentist and do this very expensive procedure.
- **[00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8kPjMd8akI&t=8s)** — You also don't even need to buy those whitening strips.
- **[00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8kPjMd8akI&t=11s)** — This remedy is going to cost you about three dollars and it's super effective.
- **[00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8kPjMd8akI&t=15s)** — If your teeth are a bit stained like yellow from coffee, tea, red wine,
- **[00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8kPjMd8akI&t=19s)** — or just getting older, this will be a great solution.
- **[00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8kPjMd8akI&t=22s)** — After the recipe, I'm going to also talk about oil pulling and also some fascinating
- **[00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8kPjMd8akI&t=26s)** — information about leaky gums. You can actually have a situation where you're getting bacteria
- **[00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8kPjMd8akI&t=31s)** — that goes into your gums, into your bloodstream. So that's going to be very important to learn
- **[00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8kPjMd8akI&t=35s)** — about that. If you want to make your teeth super white, there's two things you need to have.
- **[00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8kPjMd8akI&t=40s)** — Number one, you need baking soda. I found baking soda at the store for a dollar seventy-nine.
- **[00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8kPjMd8akI&t=46s)** — This will add a certain texture to this paste to allow you to scrub your teeth and help remove
- **[00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8kPjMd8akI&t=52s)** — the stain as well as plaque. It's gentle. It's non-abrasive. Number two, you're going
- **[00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8kPjMd8akI&t=56s)** — to need something called hydrogen peroxide. I recently found some for a dollar sixty for an
- **[01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8kPjMd8akI&t=61s)** — entire bottle. Now, it's very important that you don't get the wrong hydrogen peroxide.
- **[01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8kPjMd8akI&t=65s)** — You want the one that says three percent or less. You do not want the one that's like
- **[01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8kPjMd8akI&t=71s)** — fifteen percent or forty percent. That's going to be way too strong. And by the way,
- **[01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8kPjMd8akI&t=75s)** — the main ingredient in these whitening strips that you'd buy online is hydrogen peroxide,
- **[01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8kPjMd8akI&t=81s)** — but they charge you like twenty, thirty, forty dollars for these little strips. You don't
- **[01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8kPjMd8akI&t=85s)** — need to do that. Then when you go to dentists, it's even more expensive and they're using a
- **[01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8kPjMd8akI&t=89s)** — very concentrated hydrogen peroxide, which is up into the forties. The problem with that is,
- **[01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8kPjMd8akI&t=94s)** — yes, it does work on making your teeth whiter, but that super high concentrated hydrogen
- **[01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8kPjMd8akI&t=99s)** — peroxide on your gums with the ultraviolet or LED lights that they put at the same time
- **[01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8kPjMd8akI&t=105s)** — that intensifies that chemical reaction can really mess with your gums and dehydrate your
- **[01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8kPjMd8akI&t=112s)** — teeth to the point where now you have this sensation in your teeth that they hurt because
- **[01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8kPjMd8akI&t=116s)** — the concentration is too high. Yes, it'll work a little faster, but you don't want to put that
- **[02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8kPjMd8akI&t=122s)** — in your mouth. Here's what you're going to do. Get a little container and you're going to
- **[02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8kPjMd8akI&t=125s)** — put one teaspoon of baking soda in the container. Then you're going to take the hydrogen
- **[02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8kPjMd8akI&t=129s)** — peroxide three percent or less, and you're only going to use three drops of it into
- **[02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8kPjMd8akI&t=134s)** — this baking soda. And then eight drops of water. You're going to mix it up really nice,
- **[02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8kPjMd8akI&t=139s)** — and it's going to actually break up the bonds of the stain. The stain is a certain chain of
- **[02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8kPjMd8akI&t=146s)** — molecules. Well, the oxygen will break that up and release this pigment from your teeth,
- **[02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8kPjMd8akI&t=152s)** — causing you to have whiter teeth. This is why hydrogen peroxide is so important. Then you're
- **[02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8kPjMd8akI&t=156s)** — going to mix it up. Take your toothbrush and gently polish the outside of your teeth,
- **[02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8kPjMd8akI&t=161s)** — the inside of your teeth. This is also going to help any bacteria that you have as well.
- **[02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8kPjMd8akI&t=165s)** — It's also going to reduce the plaque formation. You're basically going to brush your teeth with
- **[02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8kPjMd8akI&t=170s)** — this mixture for one to two minutes. Then you're going to rinse out your mouth very
- **[02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8kPjMd8akI&t=175s)** — thoroughly. But because the concentration is less than the 40 percent that you would see
- **[03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8kPjMd8akI&t=180s)** — when you go to the dentist, you're going to have to do this a few times a week. I would
- **[03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8kPjMd8akI&t=183s)** — recommend doing it two to three times a week for a few weeks to see the big change. But it's
- **[03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8kPjMd8akI&t=188s)** — going to work. You will be amazed. And I do want you to comment down below when you see the
- **[03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8kPjMd8akI&t=193s)** — The whole point of this is to do it safely and gradually. This way you won't damage your gums
- **[03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8kPjMd8akI&t=199s)** — or the enamel on your teeth. That was simple. Now let's talk about oil poling.
- **[03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8kPjMd8akI&t=203s)** — You probably have heard this on the internet where people are taking coconut oil and they
- **[03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8kPjMd8akI&t=208s)** — put it in their mouth and they kind of swish it around for a period of time. Right? What is
- **[03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8kPjMd8akI&t=212s)** — that doing? What is that all about? This is actually an ancient practice. And they didn't
- **[03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8kPjMd8akI&t=217s)** — just use coconut oil back then. They used sesame seed oil. So you can do that too. But
- **[03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8kPjMd8akI&t=222s)** — less bitter and it's more of a pleasant taste. And it will work because what you're going to do
- **[03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8kPjMd8akI&t=226s)** — is you're going to take some coconut oil and you're going to keep it in there for 10 to 20
- **[03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8kPjMd8akI&t=231s)** — minutes. You're just going to keep swishing it around your mouth. Coconut oil is very high in
- **[03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8kPjMd8akI&t=235s)** — something called lauric acid, which is a very powerful antimicrobial for bacteria, fungus,
- **[04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8kPjMd8akI&t=243s)** — candida, and especially the microbe in your mouth that causes bad breath. And there was even
- **[04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8kPjMd8akI&t=248s)** — a study in the Indian Journal of Dental Research showing this procedure as effective as prescription
- **[04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8kPjMd8akI&t=255s)** — mouthwash in reducing gingivitis. Most people do it like three times a week. I want to talk
- **[04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8kPjMd8akI&t=261s)** — about something even more interesting. The relationship between sugar or glucose and
- **[04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8kPjMd8akI&t=266s)** — vitamin C. What I wanted to reveal about this is that glucose has a similar chemistry
- **[04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8kPjMd8akI&t=273s)** — to vitamin C. They compete together. You've probably heard of scurvy before. Scurvy is a
- **[04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8kPjMd8akI&t=279s)** — disease that happened to sailors and other people way back in the day where they basically
- **[04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8kPjMd8akI&t=285s)** — did not have enough vitamin C. At that time it wasn't even recognized. One thing the vitamin
- **[04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8kPjMd8akI&t=288s)** — C does is support your collagen. When you're really deficient in vitamin C, you can get
- **[04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8kPjMd8akI&t=293s)** — pink toothbrush because your gums will bleed if you consume a lot of sugar or chew gum a
- **[04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8kPjMd8akI&t=298s)** — lot. The vitamin C that you're taking or from the foods, the glucose will block the vitamin C
- **[05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8kPjMd8akI&t=304s)** — from going in. Sugar depletes vitamin C from the body. It'll definitely show up as one of
- **[05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8kPjMd8akI&t=310s)** — the first signs in the gums. You know, you're flossing your teeth and all of a sudden it
- **[05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8kPjMd8akI&t=313s)** — bleeds easily. That's an early sign. The cells in the tissue of your gums are no longer
- **[05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8kPjMd8akI&t=318s)** — like tight. They're kind of loose. So you have these holes very similar to having leaky
- **[05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8kPjMd8akI&t=323s)** — gut or even leakiness in your arteries. That would make a pathogen enter that area
- **[05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8kPjMd8akI&t=328s)** — and get into the body into the bloodstream. I don't know if you know this fact,
- **[05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8kPjMd8akI&t=332s)** — but they've isolated dental bacteria in the placking of arteries and also in the placking
- **[05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8kPjMd8akI&t=340s)** — in the brain and Alzheimer's. We want to keep the bacteria from going into the body
- **[05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8kPjMd8akI&t=345s)** — through the mouth. Thanks for watching and I will see you in the next video.

- **[00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_Mb7BIo6hA&t=0s)** — There is a hidden reason why people are aging a lot faster than they should be.
- **[00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_Mb7BIo6hA&t=4s)** — And this is really important. And unfortunately, a lot of people are not concerned about aging until they start to age.
- **[00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_Mb7BIo6hA&t=10s)** — At any age, you need to know this.
- **[00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_Mb7BIo6hA&t=12s)** — If we have too much iron, we do not live as long.
- **[00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_Mb7BIo6hA&t=15s)** — And it's related to iron deficiency anemia.
- **[00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_Mb7BIo6hA&t=18s)** — If most of us are deficient in iron and we get it in the diet, obviously that should improve it to some degree, right?
- **[00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_Mb7BIo6hA&t=24s)** — On the flip side, we're accumulating more and more iron.
- **[00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_Mb7BIo6hA&t=27s)** — There is an incredible paper by Professor Bruce Ames. I'm going to put it down below.
- **[00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_Mb7BIo6hA&t=32s)** — Which talks about some research that he did in identifying old tissue versus younger tissue as it relates to iron.
- **[00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_Mb7BIo6hA&t=39s)** — Well, we have all sorts of amazing systems in the body to protect us against iron.
- **[00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_Mb7BIo6hA&t=44s)** — Iron rusts out our organs.
- **[00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_Mb7BIo6hA&t=48s)** — If you took something called hydrogen peroxide, you probably have it in your medicine chest.
- **[00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_Mb7BIo6hA&t=52s)** — You take hydrogen peroxide and put it on open wound and you see it bubbling up and it kills bacteria.
- **[00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_Mb7BIo6hA&t=58s)** — Just think about adding hydrogen peroxide to iron.
- **[01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_Mb7BIo6hA&t=61s)** — It's going to be severely reactive. That creates a lot of damage within your cells.
- **[01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_Mb7BIo6hA&t=66s)** — The DNA of the cells, the membrane, the mitochondria.
- **[01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_Mb7BIo6hA&t=69s)** — I'm not drinking hydrogen peroxide, so how would that be a problem?
- **[01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_Mb7BIo6hA&t=72s)** — Your body makes hydrogen peroxide.
- **[01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_Mb7BIo6hA&t=74s)** — Not to mention our immune system uses hydrogen peroxide to kill microbes.
- **[01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_Mb7BIo6hA&t=78s)** — But if that system breaks down, all hell breaks loose.
- **[01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_Mb7BIo6hA&t=81s)** — I think what happens with these anemic kids, they have something called dysfunctional iron.
- **[01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_Mb7BIo6hA&t=86s)** — Where iron is locked up to the point where it's not available to the red blood cells so they become anemic.
- **[01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_Mb7BIo6hA&t=91s)** — Yet at the same time, they might have too much.
- **[01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_Mb7BIo6hA&t=93s)** — Here we are adding all this iron to the food supply and we're wondering why it doesn't work.
- **[01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_Mb7BIo6hA&t=98s)** — It may be even making things worse.
- **[01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_Mb7BIo6hA&t=100s)** — Too much iron will really put you at risk for Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, cancer, heart disease.
- **[01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_Mb7BIo6hA&t=106s)** — Because iron can create a lot of oxidative stress.
- **[01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_Mb7BIo6hA&t=109s)** — Too much oxidation without having the buffer, which is the antioxidant networks.
- **[01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_Mb7BIo6hA&t=114s)** — You can get antioxidants from food and supplements, but your body makes antioxidants.
- **[01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_Mb7BIo6hA&t=119s)** — In fact, that's way more important than the antioxidants from the food.
- **[02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_Mb7BIo6hA&t=123s)** — A lot of people also have chronic infection.
- **[02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_Mb7BIo6hA&t=126s)** — They get inflammation.
- **[02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_Mb7BIo6hA&t=127s)** — And then on top of everything, the fact that we are getting older and we're aging means that we're going to naturally accumulate more iron.
- **[02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_Mb7BIo6hA&t=136s)** — 70% of all your iron is stored in protein in your blood that helps you carry oxygen.
- **[02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_Mb7BIo6hA&t=143s)** — The hemoglobin storage, you can pretty much look at that as a very large bowl that stores iron.
- **[02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_Mb7BIo6hA&t=150s)** — And then you have ferritin, which is like a teacup, like 10%.
- **[02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_Mb7BIo6hA&t=153s)** — And ferritin is supposed to be inside your tissue where it can protect you against this free iron and control when it's released.
- **[02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_Mb7BIo6hA&t=161s)** — When you see high levels of ferritin in the blood, recycling your red blood cells every 120 days, and it's creating new red blood cells.
- **[02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_Mb7BIo6hA&t=170s)** — And so you have this incredibly efficient recycling system.
- **[02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_Mb7BIo6hA&t=175s)** — It's recycling iron and you have all these different mechanisms and proteins involved in transporting iron, protecting iron because iron can be very reactive.
- **[03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_Mb7BIo6hA&t=185s)** — And the other problem is your body doesn't want to have too much free iron because certain pathogens, microbes, can eat iron.
- **[03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_Mb7BIo6hA&t=192s)** — Infections love the iron and they will steal iron for their fuel.
- **[03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_Mb7BIo6hA&t=197s)** — Our bodies don't want that, so we tend to hold this iron and keep it in a safe place.
- **[03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_Mb7BIo6hA&t=202s)** — And what can happen because of this dysfunctional iron is your poor red blood cells can't get the iron, yet we have way too much iron in the tissues.
- **[03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_Mb7BIo6hA&t=210s)** — And unfortunately, iron increases the growth of cancer.
- **[03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_Mb7BIo6hA&t=213s)** — And then there's also a lot of people that when they donate blood, man, do they feel better.
- **[03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_Mb7BIo6hA&t=218s)** — Well, that would be a perfect indication that you have too much iron.
- **[03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_Mb7BIo6hA&t=220s)** — If you don't fix the underlying cause, you just gave a temporary solution.
- **[03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_Mb7BIo6hA&t=224s)** — What is the underlying cause?
- **[03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_Mb7BIo6hA&t=225s)** — There's some fascinating information that talks about copper.
- **[03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_Mb7BIo6hA&t=229s)** — Copper is a very, very important trace mineral.
- **[03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_Mb7BIo6hA&t=233s)** — If you have too much iron and enough copper, this is a big problem.
- **[03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_Mb7BIo6hA&t=237s)** — But before you start taking copper, I highly recommend you start to limit the amount of iron you're exposed to.
- **[04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_Mb7BIo6hA&t=244s)** — I would never take any supplement with iron at all.
- **[04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_Mb7BIo6hA&t=247s)** — This is in the flour products. It's in the grain products. It's in a lot of refined carbohydrates.
- **[04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_Mb7BIo6hA&t=252s)** — What foods are high in copper?
- **[04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_Mb7BIo6hA&t=254s)** — Shellfish, organ meats like beef liver.
- **[04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_Mb7BIo6hA&t=256s)** — If you don't eat those foods, sunflower seeds do have a good amount of copper.
- **[04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_Mb7BIo6hA&t=260s)** — Even dark chocolate has some copper.
- **[04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_Mb7BIo6hA&t=263s)** — Just make sure you don't get the chocolate with a lot of sugar.
- **[04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_Mb7BIo6hA&t=265s)** — How do we make sure our bodies are producing enough antioxidants to counter some of this oxidative stress?
- **[04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_Mb7BIo6hA&t=271s)** — To illustrate this, I want to explain a personal thing that happened to me recently.
- **[04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_Mb7BIo6hA&t=275s)** — There's a very in-depth test that you can do in your body. It's called a metabolic test.
- **[04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_Mb7BIo6hA&t=279s)** — I was doing this test like very frequently, like once every two weeks.
- **[04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_Mb7BIo6hA&t=283s)** — And what was really interesting about this, it kept showing high levels of oxidative stress.
- **[04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_Mb7BIo6hA&t=288s)** — Like, that's weird.
- **[04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_Mb7BIo6hA&t=290s)** — Upon looking at this deeper, I realized what it was.
- **[04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_Mb7BIo6hA&t=293s)** — I was exercising like crazy.
- **[04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_Mb7BIo6hA&t=296s)** — And exercise produces a tremendous amount of oxidative stress, as well as hydrogen peroxide.
- **[05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_Mb7BIo6hA&t=303s)** — What I personally needed to do to counter that is to build up my antioxidant reserve.
- **[05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_Mb7BIo6hA&t=309s)** — And to do that, I needed more glutamine, which is an amino acid.
- **[05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_Mb7BIo6hA&t=312s)** — You can get the most glutamine from red meat.
- **[05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_Mb7BIo6hA&t=315s)** — And then I retested myself and it was much, much better.
- **[05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_Mb7BIo6hA&t=318s)** — The point was there's all sorts of things that can increase the need for more antioxidant help.
- **[05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_Mb7BIo6hA&t=324s)** — Alcohol, smoking, pollution, junk foods.
- **[05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_Mb7BIo6hA&t=328s)** — When we think about antioxidants, we're always thinking about like vitamin C and vitamin E,
- **[05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_Mb7BIo6hA&t=332s)** — which are really important and you should definitely get those in your diet.
- **[05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_Mb7BIo6hA&t=336s)** — But with your own antioxidant networks, protein is probably the most important thing.
- **[05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_Mb7BIo6hA&t=343s)** — This is why it's so important to consume enough protein as you get older.
- **[05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_Mb7BIo6hA&t=350s)** — And this is one reason why I don't encourage people to be vegans,
- **[05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_Mb7BIo6hA&t=354s)** — because it's very difficult to get the quality protein.
- **[05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_Mb7BIo6hA&t=357s)** — I have a really good friend who is a foot surgeon and she told me every time she does surgery,
- **[06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_Mb7BIo6hA&t=364s)** — she notices the muscles just are not pink, they're not red, they're kind of gray.
- **[06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_Mb7BIo6hA&t=369s)** — And that's probably anemia.
- **[06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_Mb7BIo6hA&t=370s)** — The problem with vegans is they have to take an iron supplement and they're not getting this heme iron.
- **[06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_Mb7BIo6hA&t=378s)** — And heme iron only comes from animal products like meat.
- **[06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_Mb7BIo6hA&t=381s)** — And I'm not saying not to be a vegan or vegetarian. I'm just saying it's difficult.
- **[06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_Mb7BIo6hA&t=385s)** — There are other things that help build up your antioxidants too.
- **[06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_Mb7BIo6hA&t=388s)** — Now I already mentioned copper, but zinc and manganese.
- **[06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_Mb7BIo6hA&t=392s)** — These are trace minerals that can come from shellfish, seafood, things like that.
- **[06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_Mb7BIo6hA&t=397s)** — Magnesium and selenium, which is another trace mineral.
- **[06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_Mb7BIo6hA&t=400s)** — What are some other things you can do to get this iron out of your tissues that go beyond
- **[06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_Mb7BIo6hA&t=406s)** — avoiding iron and building up your internal antioxidant networks?
- **[06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_Mb7BIo6hA&t=410s)** — One is quercetin. One of the best sources of quercetin is onions.
- **[06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_Mb7BIo6hA&t=415s)** — Curcumin from turmeric is a good one too.
- **[06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_Mb7BIo6hA&t=418s)** — Increasing your melatonin can be very, very therapeutic.
- **[07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_Mb7BIo6hA&t=421s)** — I have a whole video on this. I'll put the link down below.
- **[07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_Mb7BIo6hA&t=423s)** — One of the best sources of melatonin is infrared.
- **[07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_Mb7BIo6hA&t=427s)** — Over 50% of the rays of the sun is infrared.
- **[07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_Mb7BIo6hA&t=431s)** — Infrared increases melatonin and melatonin can help you regulate iron.
- **[07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_Mb7BIo6hA&t=435s)** — Also, anything with tannins like black tea would be great.
- **[07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_Mb7BIo6hA&t=439s)** — But the most powerful chelator for iron is called lactoferrin.
- **[07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_Mb7BIo6hA&t=443s)** — You can get it when you consume raw milk or raw milk cheese because it's in dairy.
- **[07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_Mb7BIo6hA&t=448s)** — That can help you decrease iron in your cells.
- **[07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_Mb7BIo6hA&t=451s)** — You can also get it as a supplement as well.
- **[07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_Mb7BIo6hA&t=453s)** — The next time you get your blood test, make sure they include ferritin.
- **[07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_Mb7BIo6hA&t=456s)** — You want that number as low to zero as possible.
- **[07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_Mb7BIo6hA&t=459s)** — I hope I put this on your radar enough for you to really do these action steps that I mentioned.
- **[07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_Mb7BIo6hA&t=464s)** — So thanks for watching and I will see you in the next video.

- **[00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Cty_MmAaMc&t=0s)** — I'd like to discuss this very interesting, amazing molecule called coenzyme Q10. Now,
- **[00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Cty_MmAaMc&t=6s)** — what is it and where do you get it and what food has the highest amount? Coenzyme Q10
- **[00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Cty_MmAaMc&t=11s)** — is a helper molecule that is inside your mitochondria that help you make energy,
- **[00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Cty_MmAaMc&t=19s)** — ATP, in your cells. And it is in every single cell in the body. It helps in this
- **[00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Cty_MmAaMc&t=25s)** — transformation into ATP, as well as stabilizing the membrane and preventing
- **[00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Cty_MmAaMc&t=32s)** — any type of leakage of electrons. Now, if you think about a battery, a battery is filled with
- **[00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Cty_MmAaMc&t=38s)** — this energy that is filled with electrons. And if you had a hole in the battery and they
- **[00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Cty_MmAaMc&t=43s)** — leaked out, you'd get a dead battery. Same exact thing happens in your cells in relationship to
- **[00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Cty_MmAaMc&t=49s)** — Coenzyme Q10. If you don't have enough of it, you're going to have a loss of energy.
- **[00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Cty_MmAaMc&t=56s)** — I think the best way to kind of help you understand the significance of Coenzyme Q10
- **[01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Cty_MmAaMc&t=62s)** — is to talk about what happens with statins. When you take a statin,
- **[01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Cty_MmAaMc&t=67s)** — you could generate this condition called statin-induced myopathies because statin
- **[01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Cty_MmAaMc&t=73s)** — drugs block the formation of Coenzyme Q10. Now, what is a myopathy? Like what type of problems
- **[01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Cty_MmAaMc&t=80s)** — can you have when you have a myopathy? Well, muscle pain, muscle weakness, and you're going
- **[01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Cty_MmAaMc&t=86s)** — to have an intolerance to exercise. You're not going to want to exercise. You're going to get
- **[01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Cty_MmAaMc&t=90s)** — tired real fast. Even if you like climb a stairs or climb a hill, you're going to run
- **[01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Cty_MmAaMc&t=95s)** — out of oxygen pretty quick. Coenzyme Q10 can increase the energy in your muscles,
- **[01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Cty_MmAaMc&t=103s)** — in your entire body. It can greatly reduce your fatigue, especially when you're exercising.
- **[01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Cty_MmAaMc&t=109s)** — It actually can give you more oxygen when you exercise. So you're less winded. And it also
- **[01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Cty_MmAaMc&t=114s)** — can improve your repair when you exercise. So that's going to improve your performance.
- **[02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Cty_MmAaMc&t=120s)** — Now, if you have congestive heart failure, you should definitely be taking Coenzyme Q10 or be
- **[02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Cty_MmAaMc&t=126s)** — eating the foods that are high in Coenzyme Q10, which I'm going to explain. But in one
- **[02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Cty_MmAaMc&t=130s)** — study with patients that had congestive heart failure, much less hospitalizations, especially
- **[02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Cty_MmAaMc&t=137s)** — from pulmonary edema, cardiac asthma, and arrhythmias. Now, another interesting thing
- **[02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Cty_MmAaMc&t=145s)** — about Coenzyme Q10, it gets transported through the body on a shuttle. And the name of that
- **[02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Cty_MmAaMc&t=152s)** — shuttle is LDL. That's right. That so-called bad cholesterol is the transportation of this
- **[02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Cty_MmAaMc&t=159s)** — Coenzyme Q10. It gets bound to it. It travels through the body. And without that LDL,
- **[02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Cty_MmAaMc&t=167s)** — it doesn't really go anywhere. It kind of just kind of lingers around and doesn't do
- **[02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Cty_MmAaMc&t=171s)** — so much. So we need the LDL. Now, another purpose of Coenzyme Q10 is its ability to act as an
- **[02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Cty_MmAaMc&t=178s)** — antioxidant. So it prevents the oxidation of LDL. So this is another benefit. It gives you
- **[03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Cty_MmAaMc&t=186s)** — this anti-atherogenic effect. So it supports the arteries. So that's pretty much what Coenzyme
- **[03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Cty_MmAaMc&t=192s)** — Q10 does. I mean, it does a lot of other things for your brain, for the different organs,
- **[03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Cty_MmAaMc&t=198s)** — but let's just talk about what food has the most Coenzyme Q10. It is heart muscle. That's right.
- **[03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Cty_MmAaMc&t=207s)** — Which is an organ meat that very few people consume. Recently, we had one of our
- **[03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Cty_MmAaMc&t=214s)** — ous butchered and they wanted to know if I wanted to keep the heart muscle. And I'm like,
- **[03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Cty_MmAaMc&t=218s)** — yes, I do. I definitely want to keep all the organs. So I'm going to freeze dry that heart
- **[03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Cty_MmAaMc&t=223s)** — and I'm going to turn it into freeze dried heart capsules. Okay. And that's one way I'm going to
- **[03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Cty_MmAaMc&t=230s)** — get my Coenzyme Q10. And I'll do a video on that to share my experience to see what happens.
- **[03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Cty_MmAaMc&t=237s)** — But you can actually find some grass-fed heart or you can get it as supplements. Of course,
- **[04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Cty_MmAaMc&t=242s)** — find a high quality source. But out of all the organs in our bodies and other animals,
- **[04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Cty_MmAaMc&t=249s)** — the heart has the most Coenzyme Q10. And so another good source of Coenzyme Q10 is in other
- **[04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Cty_MmAaMc&t=256s)** — organ meats like kidney, liver, brain. Coenzyme Q10 is also in fatty fish. It's even in
- **[04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Cty_MmAaMc&t=265s)** — extra virgin olive oil. When you exercise, you can increase the number of mitochondria that
- **[04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Cty_MmAaMc&t=271s)** — you have and you can indirectly increase the amount of Coenzyme Q10 that your body makes
- **[04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Cty_MmAaMc&t=276s)** — just by doing regular exercise. But a lot of people get their Coenzyme Q10 from supplements.
- **[04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Cty_MmAaMc&t=283s)** — The challenge with Coenzyme Q10 is in its bioavailability. The absorption rate is like
- **[04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Cty_MmAaMc&t=289s)** — only 5%. There are other types of Coenzyme Q10 that are more bioavailable and one being
- **[04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Cty_MmAaMc&t=296s)** — something called ubiquitin. On the flip side, what are those things that could inhibit Coenzyme
- **[05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Cty_MmAaMc&t=302s)** — Q10? Well, I already mentioned statins, but there's other things like the normal aging process
- **[05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Cty_MmAaMc&t=308s)** — can decrease the amount of Coenzyme Q10, which could explain why the majority of the
- **[05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Cty_MmAaMc&t=315s)** — population on earth usually end up dying from a heart problem. But for anything connected to
- **[05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Cty_MmAaMc&t=320s)** — heart, Coenzyme Q10 is a great remedy that can help. There's other cofactors involved in
- **[05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Cty_MmAaMc&t=328s)** — this Coenzyme Q10 working in the mitochondria. So if you're deficient in vitamin C, for example,
- **[05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Cty_MmAaMc&t=336s)** — or vitamin B6, or folate, or alpha lipoic acid, you could actually end up having a
- **[05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Cty_MmAaMc&t=344s)** — lowered amount of Coenzyme Q10. And also anything that messes with your mitochondria
- **[05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Cty_MmAaMc&t=351s)** — will diminish Coenzyme Q10. And that includes diabetes, Alzheimer's, many, many different
- **[05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Cty_MmAaMc&t=357s)** — things. Dress is another thing that can diminish your natural pool of Coenzyme Q10. But I wanted
- **[06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Cty_MmAaMc&t=366s)** — to give you a quick summary of what Coenzyme Q10 is in a simple video. And if you want the
- **[06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Cty_MmAaMc&t=371s)** — complete information on supporting a healthy cardiovascular system, you should check this

## Full Transcript with Timestamps

*Click any timestamp to jump to that moment in the video*

- **[00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqbRlKiFYhc&t=0s)** — Let's talk about the number one worst food for your heart. Hint, it's not sugar. I did a video on this before, but the problem is the food that I talked about before, it's not really in the average person's diet nearly as much as it used to be. And that was trans fats. Trans fats are really bad for us, but they ban that. So if we take away trans fats, what do you think would be the food that would be at the top of the list as far as destroying that inside of that artery?
- **[00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqbRlKiFYhc&t=29s)** — So let's see if you can guess and get it right. Number one, it's a primary driver of heart disease. It creates potent and massive inflammation inside your arteries. And also this food is directly correlated as far as the consumption and introduction into our food supply and the exact statistics of getting heart disease. I mean, they're on the same trend going up.
- **[00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqbRlKiFYhc&t=53s)** — Another thing that this food does, very specifically to the inside of your arteries, is it creates what's called oxidative LDL. Now let me just explain what that means. Now maybe you've heard that LDL is the bad cholesterol, but really the LDL is not bad until it gets modified. It changes. This particular ingredient that I'm going to tell you about in a minute goes into that LDL and it modifies it and it makes it so it can
- **[01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqbRlKiFYhc&t=83s)** — penetrate inside the artery wall and start the cascade of damage. And it's this repetitive chronic consumption of this thing that keeps this irritation or inflammation going. Then you have a cascade of problems like incomplete healing with proteins and cholesterol, till the point where you're developing this plaque and that can break off, etc. But it really starts with this oxidative LDL. This food also increases the risk of getting a metabolic
- **[01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqbRlKiFYhc&t=113s)** — syndrome. What is that? That's a combination of several things. Low HDL, high triglycerides, high blood glucose, belly fat, and also high fasting insulin and insulin resistance. Now I will say there's certain studies that will show that consuming this food lowers the cholesterol. Okay, so you might think, oh, that's a good thing. But at the same time, it increases the risk of developing heart disease as well as increasing the risk of dying from heart disease.
- **[02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqbRlKiFYhc&t=143s)** — I'm going to put all that data down below. Now it also causes lipid peroxidation. And what does that mean? Well, think about oxidation as something going rancid, something like rusting something and damaging it out. But also this substance goes into the membranes of your cells. Okay, not just the arteries, but other tissues too. In the retina, it can go into the brain cells. It can create a lot of problems.
- **[02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqbRlKiFYhc&t=172s)** — One of the secondary compounds that's created, and I'm not going to get into the long name, but it's called HNE, which is a very, very toxic thing. And that can create neurodegeneration, cancer, heart disease, like we already mentioned, and inflammation. Now if we compare 2010 to 2013, there's been an increase of this by 135 acts. So that's a major increase in our bodies.
- **[03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqbRlKiFYhc&t=199s)** — This particular food is made with similar machines that they make petroleum products from. It's like an industrial product. And it's in our food chain big time. They heat it at least five times. They run it through this very toxic solvent called hexane to extract it and isolate it. So there's chemicals added, there's bleach added, there's other things to take the odor out. So basically it's void of anything living at all.
- **[03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqbRlKiFYhc&t=229s)** — It's also been known to increase clotting. It creates major oxidative stress, which basically is a combination between high oxidation, that rancidity, that rusting out, and low antioxidants. And by the way, this oxidative LDL, there's really two main ways to lower it. One is it decreases food, which I'm just about to tell you right now. But number two is to decrease smoking. That's right, smoking.
- **[04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqbRlKiFYhc&t=257s)** — So let me reveal what this is. You ready for this? Seed oil. Now, you may have heard of vegetable oils, right? Like this right here. I don't know if you can see this. Vegetable oils. They have pictures of vegetables right here. This does not come from vegetables. Vegetable oil is really seed oil. It's from corn, canola, it's from cottonseed.
- **[04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqbRlKiFYhc&t=291s)** — They make it from soy. And what's really wild about this is that this oil is an unsaturated fatty acid, which means it's very, very unstable. It's susceptible to oxidation, which I just mentioned, especially to light, air, or oxygen, temperature.
- **[05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqbRlKiFYhc&t=311s)** — So here we have this product that's not in a dark bottle, and you can heat it. The problem is that this has already been oxidized because it's been processed. So it's a highly inflammatory food, and we use this in a lot of foods. Not just in cooking, but in salad dressings, in our favorite products like this, in literally all of the ultra-processed foods.
- **[05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqbRlKiFYhc&t=337s)** — It's unfortunate now because if you're cooking at home and you've been watching any of my videos, you probably are using either butter or coconut oil, avocado oil, or olive oil, right? But when you go to a restaurant, they're going to use cheap oils to cook with.
- **[05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqbRlKiFYhc&t=354s)** — Now I also looked at some research that said that this polyunsaturated fatty acid, which is high in omega-6, is not bad for us, right? And I found a few studies that talked about that, and I want to kind of just dissect them because the first study I'm going to talk about is called the Finnish Mental Hossaball Study.
- **[06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqbRlKiFYhc&t=375s)** — And this basically supported this theory that this unsaturated oil is heart-healthy, right? But there's several flaws. In this study, they actually removed the trans fats. And so that leads to the question, was it because you removed the trans fats or you added this? We don't know.
- **[06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqbRlKiFYhc&t=395s)** — Also, it wasn't randomized. You had people that smoked, people that didn't. You had people on medications, people with high blood pressure. So there's just too many flaws in that study.
- **[06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqbRlKiFYhc&t=404s)** — So I just want to take a little break and tell you thank you so much for subscribing. I really appreciate all of my subscribers and even those that don't subscribe. But the problem is even though you might subscribe to my channel, only 1% of all of my subscribers get notified.
- **[07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqbRlKiFYhc&t=421s)** — So I would really appreciate it. It's not going to take much effort to press that bell if you subscribe. If you haven't subscribed, subscribe and then press that bell as well. So that way you can continue to get this, I think, really important information.
- **[07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqbRlKiFYhc&t=437s)** — Let's look at another study. Los Angeles Veterans Administration Study. So with this one, it showed that it decreased the cholesterol by 13%, but no significant impact on heart attack and sudden death.
- **[07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqbRlKiFYhc&t=451s)** — So for this one, it doesn't say it improved the heart. It said there was no significant difference, but it wasn't randomized. So you have these groups that some smoke, some didn't. Some people drank, some people didn't.
- **[07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqbRlKiFYhc&t=463s)** — So if someone smoked, for example, they're going to eat up their vitamin E, and that's going to put them more at risk for getting heart problems.
- **[07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqbRlKiFYhc&t=470s)** — But I'm going to put a good amount of research down below on more of a randomized control study that you can see that give you more proof that this is damaging.
- **[08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqbRlKiFYhc&t=481s)** — So I really think this is an easy problem to solve. It's just an awareness thing. Reading labels don't consume these oils.
- **[08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqbRlKiFYhc&t=488s)** — Instead of using some type of typical salad dressing, find one that doesn't have it. You're probably just going to have to use olive oil or some other type of dressing.
- **[08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqbRlKiFYhc&t=496s)** — Also the condiments, right? You have to find a condiment that doesn't have the soy oil. It's in mayonnaise, it's in a lot of different sauces.
- **[08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqbRlKiFYhc&t=505s)** — And also when you cook, I would use olive oil, butter, coconut oil, avocado oil, lard.
- **[08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqbRlKiFYhc&t=514s)** — So as you can see, there's a lot of problem with this unsaturated fatty acid. It's very, very unstable. It's not like saturated fats that are stable that are very difficult to break up.
- **[08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqbRlKiFYhc&t=523s)** — This stuff right here is highly susceptible to becoming damaged and then creating oxidation.
- **[08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqbRlKiFYhc&t=532s)** — And so in the family of unsaturated fatty acids, you have two different main categories. You have the omega-6 fatty acids and then you have the omega-3 fatty acids.
- **[09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqbRlKiFYhc&t=542s)** — So this would be mainly omega-6, right? And we want like a one-to-one ratio.
- **[09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqbRlKiFYhc&t=548s)** — But the problem is when you get into canola oil and some of these other highly processed seed oils, that's like a 311 to one ratio, right? Very heavy on the omega-6.
- **[09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqbRlKiFYhc&t=560s)** — But in America, the ratio of omega-6 to omega-3 is roughly anywhere between 10 to 1 to 20 to 1. Very heavy on the omega-6.
- **[09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqbRlKiFYhc&t=573s)** — And even in certain parts of the world, it can get up to like 50 to 1. So you have this massive amount of omega-6 that's kind of evading our cell membranes, creating all sorts of inflammation, not just in our arteries, but also going into the retina of the eye.
- **[09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqbRlKiFYhc&t=586s)** — So if someone tells you that this oil is not a problem for our bodies, it's fresh, no it's not. It's badly processed and this introduction into our bodies is directly correlated with heart disease.
- **[09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqbRlKiFYhc&t=599s)** — So here's the problem. Omega-6 and omega-3 are competitive. Which means that you're going to have to get this omega-6 seed oils out of the diet and replace with omega-3, which is from the fish oils, the cod liver oil.
- **[10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqbRlKiFYhc&t=614s)** — You're going to get more of it when you have grass-fed meat. But we want to start increasing this omega-3 to counter the effects of the omega-6.
- **[10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqbRlKiFYhc&t=622s)** — Now I don't want to get into the history of this, but wow, we just did a whole switch and we replaced saturated fats with seed oils.
- **[10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqbRlKiFYhc&t=631s)** — Thinking that was a smart move, it was not a smart move, now people are waking up. It's insidious that it crept into a lot of our different foods and no wonder we're having so many problems.
- **[10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqbRlKiFYhc&t=642s)** — I think one of the mistakes early on was because it lowered cholesterol, we assumed it was good for the heart. And so it was promoted widely before any human studies were done in the beginning.
- **[10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqbRlKiFYhc&t=655s)** — It's in baby food, it's an infant formula. I mean, they just put it in everything.
- **[10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqbRlKiFYhc&t=659s)** — Now in the first video that I did on trans fats, even though it's not a main problem in our diet, they still stick it in from various ways and they sneak it in there.
- **[11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqbRlKiFYhc&t=669s)** — I think it would be very smart to watch that video. I will put that up right here. Check it out.

- **[00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-vtMP3laIBc&t=0s)** — So what would be the perfect meal to help you detoxify your liver? That's what we're going to talk about today.
- **[00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-vtMP3laIBc&t=7s)** — The first thing I want to mention is that going through a detox is not the same as a cleanse.
- **[00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-vtMP3laIBc&t=14s)** — There's all these cleanses out there that say like a 14-day cleanse, clean out your liver, right?
- **[00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-vtMP3laIBc&t=19s)** — Well, don't waste your money. Going on a cleanse with cayenne pepper and lemon juice with maple syrup
- **[00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-vtMP3laIBc&t=26s)** — for even a week or two is not going to help you clean your liver. All these expensive little kits
- **[00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-vtMP3laIBc&t=33s)** — with these powdered herbs and things that you can take to cleanse your liver are not going to in
- **[00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-vtMP3laIBc&t=38s)** — any significant way clean your liver. And I'm going to explain why. You have some powerful,
- **[00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-vtMP3laIBc&t=45s)** — amazing thing that happens in that cell. They go through like this assembly line of
- **[00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-vtMP3laIBc&t=52s)** — enzymatic changes. Okay? You've got phase one and phase two. And then phase three is just the
- **[00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-vtMP3laIBc&t=59s)** — full elimination of that toxin. And when I talk about toxins, I'm talking about drugs, medication,
- **[01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-vtMP3laIBc&t=67s)** — preservatives, xenobiotics, which are all the chemicals that are external to the body and
- **[01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-vtMP3laIBc&t=71s)** — foreign to the body. Like you have plastics, you have petroleum products, you have also mold
- **[01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-vtMP3laIBc&t=77s)** — and fungus and pesticides, insecticides, herbicides, fungicides. You have metabolic
- **[01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-vtMP3laIBc&t=82s)** — waste like hydrogen peroxide. You have toxins from smoking. I think there's over
- **[01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-vtMP3laIBc&t=87s)** — six or 7,000 different chemicals. Okay? With about I think 74 to 100
- **[01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-vtMP3laIBc&t=95s)** — carcinogens. Then you have chemicals in vaping. You have caffeine, heavy metals. I'm not
- **[01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-vtMP3laIBc&t=100s)** — sure if I mentioned that. Cleaning chemicals, alcohol, hormones that need to be broken down.
- **[01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-vtMP3laIBc&t=105s)** — So we are basically swimming, bathing in chemicals 24-7, especially if you use tap water and it's
- **[01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-vtMP3laIBc&t=114s)** — like in your shower head and you have to drink that. And I mean, it's just it's hitting us
- **[01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-vtMP3laIBc&t=118s)** — from every different angle. Thank goodness we have this system of phase one, phase two
- **[02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-vtMP3laIBc&t=124s)** — detoxification. And the whole goal of this process is to turn poisons into harmless
- **[02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-vtMP3laIBc&t=133s)** — water-soluble particles. So in other words, a lot of these chemicals are fat-soluble. So let
- **[02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-vtMP3laIBc&t=141s)** — me explain fat-soluble. So you can see right here we have fat and we have water, right?
- **[02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-vtMP3laIBc&t=149s)** — You know they don't mix. This is the fat-soluble toxins right here. It goes into the body,
- **[02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-vtMP3laIBc&t=154s)** — but it doesn't come out. It gets stuck in there. So we need to turn this fat
- **[02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-vtMP3laIBc&t=159s)** — into something that's more water soluble so it can go through the body. So what these enzymes do
- **[02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-vtMP3laIBc&t=168s)** — is basically add something to the fat and then...
- **[02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-vtMP3laIBc&t=176s)** — and so they break it down into something that can actually go through the body.
- **[03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-vtMP3laIBc&t=180s)** — Okay, this is another example that I use with like bile salts and what bile salts can do
- **[03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-vtMP3laIBc&t=185s)** — for fat. But it's a good analogy also for what these enzymes do to the fat-soluble poisons.
- **[03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-vtMP3laIBc&t=194s)** — In phase one, they're adding either water, hydrogen, or oxygen to start to oxidize and
- **[03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-vtMP3laIBc&t=201s)** — break it down. The challenge with this phase one is that when this chemical is activated,
- **[03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-vtMP3laIBc&t=209s)** — it becomes more toxic, more dangerous, more of a carcinogen because you're adding oxygen
- **[03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-vtMP3laIBc&t=215s)** — and you're oxidizing it and you're opening it up. That's why we have phase two. But we need phase
- **[03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-vtMP3laIBc&t=221s)** — one to be able to dismantle this so that we can then add the next thing to this chain of
- **[03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-vtMP3laIBc&t=227s)** — events. So phase one kind of starts the process. It activates things. It requires certain
- **[03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-vtMP3laIBc&t=233s)** — nutrients like folate, vitamin C, certain B vitamins, calcium, etc. And this is also the
- **[03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-vtMP3laIBc&t=239s)** — where if you consume grapefruit juice or grapefruit and you're also taking a medication,
- **[04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-vtMP3laIBc&t=246s)** — there's a certain chemical in grapefruit that will retain that drug longer in your system
- **[04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-vtMP3laIBc&t=254s)** — and it will make things more toxic for you. So you never want to consume grapefruit juice
- **[04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-vtMP3laIBc&t=259s)** — or grapefruits while you're taking a certain medication. And during phase one, there's a lot
- **[04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-vtMP3laIBc&t=265s)** — of free radicals and oxidation happening and this is where you need a lot of antioxidants.
- **[04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-vtMP3laIBc&t=271s)** — So antioxidants protect the cell against all this free radical stuff going on and detoxification
- **[04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-vtMP3laIBc&t=279s)** — is different because you're taking a poison and turning into a water-soluble harmless
- **[04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-vtMP3laIBc&t=284s)** — particle. Now after phase one gets a hold of that poison, then phase two comes in there
- **[04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-vtMP3laIBc&t=291s)** — and it does something called conjugation. Okay. And that's basically adding a water-soluble
- **[04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-vtMP3laIBc&t=297s)** — molecule to this compound. Like for example, glutathione. So glutathione binds with it and
- **[05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-vtMP3laIBc&t=304s)** — now it's water-soluble. And if you ever get a DNA test, you'll see all these detoxification
- **[05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-vtMP3laIBc&t=310s)** — enzymes and you can actually see if you have a problem with them genetically. Like say there's
- **[05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-vtMP3laIBc&t=315s)** — a mutation with one of those enzymes and what that means is there's some sluggishness
- **[05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-vtMP3laIBc&t=321s)** — and that enzyme doesn't work like it should. So it makes you more susceptible to damage from
- **[05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-vtMP3laIBc&t=330s)** — that poison if you're exposed to it. It's just going to be harder for your body to get rid of
- **[05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-vtMP3laIBc&t=335s)** — that toxin unless you eat very healthy and you do things to really avoid that toxin. So
- **[05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-vtMP3laIBc&t=341s)** — the value of a DNA test will tell you the importance of avoiding a certain toxin or
- **[05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-vtMP3laIBc&t=347s)** — going above and beyond what you normally do to eat certain things to help this process happen
- **[05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-vtMP3laIBc&t=353s)** — faster. And when I'm actually evaluating DNA testing, I'm finding a lot of people have a
- **[05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-vtMP3laIBc&t=357s)** — problem with these detoxification enzymes. So in phase one, okay, the name of this group of
- **[06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-vtMP3laIBc&t=364s)** — of enzymes are called the cytochrome P450 enzymes. Okay, and then in phase two,
- **[06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-vtMP3laIBc&t=370s)** — you have a bunch of other names involving glutathione, but I'm not going to get into
- **[06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-vtMP3laIBc&t=374s)** — these names at this point. Just realize that all these enzymes pretty much do the same thing
- **[06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-vtMP3laIBc&t=379s)** — but in different locations in the body and with different toxins. So like I said before,
- **[06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-vtMP3laIBc&t=386s)** — there are detoxification enzymes in your intestines, in your lungs, in your kidney,
- **[06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-vtMP3laIBc&t=391s)** — but the liver is the primary area of detoxification. So with phase two,
- **[06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-vtMP3laIBc&t=397s)** — you're attaching certain water soluble compounds to help it become more water soluble. And that
- **[06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-vtMP3laIBc&t=404s)** — involves sulfur, choline, certain amino acids, zinc. Now there's a couple points I'm going to
- **[06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-vtMP3laIBc&t=410s)** — talk about with this whole assembly line of enzymes to break down these chemicals. It really
- **[06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-vtMP3laIBc&t=418s)** — depends on how chronically you're exposed to these chemicals. For example, if you have a bad habit
- **[07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-vtMP3laIBc&t=424s)** — of smoking, okay, every day for a long period of time, that is going to be way more of a
- **[07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-vtMP3laIBc&t=429s)** — problem with these enzymes and the accumulation in chronic irritation and the side effects of
- **[07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-vtMP3laIBc&t=435s)** — things like cancer. Because remember, cancer is this chronic irritation or damage to the
- **[07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-vtMP3laIBc&t=441s)** — mitochondria that then switches over into this out of control cancer cell. Well, something
- **[07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-vtMP3laIBc&t=447s)** — causes it and it's usually the chronic exposure to something and it can also be diet as well.
- **[07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-vtMP3laIBc&t=453s)** — And on top of that, if someone has a fatty liver, which the majority of population does,
- **[07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-vtMP3laIBc&t=459s)** — this phase one, phase two detoxification enzyme pathway just does not work like it should.
- **[07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-vtMP3laIBc&t=465s)** — Also, if they have inflammation in the liver, same thing like hepatitis,
- **[07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-vtMP3laIBc&t=469s)** — it just won't work that well. And especially if they have cirrhosis, it won't work that well.
- **[07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-vtMP3laIBc&t=474s)** — Now, there's also a phase three detoxification where you're eliminating these water soluble
- **[08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-vtMP3laIBc&t=481s)** — chemicals throughout the body. But what if, for example, you are constipated, right? Your
- **[08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-vtMP3laIBc&t=487s)** — bowels hold on to these toxins. Well, that's a problem because they accumulate,
- **[08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-vtMP3laIBc&t=492s)** — especially if you have chronic constipation. And another thing you can have is like
- **[08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-vtMP3laIBc&t=496s)** — dysbiosis, which is an alteration in the gut microbiome. There's a gut-liver relationship
- **[08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-vtMP3laIBc&t=503s)** — that if there's something going on the gut, it's going to affect the liver because the friendly
- **[08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-vtMP3laIBc&t=507s)** — bacteria also assist in removing these chemicals. So if you had a lot of antibiotics or you have
- **[08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-vtMP3laIBc&t=514s)** — an overgrowth of yeast or a lot of problems with the gut microbiome, you can have a
- **[08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-vtMP3laIBc&t=518s)** — problem with detoxification. Now, a little bit higher up in the digestion, you have these
- **[08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-vtMP3laIBc&t=523s)** — bile ducts. Bile is one of the primary ways of eliminating these toxins, okay, as well as
- **[08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-vtMP3laIBc&t=529s)** — the urinary system. But if there's anything going on in the bile ducts where there's a blockage,
- **[08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-vtMP3laIBc&t=534s)** — that's called choleostasis, where there's just like sludge or an obstruction from a gallstone,
- **[09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-vtMP3laIBc&t=540s)** — that can start accumulating these toxins in the liver and interrupt this flow that should
- **[09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-vtMP3laIBc&t=546s)** — normally happen. And the way that you would know that you would have that is usually like
- **[09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-vtMP3laIBc&t=550s)** — right shoulder pain or a fullness underneath the right rib cage or burping or belching.
- **[09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-vtMP3laIBc&t=555s)** — And the remedy is to thin the bile with more bile. And I like to use a remedy called TADCA,
- **[09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-vtMP3laIBc&t=563s)** — which has been known to greatly assist in the detoxification process of the liver and
- **[09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-vtMP3laIBc&t=569s)** — in other parts of the body. What about if the urine is obstructed? Okay, I mean,
- **[09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-vtMP3laIBc&t=574s)** — let's say the person has a large prostate and they just don't eliminate like they should and
- **[09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-vtMP3laIBc&t=578s)** — they retain urine. Well, we have this accumulation of toxic material that just cannot exit the body
- **[09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-vtMP3laIBc&t=585s)** — and it backs up all the waste. Not to mention someone that having diabetes and having a kidney
- **[09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-vtMP3laIBc&t=591s)** — problem, which also causes them to retain these chemicals. But the question is, what can you do
- **[09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-vtMP3laIBc&t=596s)** — about it? What can you do? Well, the diet. Out of all the things you can do, and I'm
- **[10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-vtMP3laIBc&t=602s)** — talking about supplements and remedies and all this stuff, the diet can help you the most
- **[10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-vtMP3laIBc&t=608s)** — when you detoxify. And I'm not talking about a two-week cleanse. I'm talking about
- **[10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-vtMP3laIBc&t=614s)** — something you do on a routine basis, a consistent basis where you're eating these foods over and
- **[10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-vtMP3laIBc&t=619s)** — over and over again. So I'm going to describe a meal that I think would be the best meal to help
- **[10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-vtMP3laIBc&t=624s)** — your liver and other organs detoxify. We want to start with the egg. Okay, eggs are one of
- **[10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-vtMP3laIBc&t=631s)** — the perfect foods because they're high in sulfur, complete amino acid profile. They pretty
- **[10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-vtMP3laIBc&t=637s)** — much have every nutrient including choline, which is really good for the liver as well as a
- **[10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-vtMP3laIBc&t=642s)** — fatty liver. And then you would cook those eggs with onions and garlic. Two things that are very
- **[10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-vtMP3laIBc&t=648s)** — high in sulfur, not to mention all the antioxidants in onion and garlic that can help counter the
- **[10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-vtMP3laIBc&t=655s)** — phase one detoxification. And don't forget the sea salt to get some of the trace minerals. And
- **[11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-vtMP3laIBc&t=660s)** — then we add our cruciferous vegetables. Now, there's any number of cruciferous vegetables that
- **[11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-vtMP3laIBc&t=665s)** — you can do. You can do roasted brussel sprouts. You can do cauliflower. Or you can do broccoli,
- **[11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-vtMP3laIBc&t=671s)** — steamed broccoli. Or even cabbage or sauerkraut. And if you want to do a salad, you can just do
- **[11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-vtMP3laIBc&t=677s)** — arugula. The more bitter the vegetable, the better for your liver. Out of all the salad greens,
- **[11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-vtMP3laIBc&t=684s)** — arugula is at the top of the list because it's cruciferous. These cruciferous vegetables
- **[11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-vtMP3laIBc&t=689s)** — activate the genes that cause these enzymes to be produced and work. So if you have a genetic
- **[11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-vtMP3laIBc&t=696s)** — mutation with one of these genes, consuming those foods can speed up this process. Now,
- **[11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-vtMP3laIBc&t=702s)** — just so you know, this is my meal. This is what I eat very often as my first meal of the day.
- **[11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-vtMP3laIBc&t=707s)** — And then as a kind of a dessert, I'll have kefir, which is way better than yogurt. Then
- **[11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-vtMP3laIBc&t=713s)** — I'll put some walnuts in there. And sometimes I might put some low carb, no sugar chocolate
- **[12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-vtMP3laIBc&t=720s)** — chips, just a little bit. That's my dessert. But that can actually help with the calcium that
- **[12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-vtMP3laIBc&t=725s)** — you need as well as to your microbiome. What's unique about kefir is that it has a lot more
- **[12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-vtMP3laIBc&t=731s)** — friendly bacteria as well as friendly yeast, whereas yogurt has less bacteria and no friendly
- **[12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-vtMP3laIBc&t=737s)** — yeast. And of course, that's not the only meal, but that's just an example of something
- **[12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-vtMP3laIBc&t=740s)** — that could be good. You definitely want enough protein too with complete amino acids,
- **[12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-vtMP3laIBc&t=746s)** — because all these enzymes are made from amino acids. So it's very, very important to have
- **[12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-vtMP3laIBc&t=750s)** — some animal meat or eggs with your meal. And to put the icing on the cake,
- **[12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-vtMP3laIBc&t=756s)** — I probably shouldn't talk about cake, add additional herbs if you can. If you can add
- **[12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-vtMP3laIBc&t=763s)** — thyme, sage, oregano, cayenne pepper, turmeric, rosemary, any of these herbs are going to
- **[12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-vtMP3laIBc&t=770s)** — help you in the detoxification process. Now, if you haven't seen this video on how to get
- **[12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-vtMP3laIBc&t=776s)** — rid of a fatty liver, I put it up right here. Check it out.

- **[00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s0jIXMc3PS0&t=0s)** — Today let's talk about the number one best probiotic for autoimmune conditions.
- **[00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s0jIXMc3PS0&t=5s)** — So the question is, what is an autoimmune condition?
- **[00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s0jIXMc3PS0&t=7s)** — It's a condition where your own immune system is attacking its own tissues.
- **[00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s0jIXMc3PS0&t=11s)** — What's really happening with the immune system is we have two parts of the immune system that are out of balance.
- **[00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s0jIXMc3PS0&t=16s)** — We have either a very low amount of this thing called regulatory T cells,
- **[00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s0jIXMc3PS0&t=21s)** — and then at the same time we have high amounts of these other two immune cells.
- **[00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s0jIXMc3PS0&t=26s)** — All you really need to know to make this really simple is that these Treg cells prevent autoimmune diseases.
- **[00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s0jIXMc3PS0&t=32s)** — So it's all about calming down the inflammation.
- **[00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s0jIXMc3PS0&t=35s)** — After your immune system has done its job, the Treg cells turn it off.
- **[00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s0jIXMc3PS0&t=40s)** — So the Treg cells are all about appropriate response.
- **[00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s0jIXMc3PS0&t=45s)** — But the problem is in the flip side it can sometimes get out of control and attack the wrong thing.
- **[00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s0jIXMc3PS0&t=51s)** — The best way to understand this is to look at a thermostat.
- **[00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s0jIXMc3PS0&t=54s)** — Autoimmune diseases are running too hot. There's too much inflammation.
- **[00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s0jIXMc3PS0&t=59s)** — The question is, how do we take an autoimmune disease and bring it to an optimal level?
- **[01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s0jIXMc3PS0&t=65s)** — It just so happens that there is a natural way to do this.
- **[01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s0jIXMc3PS0&t=69s)** — But I think it's important to understand the root problem of all autoimmune diseases.
- **[01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s0jIXMc3PS0&t=74s)** — One thing you really need to know is that when there's inflammation in the gut,
- **[01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s0jIXMc3PS0&t=79s)** — sometimes you don't initially feel it.
- **[01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s0jIXMc3PS0&t=81s)** — But inflammation blocks the function of vitamin D3.
- **[01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s0jIXMc3PS0&t=86s)** — Vitamin D3 cannot work in the presence of inflammation.
- **[01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s0jIXMc3PS0&t=91s)** — Vitamin D influences over 2,500 genes.
- **[01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s0jIXMc3PS0&t=95s)** — It's involved in every part of the immune system.
- **[01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s0jIXMc3PS0&t=97s)** — So if the Treg cells do not get enough vitamin D, then they can't work.
- **[01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s0jIXMc3PS0&t=103s)** — They can't grow. They can't function. They're going to be dysfunctional.
- **[01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s0jIXMc3PS0&t=106s)** — Many people, including a lot of doctors, don't realize that we have such a mass problem with low vitamin D.
- **[01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s0jIXMc3PS0&t=113s)** — There is a condition called vitamin D resistance.
- **[01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s0jIXMc3PS0&t=116s)** — Vitamin D resistance is at the cell level, right at the receptors for vitamin D3.
- **[02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s0jIXMc3PS0&t=121s)** — You can actually test someone's vitamin D in the blood, and it can be perfectly normal.
- **[02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s0jIXMc3PS0&t=125s)** — But if they have vitamin D resistance, despite having a normal blood level, they're going to be extremely deficient.
- **[02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s0jIXMc3PS0&t=131s)** — And many people don't realize that the great majority of the population is vitamin D resistant.
- **[02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s0jIXMc3PS0&t=137s)** — In your blood, what they're testing when they're testing for vitamin D is the inactive version.
- **[02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s0jIXMc3PS0&t=142s)** — They're not testing for what's happening at the cell level.
- **[02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s0jIXMc3PS0&t=145s)** — But the vitamin D you need for the immune system is more like 8,000 to 10,000 just to maintain it.
- **[02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s0jIXMc3PS0&t=152s)** — And not only that, you need it on a daily basis.
- **[02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s0jIXMc3PS0&t=155s)** — Rarely is anyone getting that amount, unless they're out getting a lot of sun
- **[02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s0jIXMc3PS0&t=160s)** — or taking a supplement.
- **[02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s0jIXMc3PS0&t=162s)** — So if you compound an inflammatory gut problem with low vitamin D,
- **[02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s0jIXMc3PS0&t=168s)** — it's a perfect storm for developing an autoimmune disease.
- **[02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s0jIXMc3PS0&t=172s)** — And on top of that, you have doctors, or you might have things on the news or online that say that vitamin D, you got to be careful.
- **[03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s0jIXMc3PS0&t=180s)** — You don't want to become toxic. Just so you know, it's extremely rare.
- **[03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s0jIXMc3PS0&t=183s)** — And you would have to take hundreds of thousands of international units every single day for months before you develop any toxicity.
- **[03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s0jIXMc3PS0&t=190s)** — So when we're talking about 10,000 IUs, we're not even in the ballpark for even talking about toxicity.
- **[03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s0jIXMc3PS0&t=197s)** — And the reason I'm even bringing that up is to penetrate through that vitamin D resistance that so many people have to create a therapeutic effect.
- **[03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s0jIXMc3PS0&t=205s)** — You're going to have to use levels that are much higher than 10,000 IUs.
- **[03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s0jIXMc3PS0&t=210s)** — You're probably going to have to go up 20, 30, 40, 50,000 international units every single day to penetrate that resistance to create an effect on the Treg cells.
- **[03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s0jIXMc3PS0&t=222s)** — So that's number one. Number two, missing microbes.
- **[03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s0jIXMc3PS0&t=225s)** — You have thousands of different species of microbes in your gut, and they do a lot more than you might think.
- **[03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s0jIXMc3PS0&t=231s)** — And there's two specific microbes that are involved in helping you prevent autoimmune diseases
- **[03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s0jIXMc3PS0&t=238s)** — in that they greatly affect the Treg cells as well as suppressing these other inflammatory immune cells over here.
- **[04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s0jIXMc3PS0&t=247s)** — And the first one is called B. infantis, or it might be pronounced infantis, I'm not sure, that helped develop our nervous system.
- **[04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s0jIXMc3PS0&t=256s)** — This microbe is highly sensitive to antibiotics, to steroids, to junk foods, to a lot of things in the environment.
- **[04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s0jIXMc3PS0&t=265s)** — And so what I'm saying is about 70% of the population is just missing this microbe right here.
- **[04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s0jIXMc3PS0&t=271s)** — And this microbe is very important in helping you support this Treg cell.
- **[04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s0jIXMc3PS0&t=277s)** — Elruderi is another really key microbe.
- **[04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s0jIXMc3PS0&t=280s)** — And unfortunately, it too is very sensitive to broad spectrum antibiotics.
- **[04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s0jIXMc3PS0&t=286s)** — 97% of the population is missing this microbe too.
- **[04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s0jIXMc3PS0&t=289s)** — The other thing that's really cool about this Elruderi is it helps to increase this hormone called oxytocin,
- **[04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s0jIXMc3PS0&t=296s)** — which is probably one of the most potent anti-stress hormones ever.
- **[05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s0jIXMc3PS0&t=302s)** — Now, why is that important? We can keep our immune system healthy.
- **[05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s0jIXMc3PS0&t=305s)** — You have to realize when we're going through stress, we have high levels of cortisol.
- **[05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s0jIXMc3PS0&t=310s)** — Cortisol suppresses the immune system.
- **[05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s0jIXMc3PS0&t=312s)** — Normally, you should have like 35 billion white blood cells. These are the soldiers that do all the work.
- **[05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s0jIXMc3PS0&t=317s)** — And when you're exposed to cortisol, this suppresses the entire immune system.
- **[05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s0jIXMc3PS0&t=323s)** — Just think about what is the treatment to autoimmune disease?
- **[05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s0jIXMc3PS0&t=326s)** — Prednisone. What is prednisone?
- **[05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s0jIXMc3PS0&t=329s)** — It's a steroid. It's a synthetic version of cortisol.
- **[05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s0jIXMc3PS0&t=332s)** — It shuts down the entire immune system.
- **[05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s0jIXMc3PS0&t=335s)** — We also shut down the healing part of the immune system.
- **[05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s0jIXMc3PS0&t=340s)** — This is why people that have had too many steroid shots basically destroy their joints.
- **[05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s0jIXMc3PS0&t=346s)** — It acts as an antibiotic.
- **[05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s0jIXMc3PS0&t=347s)** — So vitamin D is not an immune suppressant that shuts the whole thing down.
- **[05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s0jIXMc3PS0&t=352s)** — Only the parts that are overactive.
- **[05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s0jIXMc3PS0&t=355s)** — So this microbe helps to kind of cool things down.
- **[05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s0jIXMc3PS0&t=358s)** — But this has a bigger effect over the entire immune system.
- **[06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s0jIXMc3PS0&t=361s)** — And I don't recommend just taking these in a pill.
- **[06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s0jIXMc3PS0&t=364s)** — I recommend cultivating these with a dairy product to increase these.
- **[06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s0jIXMc3PS0&t=370s)** — And that's going to help re-seed the small intestine, start healing the small intestine,
- **[06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s0jIXMc3PS0&t=374s)** — and then start to build up the T reg cells.
- **[06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s0jIXMc3PS0&t=377s)** — So number one, vitamin D is essential.
- **[06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s0jIXMc3PS0&t=379s)** — Number two, you reestablish the microbes that are usually missing.
- **[06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s0jIXMc3PS0&t=383s)** — And number three, selenium.
- **[06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s0jIXMc3PS0&t=386s)** — Now, what does selenium do?
- **[06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s0jIXMc3PS0&t=387s)** — Well, that's a trace mineral. You only need it in small amounts.
- **[06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s0jIXMc3PS0&t=390s)** — I would recommend like 200 micrograms, not milligrams.
- **[06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s0jIXMc3PS0&t=394s)** — But selenium has a very unique function for the immune system.
- **[06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s0jIXMc3PS0&t=397s)** — If you're low in selenium, you're going to have higher amounts of these two inflammatory cells.
- **[06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s0jIXMc3PS0&t=403s)** — And remember, in autoimmune, they're already too high.
- **[06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s0jIXMc3PS0&t=405s)** — So we have to lower this.
- **[06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s0jIXMc3PS0&t=407s)** — So selenium is going to help lower these two cells right here.
- **[06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s0jIXMc3PS0&t=410s)** — Also selenium is going to help lower the antibodies.
- **[06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s0jIXMc3PS0&t=413s)** — And I'm talking about the... it's called autoantibodies, which are involved in this self-attack.
- **[06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s0jIXMc3PS0&t=418s)** — Your own immune system is attacking itself.
- **[07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s0jIXMc3PS0&t=421s)** — Selenium can help turn that down.
- **[07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s0jIXMc3PS0&t=423s)** — You can also take it as a supplement.
- **[07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s0jIXMc3PS0&t=425s)** — And the last point I'm going to bring up about this is prolonged fasting.
- **[07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s0jIXMc3PS0&t=429s)** — When you do prolonged fasting, you can greatly increase the Treg cells.
- **[07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s0jIXMc3PS0&t=434s)** — And there's a lot of people that are getting rid of inflammation by doing periodic prolonged fasting.
- **[07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s0jIXMc3PS0&t=440s)** — I'm talking about like three days at a time.
- **[07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s0jIXMc3PS0&t=443s)** — You're not eating anything.
- **[07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s0jIXMc3PS0&t=444s)** — You're drinking water, but you're not eating anything.
- **[07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s0jIXMc3PS0&t=446s)** — You can greatly improve your immune system to the point where you can create new stem cells to build up your immune system.
- **[07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s0jIXMc3PS0&t=454s)** — So these three things right here are the most important things
- **[07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s0jIXMc3PS0&t=458s)** — to help shift this very hot immune system problem, bring it back to an optimum temperature.
- **[07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s0jIXMc3PS0&t=466s)** — So you can put this autoimmune disease back in remission.
- **[07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s0jIXMc3PS0&t=469s)** — Now, since I spend a little more time on this vitamin D, if you have not seen this video on vitamin D,
- **[07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s0jIXMc3PS0&t=474s)** — it's probably a good idea to check it out.
- **[07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s0jIXMc3PS0&t=476s)** — And I put that up right here.

- **[00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTAc8IaUWTc&t=0s)** — So I'm driving my tractor carrying a bale of hay. And the bale of hay weighs about
- **[00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTAc8IaUWTc&t=8s)** — 2,000 pounds, right? And I had it on what's called the front loader, the front part of the tractor.
- **[00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTAc8IaUWTc&t=12s)** — I'm going down the hill and there's nothing flat where my farm is. Everything's on angles,
- **[00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTAc8IaUWTc&t=18s)** — steep angles, cliffs, things like that. So I'm driving down this pathway to this paddock.
- **[00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTAc8IaUWTc&t=25s)** — And of course my wife said, you probably should let someone else do that. You're not very experienced
- **[00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTAc8IaUWTc&t=31s)** — in a tractor. I'm like, I can do it. I'm driving down and I have too much weight, too high on the
- **[00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTAc8IaUWTc&t=36s)** — front of this tractor, driving on a hillside, which is not very stable. So the tractor started
- **[00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTAc8IaUWTc&t=43s)** — to tip over. At that moment I had what they call a stress event. This is called flight
- **[00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTAc8IaUWTc&t=51s)** — or fight. Now in flight or fight, you know, you have two options. You can fight or you can
- **[00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTAc8IaUWTc&t=58s)** — fly, get the heck out of there. And so I chose the flight part, get off the tractor real fast,
- **[01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTAc8IaUWTc&t=63s)** — try not to kill yourself as the tractor went through the electric fence and off the cliff.
- **[01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTAc8IaUWTc&t=68s)** — So I experienced stress. So today we're going to dig into this and I'm just using myself
- **[01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTAc8IaUWTc&t=74s)** — as an example. I was under some severe shock, stress, and what happens in that mode, you have
- **[01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTAc8IaUWTc&t=83s)** — the flight or fight mechanism kick in. That's part of what's called the autonomic nervous
- **[01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTAc8IaUWTc&t=87s)** — system. So the word autonomic means involuntary. It happens automatically without your control or
- **[01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTAc8IaUWTc&t=99s)** — will. Okay. And that's the key point is this word control. You're going to be stressed out
- **[01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTAc8IaUWTc&t=106s)** — as much as you are out of control in a situation. And you'll be less stressed the more you're in
- **[01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTAc8IaUWTc&t=112s)** — control. So there are stress states like exercise, you're stressing your body or a jacuzzi
- **[01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTAc8IaUWTc&t=118s)** — or a cold bath. Those are all stresses, very positive stress. It's going to help you.
- **[02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTAc8IaUWTc&t=123s)** — But any stress that you are out of control puts you in a bad place. But in my situation,
- **[02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTAc8IaUWTc&t=131s)** — I had this sudden burst of adrenaline, massive adrenaline that stayed in my bloodstream all day,
- **[02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTAc8IaUWTc&t=137s)** — as well as cortisol. I was in a state of panic. I was hyperventilating. I was breathing
- **[02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTAc8IaUWTc&t=143s)** — really fast at the time. My blood pressure went up. My pulse rate went up. I was sweating.
- **[02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTAc8IaUWTc&t=149s)** — That's what happens when you have this stress event because the autonomic nervous system kicks
- **[02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTAc8IaUWTc&t=153s)** — in there as a survival mechanism and it starts to alter your physiology and your anatomy to deal
- **[02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTAc8IaUWTc&t=161s)** — with this stress. First of all, I wanted just to really define the differentiating factor
- **[02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTAc8IaUWTc&t=167s)** — of this thing that happens when you get stressed out. And that is whether you're in
- **[02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTAc8IaUWTc&t=172s)** — control or out of control. And that can be with a situation, a condition, a relationship
- **[02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTAc8IaUWTc&t=177s)** — with a person. It can also be in a relationship where you don't seem to have a lot of control
- **[03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTAc8IaUWTc&t=182s)** — over the situation. You're really stuck in that relationship and you're not controlling it. It's
- **[03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTAc8IaUWTc&t=188s)** — controlling you. So in a stress state, you have a lot of these involuntary glandular secretions
- **[03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTAc8IaUWTc&t=195s)** — and reactions occurring that are below your control. Now, there are two organs in your
- **[03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTAc8IaUWTc&t=204s)** — body that have both involuntary as well as voluntary control. And the first one is called
- **[03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTAc8IaUWTc&t=211s)** — the diaphragm. That's the muscle underneath your lungs that allows you to breathe. And if you
- **[03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTAc8IaUWTc&t=218s)** — are aware when you're in a stress mode, you're usually hyperventilating or your breathing is
- **[03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTAc8IaUWTc&t=223s)** — always off. It's like... you could be doing that or you can be hyperventilating. And what's
- **[03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTAc8IaUWTc&t=229s)** — interesting, it's really the imbalance in oxygen and CO2. That's the problem. When you
- **[04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTAc8IaUWTc&t=241s)** — are in a panic attack, where if you have asthma, you breathe in a paper bag, you're breathing in
- **[04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTAc8IaUWTc&t=247s)** — more carbon dioxide, which automatically releases the absorption of oxygen, which is interesting.
- **[04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTAc8IaUWTc&t=254s)** — So anytime you are in a panic attack or a stress event or trying to sleep because you're
- **[04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTAc8IaUWTc&t=259s)** — too stressed out, you should start to do controlled breathing where you're under total
- **[04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTAc8IaUWTc&t=266s)** — voluntary breathing control. Slow your breath down, breathe in, breathe out, maybe at a count
- **[04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTAc8IaUWTc&t=275s)** — of four seconds. You just focus on that. That is very, very powerful to put back in the control
- **[04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTAc8IaUWTc&t=284s)** — over this whole system and pull yourself out of this reactive fight or fight mode. It's called
- **[04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTAc8IaUWTc&t=293s)** — the sympathetic nervous system. And that's what I did during this tractor event. As I walked home,
- **[04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTAc8IaUWTc&t=299s)** — because I had nothing to drive home, I slowly worked on my breathing in and out to pull myself
- **[05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTAc8IaUWTc&t=305s)** — out of this shock. And the second organ, which is really the skeletal muscles of your body,
- **[05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTAc8IaUWTc&t=312s)** — the skeletal muscles have reflexes in them that respond to various things. For example,
- **[05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTAc8IaUWTc&t=318s)** — if you touch a hot stove or like in my case, an electric fence to see if it was alive or not,
- **[05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTAc8IaUWTc&t=325s)** — I didn't have to think about taking the hand off. It's just an automatic reflex. So that
- **[05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTAc8IaUWTc&t=331s)** — would be an involuntary skeletal muscle reflex, but you can also voluntarily control
- **[05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTAc8IaUWTc&t=337s)** — your muscles, right? So this is another thing I would highly recommend when you're in a
- **[05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTAc8IaUWTc&t=341s)** — stress event. You use your muscles, you either exercise, okay, where you're controlling
- **[05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTAc8IaUWTc&t=347s)** — your body and or go for a long walk, which is also exercise. You can go for a long walk
- **[05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTAc8IaUWTc&t=353s)** — and you start moving your muscles, flushing out the adrenaline, the cortisol. So those two things,
- **[05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTAc8IaUWTc&t=358s)** — I think, are going to be very, very important to quickly pull yourself out of any stress state.
- **[06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTAc8IaUWTc&t=364s)** — Okay. Now the origin of this autonomic nervous system, which is the flight or fight,
- **[06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTAc8IaUWTc&t=371s)** — is actually in the brain and it's in the brain stem. That's the part underneath the
- **[06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTAc8IaUWTc&t=376s)** — rest of the brain. And also it's in the limbic system that's connected to certain emotions.
- **[06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTAc8IaUWTc&t=382s)** — Of course, when you're experiencing stress, you experience different emotions too, like fear,
- **[06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTAc8IaUWTc&t=387s)** — anger, that type of thing. But in the brain, okay, the limbic system, and especially
- **[06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTAc8IaUWTc&t=393s)** — the brain stem, are highly susceptible to a vitamin B1 thiamine deficiency. What does that
- **[06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTAc8IaUWTc&t=402s)** — mean? It means that if you are deficient in B1, for any reason, those two areas of your brain will
- **[06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTAc8IaUWTc&t=409s)** — suffer. Okay. And the tissue can even break down. Now it's reversible, but it can break down.
- **[06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTAc8IaUWTc&t=416s)** — So if you're deficient in B1, the effects that can happen because of this problem in the brain
- **[07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTAc8IaUWTc&t=422s)** — stem and the limbic system is almost identical to hypoxia. That is a condition where you're
- **[07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTAc8IaUWTc&t=429s)** — lacking oxygen. There's something about oxygen that is really good, right? I mean,
- **[07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTAc8IaUWTc&t=435s)** — breathing is really good. So when you are suffocating or let's say you're underwater and
- **[07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTAc8IaUWTc&t=440s)** — you can't seem to get above water and you can't breathe, you will automatically trigger
- **[07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTAc8IaUWTc&t=445s)** — the sympathetic nervous system or the stress reflexes. Well, guess what? A B1 deficiency
- **[07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTAc8IaUWTc&t=452s)** — can mimic a mild version of that of hypoxia. And they call it pseudo hypoxia. And also what
- **[07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTAc8IaUWTc&t=460s)** — comes along with that is difficulty breathing. And the reason I'm bringing this up is because
- **[07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTAc8IaUWTc&t=464s)** — I want to emphasize the importance of this B1 in pulling yourself out of a stress state
- **[07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTAc8IaUWTc&t=470s)** — and preventing stress, especially with your breathing, especially with your nervous system.
- **[07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTAc8IaUWTc&t=477s)** — Even the condition called SIDS, sudden infant death syndrome, is linked to a B1 deficiency.
- **[08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTAc8IaUWTc&t=484s)** — And that's a situation where an infant can die in the crib because they stop breathing. So B1
- **[08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTAc8IaUWTc&t=490s)** — keeps the oxygen high. It keeps you breathing. It keeps you out of the stress mode. So those
- **[08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTAc8IaUWTc&t=497s)** — are the three things that you should focus on when dealing with stress. I'm just reminding
- **[08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTAc8IaUWTc&t=501s)** — you of this because you probably already know this, but I wanted to emphasize it. But there's
- **[08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTAc8IaUWTc&t=506s)** — a lot of things you can do with stress. But when we're talking about a B1 deficiency,
- **[08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTAc8IaUWTc&t=511s)** — you should really know all of the factors that can create a deficiency.
- **[08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTAc8IaUWTc&t=515s)** — And for that information, you should watch this video right here.

- **[00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDRf0Lf5sE0&t=0s)** — I'm going to share with you the absolute best vitamin for arthritis. And I'm not talking about vitamin D. Vitamin D is great. But there's something else that's amazing. I stumbled on this by accident. I was taking this vitamin. I never took it before. Go to sleep. Wake up. And I just noticed like all this stiffness that would normally have because of all the injuries to my spine. It's like someone to put WD-40 in my joints. I'm like, why?
- **[00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDRf0Lf5sE0&t=29s)** — Am I feeling so loose? So I'm like, oh, I took that vitamin the day before. So with arthritis, you have inflammation, breakdown of the cartilage. You have wear and tear. You have pain. People are taking NSAIDs to get rid of inflammation. The problem is there's some side effects. GI bleeding, ulcers, kidney problems, things like that. If you take a steroid, the side effect is it'll destroy your joints. It'll lower your immune system. So is there something that you could take that doesn't have these adverse effects?
- **[00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDRf0Lf5sE0&t=59s)** — And the answer is yes, specifically in the mitochondria. And it's a precursor to this molecule called NAD. NAD is kind of a helper molecule for turning food into energy like ATP. And so we're talking about biochemistry here. We're talking about helping move these things called electrons, which are really unusable until you package them into a certain
- **[01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDRf0Lf5sE0&t=89s)** — energy form. So that's what NAD helps you with. And NAD is involved in over 400 different genes. So it's a really important molecule. And I'm going to talk about first what happens when you're deficient in NAD. All right, number one, you're going to have low collagen repair. Number two, you're going to have inflammation. Number three, you're going to have fatigue because you're not going to be able to make energy. Number four, you're going to have muscle pain, muscle
- **[01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDRf0Lf5sE0&t=119s)** — weakness, and even loss of muscle. Number five, you'll have metabolic diseases, right? And that could range anywhere from diabetes, Alzheimer's, even cancer. Next one is aging faster than you should. Because if you can't repair the DNA, you're going to age faster. And then the next one is lowered immune system. But aspirin targets something in your cells that helps make proteins in certain types
- **[02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDRf0Lf5sE0&t=149s)** — of fats. Well, it just so happens that this vitamin that I'm about to reveal does a similar thing to aspirin, but without the side effects, it helps to reduce the oxidative stress in the endoplasmic reticulum. So that's very interesting. So that's probably why my neck is so loose right now, which I'm very excited about. All right, so what is this vitamin called? Vitamin B3, niacetamide. There's two versions of B3. You have niacin and you have niacetamide. Niacin is really
- **[02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDRf0Lf5sE0&t=179s)** — good for lipids and cholesterol and all that stuff. Niacetamide works more on inflammation, arthritis, and many other things as well. And so niacetamide. So here's how you'd want to take it. You'd want to take smaller amounts of it through the day, than higher amounts once a day. So maybe you take 100 to 150 milligrams, three to six times a day, depending on how severe your arthritis
- **[03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDRf0Lf5sE0&t=209s)** — is. So in other words, taking a little bit more niacetamide through the day helps to allow your biochemistry to work a lot better, despite having these genetic issues. They're called polymorphisms. Okay, a couple other things about this. You'd want to make sure you have sufficient protein for it to work because you need protein, right? It's like the building block to help you repair the joint. Also make sure you're not drinking any alcohol. I don't know if you know this, but tryptophan
- **[03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDRf0Lf5sE0&t=239s)** — can convert to B3 as well, but the efficiency of that is not very efficient. It takes like 60 times the units of tryptophan to turn into one unit of B3. A lot of times people are not getting that conversion, despite all the problems in the diet, especially if you consume a lot of corn that can block your tryptophan. And also if you're eating junk foods and things like that, you can definitely easily be deficient in vitamin B3. But I just wanted to give you a little bit of a
- **[04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDRf0Lf5sE0&t=269s)** — overview, maybe the mechanism of how this niacinamide works. And I'm liking it a lot. And I think out of all the things that I've taken, and I'm not telling you not to take other things like vitamin D, but this niacinamide is just fascinating. I'm not recommending taking it right before bed at first. You want to kind of gradually work into it maybe earlier in the day. But there's some people that say that just helps them sleep. Niacinamide also helps to give you energy to exercise, which is really cool. But I wanted to just kind of focus in on this natural remedy for
- **[04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDRf0Lf5sE0&t=299s)** — arthritis that, boy, if you have arthritis, it sure is nice to have something that is non toxic, that's effective, and that is very low cost. Now, if you wanted to know the number one anti inflammatory food you should be eating, you should probably check out this video right here.

- **[00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Quo5bOpK4GA&t=0s)** — The most common sign of a leaky gut is bloating.
- **[00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Quo5bOpK4GA&t=5s)** — In your gut, you have these little tiny upside down roots.
- **[00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Quo5bOpK4GA&t=9s)** — When you start to develop a leaky gut, you're getting this crevice or hole
- **[00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Quo5bOpK4GA&t=13s)** — between these little hair-like projections where all sorts of things can travel through
- **[00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Quo5bOpK4GA&t=18s)** — without getting the stamp of approval from your immune system.
- **[00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Quo5bOpK4GA&t=21s)** — Let's say, for example, you ate something with egg and some of that protein
- **[00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Quo5bOpK4GA&t=26s)** — leaks down and gets through the intestine. Your immune cells are going to go crazy
- **[00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Quo5bOpK4GA&t=32s)** — because they're going to think this is a virus or a bacteria or some type of pathogen.
- **[00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Quo5bOpK4GA&t=37s)** — And so what it's going to do, it's going to tag it.
- **[00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Quo5bOpK4GA&t=40s)** — So the next time you eat peanuts, all of a sudden you have this immune reaction.
- **[00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Quo5bOpK4GA&t=44s)** — And you're like, wait a second, I didn't think I was allergic to peanuts.
- **[00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Quo5bOpK4GA&t=47s)** — The same thing will happen with eggs, protein, or anything.
- **[00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Quo5bOpK4GA&t=50s)** — So here you are all of a sudden allergic to all these different foods and you don't know why.
- **[00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Quo5bOpK4GA&t=55s)** — And this generates a lot of inflammation and joint pain.
- **[00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Quo5bOpK4GA&t=59s)** — It's going to also show up on a lot of different types of skin reactions.
- **[01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Quo5bOpK4GA&t=64s)** — Psoriasis, dermatitis. You may even notice headaches
- **[01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Quo5bOpK4GA&t=67s)** — because you have this connection between the gut and your brain.
- **[01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Quo5bOpK4GA&t=72s)** — But the most damaging thing that a leaky gut will do,
- **[01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Quo5bOpK4GA&t=76s)** — it can set you up for an autoimmune disease.
- **[01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Quo5bOpK4GA&t=79s)** — Things like Hashimoto's, which is a thyroid autoimmune condition
- **[01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Quo5bOpK4GA&t=83s)** — where your own immune system is attacking your own tissues.
- **[01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Quo5bOpK4GA&t=87s)** — But now the big question is, what causes a leaky gut?
- **[01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Quo5bOpK4GA&t=91s)** — If we can dig down into that, then we can get rid of the bloating
- **[01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Quo5bOpK4GA&t=95s)** — and all the other symptoms associated with it.
- **[01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Quo5bOpK4GA&t=98s)** — The seven most common causes of a leaky gut. I'm going to start with number seven.
- **[01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Quo5bOpK4GA&t=103s)** — Gluten. Okay, gluten is in grains.
- **[01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Quo5bOpK4GA&t=105s)** — The only protein that we as humans cannot digest.
- **[01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Quo5bOpK4GA&t=108s)** — And many people might have an allergy to it or they might just have an intolerance to it.
- **[01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Quo5bOpK4GA&t=113s)** — Now, the next thing that can cause leaky gut is sugar.
- **[01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Quo5bOpK4GA&t=117s)** — Consuming a lot of sugar creates like a rusting effect throughout the entire body.
- **[02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Quo5bOpK4GA&t=121s)** — Number five, fiber.
- **[02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Quo5bOpK4GA&t=124s)** — Fiber is considered something that's beneficial to our guts.
- **[02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Quo5bOpK4GA&t=127s)** — And it is because it feeds our microbes.
- **[02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Quo5bOpK4GA&t=130s)** — But the problem is if you have leaky gut, now when you consume that fiber,
- **[02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Quo5bOpK4GA&t=134s)** — you're going to have more bloating because we have a disruption
- **[02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Quo5bOpK4GA&t=138s)** — of all the microbes in your gut.
- **[02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Quo5bOpK4GA&t=141s)** — And they can just create a lot of gas for you.
- **[02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Quo5bOpK4GA&t=144s)** — All right, number four, lectins in beans, especially.
- **[02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Quo5bOpK4GA&t=148s)** — It's also in grain fed dairy from cows that were fed grains.
- **[02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Quo5bOpK4GA&t=154s)** — If it says grass fed, you're good.
- **[02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Quo5bOpK4GA&t=155s)** — If it doesn't say grass fed, assume it's grain fed.
- **[02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Quo5bOpK4GA&t=159s)** — Number three, certain raw vegetables like broccoli.
- **[02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Quo5bOpK4GA&t=163s)** — It could be cauliflower. It could be cabbage.
- **[02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Quo5bOpK4GA&t=165s)** — Number two, seed oils.
- **[02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Quo5bOpK4GA&t=167s)** — I'm talking about corn oil, canola oil.
- **[02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Quo5bOpK4GA&t=170s)** — And these foods are highly inflammatory and they definitely will create leakiness in your gut.
- **[02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Quo5bOpK4GA&t=174s)** — Number one, a vitamin D deficiency.
- **[02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Quo5bOpK4GA&t=177s)** — Regardless of whether you're getting rid of gluten, you know,
- **[03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Quo5bOpK4GA&t=180s)** — or going carnivore because you can't handle the fiber for a couple of months,
- **[03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Quo5bOpK4GA&t=184s)** — you need to take good amounts of vitamin D to fully heal your gut.
- **[03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Quo5bOpK4GA&t=189s)** — Now, either get a lot of sun without becoming burned
- **[03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Quo5bOpK4GA&t=192s)** — or start taking at least 20,000 IUs of vitamin D3 every single day.
- **[03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Quo5bOpK4GA&t=198s)** — Now, this will start you on the road to healing the gut,
- **[03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Quo5bOpK4GA&t=201s)** — but there's some other things you need to be aware of as well.
- **[03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Quo5bOpK4GA&t=204s)** — And that would be glutamine.
- **[03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Quo5bOpK4GA&t=206s)** — Glutamine is most important for the gut.
- **[03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Quo5bOpK4GA&t=208s)** — And the food that's the highest in glutamine is red meat.
- **[03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Quo5bOpK4GA&t=212s)** — Another food that's high in glutamine is cabbage.
- **[03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Quo5bOpK4GA&t=215s)** — You can get it in sauerkraut.
- **[03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Quo5bOpK4GA&t=218s)** — Another food that's high in glutamine is bone broth.
- **[03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Quo5bOpK4GA&t=220s)** — Eggs.
- **[03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Quo5bOpK4GA&t=221s)** — Kefir.
- **[03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Quo5bOpK4GA&t=222s)** — Another thing to think about is zinc.
- **[03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Quo5bOpK4GA&t=225s)** — You know, oysters have the most zinc, but any type of shellfish or seafood,
- **[03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Quo5bOpK4GA&t=229s)** — you can also do sea kelp as well.
- **[03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Quo5bOpK4GA&t=231s)** — And the last most important thing you can do is to give your digestive system
- **[03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Quo5bOpK4GA&t=238s)** — a chance to rest and repair.
- **[04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Quo5bOpK4GA&t=240s)** — And this is called fasting.
- **[04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Quo5bOpK4GA&t=242s)** — That right there will probably be the most important thing to do
- **[04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Quo5bOpK4GA&t=245s)** — to really turning in this situation around.
- **[04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Quo5bOpK4GA&t=248s)** — And I wish someone told me what I'm telling you right now.

- **[00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uw21AZN7Ulc&t=10s)** — Because the answer is actually not sugar.
- **[00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uw21AZN7Ulc&t=12s)** — If we look at how much a sugar depletes you of certain nutrients,
- **[00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uw21AZN7Ulc&t=16s)** — a starch will deplete you way more than a sugar.
- **[00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uw21AZN7Ulc&t=19s)** — We are talking about Refined Rice Flour, Tapioca Flour, Corn Flour,
- **[00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uw21AZN7Ulc&t=24s)** — Modified Corn Starch, Molto Dextrin, and Modified Food Starch.
- **[00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uw21AZN7Ulc&t=28s)** — In order to process or metabolize or break down a Refined Starch and turn it into energy,
- **[00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uw21AZN7Ulc&t=38s)** — it requires certain nutrients.
- **[00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uw21AZN7Ulc&t=40s)** — One of the big nutrients that is needed to metabolize starches is Vitamin B1, Thiamine.
- **[00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uw21AZN7Ulc&t=46s)** — Another question that you might have is why is a starch worse than a sugar as far as
- **[00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uw21AZN7Ulc&t=52s)** — depleting nutrients?
- **[00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uw21AZN7Ulc&t=53s)** — A person consumes much less sugar than starch in their given diet.
- **[00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uw21AZN7Ulc&t=57s)** — An average person consumes about 150 pounds of sugar per year.
- **[01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uw21AZN7Ulc&t=63s)** — An average person consumes almost 300 pounds of starch per year.
- **[01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uw21AZN7Ulc&t=68s)** — On the glycemic index, Refined Starches are much, much higher than sugar.
- **[01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uw21AZN7Ulc&t=74s)** — What is the glycemic index?
- **[01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uw21AZN7Ulc&t=75s)** — It's a measurement or a scale of how fast a food or a carbohydrate
- **[01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uw21AZN7Ulc&t=80s)** — can turn into glucose or raise your blood sugar.
- **[01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uw21AZN7Ulc&t=84s)** — We compare sugar to starches. Sugar is about 74. Maltodextrin is like 180.
- **[01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uw21AZN7Ulc&t=92s)** — And those Refined Starches jack up your blood sugar way faster.
- **[01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uw21AZN7Ulc&t=95s)** — One of the really important nutrients that's needed is Vitamin B1, Thiamine.
- **[01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uw21AZN7Ulc&t=100s)** — A couple things you need to know about Thiamine. We don't store a lot of it.
- **[01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uw21AZN7Ulc&t=103s)** — I mean, like in an entire body, we might store 30 milligrams.
- **[01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uw21AZN7Ulc&t=107s)** — The RDAs for B1, which were established like 80 or 100 years ago,
- **[01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uw21AZN7Ulc&t=112s)** — have never been changed.
- **[01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uw21AZN7Ulc&t=112s)** — It's like between 1 and 1.2 milligrams.
- **[01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uw21AZN7Ulc&t=117s)** — Do you realize how tiny that is?
- **[01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uw21AZN7Ulc&t=118s)** — From my viewpoint, that is like way, way, way too low.
- **[02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uw21AZN7Ulc&t=122s)** — Doctors never check for a Vitamin B1 deficiency.
- **[02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uw21AZN7Ulc&t=124s)** — What are the symptoms of the B1 deficiency?
- **[02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uw21AZN7Ulc&t=126s)** — Beyond fatigue is problems with your GI system, your digestion.
- **[02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uw21AZN7Ulc&t=132s)** — You might get slow digestion, bloating, maybe a little constipation,
- **[02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uw21AZN7Ulc&t=137s)** — feeling nauseous, because so many parts of the digestion need B1.
- **[02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uw21AZN7Ulc&t=141s)** — You're also not going to make enough stomach acid.
- **[02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uw21AZN7Ulc&t=143s)** — Can't release the bile coming out from the liver.
- **[02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uw21AZN7Ulc&t=146s)** — Just going to get a lack of digestion.
- **[02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uw21AZN7Ulc&t=149s)** — Another common symptom with a B1 deficiency is stress, nervous tension,
- **[02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uw21AZN7Ulc&t=155s)** — solving problems, especially when you're trying to get to sleep.
- **[02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uw21AZN7Ulc&t=158s)** — This is why a B1 deficiency creates insomnia.
- **[02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uw21AZN7Ulc&t=162s)** — You're just not going to sleep that good.
- **[02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uw21AZN7Ulc&t=163s)** — As this deficiency gets worse, you're going to notice a personality changes.
- **[02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uw21AZN7Ulc&t=169s)** — Mood swings more frequently.
- **[02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uw21AZN7Ulc&t=170s)** — If you're in a relationship with someone and they just like
- **[02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uw21AZN7Ulc&t=174s)** — fly off the handle with no reason and they're extremely moody,
- **[02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uw21AZN7Ulc&t=177s)** — suspect a vitamin B1 deficiency.
- **[02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uw21AZN7Ulc&t=179s)** — How many children have that?
- **[03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uw21AZN7Ulc&t=181s)** — Purely because they're eating too many refined starches.
- **[03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uw21AZN7Ulc&t=183s)** — They need a lot of B1.
- **[03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uw21AZN7Ulc&t=184s)** — Women that are pregnant are more susceptible to a B1 deficiency.
- **[03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uw21AZN7Ulc&t=188s)** — One of the big symptoms that they get right off the bat is feeling nauseous.
- **[03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uw21AZN7Ulc&t=193s)** — If you yourself are pregnant or you know someone who's pregnant and they get nauseous,
- **[03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uw21AZN7Ulc&t=197s)** — make sure they take more B1.
- **[03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uw21AZN7Ulc&t=198s)** — Because also that infant needs B1 too, especially in the early years.
- **[03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uw21AZN7Ulc&t=202s)** — Infants, they can have what's called a horse cry.
- **[03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uw21AZN7Ulc&t=205s)** — When they're trying to cry but no voice comes out.
- **[03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uw21AZN7Ulc&t=208s)** — Muscle twitches.
- **[03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uw21AZN7Ulc&t=209s)** — Can't get enough air. Your breathing is going to be off.
- **[03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uw21AZN7Ulc&t=212s)** — I wonder how many people with sleep apnea just have a vitamin B1 deficiency.
- **[03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uw21AZN7Ulc&t=216s)** — All the starch that comes in the body that breaks down on the glucose,
- **[03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uw21AZN7Ulc&t=219s)** — it can't be used as energy.
- **[03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uw21AZN7Ulc&t=221s)** — So then it's converted to lactic acid, which shuts down the oxygen.
- **[03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uw21AZN7Ulc&t=227s)** — It makes the body more acidic, which is going to affect the breathing.
- **[03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uw21AZN7Ulc&t=231s)** — And it might be even hyperventilating to try to push out more CO2 to balance this acidity.
- **[03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uw21AZN7Ulc&t=237s)** — This could be one of the reasons why people can't sleep.
- **[03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uw21AZN7Ulc&t=239s)** — And also in the muscles, they're going to get restless leg syndrome.
- **[04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uw21AZN7Ulc&t=243s)** — Another thing like diabetics.
- **[04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uw21AZN7Ulc&t=245s)** — I would say nearly 100% of all diabetics are deficient in B1 because they have
- **[04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uw21AZN7Ulc&t=249s)** — high sugar in the blood constantly demanding a lot of B1.
- **[04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uw21AZN7Ulc&t=252s)** — The form that I recommend is something called benthotamine.
- **[04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uw21AZN7Ulc&t=255s)** — It's a very specialized type of B1.
- **[04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uw21AZN7Ulc&t=257s)** — If someone is really, really deficient in B1, they literally can be psychotic.
- **[04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uw21AZN7Ulc&t=262s)** — They can also have another symptom called confabulation, which I had to look that up.
- **[04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uw21AZN7Ulc&t=267s)** — That means a production of memories, which are false,
- **[04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uw21AZN7Ulc&t=271s)** — all from a severe vitamin B1 deficiency.
- **[04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uw21AZN7Ulc&t=273s)** — Other things will exaggerate a B1 deficiency.
- **[04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uw21AZN7Ulc&t=277s)** — Alcohol, tea, coffee, raw fish, as in sushi.
- **[04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uw21AZN7Ulc&t=280s)** — Having certain digestive inflammatory issues with your gut where you can't absorb certain things.
- **[04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uw21AZN7Ulc&t=286s)** — Taking metformin can create a deficiency.
- **[04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uw21AZN7Ulc&t=288s)** — Exercising a lot increases the demand for vitamin B1.
- **[04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uw21AZN7Ulc&t=292s)** — Think about how many athletes are using maltodextrin as an energy source, but without B1.
- **[04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uw21AZN7Ulc&t=299s)** — And on top of that, they're exercising like crazy.
- **[05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uw21AZN7Ulc&t=302s)** — What are some foods high in B1?
- **[05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uw21AZN7Ulc&t=304s)** — Whole foods. You can get B1 in meat.
- **[05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uw21AZN7Ulc&t=307s)** — In fact, the meat that has the highest source of B1 is actually pork.
- **[05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uw21AZN7Ulc&t=310s)** — Meat, liver has B1. Eggs have B1. Sunflower seeds have B1.
- **[05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uw21AZN7Ulc&t=316s)** — Sometimes you hear that refined grains are a good source of B vitamins.
- **[05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uw21AZN7Ulc&t=320s)** — That's only because they're adding them in there through the fortification process.
- **[05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uw21AZN7Ulc&t=323s)** — I definitely don't recommend taking a synthetic B1 product.
- **[05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uw21AZN7Ulc&t=326s)** — I recommend taking a natural B1.
- **[05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uw21AZN7Ulc&t=328s)** — The name of the natural B1 is called allithiamine.
- **[05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uw21AZN7Ulc&t=331s)** — And it's from garlic. It fixes a lot of nerve issues.
- **[05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uw21AZN7Ulc&t=334s)** — It's a much better bioavailable source of B1.
- **[05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uw21AZN7Ulc&t=338s)** — I have a lot of it in B1, but I need to get to the next nutrient that's commonly deficient
- **[05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uw21AZN7Ulc&t=344s)** — when you consume these starches. And that is magnesium.
- **[05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uw21AZN7Ulc&t=348s)** — Magnesium is another co-factor involved in this whole process going from starches to energy.
- **[05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uw21AZN7Ulc&t=356s)** — What's really interesting about magnesium is it's needed to allow for B1 to work.
- **[06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uw21AZN7Ulc&t=362s)** — If you don't have enough magnesium, guess what?
- **[06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uw21AZN7Ulc&t=365s)** — B1 can't work either. In fact, your vitamin D won't work.
- **[06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uw21AZN7Ulc&t=368s)** — The other thing that magnesium does is it helps control calcium.
- **[06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uw21AZN7Ulc&t=372s)** — Calcium typically causes contraction of the muscle.
- **[06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uw21AZN7Ulc&t=375s)** — If there's not enough magnesium, you're going to get more contraction of the muscle.
- **[06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uw21AZN7Ulc&t=379s)** — What do you call that? A Charlie Horse muscle spasm.
- **[06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uw21AZN7Ulc&t=382s)** — Which usually occurs in the early morning because that's when you have the lowest
- **[06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uw21AZN7Ulc&t=387s)** — point of magnesium. Magnesium is important in
- **[06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uw21AZN7Ulc&t=389s)** — regulating calcium because if there's too much calcium in the wrong place,
- **[06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uw21AZN7Ulc&t=394s)** — you can get a lot of problems.
- **[06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uw21AZN7Ulc&t=396s)** — Calcium that builds up in the arteries, kidney stones.
- **[06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uw21AZN7Ulc&t=399s)** — Magnesium is so important with all that. Without magnesium, you tend to have higher
- **[06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uw21AZN7Ulc&t=403s)** — blood pressure, palpitations, just a lot of problems with the heart.
- **[06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uw21AZN7Ulc&t=407s)** — Just think about the medication is called a calcium channel blocker.
- **[06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uw21AZN7Ulc&t=412s)** — They're just mimicking the effects of magnesium because there's too much calcium
- **[06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uw21AZN7Ulc&t=415s)** — that's affecting the heart. If you don't have enough magnesium,
- **[06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uw21AZN7Ulc&t=419s)** — your cortisol goes up and then you can't sleep.
- **[07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uw21AZN7Ulc&t=421s)** — This is why a lot of people take magnesium before bed.
- **[07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uw21AZN7Ulc&t=423s)** — The type of magnesium I would recommend is magnesium glycinate.
- **[07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uw21AZN7Ulc&t=428s)** — If you're very deficient in magnesium, you can get tremors, muscle weakness,
- **[07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uw21AZN7Ulc&t=433s)** — migraines. You can't absorb vitamin D without magnesium.
- **[07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uw21AZN7Ulc&t=436s)** — So that's important. Yes, you can start taking these
- **[07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uw21AZN7Ulc&t=438s)** — nutrients to allow you to digest the starch, but a better thing would be to avoid refined
- **[07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uw21AZN7Ulc&t=445s)** — starches. For more information about these

- **[00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcMCBTDpDVU&t=0s)** — The one vitamin that reverses nerve damage.
- **[00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcMCBTDpDVU&t=4s)** — The reason I want to talk about this one vitamin is because it's the most common deficiency behind most nerve problems.
- **[00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcMCBTDpDVU&t=11s)** — Let's start with viruses.
- **[00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcMCBTDpDVU&t=13s)** — And I'm talking about two viruses that have the potential to go into the nerves on the face and create conditions like Bell's palsy.
- **[00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcMCBTDpDVU&t=21s)** — They can hide in this little nerve bundle called the ganglia.
- **[00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcMCBTDpDVU&t=24s)** — It's like a mini brain within the nerves that have this bundle of nerve cells.
- **[00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcMCBTDpDVU&t=28s)** — What's unique about it is the viruses go into those areas, those little bundles, to evade the immune system and kind of fly underneath the radar.
- **[00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcMCBTDpDVU&t=39s)** — And what the viruses do is they can turn off something called autophagy.
- **[00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcMCBTDpDVU&t=44s)** — Autophagy is a condition where you're recycling damaged proteins, but you're also recycling pathogens, bacteria, yeast, fungus, molds, and viruses.
- **[00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcMCBTDpDVU&t=54s)** — And because they're in this nerve bundle, they can hide with our immune system and they just kind of go to sleep.
- **[00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcMCBTDpDVU&t=59s)** — And our immune system doesn't know that they're there because they're not really doing anything, but just waiting for your stress to go up.
- **[01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcMCBTDpDVU&t=67s)** — Because when you have stress, you have cortisol.
- **[01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcMCBTDpDVU&t=69s)** — Cortisol is an immune suppressant.
- **[01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcMCBTDpDVU&t=71s)** — One of the most severe stresses that someone can go through is an emotional stress.
- **[01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcMCBTDpDVU&t=76s)** — And this is why a lot of these dormant viruses come out of remission after a stress event.
- **[01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcMCBTDpDVU&t=81s)** — Loss of a loved one is a huge one. Loss of money.
- **[01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcMCBTDpDVU&t=84s)** — And I've seen this a lot of times in practice with someone with a herpes virus or even shingles.
- **[01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcMCBTDpDVU&t=89s)** — I'll ask them what happened just before this and sure enough, it was a stress event.
- **[01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcMCBTDpDVU&t=93s)** — And they can come out and create other problems too, like fibromyalgia.
- **[01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcMCBTDpDVU&t=96s)** — Also problems on your face as well.
- **[01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcMCBTDpDVU&t=98s)** — There's one thing unique about those viruses.
- **[01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcMCBTDpDVU&t=101s)** — They need the amino acid called arginine to exist.
- **[01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcMCBTDpDVU&t=105s)** — And it just so happens that arginine competes with another amino acid called lysine.
- **[01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcMCBTDpDVU&t=109s)** — If you have enough lysine, you can block arginine and stop the reproduction of this virus.
- **[01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcMCBTDpDVU&t=116s)** — You have to take a lot of lysine to kind of compete and block arginine.
- **[02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcMCBTDpDVU&t=122s)** — You want to take a thousand milligrams to three thousand milligrams every single day for a period of time
- **[02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcMCBTDpDVU&t=127s)** — to put that virus back in remission as well as do whatever you can do to reduce stress.
- **[02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcMCBTDpDVU&t=132s)** — Let's take another nerve problem, sciatica.
- **[02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcMCBTDpDVU&t=134s)** — That usually comes from a disc issue.
- **[02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcMCBTDpDVU&t=137s)** — A lot of people with disc problems are deficient in copper.
- **[02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcMCBTDpDVU&t=139s)** — If you have sciatica, you may want to try either taking a supplement with copper or just putting copper cream topically around that area in your back
- **[02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcMCBTDpDVU&t=147s)** — where it originates to reduce the discomfort.
- **[02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcMCBTDpDVU&t=150s)** — Next condition is carpal tunnel syndrome. That's in your wrist.
- **[02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcMCBTDpDVU&t=153s)** — This is usually a B6 deficiency.
- **[02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcMCBTDpDVU&t=156s)** — The primary nerve that supports myelin is B12.
- **[02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcMCBTDpDVU&t=160s)** — And that would be another type of nerve problem because if you're deficient in B12,
- **[02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcMCBTDpDVU&t=163s)** — you can get like electric shock-like sensations in your nervous system.
- **[02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcMCBTDpDVU&t=168s)** — Very, very painful or even numbness.
- **[02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcMCBTDpDVU&t=170s)** — And that's because B12 is involved with the myelin sheath around the nerve.
- **[02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcMCBTDpDVU&t=175s)** — That's the outer covering that protects the nerve that insulates the nerve that allows the signals to transmit.
- **[02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcMCBTDpDVU&t=179s)** — Then we get to MS.
- **[03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcMCBTDpDVU&t=180s)** — Okay, this is an autoimmune disease.
- **[03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcMCBTDpDVU&t=182s)** — This can definitely affect your nerves, your brain.
- **[03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcMCBTDpDVU&t=185s)** — Vitamin D3 is essential in reducing inflammation within the nerve cells and also your brain cells.
- **[03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcMCBTDpDVU&t=193s)** — You need to take large amounts of vitamin D3.
- **[03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcMCBTDpDVU&t=196s)** — 50, 60, 70, 80 thousand I use of vitamin D3 to put that condition into remission.
- **[03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcMCBTDpDVU&t=204s)** — There's a lot of research on this using something called the Coimbra protocol,
- **[03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcMCBTDpDVU&t=208s)** — which I will put a link down below for more information about that.
- **[03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcMCBTDpDVU&t=211s)** — Now let's get into the most common nerve problem that exists.
- **[03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcMCBTDpDVU&t=214s)** — And that is something relating to either pre-diabetes or diabetes.
- **[03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcMCBTDpDVU&t=218s)** — A lot of people with diabetes end up with nerve problems in their feet.
- **[03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcMCBTDpDVU&t=222s)** — They get numbness in the toes first and then it kind of starts traveling in the foot.
- **[03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcMCBTDpDVU&t=226s)** — The bottom of the foot becomes painful.
- **[03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcMCBTDpDVU&t=229s)** — The sugar in the blood is creating such a demand for this one vitamin.
- **[03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcMCBTDpDVU&t=235s)** — That vitamin is called vitamin B1 thiamine.
- **[03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcMCBTDpDVU&t=238s)** — I would take it in the form of benfotamine because that tends to penetrate the myelin
- **[04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcMCBTDpDVU&t=244s)** — and get right into the nerve and very quickly reverse nerve damage.
- **[04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcMCBTDpDVU&t=248s)** — That's caused from the high sugar.
- **[04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcMCBTDpDVU&t=250s)** — The more carbohydrates or sugar someone consumes, the greater the need for B1.
- **[04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcMCBTDpDVU&t=255s)** — If you're a pre-diabetic or you're diabetic, you have a lot of sugar going through the bloodstream.
- **[04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcMCBTDpDVU&t=259s)** — That means you're going to need even more B1 to compensate.
- **[04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcMCBTDpDVU&t=262s)** — But of course, if you just come off the sugar, that might be a better solution.
- **[04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcMCBTDpDVU&t=266s)** — But benfotamine, this is a fat soluble version of B1, is the best antidote for peripheral neuropathy
- **[04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcMCBTDpDVU&t=273s)** — because B1 is necessary for the metabolism of carbohydrates.
- **[04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcMCBTDpDVU&t=278s)** — And just as a very important side note, in order for B1 to work,
- **[04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcMCBTDpDVU&t=284s)** — there's another cofactor that you need and that's magnesium.
- **[04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcMCBTDpDVU&t=287s)** — But I wanted to create this video kind of short and to the point and cover the most common issues
- **[04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcMCBTDpDVU&t=292s)** — relating to nerves and what nutrients you should focus on to hopefully reduce those problems.

- **[00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQKQ7pa5_ug&t=0s)** — I want to talk about how your food actually turns into poop.
- **[00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQKQ7pa5_ug&t=3s)** — When you're eating food, you chew your food. You're starting to break your food down.
- **[00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQKQ7pa5_ug&t=6s)** — All the stuff that you're eating is giving information through your taste buds down lower into the digestive tract.
- **[00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQKQ7pa5_ug&t=14s)** — And then you also have the stomach that has to get ready to break down the protein.
- **[00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQKQ7pa5_ug&t=18s)** — Let's talk about this valve on the top of the stomach first.
- **[00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQKQ7pa5_ug&t=20s)** — This valve is really important to keep the food in the stomach and from backing up into the esophagus.
- **[00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQKQ7pa5_ug&t=27s)** — Because if that food backs up, you have something called acid reflux or heartburn.
- **[00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQKQ7pa5_ug&t=32s)** — The real problem is the acid that you feel is just in the wrong location.
- **[00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQKQ7pa5_ug&t=35s)** — It's in the esophagus or even a little bit higher when it should be in the stomach.
- **[00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQKQ7pa5_ug&t=39s)** — The big mistake that people make is they start taking antacids,
- **[00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQKQ7pa5_ug&t=43s)** — not realizing that they're going to start to neutralize acids in the stomach.
- **[00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQKQ7pa5_ug&t=47s)** — And the more you dilute these stomach acids, the less that valve closes tightly.
- **[00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQKQ7pa5_ug&t=52s)** — Instead, if you have any of these acid regurgitation problems, you should be taking more acid.
- **[00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQKQ7pa5_ug&t=57s)** — It sounds counterintuitive, but it does work.
- **[01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQKQ7pa5_ug&t=60s)** — You can do an episode of vinegar diluted because you don't want to take it straight
- **[01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQKQ7pa5_ug&t=63s)** — because that's going to irritate your esophagus.
- **[01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQKQ7pa5_ug&t=64s)** — But also you can take a really good remedy called betaine hydrochloride.
- **[01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQKQ7pa5_ug&t=69s)** — And I have done videos on this, but you'd probably take three or four or five right before a meal.
- **[01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQKQ7pa5_ug&t=73s)** — You're not actually taking hydrochloric acid.
- **[01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQKQ7pa5_ug&t=75s)** — You're taking something that turns into hydrochloric acid.
- **[01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQKQ7pa5_ug&t=79s)** — And to really understand that a little bit deeper,
- **[01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQKQ7pa5_ug&t=80s)** — the stomach acid should be between one and three.
- **[01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQKQ7pa5_ug&t=83s)** — That is like battery acid.
- **[01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQKQ7pa5_ug&t=85s)** — That's super acidic.
- **[01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQKQ7pa5_ug&t=87s)** — As we age, the acid dilutes and gets weaker.
- **[01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQKQ7pa5_ug&t=90s)** — By the time you're 50, your stomach acid is 50% of what it was when you were 20.
- **[01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQKQ7pa5_ug&t=95s)** — If that pH is not super acid, then we don't really absorb minerals as well as we should.
- **[01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQKQ7pa5_ug&t=102s)** — In that situation, we have too much bacteria in the small intestine.
- **[01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQKQ7pa5_ug&t=106s)** — 90% of all the digestion occurs in the small intestine.
- **[01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQKQ7pa5_ug&t=109s)** — This is where you can also get leaky gut.
- **[01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQKQ7pa5_ug&t=112s)** — And leaky gut can occur if you eat a lot of things that are damaging, especially in the areas of grains.
- **[01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQKQ7pa5_ug&t=117s)** — Gluten can really create problems with that.
- **[02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQKQ7pa5_ug&t=120s)** — Junk food, refined sugar, seed oils, all of these things can actually create leaky gut.
- **[02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQKQ7pa5_ug&t=125s)** — And then we have enzymes within the small intestine that are helping you digest.
- **[02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQKQ7pa5_ug&t=129s)** — Right at the point where the stomach releases its juices into the small intestine,
- **[02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQKQ7pa5_ug&t=134s)** — pancreas also has to release something to neutralize all that stomach acid
- **[02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQKQ7pa5_ug&t=138s)** — or else it's going to burn a hole in your small intestine.
- **[02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQKQ7pa5_ug&t=140s)** — How do you know that you don't have enough acid in your stomach?
- **[02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQKQ7pa5_ug&t=143s)** — Indigestion. So you eat food and it's just like, wow, it's just not digesting.
- **[02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQKQ7pa5_ug&t=147s)** — It's kind of sitting there telling your pancreas to get ready, start to produce enzymes.
- **[02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQKQ7pa5_ug&t=152s)** — You have to then associate that with what enzymes going to be released
- **[02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQKQ7pa5_ug&t=154s)** — because you have enzymes for protein, carbs, fats.
- **[02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQKQ7pa5_ug&t=158s)** — Information is sent down to the liver and the gallbladder to prepare to digest
- **[02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQKQ7pa5_ug&t=161s)** — because we have the bile salts that are involved with that.
- **[02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQKQ7pa5_ug&t=165s)** — One tip on digestion is the worse off your digestion is the less food you should be eating.
- **[02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQKQ7pa5_ug&t=171s)** — But then we also have bile. Bile is not made by your gallbladder.
- **[02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQKQ7pa5_ug&t=174s)** — The bile is made by your liver. And so the liver makes the bile.
- **[02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQKQ7pa5_ug&t=178s)** — It goes down a little tube and then it goes right into the gallbladder
- **[03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQKQ7pa5_ug&t=181s)** — and it just gets concentrated to help you break down fats.
- **[03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQKQ7pa5_ug&t=185s)** — So here we have the fat, okay, and here we have bile. It's a detergent.
- **[03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQKQ7pa5_ug&t=189s)** — So we're going to pour it into the fat, shake it around a little bit.
- **[03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQKQ7pa5_ug&t=192s)** — It helps you break down fat so you can extract the fat nutrients.
- **[03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQKQ7pa5_ug&t=196s)** — Bile salts also kill off pathogens, bad bacteria in the small intestine.
- **[03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQKQ7pa5_ug&t=202s)** — Your microbes actually make bile salts as well.
- **[03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQKQ7pa5_ug&t=204s)** — When you become deficient in bile, you start getting bloating, burping, belching.
- **[03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQKQ7pa5_ug&t=209s)** — Your vision becomes a problem. And something else happens too.
- **[03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQKQ7pa5_ug&t=212s)** — Gallstones. If you're eating more cholesterol, bile salts will help kind of get rid of that.
- **[03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQKQ7pa5_ug&t=216s)** — The specific one I would recommend is called Tudka.
- **[03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQKQ7pa5_ug&t=218s)** — It's a very specialized type of bile salt that you take on an empty stomach.
- **[03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQKQ7pa5_ug&t=223s)** — What these bile supplements do is they start to unclog the dam and just allow it to drain properly.
- **[03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQKQ7pa5_ug&t=229s)** — It gives you a lot of relief.
- **[03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQKQ7pa5_ug&t=230s)** — Let me just move right down to the large intestine.
- **[03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQKQ7pa5_ug&t=232s)** — This is where something gets digested. You have trillions and trillions of microbes in your large intestine
- **[03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQKQ7pa5_ug&t=237s)** — that are helping you break down this fiber through an interesting process of fermentation.
- **[04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQKQ7pa5_ug&t=243s)** — Feeding the microbes fiber and then that's being converted into a type of fatty acid.
- **[04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQKQ7pa5_ug&t=249s)** — Which then feed the colon cells.
- **[04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQKQ7pa5_ug&t=251s)** — These trillions of microbes do so many wonderful things for you.
- **[04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQKQ7pa5_ug&t=255s)** — They give you 80% of your immune system.
- **[04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQKQ7pa5_ug&t=257s)** — They help you make neurotransmitters like serotonin, dopamine.
- **[04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQKQ7pa5_ug&t=261s)** — Whatever is going on in your microbes down here is going to go on up here.
- **[04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQKQ7pa5_ug&t=264s)** — When you eat food, it has to go through this entire assembly line of things that happen to the point where it ends up as poop.
- **[04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQKQ7pa5_ug&t=271s)** — Poop is like mostly water. The reason why it's brown is because of the pigment in the red blood cells that ends up in your stool.
- **[04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQKQ7pa5_ug&t=278s)** — And the smell of your poop, it's usually some gas from bacteria.
- **[04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQKQ7pa5_ug&t=282s)** — And so it has a certain smell to it, but it can smell even worse at certain times depending on what's happening in your digestion
- **[04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQKQ7pa5_ug&t=288s)** — or a lack thereof.
- **[04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQKQ7pa5_ug&t=289s)** — When you look at your poop, you can get a lot of clues on what's going on.
- **[04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQKQ7pa5_ug&t=292s)** — I'm just going to cover some general things.
- **[04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQKQ7pa5_ug&t=296s)** — Constipation, diarrhea, and that relates to missing microbes.
- **[04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQKQ7pa5_ug&t=299s)** — When you get an antibiotic, people might tell you that those microbes will come back eventually.
- **[05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQKQ7pa5_ug&t=304s)** — That's false information.
- **[05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQKQ7pa5_ug&t=305s)** — And just think about how many antibiotics we take.
- **[05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQKQ7pa5_ug&t=307s)** — Then there's also something else that acts like an antibiotic, Roundup Ready.
- **[05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQKQ7pa5_ug&t=311s)** — Roundup Ready has a chemical in it called glyphosate.
- **[05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQKQ7pa5_ug&t=314s)** — Glyphosate is an herbicide, but they also have a patent on it acting as an antibiotic because it kills off your microbes.
- **[05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQKQ7pa5_ug&t=320s)** — Even things that are non-GMO like wheat are loaded with glyphosate.
- **[05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQKQ7pa5_ug&t=325s)** — Three times more than genetically modified foods like soybeans and corn, things like that.
- **[05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQKQ7pa5_ug&t=330s)** — One safe way to avoid glyphosate is just to avoid anything connected with grains and start eating more organic foods
- **[05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQKQ7pa5_ug&t=337s)** — because the glyphosate can really mess with your microbes.
- **[05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQKQ7pa5_ug&t=341s)** — Eating fermented foods like sauerkraut, kimchi is really important, but also raw milk cheese is a really good one.
- **[05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQKQ7pa5_ug&t=347s)** — I also did a video on how to make your own probiotic from a microbe called L-Ruderide.
- **[05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQKQ7pa5_ug&t=355s)** — It increases something called oxytocin.
- **[05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQKQ7pa5_ug&t=358s)** — It makes you more social. It helps reduce stress. It helps your sleep.
- **[06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQKQ7pa5_ug&t=362s)** — Another really important tip is to do intermittent fasting because if you're eating too much and you're cramming all this food constantly,
- **[06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQKQ7pa5_ug&t=371s)** — the poor digestive system never has a chance to clean out.
- **[06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQKQ7pa5_ug&t=374s)** — Another thing that I think a lot of people are doing incorrectly is drinking these smoothies with kale and banana and pineapple.
- **[06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQKQ7pa5_ug&t=383s)** — And you just start drinking those in the morning.
- **[06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQKQ7pa5_ug&t=385s)** — Well again, if you have leaky gut or inflammation, you're just going to create more bloating and inflammation because you're dumping too much fiber down there.
- **[06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQKQ7pa5_ug&t=392s)** — Of course, I used to recommend it and for some people they would thrive on it because they needed that.
- **[06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQKQ7pa5_ug&t=397s)** — But it's not a good overall recommendation for everyone.
- **[06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQKQ7pa5_ug&t=400s)** — 90% of chronic disease is coming from your food and most medications are treating the side effects of bad food.
- **[06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQKQ7pa5_ug&t=409s)** — Thank you so much for watching and I will see you in the next video.

- **[00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuO2FwBrmqY&t=0s)** — Many times we have this idea that we just need to increase more protein to build our muscles because
- **[00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuO2FwBrmqY&t=6s)** — after all muscles are made out of protein, right? But then when a lot of people do this it doesn't
- **[00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuO2FwBrmqY&t=11s)** — always work. So in fact there's actually a paradox involved here. Some people that eat
- **[00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuO2FwBrmqY&t=16s)** — more protein might even suffer from an individual amino acid deficiency. So whether you're trying
- **[00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuO2FwBrmqY&t=22s)** — to prevent muscle loss as you're getting older, that's called sarcopenia, or whether you're
- **[00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuO2FwBrmqY&t=28s)** — increase more muscle, I want to talk about some other factors that are not related directly to
- **[00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuO2FwBrmqY&t=34s)** — protein consumption. Even though you do need sufficient protein consumption to build muscles,
- **[00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuO2FwBrmqY&t=40s)** — but more than that you need sufficient amount of amino acids. Now when you look up the minimum
- **[00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuO2FwBrmqY&t=45s)** — amount of protein you need, there's a lot of conflicting information out there. But the general
- **[00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuO2FwBrmqY&t=52s)** — consensus is you need 0.8 grams per kilogram of lean body weight. Not your overall weight. So
- **[01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuO2FwBrmqY&t=61s)** — let's say for example you weigh like 400 pounds and you have a lot of extra fat. It doesn't
- **[01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuO2FwBrmqY&t=65s)** — mean you should start massively increasing your protein. You should calculate that based on
- **[01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuO2FwBrmqY&t=70s)** — your lean body mass. So 0.8 grams per kilogram of lean body mass is kind of like on the low
- **[01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuO2FwBrmqY&t=76s)** — that's like the minimum amount. And that on average could be around 50 grams of protein
- **[01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuO2FwBrmqY&t=84s)** — per day. Now when I say protein, I'm talking about the protein in your food. For example,
- **[01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuO2FwBrmqY&t=90s)** — if you take a steak and you have like 100 grams of steak, right, the weight of it,
- **[01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuO2FwBrmqY&t=95s)** — that only has roughly about 26 grams of protein in that 100 gram steak. So it's the
- **[01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuO2FwBrmqY&t=103s)** — in the food, not the actual weight of the food. Now a moderate amount of protein could be between
- **[01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuO2FwBrmqY&t=109s)** — like 1.2 and 1.7 grams per kilogram of lean body weight. And then when we get into higher
- **[01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuO2FwBrmqY&t=115s)** — protein, that's roughly about like two grams per kilogram of lean body weight. And a lot of
- **[02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuO2FwBrmqY&t=121s)** — weight lifters will do that amount and even a lot more too. So but I'm not going to get into
- **[02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuO2FwBrmqY&t=126s)** — whether you should do that or not do that. I'm just kind of giving you some ideas on the
- **[02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuO2FwBrmqY&t=131s)** — how much protein you should have. But I want to really focus on these other factors that
- **[02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuO2FwBrmqY&t=137s)** — influence the production of muscle protein itself. Now, and a couple points I want to even
- **[02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuO2FwBrmqY&t=143s)** — touch on is your body doesn't normally store a lot of protein as like a reserve. Okay,
- **[02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuO2FwBrmqY&t=147s)** — so it doesn't store that. So if you eat too much protein, it'll just convert the excess
- **[02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuO2FwBrmqY&t=153s)** — into glucose. Bodybuilders sometimes like that because sometimes they want to increase
- **[02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuO2FwBrmqY&t=159s)** — insulin effects from glucose because insulin is anabolic and they want to build their muscle mass.
- **[02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuO2FwBrmqY&t=165s)** — And if they're fortunate enough not to have insulin resistance and maybe they're immune to
- **[02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuO2FwBrmqY&t=171s)** — it or whatever versus the rest of us that have insulin resistance, that may work for them. But
- **[02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuO2FwBrmqY&t=176s)** — for the majority of the population when they start increasing more sugar, glucose, or even
- **[03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuO2FwBrmqY&t=182s)** — glucose from protein and thereby increasing more insulin, the body tends to now create
- **[03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuO2FwBrmqY&t=187s)** — So it's kind of a catch-22. Here you're trying to increase more insulin, but the more you try
- **[03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuO2FwBrmqY&t=192s)** — to do it, the more you're creating insulin resistance to the point where now you have a deficiency
- **[03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuO2FwBrmqY&t=198s)** — of insulin. Okay, that's what insulin resistance is. So how does that affect your muscles? Well,
- **[03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuO2FwBrmqY&t=204s)** — guess what? You need insulin to absorb amino acids. So the more insulin resistance you have,
- **[03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuO2FwBrmqY&t=211s)** — the less ability you're going to be able to use these proteins for your own muscles.
- **[03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuO2FwBrmqY&t=217s)** — So that's barrier number one, insulin resistance. How was that created? By eating too many carbs.
- **[03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuO2FwBrmqY&t=223s)** — And it could be also created by consuming too much protein too. So on the flip side, if we
- **[03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuO2FwBrmqY&t=227s)** — want to correct insulin resistance, we want to get on a low carb diet. We want to not eat as
- **[03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuO2FwBrmqY&t=232s)** — frequently. And this is the other point I want to bring up about protein. So many people
- **[03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuO2FwBrmqY&t=238s)** — have this idea that they have to be constantly eating protein when they're working out
- **[04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuO2FwBrmqY&t=243s)** — before or after or even during having these protein powders and these shakes and these bars.
- **[04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuO2FwBrmqY&t=250s)** — But in fact, that's going to actually rebound on the person many times because it's going to
- **[04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuO2FwBrmqY&t=254s)** — act as a snack. It's going to increase insulin, but create more insulin resistance.
- **[04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuO2FwBrmqY&t=258s)** — And it's really not needed for many reasons, but definitely insulin resistance is one reason.
- **[04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuO2FwBrmqY&t=264s)** — The other factor involved with building muscles is growth hormone. And there are some things
- **[04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuO2FwBrmqY&t=270s)** — you want to know about growth hormone. How do you first trigger growth hormone? Well,
- **[04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuO2FwBrmqY&t=274s)** — you can trigger it by intense exercise. So if you're trying to build muscle with just eating
- **[04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuO2FwBrmqY&t=279s)** — protein and not exercising, it's not going to work. Exercise is the most potent activator of
- **[04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuO2FwBrmqY&t=286s)** — muscle synthesis, especially intense exercise, as well as the volume of exercise too. So it's
- **[04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuO2FwBrmqY&t=293s)** — not just doing a short little intense workout. It's really increasing the volume and the load
- **[04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuO2FwBrmqY&t=298s)** — the muscles doing like resistance type exercise. But exercise will stimulate growth hormone.
- **[05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuO2FwBrmqY&t=304s)** — And it also stimulates testosterone too. Both necessary for building muscle. Now,
- **[05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuO2FwBrmqY&t=310s)** — another thing that you can do to increase growth hormone is fasting, right? Fasting and not
- **[05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuO2FwBrmqY&t=315s)** — snacking so frequently. So fasting can increase growth hormone. And if you're trying to build
- **[05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuO2FwBrmqY&t=321s)** — muscle, I would just do intermittent fasting. Intermittent fasting, not eat so frequently.
- **[05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuO2FwBrmqY&t=325s)** — Eat two meals a day. I think that would be a lot better than three meals a day. Now with
- **[05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuO2FwBrmqY&t=330s)** — intermittent fasting, your hunger will go down. So you just want to make sure that you have
- **[05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuO2FwBrmqY&t=334s)** — enough calories too. Because especially if you have a fast metabolism, growth hormone also can
- **[05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuO2FwBrmqY&t=340s)** — be inhibited by high blood glucose levels. That's why I like the low carb. I like
- **[05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuO2FwBrmqY&t=348s)** — intermittent fasting and a good exercise plan. As well as a good amount of recovery from sleep.
- **[05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuO2FwBrmqY&t=357s)** — All of those factors can help increase growth hormone. Now as far as testosterone goes,
- **[06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuO2FwBrmqY&t=363s)** — there's several things you need to be aware of. Zinc deficiency can create a low
- **[06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuO2FwBrmqY&t=368s)** — testosterone. Zinc can definitely increase your testosterone. Now where do you get zinc from?
- **[06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuO2FwBrmqY&t=373s)** — Red meat, shellfish, seafood. Way more than plant type foods. How do you create a zinc deficiency?
- **[06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuO2FwBrmqY&t=382s)** — By eating too many refined carbs, too much sugar, going through stress. The other thing that
- **[06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuO2FwBrmqY&t=387s)** — can inhibit testosterone is having too much estrogen. Now where does that come from? Well,
- **[06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuO2FwBrmqY&t=393s)** — mainly comes from a lot of the soy protein isolate foods. Soy milk can do it. You also
- **[06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuO2FwBrmqY&t=400s)** — increase estrogen when you drink beer. Okay, yeah, and also consume alcohol. Now another way to
- **[06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuO2FwBrmqY&t=408s)** — create a problem with amino acids is to consume foods low in certain amino acids. Like plant
- **[06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuO2FwBrmqY&t=416s)** — based proteins. Whether you're a vegetarian or a vegan or consuming a lot of plant based
- **[07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuO2FwBrmqY&t=421s)** — protein which are considered clean proteins, many times are low in certain amino acids.
- **[07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuO2FwBrmqY&t=426s)** — One amino acid that I want to bring up is leucine. Leucine is a potent stimulus of the
- **[07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuO2FwBrmqY&t=434s)** — production of muscle. So mostly you're going to see low leucine foods in plant based foods.
- **[07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuO2FwBrmqY&t=441s)** — You're not going to see this in animal meats, things like that. So it's the type of protein
- **[07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuO2FwBrmqY&t=445s)** — that's important too. Eggs, meat, fish, dairy. All very, very important. Now another factor is
- **[07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuO2FwBrmqY&t=452s)** — stress. Stress produces cortisol. Cortisol is very catabolic. That's the opposite of anabolic.
- **[07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuO2FwBrmqY&t=458s)** — So it tends to break things down. If you're under chronic stress, that can wear your muscles
- **[07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuO2FwBrmqY&t=464s)** — down big time. Primarily it starts out in the thigh muscle, the quadricep, and then it goes
- **[07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuO2FwBrmqY&t=469s)** — after the glutamous maximus and it can convert some of that protein into sugar which
- **[07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuO2FwBrmqY&t=476s)** — then is converted to fat around your midsection. Okay, so that's just another factor to be aware
- **[08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuO2FwBrmqY&t=482s)** — of. Another factor is the microbiome. Microbiome is definitely involved in helping you make
- **[08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuO2FwBrmqY&t=488s)** — amino acids and other factors in helping you make protein in general. And so if someone had
- **[08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuO2FwBrmqY&t=495s)** — a lot of antibiotics, many times they start having all sorts of problems with their muscles,
- **[08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuO2FwBrmqY&t=501s)** — building muscles, and maintaining muscles. So consuming more probiotic foods like fermented
- **[08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuO2FwBrmqY&t=508s)** — foods like sauerkraut, things like that, that are very, very good. Now the other thing that I've
- **[08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuO2FwBrmqY&t=514s)** — run into with people is that they just don't have enough stomach acid to break down the
- **[08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuO2FwBrmqY&t=517s)** — protein. They then turn into muscle. So they never have this fully broke down protein
- **[08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuO2FwBrmqY&t=524s)** — product into the amino acids. So hydrochloric acid is very, very important, especially as
- **[08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuO2FwBrmqY&t=529s)** — we age. The stomach acid goes down. So you need to start to support that so you get the
- **[08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuO2FwBrmqY&t=534s)** — of amino acids. So butane hydrochloride is a really good thing to start taking with your meals to
- **[09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuO2FwBrmqY&t=541s)** — enhance the amino acids into the muscle. How do you know if you have a problem or deficiency of
- **[09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuO2FwBrmqY&t=547s)** — hydrochloric acid? Well, one way is indigestion or acid reflux or GERD. If you have that,
- **[09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuO2FwBrmqY&t=554s)** — you should watch the link down below. Now also enzymes. Enzymes mainly from the pancreas
- **[09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuO2FwBrmqY&t=559s)** — and even from the small intestine can be a factor. If you don't have enough enzymes,
- **[09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuO2FwBrmqY&t=563s)** — you're not going to be able to break down certain foods that then can turn into these
- **[09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuO2FwBrmqY&t=568s)** — pure amino acids. So a couple things with the pancreas. You could have a like bile sludge that
- **[09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuO2FwBrmqY&t=575s)** — can build up that can create pancreatitis. So that's a problem with the bile. And the way
- **[09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuO2FwBrmqY&t=580s)** — that you probably have that is you get a lot of bloating or you have referred pain to your
- **[09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuO2FwBrmqY&t=585s)** — left or right shoulder. I put a link down below if you have that. Or you have some type
- **[09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuO2FwBrmqY&t=591s)** — of malabsorption in your small intestine or your large intestine where there's inflammation
- **[09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuO2FwBrmqY&t=595s)** — or past gut problems that have been really hindering your ability to absorb protein.
- **[10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuO2FwBrmqY&t=602s)** — In which case you might need to take an amino acid supplement. And then the other factor I
- **[10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuO2FwBrmqY&t=608s)** — want to bring up is when you eat protein, right, you have to realize that the ideal protein
- **[10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuO2FwBrmqY&t=613s)** — your body to absorb would be in its natural form with fat versus lean protein. Okay,
- **[10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuO2FwBrmqY&t=622s)** — the leaner a protein is the harder it is to digest and the more problems it can create.
- **[10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuO2FwBrmqY&t=626s)** — There's some interesting data on that in relationship to people eating just,
- **[10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuO2FwBrmqY&t=630s)** — you know, very very lean protein and no fat and what that does to your bodies. There's a
- **[10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuO2FwBrmqY&t=635s)** — lot of problems with that. So I recommend always consume the fat that normally comes with
- **[10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuO2FwBrmqY&t=641s)** — protein if possible. Or if you're eating chicken, have the skin on it. Or fish,
- **[10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuO2FwBrmqY&t=645s)** — try to have the skin on it. That's much better. And this also includes like so many people are
- **[10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuO2FwBrmqY&t=650s)** — doing this refined protein by having protein powders all the time. I mean a little bit of
- **[10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuO2FwBrmqY&t=655s)** — that is okay, but if you're just relying exclusively on protein powders, it's not the
- **[11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuO2FwBrmqY&t=660s)** — ideal scene to build healthy muscles. Especially since they put all this maltodextrin and this
- **[11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuO2FwBrmqY&t=666s)** — corn syrup in there and all sorts of crap. But in this video, I just wanted to go beyond
- **[11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuO2FwBrmqY&t=671s)** — this dietary protein and give you some other factors, especially if you're trying to build
- **[11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuO2FwBrmqY&t=675s)** — muscle or prevent the loss of muscle as you age. Now, since I brought up growth hormone,
- **[11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuO2FwBrmqY&t=681s)** — it's a really important topic. And if you haven't seen my video on growth hormone,
- **[11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuO2FwBrmqY&t=684s)** — you should probably check that out. I put it up right here.

- **[00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GhGSLffZd0E&t=0s)** — Now, for some reason, we don't like to freeze. We don't like to starve.
- **[00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GhGSLffZd0E&t=7s)** — It's very uncomfortable. We like warm weather. We like to have food available all the time,
- **[00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GhGSLffZd0E&t=13s)** — and we definitely like to be comfortable as far as our temperature. Well, our ancestors have
- **[00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GhGSLffZd0E&t=17s)** — adapted to temperature over a very long period of time due to the season called winter.
- **[00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GhGSLffZd0E&t=25s)** — Nowadays, we can easily overcome this severe cold winter by just turning the thermostat to 70
- **[00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GhGSLffZd0E&t=32s)** — degrees. Today, I'm going to talk about some interesting research relating to cold water
- **[00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GhGSLffZd0E&t=38s)** — immersion and your genes and how using cold therapy can greatly affect your genes in a
- **[00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GhGSLffZd0E&t=45s)** — positive way. Now, I have an actual cold water immersion tank outside my house, and when I
- **[00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GhGSLffZd0E&t=51s)** — used it, I set the temperature to 37 degrees. That's pretty darn cold, and I don't recommend
- **[00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GhGSLffZd0E&t=59s)** — doing that to start out with because I could only last five seconds. I would recommend starting
- **[01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GhGSLffZd0E&t=65s)** — out at 50 degrees Fahrenheit, which is 10 degrees Celsius, starting out with just a minute,
- **[01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GhGSLffZd0E&t=71s)** — and then gradually working up from that. But to experience the benefits of this cold therapy,
- **[01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GhGSLffZd0E&t=76s)** — you want to be uncomfortable. And to experience the benefits I'm going to talk about,
- **[01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GhGSLffZd0E&t=81s)** — you really only need 11 minutes per week. So anyone can do that. Even if you don't have a
- **[01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GhGSLffZd0E&t=88s)** — cold water immersion tank, you can do this with a cold shower. You can find a pool that's really
- **[01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GhGSLffZd0E&t=93s)** — cold or maybe jump in the pond somewhere. But there's different ways of experiencing this
- **[01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GhGSLffZd0E&t=98s)** — therapy. Now, if you compare cold therapy to warm therapy, like a hot shower, you're
- **[01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GhGSLffZd0E&t=104s)** — definitely going to experience more benefits with the cold therapy simply because it's more
- **[01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GhGSLffZd0E&t=109s)** — uncomfortable. If you just can't even fathom to doing this or have no tolerance for doing this,
- **[01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GhGSLffZd0E&t=116s)** — it could be that you just need more B vitamins. B vitamins help increase the tolerance to
- **[02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GhGSLffZd0E&t=121s)** — extreme temperatures. And I will put a link down below of where I got my tank. And I'm
- **[02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GhGSLffZd0E&t=126s)** — not affiliated with this company. I get no kickbacks, but it's called the Cold Plunge Store.
- **[02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GhGSLffZd0E&t=132s)** — And I bought the tank called the Flex, but I really like it. I think the benefits are
- **[02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GhGSLffZd0E&t=137s)** — You're going to find all sorts of cool benefits relating to cognitive benefits, physical inflammation,
- **[02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GhGSLffZd0E&t=144s)** — repair, etc. So I'm going to go through the benefits and then I'll talk about
- **[02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GhGSLffZd0E&t=148s)** — the genetic benefits as well. However, I do want to make one point about when you initially
- **[02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GhGSLffZd0E&t=154s)** — get into this tank, your pulse rate is going to go up, your heart rate is going to go up.
- **[02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GhGSLffZd0E&t=159s)** — Okay, you're going to have probably the urge to hyperventilate. You'll probably have
- **[02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GhGSLffZd0E&t=164s)** — gasping where your breathing is affected. You really have to focus on controlling your breath,
- **[02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GhGSLffZd0E&t=171s)** — slow it down, breathe in, slow it down, breathe out. And that will help the shock of getting
- **[02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GhGSLffZd0E&t=178s)** — into this cold water immersion. So let's first talk about all the things that it can decrease.
- **[03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GhGSLffZd0E&t=184s)** — Okay, the first thing that it can decrease is the ratios of something called APO A to APO B
- **[03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GhGSLffZd0E&t=191s)** — ratios. And this really has to do with a cardiovascular risk. Without getting into the
- **[03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GhGSLffZd0E&t=196s)** — details, APO A and APO E have to do with proteins that are attached or that regulate
- **[03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GhGSLffZd0E&t=204s)** — the lipoproteins. And so when this ratio is decreased, you have better cardiovascular
- **[03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GhGSLffZd0E&t=210s)** — function. Another thing that will decrease is your homocysteine levels. Okay, that is
- **[03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GhGSLffZd0E&t=215s)** — another factor that's associated with cardiovascular problems. You also have decreased oxidative
- **[03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GhGSLffZd0E&t=220s)** — stress, a decrease in cortisol and the hormone that controls cortisol, which is ACTH,
- **[03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GhGSLffZd0E&t=227s)** — which is interesting because you would think your stress would go up, but it actually goes
- **[03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GhGSLffZd0E&t=231s)** — down. Maybe not initially, but as soon as you get out of the tub and you're relaxed,
- **[03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GhGSLffZd0E&t=238s)** — antibodies even decrease. Okay, so this is going to strengthen your immune system,
- **[04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GhGSLffZd0E&t=244s)** — especially if you have an autoimmune problem. Your insulin actually goes down and that's going
- **[04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GhGSLffZd0E&t=251s)** — to be a good thing because you could imagine how many body problems are associated with high
- **[04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GhGSLffZd0E&t=256s)** — insulin. Your acid goes down. Your risk for upper respiratory tract infections goes down.
- **[04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GhGSLffZd0E&t=263s)** — And as a side note, it especially go down if you're a swimmer. Swimmers have this out of
- **[04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GhGSLffZd0E&t=269s)** — cardiovascular plus many times these pools are on the cold side. So swimmers have a much less
- **[04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GhGSLffZd0E&t=276s)** — incidence of upper respiratory tract infections. Another thing that will decrease is your
- **[04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GhGSLffZd0E&t=282s)** — depression. Okay, cold water therapy is like a natural antidepressant, but without the side
- **[04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GhGSLffZd0E&t=290s)** — effects, pain will decrease, inflammation will decrease, muscle soreness will actually decrease.
- **[04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GhGSLffZd0E&t=295s)** — Now I do want to mention another thing about muscle. There's been some research that shows
- **[04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GhGSLffZd0E&t=299s)** — that when you do this on a repetitive basis, cold therapy, it can actually inhibit your gains
- **[05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GhGSLffZd0E&t=307s)** — in growing muscle. But if you're just doing, you know, 11 minutes per week, I highly doubt
- **[05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GhGSLffZd0E&t=316s)** — it's going to influence your muscles in any negative way, shape, or form. The benefits far
- **[05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GhGSLffZd0E&t=324s)** — away any potential downside. Now your recovery time will decrease when you do this therapy as
- **[05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GhGSLffZd0E&t=332s)** — well. So if you just exercise or you've done some type of athletic event, you'll recover
- **[05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GhGSLffZd0E&t=338s)** — faster. And there's also evidence that shows that cold therapy actually inhibits the growth of
- **[05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GhGSLffZd0E&t=344s)** — tumors. And one theory why this does this is because of the spike in brown fat, which can
- **[05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GhGSLffZd0E&t=350s)** — suck up a lot of the glucose, which is fuel for cancer cells. But it does make sense that
- **[05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GhGSLffZd0E&t=354s)** — cold therapy would be anti-carcinogenic because of what it does to your genes, of what it does to
- **[06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GhGSLffZd0E&t=361s)** — your immune system, and what it does to your overall survival. Now let's flip over to all the
- **[06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GhGSLffZd0E&t=367s)** — things that this cold therapy will increase. Okay, it can increase your thyroid stimulating
- **[06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GhGSLffZd0E&t=372s)** — hormone as well as increase T3, which is the active form of the thyroid hormone. Cold
- **[06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GhGSLffZd0E&t=377s)** — therapy actually increases your T cells. Okay, I'm talking about your killer T cells, which
- **[06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GhGSLffZd0E&t=383s)** — address viruses and attack cancer. Overall, it can increase your white blood cells. The
- **[06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GhGSLffZd0E&t=390s)** — concentration of zinc will increase. Your noradrenaline can increase, making you very,
- **[06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GhGSLffZd0E&t=394s)** — very alert. You can even increase your insulin sensitivity, which has to do with lowering
- **[06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GhGSLffZd0E&t=400s)** — your overall insulin. Probably one of the biggest benefits that I like about this is that
- **[06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GhGSLffZd0E&t=404s)** — increases your mental resilience. This is your capacity to adapt to stress. It makes you mentally
- **[06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GhGSLffZd0E&t=412s)** — strong when you do this. It's just kind of like the same thing with fasting. When you can
- **[06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GhGSLffZd0E&t=417s)** — not eat for a period of time, you develop a stronger willpower because you're basically now
- **[07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GhGSLffZd0E&t=423s)** — more in charge of your body versus people with a lowered willpower and they tend to
- **[07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GhGSLffZd0E&t=434s)** — Okay, we're turning on certain genes that were otherwise inhibited. There's one gene called
- **[07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GhGSLffZd0E&t=443s)** — PGC-1 alpha. And when this gene gets turned on, it creates mitochondria biogenesis. It
- **[07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GhGSLffZd0E&t=451s)** — actually increases that growth of mitochondria, which is going to help your metabolism. It's
- **[07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GhGSLffZd0E&t=455s)** — going to help generate more oxygen in the body. There's another gene called VEGF, which
- **[07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GhGSLffZd0E&t=461s)** — will increase more blood vessels. And so basically you're getting more angiogenesis,
- **[07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GhGSLffZd0E&t=468s)** — which is the production of new blood cells. There's another gene called PPARGC1A that has to
- **[07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GhGSLffZd0E&t=475s)** — do with VO2 max, your capacity to use oxygen. And if someone has a mutation with this gene,
- **[08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GhGSLffZd0E&t=483s)** — their VO2 max can be decreased up to 50%. So cold therapy can cause expression of this
- **[08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GhGSLffZd0E&t=491s)** — turn it on and increase your VO2 max. There's another gene called PSME1, which has to do with
- **[08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GhGSLffZd0E&t=500s)** — a protein aggregation or accumulation of damaged protein in the body, which creates a lot of
- **[08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GhGSLffZd0E&t=507s)** — problems. And when you add cold therapy, you can actually increase the recycling of this
- **[08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GhGSLffZd0E&t=511s)** — this protein. So you get less accumulation of this protein aggregation. Another gene is
- **[08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GhGSLffZd0E&t=516s)** — having to do with glutathione, which is like the most powerful antioxidant in your liver,
- **[08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GhGSLffZd0E&t=523s)** — which can help you break down poisons into harmless particles, which also can influence
- **[08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GhGSLffZd0E&t=528s)** — networks of other antioxidants. So cold therapy increases antioxidants. And as a side note,
- **[08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GhGSLffZd0E&t=536s)** — heat therapy, as in a sauna or even a jacuzzi, can inhibit your antioxidants. Now I'm not
- **[09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GhGSLffZd0E&t=543s)** — not to do it, but let's say for example, you do have a problem genetically with oxidative stress,
- **[09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GhGSLffZd0E&t=549s)** — then maybe you should focus more on cold therapy than heat therapy. There's another gene
- **[09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GhGSLffZd0E&t=555s)** — that gets expressed called ACTN3, which has everything to do with increasing your
- **[09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GhGSLffZd0E&t=561s)** — tolerance to stress. So the more you do this, the more tolerance to stress you'll have,
- **[09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GhGSLffZd0E&t=566s)** — the more resistance to stress you'll have, the more mentally resilient you're going to be.
- **[09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GhGSLffZd0E&t=570s)** — And the last two genes, RBM3 and CIRP, you'll get more survival of your cells, improved DNA,
- **[09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GhGSLffZd0E&t=580s)** — stabilized RNA, which is the copy of the DNA, which will give you enhanced protein synthesis
- **[09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GhGSLffZd0E&t=586s)** — or shall I say building of proteins, as well as an anti-inflammatory effect and an antioxidant
- **[09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GhGSLffZd0E&t=592s)** — effect. So as you can see, the benefits of cold water immersion are huge. And I think it's
- **[09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GhGSLffZd0E&t=599s)** — beneficial to alternate this with heat therapy. And if you haven't seen my video on that topic,
- **[10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GhGSLffZd0E&t=605s)** — I put it up right here. Check it out.

- **[00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XEcssz8NOhg&t=0s)** — The benefits of drinking clove water at night. Let's talk about this.
- **[00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XEcssz8NOhg&t=3s)** — Cloves at one time were worth more than gold. This is what they look like. You could see it in this
- **[00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XEcssz8NOhg&t=9s)** — little jar right here. They're these little tiny structures. A lot of people might have had these
- **[00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XEcssz8NOhg&t=14s)** — in like ham and they're sold as a spice. And you have them already. You just need to know how
- **[00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XEcssz8NOhg&t=20s)** — to use them and what they're good for. They were so valuable. They were exchanging them with
- **[00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XEcssz8NOhg&t=24s)** — gold. Amazing. They've been used in China for over 2,000 years for certain medicines. They
- **[00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XEcssz8NOhg&t=28s)** — were also used in the Black Plague. You might have seen pictures of those people with those long
- **[00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XEcssz8NOhg&t=33s)** — masks. They'd be basically burning certain herbs and they would breathe in the vapors. Well,
- **[00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XEcssz8NOhg&t=37s)** — one of the spices they used was clove because of its anti-viral and antibacterial properties.
- **[00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XEcssz8NOhg&t=42s)** — Also, in early dentistry, before they had certain medications that numbed the tooth
- **[00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XEcssz8NOhg&t=46s)** — problem, they used clove oil. I mean, in fact, even with minor surgeries, they used
- **[00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XEcssz8NOhg&t=51s)** — clove oil because of its analgesic effect. Very similar to the synthetic lidocaine that
- **[00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XEcssz8NOhg&t=56s)** — certain dentists use. So it's a topical and you can put it externally on your skin. You can also
- **[01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XEcssz8NOhg&t=61s)** — put it on your gums. You could put it directly on the tooth. If there's a cavity and the nerve
- **[01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XEcssz8NOhg&t=66s)** — is exposed, it will help numb that nerve. Now, the cool thing about this is there's virtually
- **[01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XEcssz8NOhg&t=70s)** — no side effects. It has antibacterial, anti-fungal, anti-candida, anti-viral properties.
- **[01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XEcssz8NOhg&t=80s)** — In addition to numbing the tooth or numbing pain, it can also go after the microbes that
- **[01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XEcssz8NOhg&t=86s)** — are growing there, whether it's a fungal, candida, bacteria, or even virus. And where I found this
- **[01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XEcssz8NOhg&t=91s)** — information was in certain patents on using the oil of clove for various things. Helping increase
- **[01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XEcssz8NOhg&t=99s)** — the bioflow as well as increasing digestive enzymes. They patent a mouthwash, toothpaste,
- **[01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XEcssz8NOhg&t=104s)** — as well as a gingivitis treatment. So it works on everything oral. And then I started
- **[01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XEcssz8NOhg&t=109s)** — looking at medications and what medications that they can compare to in a similar
- **[01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XEcssz8NOhg&t=115s)** — effectiveness or even work better. So in this first study, they compared clove oil to something
- **[02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XEcssz8NOhg&t=120s)** — called benzocaine, which is a pain reliever that dentists use to numb the teeth. And this was in
- **[02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XEcssz8NOhg&t=125s)** — the Journal of Dentistry. They found that this oil from clove worked faster, it was longer
- **[02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XEcssz8NOhg&t=131s)** — lasting, and more effective for toothaches as well as tooth infections because it also had this
- **[02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XEcssz8NOhg&t=137s)** — anti-microbial effect as well. In another study, they compared eugenol to hydrocortisone
- **[02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XEcssz8NOhg&t=143s)** — and they found the effectiveness was equal or greater in reducing swelling and redness of the
- **[02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XEcssz8NOhg&t=149s)** — skin. And this study was in one of the inflammatory research journals. The next study I
- **[02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XEcssz8NOhg&t=153s)** — looked at was on fungal infections like toenail fungus, athlete's foot, and they compared
- **[02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XEcssz8NOhg&t=159s)** — tea tree oil to clove oil. And clove oil killed candida and fungus faster. Then there was
- **[02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XEcssz8NOhg&t=165s)** — a comparison between clove oil and lidocaine. And in that study, clove oil had longer lasting
- **[02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XEcssz8NOhg&t=172s)** — effects for numbing. That was in the Journal of Pain Research. So now let's get into how you can
- **[02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XEcssz8NOhg&t=177s)** — use this because you already have this in your pantry. You just need to know how to use it
- **[03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XEcssz8NOhg&t=181s)** — and what conditions you can use this on. And I'm going to give you a couple different
- **[03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XEcssz8NOhg&t=185s)** — recipes that you can make this in a salve and liquid that you can drink before bed.
- **[03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XEcssz8NOhg&t=190s)** — But let's first talk about the conditions that it's good for. Now of course I already
- **[03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XEcssz8NOhg&t=194s)** — mentioned it's great for anything with teeth pain or biofilms like plucking, things like
- **[03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XEcssz8NOhg&t=199s)** — And of course you can even just take one of these cloves and then just suck on it. Or you can just
- **[03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XEcssz8NOhg&t=204s)** — take the oil from it and with a little cotton swab and dab it on the tooth and the gum around
- **[03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XEcssz8NOhg&t=209s)** — the tooth. But if you have a cavity you want to actually put it right into that cavity directly.
- **[03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XEcssz8NOhg&t=214s)** — Another application is for muscle pain, okay, as well as joint pain. You're going to basically
- **[03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XEcssz8NOhg&t=220s)** — just take a couple drops, put it in a little olive oil or coconut oil, and rub it into the
- **[03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XEcssz8NOhg&t=226s)** — You can also mix a couple drops in Epsom salts and water all dissolved nicely and rub that into
- **[03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XEcssz8NOhg&t=234s)** — the muscle as well. Because the Epsom salts is the magnesium that can also help the muscles.
- **[03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XEcssz8NOhg&t=239s)** — Some people use it as a lip balm and you can put this on like a colesor which is Herpes
- **[04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XEcssz8NOhg&t=244s)** — Simplex. You'd have to mix a couple drops with either beeswax or coconut oil and just
- **[04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XEcssz8NOhg&t=250s)** — rub it into the lip. Remember it's anti-viral as well and Herpes Simplex is a virus. With
- **[04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XEcssz8NOhg&t=255s)** — mosquito repellent you would put a couple drops in a little spray bottle and you would spray that
- **[04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XEcssz8NOhg&t=260s)** — on your body. I actually use this on my cattle in the summer with all of these flies, not
- **[04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XEcssz8NOhg&t=267s)** — mosquitoes, and it works like a charm. But it's non-toxic. All right now the following things
- **[04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XEcssz8NOhg&t=271s)** — I'm going to talk about are using clove water which I'll explain how to prepare that. And I
- **[04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XEcssz8NOhg&t=276s)** — would drink this before bed. It seems to work really good because they help relax you and
- **[04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XEcssz8NOhg&t=281s)** — they can help you drift off into a wonderful sleep as well. So might as well take it before
- **[04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XEcssz8NOhg&t=285s)** — you go to bed. It's not a necessity but it can definitely help. So the first thing it does is
- **[04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XEcssz8NOhg&t=289s)** — it helps to detoxify the liver. So it's going to stimulate some of the enzymes to help break
- **[04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XEcssz8NOhg&t=294s)** — things down in the liver. It's going to help you with digestion. So if you have bloating,
- **[04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XEcssz8NOhg&t=299s)** — indigestion, gas, consume some of this clove water. Maybe you do this after a meal when you're
- **[05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XEcssz8NOhg&t=303s)** — bloating and it can help reduce the bloating. Another very potent effect of this clove water
- **[05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XEcssz8NOhg&t=307s)** — is to use it for respiratory problems like bronchitis, mucus in the lungs, a cold, a cough,
- **[05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XEcssz8NOhg&t=315s)** — asthma. You can consider it as like a natural antibiotic but without the side effects. Some
- **[05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XEcssz8NOhg&t=320s)** — people also use it for cognitive improvements to improve the memory, concentration, the focus.
- **[05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XEcssz8NOhg&t=326s)** — But this clove water also works with heart stuff so it can actually support a healthy heart
- **[05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XEcssz8NOhg&t=331s)** — as well. Especially when you get into blood circulation. Anything related to circulation,
- **[05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XEcssz8NOhg&t=336s)** — clove water is awesome. It also has immune properties so it can help support a healthy
- **[05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XEcssz8NOhg&t=341s)** — immune system because it's antimicrobial. Some people even use it as a mouthwash to help
- **[05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XEcssz8NOhg&t=346s)** — freshen their breath and I've already talked about the great benefits for biofilms and
- **[05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XEcssz8NOhg&t=349s)** — breaking down plaque. And then of course the last one which I kind of already mentioned was
- **[05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XEcssz8NOhg&t=354s)** — using this as a sleep aid because it's a natural sedative without the negative effects.
- **[05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XEcssz8NOhg&t=359s)** — It does not have side effects like sleeping medication does. And there's also some tryptophan
- **[06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XEcssz8NOhg&t=364s)** — there that will actually increase serotonin and help you increase melatonin. So how do you
- **[06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XEcssz8NOhg&t=369s)** — make clove water? What you do is you take about four or five of these little cloves.
- **[06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XEcssz8NOhg&t=373s)** — Okay, put them in a cup of water and bring it to a boil and then take it off boiling
- **[06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XEcssz8NOhg&t=378s)** — so it's simmering for five minutes. Now make sure that you cover it while it's simmering
- **[06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XEcssz8NOhg&t=383s)** — because you don't want to have all these vapors escape. A lot of the remedy is in the
- **[06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XEcssz8NOhg&t=389s)** — vapors that are coming off this thing that are supposed to go back into the water. After five
- **[06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XEcssz8NOhg&t=393s)** — minutes let it cool for one hour. What I like to do is put it back in the fridge and then what
- **[06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XEcssz8NOhg&t=397s)** — you want to do is consume it 30 minutes before you go to bed. Now if you're using for
- **[06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XEcssz8NOhg&t=401s)** — children it might be a little bitter so you might want to add a little bit of honey to it.
- **[06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XEcssz8NOhg&t=405s)** — Maybe a half a teaspoon. Dissolve raw honey into it and then have them drink it. It's
- **[06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XEcssz8NOhg&t=410s)** — actually pretty delicious with honey or I think it's good without it. If you want to make
- **[06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XEcssz8NOhg&t=414s)** — this into a cream just put a couple drops into some coconut oil or olive oil and use that.
- **[07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XEcssz8NOhg&t=420s)** — Also if you have like some type of wound that you want to increase the healing I would use aloe.
- **[07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XEcssz8NOhg&t=426s)** — Put a couple drops of aloe and put that over the wound so you can speed up healing and it
- **[07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XEcssz8NOhg&t=430s)** — can also act as an antiseptic. Now if you haven't seen my other video on clove I think
- **[07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XEcssz8NOhg&t=434s)** — you'll really enjoy it. I put it up right here. Check it out.

- **[00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkhWpH0SNfM&t=0s)** — When you have blackheads, whiteheads, acne, pulling them out with an instrument or tweezers
- **[00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkhWpH0SNfM&t=4s)** — or using manual pressure to pinch your skin comes with a package.
- **[00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkhWpH0SNfM&t=7s)** — I don't recommend you doing this. This could actually be dangerous to your skin.
- **[00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkhWpH0SNfM&t=11s)** — I did this the wrong way. I put a lot of scarring on my face.
- **[00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkhWpH0SNfM&t=14s)** — What are those little structures that bring the oil to the surface of your skin?
- **[00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkhWpH0SNfM&t=18s)** — The root cause of a blackhead, a whitehead, acne are all coming from the same thing.
- **[00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkhWpH0SNfM&t=23s)** — The solution I'm going to talk about is way better than the topical creams that people are using for these issues.
- **[00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkhWpH0SNfM&t=28s)** — It's just treating the symptom. We're not fixing the cause.
- **[00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkhWpH0SNfM&t=31s)** — When we're dealing with any skin problems, it's so important to identify the real problem before we even get to a solution.
- **[00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkhWpH0SNfM&t=38s)** — If you look up blackheads, whiteheads, it'll list things like bacterial infection.
- **[00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkhWpH0SNfM&t=42s)** — You have too many dead skin cells. The difference between a whitehead and a blackhead,
- **[00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkhWpH0SNfM&t=46s)** — when you have a blackhead, the oil inside the pore is more exposed to oxygen and it's oxidizing like an apple would turn brown
- **[00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkhWpH0SNfM&t=53s)** — versus a whitehead, which is something that's not exposed to oxygen.
- **[00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkhWpH0SNfM&t=56s)** — When we're talking about pus, we're mainly talking about oil.
- **[01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkhWpH0SNfM&t=60s)** — One big confusion of the actual problem is thinking that the person is just producing too much oil.
- **[01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkhWpH0SNfM&t=67s)** — And that's what's causing this whole problem.
- **[01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkhWpH0SNfM&t=69s)** — Some of these topical creams do work, at least temporarily.
- **[01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkhWpH0SNfM&t=72s)** — I'm also talking about another cream called Enado Extract, which is loaded with a very special type of vitamin E,
- **[01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkhWpH0SNfM&t=79s)** — which does help control the oil to some degree.
- **[01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkhWpH0SNfM&t=81s)** — One of the big things that I'm going to share with you is that a lot of people actually are solving the wrong problem.
- **[01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkhWpH0SNfM&t=87s)** — That is actually not true. It's not the excess oil production.
- **[01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkhWpH0SNfM&t=91s)** — The real problem is this. That little gland is producing thicker, stickier oil that doesn't flow like normal oil.
- **[01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkhWpH0SNfM&t=100s)** — What's behind that? What causes this sticky oil?
- **[01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkhWpH0SNfM&t=105s)** — There are five causes. The fifth cause is the most common.
- **[01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkhWpH0SNfM&t=107s)** — I just want to run through all of them so you know what they all are, because they all relate to what we're going to do about it.
- **[01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkhWpH0SNfM&t=113s)** — The first thing is hormones. We know in puberty, your androgens, including testosterone, are going to be a little bit too high.
- **[02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkhWpH0SNfM&t=120s)** — That produces a high level of a certain type of testosterone called DHT.
- **[02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkhWpH0SNfM&t=126s)** — DHT makes your oil into like a glue, sticky, thick substance.
- **[02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkhWpH0SNfM&t=132s)** — Number two, the other hormone involved in this is insulin.
- **[02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkhWpH0SNfM&t=135s)** — Having too much insulin will then raise your androgen levels.
- **[02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkhWpH0SNfM&t=139s)** — You know that insulin that's triggered by carbohydrates, sugars, starches.
- **[02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkhWpH0SNfM&t=143s)** — Too much insulin will also block number three, which is a zinc deficiency.
- **[02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkhWpH0SNfM&t=149s)** — When you're eating a lot of refined carbs and sugar, you're depleting your zinc.
- **[02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkhWpH0SNfM&t=153s)** — Zinc is crucial in regulating the amount of oil that that gland produces.
- **[02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkhWpH0SNfM&t=158s)** — And if you're deficient in zinc, not only will you produce too much oil, that oil will be thicker.
- **[02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkhWpH0SNfM&t=164s)** — It'll be stickier. Zinc is also needed to prevent the excess amount of that powerful testosterone called DHT.
- **[02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkhWpH0SNfM&t=172s)** — Can you see how this relates? It's important to know all these pieces to this puzzle.
- **[02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkhWpH0SNfM&t=177s)** — Because let's go to number four. And this is in vitamin A deficiency.
- **[03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkhWpH0SNfM&t=181s)** — When you're deficient in vitamin A, you get very sticky, thick oil.
- **[03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkhWpH0SNfM&t=186s)** — And it plugs everything up. And by the way, you need zinc to allow vitamin A to work.
- **[03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkhWpH0SNfM&t=191s)** — They both work together.
- **[03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkhWpH0SNfM&t=192s)** — This last thing, number five, is the most important thing you need to know.
- **[03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkhWpH0SNfM&t=197s)** — And this is based on the fact that the oil in your skin is mostly an unsaturated fat.
- **[03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkhWpH0SNfM&t=203s)** — Hmm, why is that so significant? Because other unsaturated fats that you consume make up that oil.
- **[03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkhWpH0SNfM&t=210s)** — Seed oils are highly processed. When you consume them, they start making up the oil in your skin.
- **[03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkhWpH0SNfM&t=217s)** — Now we don't have something natural. We have something very highly pro-inflammatory.
- **[03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkhWpH0SNfM&t=222s)** — All that seed oil will build up in your liver and prevent you from making enough bile
- **[03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkhWpH0SNfM&t=227s)** — to be able to even absorb fat soluble vitamins like vitamin A, vitamin D, vitamin E, vitamin K.
- **[03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkhWpH0SNfM&t=234s)** — You need a healthy liver to get enough vitamin A for your body to actually have good skin.
- **[03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkhWpH0SNfM&t=239s)** — We're dealing with an industrial oil that should never be in our diet.
- **[04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkhWpH0SNfM&t=244s)** — Unfortunately, these seed oils will stay in your body for literally a year and a half to up to two years.
- **[04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkhWpH0SNfM&t=251s)** — So you're going to have to avoid seed oils for a good amount of time.
- **[04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkhWpH0SNfM&t=255s)** — What type of foods are creating this problem? Well, ultra-processed foods are creating this problem.
- **[04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkhWpH0SNfM&t=261s)** — Because what's in an ultra-processed food? Refined sugars and we have refined starches.
- **[04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkhWpH0SNfM&t=265s)** — And I don't know if you know this, but the more refined sugar you eat, the more refined starch you eat,
- **[04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkhWpH0SNfM&t=270s)** — the more you deplete yourself of zinc. And all these processed ingredients destroy the liver,
- **[04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkhWpH0SNfM&t=275s)** — which actually prevents you from even using vitamin A in the first place.
- **[04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkhWpH0SNfM&t=279s)** — And on top of all that, the sugar, the starch will really jack up.
- **[04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkhWpH0SNfM&t=283s)** — Your insulin levels as well as the seed oils will also create insulin resistance,
- **[04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkhWpH0SNfM&t=289s)** — which will then cause your body to make more insulin. Your skin is getting hit from every angle.
- **[04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkhWpH0SNfM&t=295s)** — Let's look at the opposite of that. What should we be eating to keep our antigens low,
- **[04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkhWpH0SNfM&t=299s)** — our insulin low, to have enough zinc, to have enough vitamin A, low carbohydrate?
- **[05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkhWpH0SNfM&t=304s)** — Okay, we don't want any sugar or starch. Your skin is going to start to heal.
- **[05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkhWpH0SNfM&t=306s)** — In addition to reducing the seed oils, there's other foods that are high in omega-6 fatty acids as well.
- **[05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkhWpH0SNfM&t=312s)** — And that would also be animals that are fed grains, like chicken.
- **[05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkhWpH0SNfM&t=316s)** — The eggs from chicken could potentially make things worse, and even pigs that are fed grain.
- **[05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkhWpH0SNfM&t=320s)** — And this is why I'm going to recommend consuming grass-fed beef, lamb, wild-caught fish, sardines, shellfish,
- **[05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkhWpH0SNfM&t=329s)** — which is high in zinc. And by the way, red meat is loaded with zinc.
- **[05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkhWpH0SNfM&t=333s)** — But you can get your vitamin A from grass-fed butter, as well as from grass-fed beef liver.
- **[05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkhWpH0SNfM&t=338s)** — And cod liver oil is loaded with vitamin A.
- **[05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkhWpH0SNfM&t=340s)** — This simple switch from avoiding these junk foods and eating these healthy foods
- **[05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkhWpH0SNfM&t=345s)** — will get at the root of your skin problems in the fastest way possible
- **[05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkhWpH0SNfM&t=350s)** — without having to cope and treat the symptom anymore.
- **[05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkhWpH0SNfM&t=354s)** — Thanks for watching, and I will see you in the next video.

- **[00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8L7F5ffv6bs&t=0s)** — You know, I've done a lot of videos on the immune system.
- **[00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8L7F5ffv6bs&t=2s)** — Today we're going to talk about what to do once you get an infection
- **[00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8L7F5ffv6bs&t=6s)** — and what is the fastest way to overcome this infection.
- **[00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8L7F5ffv6bs&t=9s)** — Well, the first thing to do is to kind of figure out or guess
- **[00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8L7F5ffv6bs&t=13s)** — if it's more a viral infection or a bacterial infection.
- **[00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8L7F5ffv6bs&t=18s)** — So with a viral infection, it's going to be more systemic.
- **[00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8L7F5ffv6bs&t=20s)** — So you're going to probably feel more body aches,
- **[00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8L7F5ffv6bs&t=23s)** — chills with bacterial.
- **[00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8L7F5ffv6bs&t=25s)** — It could be more localized to like lymph nodes
- **[00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8L7F5ffv6bs&t=29s)** — or maybe urinary tract infection or food poisoning.
- **[00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8L7F5ffv6bs&t=33s)** — A fever in a bacterial infection goes a little bit higher than a viral.
- **[00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8L7F5ffv6bs&t=38s)** — So if your fever is really super high, potentially it could be more bacterial.
- **[00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8L7F5ffv6bs&t=42s)** — If you get a sore throat with a viral infection,
- **[00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8L7F5ffv6bs&t=45s)** — a lot of times you'll have a runny nose and a cough.
- **[00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8L7F5ffv6bs&t=48s)** — But with a bacterial sore throat, you're going to feel just like more pain
- **[00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8L7F5ffv6bs&t=52s)** — and localized without the runny nose.
- **[00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8L7F5ffv6bs&t=55s)** — That's a type I used to have every single year growing up.
- **[00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8L7F5ffv6bs&t=59s)** — It was terrible.
- **[01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8L7F5ffv6bs&t=60s)** — With a virus, you'll have more of a dry cough, bacterial, productive cough,
- **[01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8L7F5ffv6bs&t=66s)** — which means there'll be mucus involved.
- **[01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8L7F5ffv6bs&t=68s)** — Typically when you have a respiratory infection,
- **[01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8L7F5ffv6bs&t=71s)** — sinus or lung or bronchitis, think viral.
- **[01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8L7F5ffv6bs&t=76s)** — But if you have pneumonia, you can have both bacterial and virus,
- **[01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8L7F5ffv6bs&t=81s)** — except sometimes in a childhood illness you'll get pneumonia, viral pneumonia.
- **[01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8L7F5ffv6bs&t=85s)** — But if you have like the common cold or a flu,
- **[01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8L7F5ffv6bs&t=88s)** — that's typically going to be viral.
- **[01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8L7F5ffv6bs&t=90s)** — Now as far as how long these infections can go,
- **[01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8L7F5ffv6bs&t=93s)** — with a viral it could be one to two weeks.
- **[01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8L7F5ffv6bs&t=96s)** — With the bacterial it could be a little bit longer.
- **[01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8L7F5ffv6bs&t=99s)** — And this all depends on your immune system.
- **[01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8L7F5ffv6bs&t=102s)** — The mucus with a viral infection usually is clear or white.
- **[01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8L7F5ffv6bs&t=106s)** — But with a bacterial infection it's more green or yellow.
- **[01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8L7F5ffv6bs&t=111s)** — There's a couple remedies that I recommend for viral.
- **[01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8L7F5ffv6bs&t=114s)** — Elderberry or olive leaf extract.
- **[01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8L7F5ffv6bs&t=118s)** — For bacterial I would recommend garlic,
- **[02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8L7F5ffv6bs&t=123s)** — oregano oil and echinacea.
- **[02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8L7F5ffv6bs&t=126s)** — Think about echinacea.
- **[02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8L7F5ffv6bs&t=127s)** — If you can catch this infection in time and you take echinacea,
- **[02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8L7F5ffv6bs&t=133s)** — you can sometimes stop it from going into a full-blown infection.
- **[02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8L7F5ffv6bs&t=137s)** — Now at the very end of this video,
- **[02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8L7F5ffv6bs&t=139s)** — I want to reveal something very important about a sore throat.
- **[02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8L7F5ffv6bs&t=142s)** — It's a technique.
- **[02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8L7F5ffv6bs&t=144s)** — You want to take a hot bath or hot shower
- **[02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8L7F5ffv6bs&t=146s)** — and dress very very warm to the point where you're even sweating.
- **[02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8L7F5ffv6bs&t=151s)** — Why? Because we want to cook the virus or bacteria.
- **[02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8L7F5ffv6bs&t=155s)** — We want to heat you up to the point where we can kill off this infection.
- **[02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8L7F5ffv6bs&t=161s)** — The side effects from this infection really are your immune system
- **[02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8L7F5ffv6bs&t=165s)** — killing off the microbes and your normal cells are also being affected.
- **[02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8L7F5ffv6bs&t=170s)** — So really think about this is not a bad thing.
- **[02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8L7F5ffv6bs&t=172s)** — It's just your immune system is working.
- **[02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8L7F5ffv6bs&t=174s)** — Go to bed early. The more sleep you can get, the better.
- **[02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8L7F5ffv6bs&t=178s)** — A lack of sleep will really weaken your immune system.
- **[03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8L7F5ffv6bs&t=181s)** — I think it's really important to take zinc, vitamin D and vitamin C.
- **[03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8L7F5ffv6bs&t=186s)** — Fasting, I think is a very very good thing.
- **[03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8L7F5ffv6bs&t=188s)** — That way you're stimulating your immune system
- **[03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8L7F5ffv6bs&t=190s)** — and allowing your immune system to work.
- **[03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8L7F5ffv6bs&t=192s)** — And when you fast, you actually increase your survival genes.
- **[03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8L7F5ffv6bs&t=196s)** — They start to kick in and there's a lot of benefits from fasting
- **[03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8L7F5ffv6bs&t=200s)** — that go way beyond just your immune system.
- **[03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8L7F5ffv6bs&t=201s)** — But fasting will help your immune system.
- **[03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8L7F5ffv6bs&t=204s)** — Sea salt is a very important thing.
- **[03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8L7F5ffv6bs&t=207s)** — Sea salt also helps increase the parasympathetic nervous system
- **[03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8L7F5ffv6bs&t=210s)** — and decreases the sympathetic nervous system.
- **[03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8L7F5ffv6bs&t=213s)** — Sea salt can help you sleep at night.
- **[03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8L7F5ffv6bs&t=215s)** — The other thing that's really important is to do whatever you can
- **[03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8L7F5ffv6bs&t=218s)** — to improve your emotional state.
- **[03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8L7F5ffv6bs&t=221s)** — Whether you have anxiety or depression,
- **[03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8L7F5ffv6bs&t=223s)** — you know, go for a walk, listen to music,
- **[03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8L7F5ffv6bs&t=225s)** — do something to pull yourself up.
- **[03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8L7F5ffv6bs&t=227s)** — Because infections last longer in lower emotional states.
- **[03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8L7F5ffv6bs&t=234s)** — The sun gives us many cool things
- **[03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8L7F5ffv6bs&t=236s)** — that go beyond just making vitamin D.
- **[03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8L7F5ffv6bs&t=239s)** — It also gives you UVB, which is anti-inflammatory.
- **[04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8L7F5ffv6bs&t=243s)** — Also, the sun gives you infrared.
- **[04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8L7F5ffv6bs&t=246s)** — And infrared can do a lot.
- **[04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8L7F5ffv6bs&t=248s)** — It's anti-inflammatory.
- **[04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8L7F5ffv6bs&t=249s)** — It can increase melatonin.
- **[04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8L7F5ffv6bs&t=252s)** — It's immunoregulatory.
- **[04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8L7F5ffv6bs&t=254s)** — It helps sleep, repair, enhance the mitochondria.
- **[04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8L7F5ffv6bs&t=258s)** — It can increase killer T cells.
- **[04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8L7F5ffv6bs&t=260s)** — And it can even dampen this cytokine storm.
- **[04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8L7F5ffv6bs&t=263s)** — Many, many, many times when people get sick,
- **[04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8L7F5ffv6bs&t=266s)** — there usually is always some type of predisposing factor,
- **[04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8L7F5ffv6bs&t=269s)** — like some type of stress that allows this infection to take over.
- **[04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8L7F5ffv6bs&t=276s)** — So anything you can do to reduce that would be very, very good.
- **[04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8L7F5ffv6bs&t=280s)** — This is why they give prednisone, which is a synthetic version of cortisol,
- **[04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8L7F5ffv6bs&t=283s)** — to any type of immune problem that someone has.
- **[04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8L7F5ffv6bs&t=287s)** — And it gets rid of it. It suppresses it.
- **[04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8L7F5ffv6bs&t=289s)** — If someone is low in vitamin D or zinc,
- **[04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8L7F5ffv6bs&t=294s)** — they can be more susceptible to having an infection too.
- **[04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8L7F5ffv6bs&t=298s)** — Also, you should make note that when you eat
- **[05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8L7F5ffv6bs&t=300s)** — refined sugar or refined food,
- **[05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8L7F5ffv6bs&t=304s)** — that can deplete zinc as well as vitamin C.
- **[05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8L7F5ffv6bs&t=307s)** — The chemistry of vitamin C is similar to glucose.
- **[05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8L7F5ffv6bs&t=311s)** — And so if you're consuming any type of sugar
- **[05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8L7F5ffv6bs&t=314s)** — while you're consuming vitamin C,
- **[05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8L7F5ffv6bs&t=317s)** — you're going to block the absorption of vitamin C
- **[05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8L7F5ffv6bs&t=320s)** — because the body is going to take in the sugar.
- **[05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8L7F5ffv6bs&t=321s)** — As we age, the thymus gland,
- **[05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8L7F5ffv6bs&t=324s)** — it's a little gland on top of the heart that really
- **[05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8L7F5ffv6bs&t=327s)** — is so important in training your T cells,
- **[05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8L7F5ffv6bs&t=330s)** — it starts to shrink as we age.
- **[05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8L7F5ffv6bs&t=332s)** — So when we get older, our immune system gets weaker, unfortunately.
- **[05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8L7F5ffv6bs&t=337s)** — If you have microbial imbalance in your gut flora
- **[05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8L7F5ffv6bs&t=340s)** — or you don't have enough microbiome diversity,
- **[05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8L7F5ffv6bs&t=344s)** — that can put you at risk for having a problem as well.
- **[05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8L7F5ffv6bs&t=347s)** — And of course, you know, sometimes people have this idea
- **[05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8L7F5ffv6bs&t=349s)** — that I'm going to try to kill off this infection by
- **[05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8L7F5ffv6bs&t=352s)** — doing a shot of whiskey.
- **[05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8L7F5ffv6bs&t=354s)** — No, I wouldn't do that. It's not going to help you.
- **[05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8L7F5ffv6bs&t=357s)** — And another good remedy is cod liver oil. Why?
- **[06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8L7F5ffv6bs&t=362s)** — Because not only does cod liver oil have the omega-3 fatty acids,
- **[06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8L7F5ffv6bs&t=365s)** — which are anti-inflammatory, but it has vitamin D
- **[06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8L7F5ffv6bs&t=369s)** — and vitamin A, which supports your sinuses, your throat, your GI tract.
- **[06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8L7F5ffv6bs&t=374s)** — I used to have a lot of sore throats.
- **[06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8L7F5ffv6bs&t=376s)** — And in practice, there was something that I came up with
- **[06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8L7F5ffv6bs&t=380s)** — that I think is mind-blowing.
- **[06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8L7F5ffv6bs&t=384s)** — And it's one of those things that you just have to try out to believe it.
- **[06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8L7F5ffv6bs&t=388s)** — And I have a video that I'm going to put up that you can watch.
- **[06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8L7F5ffv6bs&t=393s)** — It's a simple technique that someone can do on you
- **[06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8L7F5ffv6bs&t=396s)** — to help give you relief of the soreness of your throat infection.
- **[06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8L7F5ffv6bs&t=400s)** — Now, I'm not saying it does anything for the infection,
- **[06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8L7F5ffv6bs&t=403s)** — but it'll definitely reduce the pain and soreness that you have
- **[06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8L7F5ffv6bs&t=407s)** — if you have a sore throat.
- **[06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8L7F5ffv6bs&t=408s)** — So what you're going to be doing is you're going to have someone press
- **[06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8L7F5ffv6bs&t=412s)** — on the exact opposite part of where the sore throat is.
- **[06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8L7F5ffv6bs&t=416s)** — So if you have a sore throat, like right through here,
- **[06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8L7F5ffv6bs&t=419s)** — you're going to have someone pressing on the back part of your neck
- **[07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8L7F5ffv6bs&t=422s)** — To get a full detailed understanding of what it looks like and how to do it,
- **[07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8L7F5ffv6bs&t=427s)** — I put that video right here. Check it out.

- **[00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPcb9zNRC9I&t=0s)** — Let's talk about the dark side of the fast food industry. There are all sorts of dirty little secrets that you need to know about.
- **[00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPcb9zNRC9I&t=6s)** — An average American consumes between two and three of those fast food meals every single week, which comes out to like 150 to 200 meals per year, totaling between $1,500 to $2,000 a year.
- **[00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPcb9zNRC9I&t=18s)** — Now, if we compare that to other countries, especially France, we spend three times as much on fast food than they do.
- **[00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPcb9zNRC9I&t=25s)** — And you might have this idea that it's really cheap food, but you're not going to walk out of a fast food restaurant without at least paying $10 per person, which is pretty surprising when sometimes you go in there and you're choosing food from the dollar menu or the value meals.
- **[00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPcb9zNRC9I&t=40s)** — The perception is you save a lot, but actually you're going to pay a lot. A good portion of the ingredients in this food, which is subsidized by the government, aka your tax dollars, pay for a lot of these ingredients, especially all these grains that actually feed the animals and they actually are put into products which you end up buying at this fast food restaurant.
- **[01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPcb9zNRC9I&t=62s)** — And then you actually pay for your health problems that you're going to have to solve created by this type of food.
- **[01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPcb9zNRC9I&t=67s)** — They're so convenient. I mean, it's open 24 hours a day. In fact, when you drive up to one of these facilities, you don't even have to get out of the car. But not only that, you don't even have to drive to these places. You can order it from your home and have it delivered.
- **[01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPcb9zNRC9I&t=82s)** — The speed at which they make this food is mind blowing. And you can actually personalize the food. You can tell them how you want it cooked. You can take certain ingredients off of it. You can add certain things on there.
- **[01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPcb9zNRC9I&t=92s)** — However, there are so many tricks in things that they do to get you to eat more of this stuff. I mean, even the colors, yellow and red, aka McDonald's, the color yellow stimulates impulsivity.
- **[01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPcb9zNRC9I&t=107s)** — It also will increase serotonin and happiness because apparently it kind of gives you this perception of there's some really cool flavors involved. And then the color red stimulates the speed of eating. So you're going to actually want to eat faster.
- **[02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPcb9zNRC9I&t=123s)** — But the combination together will increase more appetite. A lot of this is designed for kids. Your kids have been advertised to so much. And if your child is demanding that you stop off at the fast food restaurant, chances are you might give in.
- **[02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPcb9zNRC9I&t=139s)** — And of course, when you go there, there's a playground. There are free toys. There's also a lot of tactics and tricks that they do to get more money from you.
- **[02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPcb9zNRC9I&t=148s)** — There's something called a loss leader, which basically they kind of might sell something at cost or even at a loss to then upsell you. A lot of times the loss leader is a small soda.
- **[02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPcb9zNRC9I&t=160s)** — And then if you supersize it, the profit goes way up by 80% because glucose syrup or high fructose corn syrup is so cheap. It's wild. The markup on these large sodas is 1150%. That's the profit margin.
- **[02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPcb9zNRC9I&t=176s)** — Then you have other techniques like upsell techniques by asking someone, would you like fries with that? They found that you can actually increase the profits by 22% just by asking.
- **[03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPcb9zNRC9I&t=186s)** — Even the mobile apps when people use them will increase profits by 20%. Having a combo meal, like a complete meal, can increase the profits by 30% versus buying them individually.
- **[03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPcb9zNRC9I&t=196s)** — And also if the cost of the meal involves the number 9, as in 199 or 299, they tested that as long as it has 9 in there, they can increase profits by 24%.
- **[03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPcb9zNRC9I&t=209s)** — Now there are certain products with very, very high margins, a lot of profitability. And of course the high margin products really are the soft drinks, which is about 90%.
- **[03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPcb9zNRC9I&t=218s)** — The French fries are about 80% margins, but the products with the lowest margin, which is the most overhead, is the beef, the animal meat.
- **[03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPcb9zNRC9I&t=226s)** — And so the margins on beef go down to 30%. With chicken it's a little bit less. And cheese is very, very high. In fact the cheese is like the biggest overhead, 40%.
- **[03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPcb9zNRC9I&t=235s)** — But not if they do cheese products, right? Or something that resembles cheese.
- **[03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPcb9zNRC9I&t=238s)** — You know McDonald's is one of the largest buyers of beef in the U.S. The big problem with this beef at McDonald's and other places is this beef comes from factory farms.
- **[04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPcb9zNRC9I&t=251s)** — 70% of all the U.S. cattle is this type of farming. 80% of all the antibiotics go towards animals, not humans.
- **[04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPcb9zNRC9I&t=261s)** — But McDonald's buys 1.7 billion pounds of beef every single year. Chick-fil-A processes their own chicken, like 4 million chickens per year.
- **[04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPcb9zNRC9I&t=273s)** — And the problem with the chickens is they don't have a lot of space to live. They literally have about 0.6 to 0.8 square feet of room to survive in.
- **[04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPcb9zNRC9I&t=284s)** — Putting them in a space of a half of a foot is literally insane and torture for these poor chickens.
- **[04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPcb9zNRC9I&t=291s)** — As far as the cattle goes, they are sometimes put in the feedlots, you know, 4 to 6 months before they're slaughtered.
- **[04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPcb9zNRC9I&t=298s)** — In the feedlots this is where they give them a lot of grains to fatten them up.
- **[05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPcb9zNRC9I&t=302s)** — There are basically 4 companies that own 80% of all the beef in the United States.
- **[05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPcb9zNRC9I&t=309s)** — And a few of these companies cross over.
- **[05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPcb9zNRC9I&t=314s)** — They're both involved in chicken and beef.
- **[05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPcb9zNRC9I&t=316s)** — Then we get to the quality of ingredients in fast food.
- **[05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPcb9zNRC9I&t=320s)** — Let's first talk about this thing called high fructose corn syrup.
- **[05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPcb9zNRC9I&t=323s)** — Corn syrup is very unique and it affects the body very differently than other types of sugar.
- **[05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPcb9zNRC9I&t=329s)** — In other words, it creates a lot of inflammation.
- **[05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPcb9zNRC9I&t=331s)** — Secondly, it doesn't have a satisfying effect.
- **[05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPcb9zNRC9I&t=333s)** — So you can drink a tremendous amount, like a super-sized container, and not really feel filled up.
- **[05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPcb9zNRC9I&t=339s)** — The effects in the liver are similar to drinking alcohol, as far as the toxicity levels go.
- **[05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPcb9zNRC9I&t=344s)** — And it's absorbed much quicker than other sugars as well.
- **[05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPcb9zNRC9I&t=347s)** — So you have high fructose corn syrup, there's a lot of corn oil, soy oil, seed oils involved in these foods.
- **[05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPcb9zNRC9I&t=353s)** — You have potatoes fried in the seed oil, which is very, very dangerous.
- **[05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPcb9zNRC9I&t=358s)** — And then you have the famous chicken nugget.
- **[06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPcb9zNRC9I&t=361s)** — Okay, what's in a chicken nugget? It's a mystery.
- **[06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPcb9zNRC9I&t=363s)** — Is there any chicken? Maybe.
- **[06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPcb9zNRC9I&t=365s)** — There's a lot of corn flour.
- **[06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPcb9zNRC9I&t=367s)** — There's corn starch.
- **[06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPcb9zNRC9I&t=368s)** — And then the chicken is fed corn.
- **[06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPcb9zNRC9I&t=370s)** — Basically, you're eating a lot of byproducts from corn when you go to a fast food restaurant.
- **[06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPcb9zNRC9I&t=377s)** — Then you have all different types of sugars that are corn-based.
- **[06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPcb9zNRC9I&t=380s)** — Something called dextrose, corn syrup.
- **[06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPcb9zNRC9I&t=383s)** — But I didn't mention in a 32 ounce, there are 74 grams of sugar.
- **[06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPcb9zNRC9I&t=388s)** — That's 18.5 teaspoons of sugar in that one soda.
- **[06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPcb9zNRC9I&t=393s)** — You know, it takes seven pounds of corn to make one pound of beef.
- **[06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPcb9zNRC9I&t=400s)** — Then you have a lot of the fillers and thickeners,
- **[06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPcb9zNRC9I&t=403s)** — as in maltodextrin, modified corn starch.
- **[06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPcb9zNRC9I&t=406s)** — You're basically eating something that is highly processed.
- **[06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPcb9zNRC9I&t=409s)** — It's highly inflammatory because it's a lot of omega-6 fatty acids.
- **[06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPcb9zNRC9I&t=414s)** — The deep frying involved, they don't just use that one time.
- **[06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPcb9zNRC9I&t=417s)** — Sometimes they use it for weeks, maybe a hundred different times.
- **[07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPcb9zNRC9I&t=420s)** — So you have the animals that are fed with corn.
- **[07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPcb9zNRC9I&t=422s)** — You have corn in the breading.
- **[07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPcb9zNRC9I&t=424s)** — You have corn in the condiments and sauces.
- **[07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPcb9zNRC9I&t=427s)** — You have corn in all the soft drinks because it's high-protein corn syrup.
- **[07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPcb9zNRC9I&t=432s)** — So I hope that you're shifting your viewpoint on a fast food restaurant.
- **[07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPcb9zNRC9I&t=435s)** — I used to go there all the time.
- **[07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPcb9zNRC9I&t=437s)** — I used to go there for the lost leaders when I was in college
- **[07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPcb9zNRC9I&t=440s)** — to save a little bit of money.
- **[07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPcb9zNRC9I&t=442s)** — I would get the two burgers for one dollar.
- **[07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPcb9zNRC9I&t=445s)** — And I did that for a long time.
- **[07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPcb9zNRC9I&t=447s)** — And no, I did not feel very good when I ate that food.
- **[07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPcb9zNRC9I&t=449s)** — And of course I justified. I said I'll eat healthy when I graduate.
- **[07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPcb9zNRC9I&t=453s)** — But that didn't happen.
- **[07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPcb9zNRC9I&t=455s)** — The truth is that you can find healthy foods at the grocery store
- **[07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPcb9zNRC9I&t=458s)** — and make them yourself.
- **[07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPcb9zNRC9I&t=460s)** — It might appear that you're saving a little bit of money
- **[07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPcb9zNRC9I&t=461s)** — and it's very convenient.
- **[07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPcb9zNRC9I&t=463s)** — And it might make you temporarily feel good
- **[07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPcb9zNRC9I&t=465s)** — because of all the chemicals and the MSG
- **[07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPcb9zNRC9I&t=468s)** — that gives it all this flavor.
- **[07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPcb9zNRC9I&t=470s)** — But in the long run, it comes with a price.
- **[07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPcb9zNRC9I&t=473s)** — I think the next step that you need to know
- **[07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPcb9zNRC9I&t=475s)** — is what to eat, okay?
- **[07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPcb9zNRC9I&t=478s)** — To turn things around.
- **[08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPcb9zNRC9I&t=480s)** — And for that, watch this video right here.

- **[00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nB-kTt0uNoY&t=0s)** — The fastest way to get rid of acne. I would consider myself an expert on acne simply because I had it really really bad for so many years. It may be very introverted. I was very shy. It actually is just devastating for a teenager to have that. I wish I knew what to do back then. But if you have acne, I'm going to tell you exactly what to do. Back then, I thought you just need to scrub your face and clean out those pores and maybe use different lotions. That just made it worse. People would tell you to avoid junk food and sugar and things like that. But there's something else that is very
- **[00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nB-kTt0uNoY&t=29s)** — essential to preventing acne and then if you have it, to get rid of it. I stumbled on this information when I was searching patents on acne. Patent certain natural remedies to get rid of acne. Blemishes and inflammation of the skin and even scarring from acne. What I found was very interesting. There was four patents I looked at and all four of them had a common denominator. They were using a sulfur compound. Then I looked on Amazon and I started looking at sulfur creams for
- **[00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nB-kTt0uNoY&t=59s)** — acne and there was like a whole bunch of different ones. I'm like, wait a second. What is the sulfur doing that's helping get rid of acne and are we deficient in sulfur? Are people that are more prone to acne have a sulfur deficiency? I found that a lot of them are. Then you might think, okay, so where can I get sulfur? Well, it's in onions, garlic, cruciferous vegetables. Would that be the best source of sulfur? Actually not. First, let me just tell you what sulfur does. Sulfur helps decrease inflammation. Also, increase hydration of the skin as well.
- **[01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nB-kTt0uNoY&t=89s)** — Sulfur also increases collagen, which is really interesting. So it can help with fine lines and even wrinkles. That's probably why they use sulfur in a lot of joint remedies to help hydration and lubrication of the joint. Sulfur is basically drying up this excess oil and the actual acne. And it also helps regulate the hormones that are behind the situation. I'm talking about androgens because androgens are very high when you're a teenager. You have this excess production of this, it's called sebaceous gland that
- **[01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nB-kTt0uNoY&t=119s)** — produces more oil and sulfur can help regulate that production. And on top of that, sulfur helps regulate insulin. And we all know when we eat too much sugar or carbs, insulin will increase and that can increase androgens. Here we have the sulfur that can help normalize insulin as well as the androgens that come right after that. And then I started to look at what would deplete sulfur. Grains, sugars, seed oils, the main three ingredients in most junk food, but also fructose. As in
- **[02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nB-kTt0uNoY&t=149s)** — high fructose corn syrup and of course alcohol will do it as well. Yes, junk food does cause acne. But one of the reasons why is it depletes sulfur. If there's some way we could still eat the level of junk food that we want, yet add a little sulfur, maybe we could prevent our acne. And I'm being very sarcastic. You don't want to do that. Now that you know what sulfur does, why might you be deficient in sulfur? You actually get sulfur from plants, okay, like garlic and onions and cruciferous and other foods. But that's only a tiny, tiny bit. The majority
- **[02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nB-kTt0uNoY&t=179s)** — of sulfur that you get from your diet actually comes from protein. There are many amino acids, but there are two and that's where you get most of your sulfur. And the two amino acids are methionine and cysteine. If we take away calcium and phosphorus, sulfur is the most abundant mineral in the body. So we need a lot of it. This leads me to the question, what foods are the highest in those two amino acids and what foods should we eat less of to get rid of our acne is fascinating.
- **[03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nB-kTt0uNoY&t=209s)** — Is it possible? And believe it or not the number one food is eggs. Number two is fish, then beef, then lamb, and then cheese and then organ meats. All of those are very high and those two amino acids high in sulfur. You have to realize that you also need to avoid the sugar, the starch, which basically blocks those amino acids from working that well.
- **[03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nB-kTt0uNoY&t=232s)** — And anything that increases insulin, which is sugar and starch, and when I say starch, I'm talking about the breads, the pasta, the cereal, crackers, biscuits, waffles, pancakes, muffins, things like that.
- **[04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nB-kTt0uNoY&t=242s)** — But if you just get rid of the sugar and the starch, and you don't increase the sulfur-based amino acids, you may not get rid of your acne.
- **[04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nB-kTt0uNoY&t=251s)** — Try this experiment. Start consuming more animal-based protein. Of course, make sure it's as quality as possible.
- **[04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nB-kTt0uNoY&t=257s)** — I'm talking about eggs, I'm talking about fish, I'm talking about meat. Instead of the carb breakfast, do protein.
- **[04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nB-kTt0uNoY&t=263s)** — Go ahead and try this, and then comment down below how fast your acne goes away.

- **[00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2MzNMBwzZv4&t=0s)** — Today we are going to talk about how to get rid of this toenail fungus. Toenail fungus is really not a problem of the toenail. It's a systemic problem.
- **[00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2MzNMBwzZv4&t=7s)** — And so if you just treat it right here in this location, you may or may not be successful long term.
- **[00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2MzNMBwzZv4&t=12s)** — And one of the big problems of treating the toenail fungus with medication is if you are going to be treating it for a period of time, which is usually about three months, there are side effects that come along with it, like liver damage.
- **[00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2MzNMBwzZv4&t=24s)** — Wouldn't it be nice to do something that didn't have any side effects?
- **[00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2MzNMBwzZv4&t=28s)** — Before we get to the solution, I want to quickly just go through a couple little facts that you need to know about toenail fungus.
- **[00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2MzNMBwzZv4&t=33s)** — If you look up the actual cause, it will say your feet are too sweaty and then you all of a sudden got this toenail fungus.
- **[00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2MzNMBwzZv4&t=39s)** — A lot of people have sweaty, wet feet and they don't get toenail fungus. This specific toenail fungus can invade the toenail, but it can also cause other skin infections.
- **[00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2MzNMBwzZv4&t=49s)** — Jock itch, athlete's foot, infections in your beard, infections in the skin on your legs, and even your scalp.
- **[00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2MzNMBwzZv4&t=56s)** — This specific microbe lives on protein and your nail just so happens to be pure protein.
- **[01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2MzNMBwzZv4&t=62s)** — One of the problems that people have treating this topically is that the cream does not penetrate deep enough in the nail to kill off the microbe.
- **[01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2MzNMBwzZv4&t=70s)** — This microbe is burying itself deep inside the protein part of the nail.
- **[01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2MzNMBwzZv4&t=76s)** — And there's something very unique about this microbe and how it survives. It has the ability to evade or escape your immune system defense.
- **[01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2MzNMBwzZv4&t=86s)** — And there's several mechanisms that it uses. One is it grows really slowly over time so your immune system doesn't necessarily see it.
- **[01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2MzNMBwzZv4&t=94s)** — Number two, it has the ability to suppress your T cells.
- **[01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2MzNMBwzZv4&t=98s)** — The other thing that it can do is it can go into a dormant state and then wait for the right moment to come out of remission.
- **[01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2MzNMBwzZv4&t=107s)** — And it can stay in this dormant state for years. This microbe is uniquely resistant to UV radiation.
- **[01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2MzNMBwzZv4&t=115s)** — Part of the sunlight spectrum is called ultraviolet and that does have the ability to kill certain microbes and fungus, but not this specific microbe called T. rubrum.
- **[02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2MzNMBwzZv4&t=124s)** — It can survive despite how much UV that you put on it. So you couldn't necessarily put a UV light directly on the toenail. It wouldn't work.
- **[02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2MzNMBwzZv4&t=131s)** — This next part is going to give you the secret of the treatment for getting rid of this toenail fungus.
- **[02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2MzNMBwzZv4&t=137s)** — Remember when I said that this microbe can go into a dormant state? That means it can be reawakened at certain times when the timing is just right.
- **[02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2MzNMBwzZv4&t=145s)** — So the first question is, what are the triggers to go into this dormant sleep state?
- **[02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2MzNMBwzZv4&t=151s)** — Well, the number one trigger to cause this microbe to go into this dormant state is when your immune system, especially these T cells, can finally work and attack it.
- **[02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2MzNMBwzZv4&t=161s)** — Your body's immune system is a very hostile environment for pathogens, including this fungus.
- **[02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2MzNMBwzZv4&t=167s)** — And it forces the microbe to go into this hibernation mode, this remission.
- **[02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2MzNMBwzZv4&t=171s)** — Recently there was a kind of a hurricane that came through. We lost power for a couple days.
- **[02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2MzNMBwzZv4&t=176s)** — And I have a garage with a freezer filled with meat. And each portion of meat is in this vacuum sealed plastic.
- **[03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2MzNMBwzZv4&t=183s)** — We have a backup generator. And so I assumed that all of our freezers were working.
- **[03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2MzNMBwzZv4&t=188s)** — Somehow it blew a fuse in the garage. And I did not know that until two weeks later.
- **[03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2MzNMBwzZv4&t=195s)** — Inside those plastic packages with the meat, see worms crawling around. I see microbes moving around.
- **[03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2MzNMBwzZv4&t=203s)** — And I'm like, what the heck? Where did that come from? They couldn't have actually invaded that plastic because I had them so protected.
- **[03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2MzNMBwzZv4&t=209s)** — Well, those microbes were already in there in a dormant state. And so much of the microbes that we have, even in our body, the good bacteria also can go in a dormant state.
- **[03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2MzNMBwzZv4&t=219s)** — Apparently some of the bacteria around that meat woke up with the trigger of having a certain warmer temperature.
- **[03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2MzNMBwzZv4&t=226s)** — And so one goal is to take this fungus and put it into a dormant state. If someone were to put some antifungal cream or take antifungal medication, that would also put it into a dormant state.
- **[03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2MzNMBwzZv4&t=239s)** — Not necessarily kill it. Then when you stop taking the medication, it doesn't stay in a dormant state. It comes out of remission.
- **[04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2MzNMBwzZv4&t=248s)** — Another thing that will cause it to go into a dormant state is having the environment being cooler and dry.
- **[04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2MzNMBwzZv4&t=253s)** — So then the next question is how do we wake up this microbe that's dormant on your toenail?
- **[04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2MzNMBwzZv4&t=258s)** — Well, we actually can change the environment. We warm up the environment. We make it moist. We add a little sweat in there and it can wake it up.
- **[04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2MzNMBwzZv4&t=265s)** — But having a warm, moist environment is not enough to actually cause a microbe just to appear there.
- **[04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2MzNMBwzZv4&t=272s)** — Another trigger to wake them up is to change a part of the environment that involves pH.
- **[04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2MzNMBwzZv4&t=279s)** — Because this microbe grows best in a pH of 8, which is pretty alkaline. So it doesn't like in an acid environment.
- **[04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2MzNMBwzZv4&t=287s)** — And normally your skin is acidic. This next thing is the most important thing.
- **[04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2MzNMBwzZv4&t=291s)** — The biggest activator of having this dormant microbe become alive is when your immune system gets suppressed.
- **[04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2MzNMBwzZv4&t=298s)** — How does your immune system get suppressed? Stress, being a diabetic, being overweight, taking in an antibiotic.
- **[05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2MzNMBwzZv4&t=306s)** — Because now we killed off all the bacteria and the bacteria are there to keep this fungus in check.
- **[05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2MzNMBwzZv4&t=310s)** — So if you have an imbalance there, this is when we get an overgrowth of certain fungus.
- **[05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2MzNMBwzZv4&t=314s)** — But the biggest thing that will reawaken dormant microbe, especially a fungus, is having a vitamin D deficiency.
- **[05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2MzNMBwzZv4&t=320s)** — Your immune system becomes suppressed. Vitamin D is the most important nutrient to support and allow the immune system to be alive.
- **[05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2MzNMBwzZv4&t=329s)** — In the toenail you have a lot of receptors for vitamin D.
- **[05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2MzNMBwzZv4&t=333s)** — And these fungus have a unique strategy of downgrading the vitamin D receptors.
- **[05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2MzNMBwzZv4&t=340s)** — Not only is this microbe shutting down your immune system, but it's shutting down the ability to use vitamin D.
- **[05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2MzNMBwzZv4&t=347s)** — The goal is just to be able to activate your immune system army against this darn pathogen. That's all we're trying to do.
- **[05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2MzNMBwzZv4&t=353s)** — And make the environment so hostile for this fungus that it just stays in a dormant state.
- **[05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2MzNMBwzZv4&t=358s)** — You don't want to just take a regular amount of vitamin D3. You need to take more vitamin D.
- **[06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2MzNMBwzZv4&t=364s)** — At least 25,000 international units every single day.
- **[06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2MzNMBwzZv4&t=369s)** — Some people need to take even a little bit more. But what this is going to do, it's going to build up your immune system to the point where this fungus has no choice but to go into a dormant state.
- **[06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2MzNMBwzZv4&t=380s)** — And we're doing this systemically all over because it's not really a local problem. It's a whole body problem.
- **[06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2MzNMBwzZv4&t=387s)** — And I don't know if this is true because I don't have a lot of information. But if you could find liquid vitamin D and put it on your toenail topically, I'm not 100% sure if it would speed things up.
- **[06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2MzNMBwzZv4&t=397s)** — But it's worth a try. Based on certain case studies and other reports of people using higher doses of vitamin D3, there's been a pretty good success at ridding this toenail fungus and doing it without side effects.
- **[06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2MzNMBwzZv4&t=409s)** — Because in the end, you have your immune system back. There's some other things that I'm going to recommend as well. Zinc. But not just any type of zinc. Zinc pyrethione.
- **[06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2MzNMBwzZv4&t=419s)** — This form of zinc is just not talked about very often. And sometimes they put it into a cream. Sometimes they will put it into a certain soap, which probably would be a good idea.
- **[07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2MzNMBwzZv4&t=427s)** — But it has very powerful antifungal properties. Here we have the vitamin D to help you from the inside out with the immune system. And then from the outside in, we use zinc topically.
- **[07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2MzNMBwzZv4&t=437s)** — The other thing I'm going to recommend is to get some shoes that are breathable. Because we want to change the temperature and we want to keep the feet as dry as possible.
- **[07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2MzNMBwzZv4&t=446s)** — Also, change your socks very frequently. Wash them. Wash the shoes so that this fungus can't stay and live in your shoes.
- **[07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2MzNMBwzZv4&t=452s)** — And when you use detergent, when you wash them, that detergent usually will kill off the fungus as well.
- **[07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2MzNMBwzZv4&t=457s)** — Now you have a plan and a solution that won't give you additional side effects. Thanks for watching and I will see you in the next video.

- **[00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AsBMXA3ynFU&t=0s)** — I'd like to share with you on how to pull yourself out of any stressful situation extremely quick.
- **[00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AsBMXA3ynFU&t=8s)** — You can also definitely use this if you're struggling to sleep at night or you're trying
- **[00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AsBMXA3ynFU&t=12s)** — to go to sleep but you have too much stress. But I'm going to show you a technique that's
- **[00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AsBMXA3ynFU&t=16s)** — completely free. It's very simple. It's very quick and it has many many benefits. It's the
- **[00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AsBMXA3ynFU&t=22s)** — fastest thing that I know of to put you in a calm state. It can actually even help increase
- **[00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AsBMXA3ynFU&t=26s)** — your DHEA which is kind of the precursor for all of your adrenal hormones. It has been shown to
- **[00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AsBMXA3ynFU&t=32s)** — improve immune defense and increase oxytocin which is kind of like the they call it the love
- **[00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AsBMXA3ynFU&t=37s)** — hormone or the hormone that helps you bond with another. And it's a major pleasure hormone too.
- **[00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AsBMXA3ynFU&t=43s)** — It can help lower your blood pressure, decrease your pulse rate and increase something
- **[00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AsBMXA3ynFU&t=47s)** — called alpha wave brain waves which will help you feel attentive, calm and totally relaxed.
- **[00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AsBMXA3ynFU&t=54s)** — It'll also support your neurotransmitters specifically dopamine and serotonin.
- **[00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AsBMXA3ynFU&t=58s)** — Basically it will put you in a state of parasympathetic balance. Okay. The parasympathetic
- **[01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AsBMXA3ynFU&t=65s)** — nervous system is part of the autonomic nervous system and it is the thing that is
- **[01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AsBMXA3ynFU&t=71s)** — called rest and digest. It is the mode where your body gets into that help calm down that
- **[01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AsBMXA3ynFU&t=77s)** — sympathetic nervous system. And this is based on a recent book that I'm reading called Heart
- **[01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AsBMXA3ynFU&t=83s)** — Coherence 365. And let me explain what that means that heart coherence. It's a fancy word for
- **[01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AsBMXA3ynFU&t=90s)** — synchronizing your heart to your emotions, your heart to your brain. And there's quite a bit of
- **[01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AsBMXA3ynFU&t=96s)** — science behind this but it's basically a simple breathing technique to put you in a state of
- **[01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AsBMXA3ynFU&t=102s)** — peace and calmness that will help you sleep and help you rest and do a lot of other cool
- **[01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AsBMXA3ynFU&t=108s)** — 365. Okay. Three means three times a day. Six means six breaths per minute. And so you're
- **[01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AsBMXA3ynFU&t=118s)** — going to slow down your breaths a little bit. And five indicates five minutes. So basically you
- **[02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AsBMXA3ynFU&t=124s)** — have this certain pattern of breathing which is six repetitions per minute. And you're going
- **[02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AsBMXA3ynFU&t=129s)** — to do that for five minutes three times a day. So that's the simplicity of it. Okay.
- **[02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AsBMXA3ynFU&t=133s)** — So apparently the research that's done on this wavelength that you're creating this
- **[02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AsBMXA3ynFU&t=138s)** — wave of breathing pattern creates some really amazing things to your nervous system. In fact,
- **[02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AsBMXA3ynFU&t=144s)** — you probably already have learned this from other videos that I've done but this makes it
- **[02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AsBMXA3ynFU&t=148s)** — really really simple. And I like the book because he gives the science behind it. And
- **[02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AsBMXA3ynFU&t=151s)** — of course I'm going to just add one little thing which will make sense. So you have to
- **[02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AsBMXA3ynFU&t=156s)** — make sure that it's controlled breathing. You have to make sure that it's deep and it's even.
- **[02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AsBMXA3ynFU&t=161s)** — And then you want to breathe through your stomach. So you just kind of stick it out and in so you
- **[02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AsBMXA3ynFU&t=166s)** — can have a nice deep breath using your diaphragm. But also I'm going to add my own
- **[02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AsBMXA3ynFU&t=170s)** — little two cents to this. I want you to breathe through your nose because that way you'll get
- **[02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AsBMXA3ynFU&t=174s)** — a little bit more CO2 to extract more oxygen. And what's interesting is you need CO2
- **[02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AsBMXA3ynFU&t=179s)** — to allow oxygen to penetrate deeper into the cells. So this really sounds just so simple and
- **[03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AsBMXA3ynFU&t=185s)** — it's like almost... can it really do that? But oh my goodness. I mean there's been many times
- **[03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AsBMXA3ynFU&t=191s)** — where in the middle of the night I'll wake up for some reason and start to think about something
- **[03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AsBMXA3ynFU&t=196s)** — or some stress. And then I will start breathing. Slowing it down, breathing in, breathing out. And
- **[03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AsBMXA3ynFU&t=202s)** — it pulls me right out of that stress. Allows me to go back to sleep. Also getting to sleep
- **[03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AsBMXA3ynFU&t=207s)** — at night. You can start doing this breathing. Keeping very even in and out six cycles per
- **[03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AsBMXA3ynFU&t=213s)** — minute. That can help you get to sleep. And there's a really cool device called HRV,
- **[03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AsBMXA3ynFU&t=219s)** — heart rate variability, that I hopefully at the time you're watching this have some more
- **[03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AsBMXA3ynFU&t=223s)** — information about. I'll put a link down below. To basically measure where you are on the heart
- **[03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AsBMXA3ynFU&t=227s)** — rate variability, which has a lot to do with these two systems. The sympathetic and the
- **[03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AsBMXA3ynFU&t=234s)** — parasympathetic. So you have a tool to measure where you're at and then you can
- **[03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AsBMXA3ynFU&t=239s)** — improve it over time. Because this breathing technique is one of the things that will
- **[04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AsBMXA3ynFU&t=245s)** — increase HRV, which is heart rate variability, which has a lot to do with your health reserve
- **[04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AsBMXA3ynFU&t=251s)** — and your fitness reserve. Now because of the censoring and the suppressing of the algorithms
- **[04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AsBMXA3ynFU&t=256s)** — on YouTube, it's becoming more difficult to find my content. And there's a lot of content that I
- **[04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AsBMXA3ynFU&t=261s)** — cannot put on YouTube, unfortunately. So to make sure you have full access of all my

- **[00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rHTsJmiIx9M&t=0s)** — Today we are going to discuss the first symptom that occurs with gallstones over 80% of the time.
- **[00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rHTsJmiIx9M&t=8s)** — And I am also going to talk about the fastest way to dissolve a gallstone if you have a gallstone.
- **[00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rHTsJmiIx9M&t=14s)** — And let's dive right into the first symptom that occurs over 80% of the time. And that would be
- **[00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rHTsJmiIx9M&t=20s)** — asymptomatic. That's right. There is no symptoms 80% of the time when a person has gallstones.
- **[00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rHTsJmiIx9M&t=27s)** — You don't even know you have them. Unless they get lodged into a duct where it creates
- **[00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rHTsJmiIx9M&t=32s)** — distension and pressure, you might even not know you have them until they get really bad.
- **[00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rHTsJmiIx9M&t=37s)** — Other than that, are there any other symptoms? And yes, there is. You are normally going to feel
- **[00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rHTsJmiIx9M&t=42s)** — a sensation underneath the right rib cage. Kind of like a fullness, a tightness, or a pain.
- **[00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rHTsJmiIx9M&t=49s)** — You may feel pain in your right rhomboid, that muscle between your scapula and the mid
- **[00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rHTsJmiIx9M&t=55s)** — part of your spine and the back part there. You may even have pain that runs up to this side
- **[00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rHTsJmiIx9M&t=59s)** — of your face right here. These are all indications that there is something going on with the gall
- **[01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rHTsJmiIx9M&t=64s)** — bladder. It doesn't necessarily have to be a stone. It could be very small micro stones
- **[01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rHTsJmiIx9M&t=70s)** — that are really hard to identify even on an MRI. You can also experience nausea, vomiting,
- **[01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rHTsJmiIx9M&t=79s)** — bloating, belching, jaundice. Now why would you have jaundice, like where your skin is
- **[01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rHTsJmiIx9M&t=83s)** — yellow? Well that's because the gallstone is blocking the bile duct and we are getting a
- **[01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rHTsJmiIx9M&t=88s)** — backup of bile into the liver and that is coming out through into the blood and into your skin.
- **[01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rHTsJmiIx9M&t=94s)** — And some of that is something called bilirubin, which is kind of a byproduct of your red
- **[01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rHTsJmiIx9M&t=98s)** — blood cells and that can create a yellowing effect of your skin. You may also notice that
- **[01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rHTsJmiIx9M&t=102s)** — your urine is darker than it should be, yet your stool is pale. It's no longer dark brown.
- **[01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rHTsJmiIx9M&t=110s)** — Now let's talk about how to get rid of a gallstone really quick. It really is important for you to
- **[01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rHTsJmiIx9M&t=116s)** — understand what causes a gallstone first and that will explain everything. Many people think
- **[02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rHTsJmiIx9M&t=123s)** — gallstones come from consuming too much fat, fatty foods, right? Or foods high in cholesterol
- **[02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rHTsJmiIx9M&t=129s)** — because a gallstone is made out of cholesterol. So just by knowing that if you eat more
- **[02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rHTsJmiIx9M&t=136s)** — you're at risk for getting a stone, right? Well actually no, you're not. The reason why stones
- **[02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rHTsJmiIx9M&t=143s)** — develop is for two reasons. One is you have this high amount of cholesterol coming through
- **[02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rHTsJmiIx9M&t=150s)** — the body and, and this is the most important thing, you have a lack of bile salts. And this
- **[02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rHTsJmiIx9M&t=156s)** — number two thing is usually ignored. They think it's just the cholesterol, but what keeps the
- **[02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rHTsJmiIx9M&t=161s)** — cholesterol thinned is the bile salts. Bile is the primary mode of elimination of cholesterol.
- **[02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rHTsJmiIx9M&t=169s)** — Okay, it goes to the bile ducts. The more bile you have, the more elimination of cholesterol
- **[02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rHTsJmiIx9M&t=174s)** — that you have. So in reality you develop gallstones because you don't have enough bile,
- **[02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rHTsJmiIx9M&t=179s)** — okay? And all of those symptoms that I mentioned are really symptoms of a bile deficiency.
- **[03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rHTsJmiIx9M&t=186s)** — You have this gallbladder, right? It's not an extra organ that you're developing. You really
- **[03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rHTsJmiIx9M&t=190s)** — need the gallbladder. The gallbladder has a very, very important purpose of storing and
- **[03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rHTsJmiIx9M&t=198s)** — concentrating the bile salts. Why do you need concentrated bile? Because that concentrated bile
- **[03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rHTsJmiIx9M&t=205s)** — is then released by the gallbladder into your small intestine to help you break down the fats.
- **[03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rHTsJmiIx9M&t=211s)** — If you just put bile into the small intestine without it being concentrated, you're not
- **[03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rHTsJmiIx9M&t=216s)** — nearly going to have the effect that you should to help extract the fat soluble nutrients
- **[03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rHTsJmiIx9M&t=220s)** — like vitamin A, D, E, K1, K2, omega-3 fatty acids, things like that. And so this bile helps break
- **[03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rHTsJmiIx9M&t=227s)** — down this fat to a certain degree, but then the pancreas releases its enzyme called lipase to help
- **[03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rHTsJmiIx9M&t=232s)** — break it down even smaller. And so when you don't have a gallbladder because they removed
- **[03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rHTsJmiIx9M&t=237s)** — it, now you just have a tube from your liver to the small intestine, okay? You don't get
- **[04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rHTsJmiIx9M&t=242s)** — any more concentration of the bile. And then you may have a hard time digesting fats and
- **[04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rHTsJmiIx9M&t=246s)** — absorbing these fat soluble nutrients. Now, on a rare occasion, when they do the surgery,
- **[04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rHTsJmiIx9M&t=252s)** — they might have made this duct maybe a little bit too big. And now we get too much bile coming
- **[04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rHTsJmiIx9M&t=259s)** — into the small intestine. And the biggest symptom for that would be diarrhea. And also not
- **[04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rHTsJmiIx9M&t=264s)** — enough bile is constipation. And there's another term I want to tell you about. It's
- **[04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rHTsJmiIx9M&t=269s)** — called choleostasis. And I think that's a really common problem where you don't have a
- **[04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rHTsJmiIx9M&t=274s)** — it's kind of like sludge. So you have bio sludge. It's a lot of cholesterol, but you don't have
- **[04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rHTsJmiIx9M&t=279s)** — enough bile. And it kind of just sits there and it causes a lot of pain. And you do the
- **[04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rHTsJmiIx9M&t=284s)** — ultrasound, you don't see any stone. There's also a syndrome that occurs after you have
- **[04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rHTsJmiIx9M&t=289s)** — your gallbladder removed, that you now have complications too. And I want to bring that up
- **[04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rHTsJmiIx9M&t=294s)** — because sometimes people will downplay that. But it can occur up to 40% of the time. And
- **[05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rHTsJmiIx9M&t=301s)** — you take a wild guess what the biggest symptom is after surgery. Choleostasis, this bile sludge.
- **[05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rHTsJmiIx9M&t=309s)** — And that can give you the same symptoms as you had before you had the surgery with a gallstone.
- **[05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rHTsJmiIx9M&t=314s)** — Because they removed the stone, but they didn't remove the cause of the stone,
- **[05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rHTsJmiIx9M&t=319s)** — which is the lack of bile problem. Other risk factors for getting gallstones would be
- **[05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rHTsJmiIx9M&t=325s)** — pregnancy, because you have this spike in estrogen. Too much estrogen can put you
- **[05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rHTsJmiIx9M&t=329s)** — at risk for a gallstone. Also taking birth control pills, which is more estrogen.
- **[05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rHTsJmiIx9M&t=335s)** — Obesity and type 2 diabetes simply because you're going to have higher levels of insulin,
- **[05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rHTsJmiIx9M&t=341s)** — which also can aggravate and increase the risk of gallstones. Liver disease can put you at
- **[05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rHTsJmiIx9M&t=347s)** — risk. Why? Because the liver actually makes bile salts. Okay. And the more problems you
- **[05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rHTsJmiIx9M&t=353s)** — have with the liver, whether it's fatty or liver disease, whatever, the less bile you're
- **[05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rHTsJmiIx9M&t=357s)** — making. Constipation, I already talked about that. That can put you at risk. Actually,
- **[06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rHTsJmiIx9M&t=362s)** — just the bile deficiency can cause the symptom of constipation. And also if you're low in
- **[06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rHTsJmiIx9M&t=367s)** — folate, okay, this can be more of a genetic problem or just you don't consume any vegetables,
- **[06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rHTsJmiIx9M&t=372s)** — so you don't get any folate. Folate helps the conversion of cholesterol to bile salts. So
- **[06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rHTsJmiIx9M&t=380s)** — people that are on a statin drug don't have the cholesterol to make bile. And a lot of
- **[06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rHTsJmiIx9M&t=387s)** — symptoms. Also, if you're on PPIs, these are in acids, that can create a big problem
- **[06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rHTsJmiIx9M&t=393s)** — or an increased risk of gallstones simply because you need that acid in your stomach
- **[06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rHTsJmiIx9M&t=399s)** — to trigger the liver to release bile salts. A high carb diet, which increases insulin,
- **[06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rHTsJmiIx9M&t=406s)** — can also put you at risk. And even a low fat diet can put you at risk. Why? Because one of
- **[06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rHTsJmiIx9M&t=411s)** — triggers for the release of bile is fat. And if you don't have enough, like let's say you're
- **[06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rHTsJmiIx9M&t=418s)** — a vegetarian or a vegan, that could put you at risk for getting gallstones. So what is the
- **[07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rHTsJmiIx9M&t=424s)** — solution? What do we do? The first solution is to take purified bile salts with some
- **[07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rHTsJmiIx9M&t=429s)** — probiotic. One with meals and you take one an empty stomach twice a day. Okay, sometimes
- **[07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rHTsJmiIx9M&t=434s)** — you need more, but you're going to take this over a period of time. What this is going to do,
- **[07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rHTsJmiIx9M&t=438s)** — to help dissolve the stone. Because we have a situation where we have a super concentrated
- **[07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rHTsJmiIx9M&t=443s)** — amount of cholesterol, but not enough bile salt. So we need more bile salt. Realize that your
- **[07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rHTsJmiIx9M&t=448s)** — gut makes bile too. So we really need to also support the microbiome with some probiotic.
- **[07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rHTsJmiIx9M&t=456s)** — And I think a really good way to do that would be to consume like sauerkraut or kimchi or even
- **[07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rHTsJmiIx9M&t=462s)** — kefir. Eating more salad would be beneficial. The fiber in the salad helps to bind with
- **[07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rHTsJmiIx9M&t=467s)** — the cholesterol. So that's one cool thing. Also, you're going to get folate, which will help you
- **[07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rHTsJmiIx9M&t=471s)** — make this conversion to make more bile. I would also manually massage underneath your right rib
- **[07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rHTsJmiIx9M&t=478s)** — cage and the left rib cage to help maybe push some of the sludge through. And many times
- **[08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rHTsJmiIx9M&t=484s)** — that will give you a tremendous amount of relief. And the last thing to do is to decrease
- **[08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rHTsJmiIx9M&t=488s)** — your insulin. Okay, because insulin can increase your risk. And you do that two ways.
- **[08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rHTsJmiIx9M&t=493s)** — Intermittent fasting and number two, going on a low carb diet. And if you're not familiar
- **[08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rHTsJmiIx9M&t=497s)** — with that, I put a link down below. But I think the most important thing for you to watch now,
- **[08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rHTsJmiIx9M&t=504s)** — because you're watching this video and you're concerned about gallstones,
- **[08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rHTsJmiIx9M&t=507s)** — is to learn how to do this manual flushing. Okay, this massage in your gallbladder. And I

- **[00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG63a8vDGXA&t=0s)** — Now, how do you get all your vitamins in one meal? Is it possible? I really want to show you what makes up these meals and why they're nutritionally dense before I show you the actual meal.
- **[00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG63a8vDGXA&t=10s)** — All these foods are animal based. All these are plant based for the most part. Okay? Let's start with protein. If we look at plant based proteins, they're low quality proteins.
- **[00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG63a8vDGXA&t=22s)** — It's very difficult to get a complete protein when you're just going with plants. It's very easy to get complete proteins if you go with animal products, especially animals that eat grass.
- **[00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG63a8vDGXA&t=34s)** — Those animals also can be fed grains, but the grain fed animals are not as healthy. And all I want to point out is there's a difference between grass fed and grain fed animal products. Okay?
- **[00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG63a8vDGXA&t=46s)** — So, for example, pork, poultry, and eggs are all grain based. You can't just raise a chicken just on grass. They don't survive, or even a pig. So if you were to ask me out of all the proteins, what would be the healthiest, the most nutritionally dense, I would say beef or lamb or even goat.
- **[01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG63a8vDGXA&t=64s)** — And it's fascinating to me how they classified red meat. They kind of threw it in the bucket of processed meat. And they said, oh, yeah, that's not healthy. That's junk food. It causes cancer when it doesn't at all.
- **[01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG63a8vDGXA&t=75s)** — In fact, it's just the opposite. It's the healthiest thing that you can consume. And personally, when I was very, very sick and I started to turn things around, it started with eating buffalo burger for breakfast.
- **[01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG63a8vDGXA&t=88s)** — That was the thing that just gave my body what it needed. And boy, did I feel better. This is why the carnivore diet is very, very successful for so many people with gut inflammation, autoimmune diseases, and other sensitivities to plants.
- **[01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG63a8vDGXA&t=101s)** — So some of these nutrients, you can get them from either side, plant or animal. OK, what about vitamin K1? Well, you can't really get it from animal products. OK, it is mainly from dark, leafy green vegetables.
- **[01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG63a8vDGXA&t=114s)** — And just by looking at this nutritional profile, it will kind of tell you what you should be eating more of. Vitamin K1 helps stop bleeding. It helps you clot.
- **[02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG63a8vDGXA&t=123s)** — And then we have vitamin A. Now, a lot of times you'll hear, oh yeah, carrots are really high in vitamin A, which by the way, is not the active form and the conversion is not very high.
- **[02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG63a8vDGXA&t=134s)** — So retinol, vitamin A, is difficult to get from plant source, but you can easily get it in a little liver, fish, cod liver oil, egg yolks.
- **[02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG63a8vDGXA&t=142s)** — Then we get iron. Well, there's two types of iron. There's one type that's not very absorbable and usable by the body. That's called non-heme.
- **[02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG63a8vDGXA&t=153s)** — And then you have the heme-based iron, which is in liver, red meat, other meats. So if someone is anemic, they should not be getting their iron from spinach, things like that.
- **[02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG63a8vDGXA&t=166s)** — They need to get it from like liver or red meat. All right, then we get the B vitamins. You can get a great source of all the B vitamins from red meat, fish, eggs, cheese, liver.
- **[02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG63a8vDGXA&t=178s)** — You can also get B vitamins from grains. The problem with grains is that when you're eating whole grains, whole grains have phytic acid, which actually block trace minerals.
- **[03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG63a8vDGXA&t=188s)** — Plus it has gluten, the only protein that our bodies can't digest, and that can really hurt our guts.
- **[03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG63a8vDGXA&t=193s)** — However, sunflower seeds have some B vitamins, and so does nutritional yeast. But nutritional yeast does not have B12 unless it's added.
- **[03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG63a8vDGXA&t=203s)** — Okay, what about collagen? Now collagen is a type of protein that makes up one third of all of our proteins.
- **[03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG63a8vDGXA&t=209s)** — And if you think you just can't eat a steak and get enough collagen, it has a small amount of collagen, believe it or not.
- **[03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG63a8vDGXA&t=216s)** — But if you have short ribs, where you have more collagen to that, or the skin on fish, or bone broth, or organ meats, then you can get collagen.
- **[03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG63a8vDGXA&t=226s)** — As someone gets older, it's very important to have enough collagen too, because as we age it kind of breaks down more.
- **[03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG63a8vDGXA&t=232s)** — And there is no collagen in plants.
- **[03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG63a8vDGXA&t=234s)** — Okay, what about D3? Well, some people will say, oh, you should get your vitamin D3 from mushrooms, right?
- **[04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG63a8vDGXA&t=240s)** — Okay, so you would have to consume 5.6 pounds of mushrooms every single day to just get 10,000 international units of vitamin D3.
- **[04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG63a8vDGXA&t=252s)** — And by the way, if you had any thought that 10,000 IUs of vitamin D3 is toxic, that's like basically getting 20 minutes of sun.
- **[04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG63a8vDGXA&t=261s)** — Okay, it's non-toxic. You can also do cod liver oil. You'll get some, but not close to what I recommend as a maintenance, which is 10,000 IUs.
- **[04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG63a8vDGXA&t=270s)** — Sardines have some vitamin D3. Okay, what about iodine? Well, shellfish.
- **[04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG63a8vDGXA&t=275s)** — Tons of iodine. Cod, dairy, eggs have some iodine. But also sea kelp, or even sea salt, also has iodine.
- **[04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG63a8vDGXA&t=283s)** — And then we get selenium, which is also important for the immune system. Shellfish, organ meats, red meat, or Brazil nuts.
- **[04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG63a8vDGXA&t=290s)** — So, you're starting to probably see a pattern. Okay, then we have zinc. So you can see iodine, selenium, and zinc are trace minerals, mainly from the sea.
- **[04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG63a8vDGXA&t=299s)** — Beef has a good amount of zinc. So do organ meats. But, guess what? You can go to pumpkin seeds and get your zinc from seed.
- **[05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG63a8vDGXA&t=307s)** — Alright, now what about the omega-3s? Well, fatty fish. But also you can get it from algae.
- **[05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG63a8vDGXA&t=312s)** — But actually, you're not getting this active form. You're getting the precursor, which is called ALA.
- **[05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG63a8vDGXA&t=319s)** — But there is a way to get it from algae. The other point I want to bring up about these omega fatty acids.
- **[05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG63a8vDGXA&t=324s)** — So many people are high in the omega-6. It competes with omega-3. We need a lot of omega-3.
- **[05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG63a8vDGXA&t=331s)** — Then we have magnesium, a very important... you can get it from fish, but dairy, but it's a little on the low side.
- **[05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG63a8vDGXA&t=336s)** — But pumpkin seeds are a really good source of magnesium and zinc, but also greens, because magnesium is at the heart of the chlorophyll.
- **[05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG63a8vDGXA&t=344s)** — So you can get it from any type of vegetable and even chocolate.
- **[05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG63a8vDGXA&t=348s)** — Then we get to potassium. We do get a little bit in fish and red meat, but you can get it avocados and greens.
- **[05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG63a8vDGXA&t=355s)** — And so these two minerals, magnesium and potassium, which are really important, are heavier over here than over here.
- **[06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG63a8vDGXA&t=363s)** — Then we have vitamin E. You do get some vitamin E from fish, dairy and eggs, but it's going to be higher in sunflower seeds and greens.
- **[06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG63a8vDGXA&t=370s)** — It's also in nuts as well. Most nuts are roasted, so you're just going to destroy it, because vitamin E is heat sensitive.
- **[06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG63a8vDGXA&t=378s)** — Phytonutrients are all the hundreds of thousands of chemicals in our food supply that help protect us and create all these therapeutic, amazing effects.
- **[06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG63a8vDGXA&t=388s)** — Onions, garlics, herbs, things like that. But it's also in grass-fed meat.
- **[06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG63a8vDGXA&t=394s)** — I had my cattle butchered and we tested, and it was loaded with phytonutrients.
- **[06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG63a8vDGXA&t=400s)** — Then we get vitamin C. You can get some vitamin C in organ meats, but the problem is when you cook it, it really goes way, way, way, way down.
- **[06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG63a8vDGXA&t=408s)** — So like in raw liver, you might get 100 milligrams, but when you cook it, it ends up with like two or three milligrams.
- **[06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG63a8vDGXA&t=414s)** — You'd be much better off if you had it from berries or especially sauerkraut.
- **[06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG63a8vDGXA&t=417s)** — Sauerkraut has the most vitamin C. It's like 700 milligrams per cup, but it has to be raw.
- **[07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG63a8vDGXA&t=422s)** — So get it in the refrigerated section or make it yourself.
- **[07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG63a8vDGXA&t=426s)** — Any green vegetable has some vitamin C in it, a good amount usually.
- **[07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG63a8vDGXA&t=430s)** — Now let's go to examples of meals that give you a nice combination of certain things to get a good amount of nutrition.
- **[07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG63a8vDGXA&t=439s)** — Okay, so we have some examples of meals.
- **[07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG63a8vDGXA&t=442s)** — I think it is impossible to get all of your nutrients from one meal.
- **[07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG63a8vDGXA&t=447s)** — Some days you can have more, some days you can have less. It doesn't have to be a certain amount every single day.
- **[07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG63a8vDGXA&t=452s)** — But I want you just to get the overall concept of what you should be eating or including in your meals.
- **[07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG63a8vDGXA&t=458s)** — Let's start with the steak and eggs and salad.
- **[07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG63a8vDGXA&t=460s)** — Okay, that would be one meal that you'd get a good supply of protein and also the minerals and phytonutrients right here.
- **[07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG63a8vDGXA&t=468s)** — Burger, cheese, sauerkraut, you get your vitamin C right here, you get fiber for the gut.
- **[07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG63a8vDGXA&t=474s)** — You also get vitamin K2, but you're getting vitamin K2 right here, high quality protein.
- **[07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG63a8vDGXA&t=479s)** — I do this a lot.
- **[08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG63a8vDGXA&t=481s)** — Then we got the liver and onions and cauliflower.
- **[08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG63a8vDGXA&t=484s)** — Okay, good combination. You get cruciferous right here.
- **[08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG63a8vDGXA&t=487s)** — You pretty much get almost every nutrient from liver and some great things from onions as well.
- **[08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG63a8vDGXA&t=493s)** — Eggs and avocado is a good combination.
- **[08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG63a8vDGXA&t=496s)** — Then we have sardines, tomato, tuna salad, so you have tuna on greens.
- **[08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG63a8vDGXA&t=501s)** — I like to throw nutritional yeast on there. It gives a nice little nutty flavor and there's a lot of B vitamins and trace minerals in nutritional yeast.
- **[08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG63a8vDGXA&t=510s)** — Salmon, carrots, brussel sprouts, it's a good one.
- **[08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG63a8vDGXA&t=513s)** — Shellfish, mashed cauliflower, short ribs can give you the collagen and then cheese and tomato, that's a good combination.
- **[08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG63a8vDGXA&t=520s)** — I'm doing a lot of pork rinds. There's different flavors and things like that.
- **[08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG63a8vDGXA&t=524s)** — I make sure I get the one without the MSG and all that.
- **[08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG63a8vDGXA&t=527s)** — Pork rinds give you collagen, of course, get your vitamin D from the sun if you can.
- **[08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG63a8vDGXA&t=532s)** — And then for a dessert, berries, Greek yogurt, you get your vitamin C.
- **[08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG63a8vDGXA&t=537s)** — Chocolate and kefir. If you do chocolate, try to add some dairy because chocolate does have some oxalates
- **[09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG63a8vDGXA&t=544s)** — and the calcium in the dairy can bind with the oxalates and actually kind of neutralize themself.
- **[09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG63a8vDGXA&t=549s)** — Chocolate and kefir, chocolate, sunflower, and pumpkin seeds, right?
- **[09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG63a8vDGXA&t=553s)** — With cheese, right? I'm not saying all mixed together, but you can do this as a little dessert.
- **[09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG63a8vDGXA&t=559s)** — But I already mentioned the benefits of sunflower seeds and pumpkin seeds, right?
- **[09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG63a8vDGXA&t=563s)** — Pumpkin seeds have a lot of magnesium and zinc.
- **[09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG63a8vDGXA&t=567s)** — So I hope this kind of gave you some idea on some nutrient dense foods.
- **[09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG63a8vDGXA&t=571s)** — But I'm really curious if you have even more ideas on this, please comment down below.
- **[09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG63a8vDGXA&t=576s)** — And I will see you in the next video.

- **[00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bskn2RrhPM&t=0s)** — You know, I have a video on inactivity and how that is an actual cause of all sorts of diseases.
- **[00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bskn2RrhPM&t=8s)** — But today we're going to talk about exercise in a very unique way. All it takes is just a little bit
- **[00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bskn2RrhPM&t=14s)** — of exercise to produce significant health benefits. And I'm talking about lowering your risk
- **[00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bskn2RrhPM&t=20s)** — for certain diseases and increasing your longevity, living longer. It doesn't take much exercise.
- **[00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bskn2RrhPM&t=25s)** — Hopefully this video will inspire you to start exercising, doing some type of physical activity
- **[00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bskn2RrhPM&t=32s)** — on a regular basis. Because exercise is the most potent natural medicine for living longer and
- **[00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bskn2RrhPM&t=42s)** — countering diseases. And I'm going to recommend over time that you really work on establishing
- **[00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bskn2RrhPM&t=48s)** — a fitness reserve which correlates to a health reserve. That extra bit of health buffer to
- **[00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bskn2RrhPM&t=56s)** — counter these stresses that come in on our body and affect us in a negative way. The more fitness
- **[01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bskn2RrhPM&t=62s)** — you have in your reserve, it's like an abundance of fitness, all sorts of great things can happen.
- **[01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bskn2RrhPM&t=68s)** — You become more flexible with your metabolism, your eating plan as well, and not have as much
- **[01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bskn2RrhPM&t=73s)** — damage. In other words, you raised up your level of health to a certain degree
- **[01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bskn2RrhPM&t=77s)** — where you can get away with more stuff versus other people don't have that luxury. Unfortunately,
- **[01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bskn2RrhPM&t=83s)** — those are the people that tend to go off the program more often. So if you think about it,
- **[01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bskn2RrhPM&t=87s)** — even if you're a smoker, even if you have chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or diabetes
- **[01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bskn2RrhPM&t=94s)** — or you're overweight or have high blood pressure, if you're exercising on a regular basis,
- **[01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bskn2RrhPM&t=100s)** — those things are not nearly going to have a negative effect on your body if you have this
- **[01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bskn2RrhPM&t=105s)** — So check this out. Walking only 2 to 2.5 hours per week, not per day, per week can give you a
- **[01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bskn2RrhPM&t=114s)** — 20% lower mortality rate. Another study talked about exercising 11 minutes a day, giving you
- **[02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bskn2RrhPM&t=120s)** — a 10% lower mortality rate. Here's another one called Vigorous Intermittent Lifestyle
- **[02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bskn2RrhPM&t=125s)** — Physical Exercise. Just by doing three to four short bouts of intense exercise, like roughly
- **[02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bskn2RrhPM&t=133s)** — a minute each, can give you a 40% lower mortality rate. Now if you were to beef it up to 11 bouts
- **[02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bskn2RrhPM&t=141s)** — of this short intense workouts, like a minute each spread out through the day,
- **[02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bskn2RrhPM&t=146s)** — it was calculated lowering your risk for cardiovascular disease by 65% and a decreased
- **[02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bskn2RrhPM&t=153s)** — risk in cancer by 49%. So this is pretty cool because it's just short little bursts
- **[02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bskn2RrhPM&t=159s)** — So let's say for example you're in the basement of your house and you just use the stairs to run
- **[02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bskn2RrhPM&t=166s)** — up and down the stairs a minute, right? And then you go to your office and do whatever you're
- **[02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bskn2RrhPM&t=171s)** — going to do and then you come back and do it again and do it again. It can be any type of
- **[02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bskn2RrhPM&t=176s)** — high intensity exercise. It could be just taking a break and doing some burpees or doing
- **[03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bskn2RrhPM&t=180s)** — some push-ups or sprinting up a hill. It's pretty easy. Anyone can do a minute workout and
- **[03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bskn2RrhPM&t=186s)** — just do it repetitively. Another study showed 10 to 59 minute workout every week,
- **[03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bskn2RrhPM&t=192s)** — okay, just once a week can decrease your mortality by 18%. So over and over and over
- **[03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bskn2RrhPM&t=198s)** — they've shown that it doesn't take much exercise to help you with your health.
- **[03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bskn2RrhPM&t=202s)** — When you're exercising you're doing a lot of interesting things to the inside of your body,
- **[03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bskn2RrhPM&t=206s)** — especially your mitochondria, the energy factory of your body. You're increasing the size and
- **[03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bskn2RrhPM&t=212s)** — your mitochondria, which happened to be behind most diseases. Most diseases are related to
- **[03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bskn2RrhPM&t=219s)** — problems with your mitochondria, including cancer. So anytime you can strengthen your
- **[03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bskn2RrhPM&t=223s)** — mitochondria, you can counter these diseases. The other thing that I'm going to recommend is
- **[03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bskn2RrhPM&t=228s)** — if you have the option of going for a walk after you eat, if you've eaten carbohydrates
- **[03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bskn2RrhPM&t=235s)** — in that meal, you have a chance to burn off those sugars and then they don't affect you.
- **[04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bskn2RrhPM&t=240s)** — And this is one of the ways that athletes can get away with eating more carbs, the amount of
- **[04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bskn2RrhPM&t=246s)** — exercise. That fitness reserve really protects your body big time. And developing more fitness
- **[04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bskn2RrhPM&t=254s)** — also improves your insulin sensitivity. So if you had insulin resistance at one time,
- **[04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bskn2RrhPM&t=260s)** — developing more of a fitness reserve can greatly help your blood sugars and allow you
- **[04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bskn2RrhPM&t=266s)** — to get to a place where your insulin now finally works. If you're struggling with the
- **[04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bskn2RrhPM&t=270s)** — dawn phenomena where you wake up with your blood sugars higher, well one way to counter
- **[04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bskn2RrhPM&t=274s)** — that is just to build up your fitness reserve. One thing I think that's really important is to
- **[04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bskn2RrhPM&t=278s)** — find some type of fitness activity that you really enjoy, that you're going to do, that
- **[04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bskn2RrhPM&t=285s)** — you're not going to procrastinate. For example, with me, I really enjoy climbing rope, but I'm
- **[04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bskn2RrhPM&t=293s)** — 58 years old and I weigh like 188 pounds and I broke my left shoulder. I just can't quite do
- **[05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bskn2RrhPM&t=300s)** — what I used to do with rope climbing, but I love it. It's a great workout. So I got
- **[05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bskn2RrhPM&t=303s)** — something called the Relentless Rope Trainer, where I can mimic climbing rope and do a great
- **[05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bskn2RrhPM&t=310s)** — workout. I'll do like a hundred rope climbs in a row and I'm good for an entire workout.
- **[05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bskn2RrhPM&t=316s)** — I mean it only took me like maybe four, maybe five minutes, and it's a great workout.
- **[05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bskn2RrhPM&t=320s)** — It works the entire upper body, the core, and cardiovascular at the same time. And I use that
- **[05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bskn2RrhPM&t=327s)** — several times a week. Another thing that I'm using right now for flexibility training is
- **[05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bskn2RrhPM&t=331s)** — not necessarily high intensity, but it's for stretching. It's called the Mobility Stick.
- **[05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bskn2RrhPM&t=337s)** — It really helps to mobilize and add stretching of the upper and lower extremity,
- **[05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bskn2RrhPM&t=341s)** — which can greatly enhance sleeping, stiffness, and stress, especially if you sit behind a desk
- **[05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bskn2RrhPM&t=347s)** — most of the day. So I do a lot of research behind the computer all day, so that really comes
- **[05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bskn2RrhPM&t=352s)** — in handy. So the point is you want to break up your day by scheduled little burst of exercise.
- **[05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bskn2RrhPM&t=358s)** — And I would recommend even setting the timer to do that. So several times a day, if you
- **[06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bskn2RrhPM&t=364s)** — can work yourself up to like 11, that would be the ideal situation. But you know just several
- **[06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bskn2RrhPM&t=368s)** — times a day is definitely good. The other point I want to make is that our bodies are
- **[06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bskn2RrhPM&t=372s)** — constantly exposed to stress, and exercise keeps the stress off our body. One very unique
- **[06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bskn2RrhPM&t=379s)** — tool that I use, Heart Rate Variability Technology, which I may have some information
- **[06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bskn2RrhPM&t=385s)** — down below in the description. And this device could be used to help you figure out
- **[06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bskn2RrhPM&t=391s)** — where you are on your fitness level, when you should exercise, how long you should exercise,
- **[06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bskn2RrhPM&t=397s)** — when you shouldn't exercise, because it's all about measuring your stress and recovery cycles.
- **[06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bskn2RrhPM&t=404s)** — And exercise is a controlled stress that you can add into the mix. And it'll help you
- **[06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bskn2RrhPM&t=409s)** — determine the intensity of exercise, the volume of exercise, and your recovery of exercise.
- **[06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bskn2RrhPM&t=415s)** — And HIV by itself is an independent predictor of mortality from heart attacks. Now another
- **[07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bskn2RrhPM&t=422s)** — thing that you can kind of add to this exercise is a sauna. If you have access to a sauna,
- **[07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bskn2RrhPM&t=429s)** — if you have a sauna, if you can go somewhere to sit in a sauna and you do that four times a
- **[07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bskn2RrhPM&t=433s)** — week, that can add a significant benefit. If you can also add intermittent fasting,
- **[07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bskn2RrhPM&t=438s)** — huge benefits for increasing your longevity. Another thing that I personally like to do is
- **[07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bskn2RrhPM&t=443s)** — get out in nature, go for hikes. I do that on a regular basis. If I would have known back
- **[07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bskn2RrhPM&t=449s)** — what I know now, I would have kept up this exercise and been very, very consistent.
- **[07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bskn2RrhPM&t=454s)** — I would have been even healthier. If you have not seen my video on how inactivity
- **[07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bskn2RrhPM&t=460s)** — could be the cause of certain diseases, check it out. I put it up right here.

- **[00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpF65KLQUHY&t=0s)** — Today we're going to talk about a natural way to get rid of histamines.
- **[00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpF65KLQUHY&t=5s)** — Now, what's a histamine? A histamine is something developed when encountered with some type of
- **[00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpF65KLQUHY&t=11s)** — thing that you're allergic to, also an injury or an infection. And the symptoms are the following.
- **[00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpF65KLQUHY&t=19s)** — Mucus, sneezing, runny nose, watery eyes, red eyes. And so whether you have seasonal allergies
- **[00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpF65KLQUHY&t=26s)** — or some other type of inflammatory condition, it might be a good idea to know more about how
- **[00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpF65KLQUHY&t=31s)** — to speed up this process and get rid of these histamines. Now, unfortunately, histamines are
- **[00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpF65KLQUHY&t=37s)** — also in the food supply too. So unknowingly, you could be consuming histamines and aggravating
- **[00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpF65KLQUHY&t=44s)** — the condition. But there are certain organs that have enzymes to help you dismantle and break
- **[00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpF65KLQUHY&t=52s)** — histamines. And the first one is called diamine oxidase. We're just going to call it DAO. So
- **[00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpF65KLQUHY&t=58s)** — this enzyme is located in the small intestine as well as your kidney. Now, it's in the small
- **[01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpF65KLQUHY&t=64s)** — intestine because of all the histamines you get from foods. So you need this enzyme to
- **[01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpF65KLQUHY&t=69s)** — help break it down. But it's also in the kidney. And another enzyme, which is fairly a
- **[01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpF65KLQUHY&t=75s)** — chemical compound, HNMT stands for histamine N-methyl transferase. Not that you needed to know
- **[01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpF65KLQUHY&t=84s)** — that, but this enzyme also breaks down histamine and it's located in your liver,
- **[01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpF65KLQUHY&t=88s)** — it's in your lungs, and it's even in your central nervous system. And so if we look at
- **[01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpF65KLQUHY&t=94s)** — these histamines, the liver and kidney are probably the most important organs. The liver
- **[01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpF65KLQUHY&t=99s)** — receives a tremendous amount of blood flow, just like the kidneys. In fact, one third of
- **[01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpF65KLQUHY&t=104s)** — all the blood in your entire body travels through the liver every minute. And so anything that
- **[01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpF65KLQUHY&t=110s)** — inhibits liver function can be a problem. So this relates to like, you know, junk foods,
- **[01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpF65KLQUHY&t=117s)** — alcohol, or even smoking can actually kind of make things worse. So the two central good
- **[02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpF65KLQUHY&t=124s)** — remedies for dealing with histamines would be getting some grass-fed beef kidney extract,
- **[02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpF65KLQUHY&t=132s)** — as well as grass-fed beef liver extract. Now if you can find these in a freeze-dried form,
- **[02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpF65KLQUHY&t=140s)** — that would be best because you'll have the maximum amount of these enzymes,
- **[02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpF65KLQUHY&t=144s)** — plus a lot of other additional things that will help detoxification. I mean, you have
- **[02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpF65KLQUHY&t=149s)** — selenium, you have antioxidants, you have nutrients that will all help speed up the
- **[02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpF65KLQUHY&t=155s)** — process. Now the other remedy that I'm going to recommend would be milk thistle. So the
- **[02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpF65KLQUHY&t=160s)** — compound in milk thistle is called silymarin. And that compound not only is great in protecting
- **[02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpF65KLQUHY&t=168s)** — the liver and other organs from poisons, like snake bites, poisonous mushrooms, certain drugs
- **[02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpF65KLQUHY&t=176s)** — that can poison you, but milk thistle has been known to help anaphylactic shock, which is a
- **[03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpF65KLQUHY&t=183s)** — allergic reaction. So it's great in any allergies. Now since histamines come from a certain immune
- **[03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpF65KLQUHY&t=190s)** — cell called the mast cell, milk thistle stabilizes the membrane around the mast cell,
- **[03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpF65KLQUHY&t=198s)** — decreasing histamines directly, and then avoiding the foods high in histamine. And that would
- **[03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpF65KLQUHY&t=204s)** — be anything fermented, as in alcohol, like beer, wine, other alcohol beverages. This includes
- **[03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpF65KLQUHY&t=212s)** — fermented dairy, as in aged cheeses, cream cheese, yogurt, kefir, things like that. I would also
- **[03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpF65KLQUHY&t=219s)** — avoid fermented vegetables like sauerkraut or kimchi, even though I usually recommend them.
- **[03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpF65KLQUHY&t=224s)** — But if you're in a histamine reaction, you should probably avoid them. Other fermented
- **[03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpF65KLQUHY&t=229s)** — products would be like bread, vinegar, which includes apple cider vinegar, steered meats.
- **[03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpF65KLQUHY&t=235s)** — Okay, I would avoid those. And then other things like smoked meats and smoked fish,
- **[04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpF65KLQUHY&t=241s)** — shellfish, spinach, and even chocolate. All of these are high in histamine. So if you avoid these,
- **[04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpF65KLQUHY&t=246s)** — you're going to have less of a reaction and you can overcome this a lot faster. Now if
- **[04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpF65KLQUHY&t=250s)** — you haven't seen my other very popular video on mucus, you might want to check that out. I

## Video 73: The Muscle-Building Supplements That ACTUALLY Work

**Watch on YouTube:** [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPDzypsisI4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPDzypsisI4)

## Full Transcript with Timestamps

*Click any timestamp to jump to that moment in the video*

- **[00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPDzypsisI4&t=0s)** — The three best supplements to build muscle as fast as possible.
- **[00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPDzypsisI4&t=5s)** — Of course, everyone knows that exercise is the most potent stimulus of building muscle.
- **[00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPDzypsisI4&t=10s)** — The more mechanical stress on the muscles, the faster the muscle responds by getting bigger.
- **[00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPDzypsisI4&t=15s)** — What I want to get into is what supplements can you take at the same time to enhance that effect?
- **[00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPDzypsisI4&t=20s)** — And some other things that are really important to talk about too, because they can slow you down,
- **[00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPDzypsisI4&t=25s)** — if not prevent you from growing your muscles.
- **[00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPDzypsisI4&t=28s)** — One of them does stimulate muscle growth, but when you're just taking three amino acids,
- **[00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPDzypsisI4&t=32s)** — it's just a very incomplete product. Because you need more than just three amino acids to actually build muscle.
- **[00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPDzypsisI4&t=38s)** — And in fact, on some of the double-blended studies that were done on amino acids, the results are not good.
- **[00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPDzypsisI4&t=44s)** — It really doesn't do anything for your muscles. So that's going to be a waste of time.
- **[00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPDzypsisI4&t=48s)** — Not to mention, it'll turn into sugar. It'll actually increase your blood sugar many times as well.
- **[00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPDzypsisI4&t=53s)** — The other thing I'm going to recommend to avoid if you're trying to build muscle is something called tribulus and fenugreek.
- **[00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPDzypsisI4&t=59s)** — Both of those do tend to increase testosterone a little bit, but not enough to really see any change in your muscles.
- **[01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPDzypsisI4&t=66s)** — And as we age, testosterone goes down. Testosterone is essential to building muscle.
- **[01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPDzypsisI4&t=72s)** — And also our cortisol goes up as we age. And so the combination of low testosterone and increased cortisol is not good for your muscles.
- **[01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPDzypsisI4&t=79s)** — One of the biggest things that will do that is overtraining.
- **[01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPDzypsisI4&t=82s)** — When you overtrain, you greatly spike cortisol and you shut down your testosterone. That's directly going to affect your muscles.
- **[01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPDzypsisI4&t=88s)** — And testosterone actually comes from cholesterol. I don't recommend you go on a low-fat diet or a low-cholesterol diet,
- **[01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPDzypsisI4&t=95s)** — let alone take this medication called statins because statins block cholesterol, which will tank your testosterone and prevent you from developing your muscles.
- **[01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPDzypsisI4&t=105s)** — Another big barrier in developing muscles is having insulin resistance.
- **[01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPDzypsisI4&t=110s)** — And that comes from usually consuming way too much carbohydrates as well as eating frequently with all the different snacks.
- **[01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPDzypsisI4&t=116s)** — And a lack of sleep is a huge factor in developing your muscles.
- **[02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPDzypsisI4&t=120s)** — Since most of the muscle growth occurs when you're sleeping, if you're not sleeping, that could be a big barrier.
- **[02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPDzypsisI4&t=126s)** — One of the best things to help you sleep is magnesium glycinate.
- **[02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPDzypsisI4&t=130s)** — Magnesium is essential in making energy that actually feeds the muscle.
- **[02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPDzypsisI4&t=134s)** — So magnesium is a really important nutrient. But that's not part of the three supplements I'm going to recommend. It's just a side note.
- **[02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPDzypsisI4&t=141s)** — The first supplement I'm going to recommend is something called creatine monohydrate.
- **[02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPDzypsisI4&t=145s)** — Creatine is normally in red meat. Creatine increases ATP, it increases performance, it increases your energy while you're working out,
- **[02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPDzypsisI4&t=154s)** — more hydration, as well as increasing muscle stimulus directly, increasing the mass or the size of the muscle.
- **[02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPDzypsisI4&t=160s)** — That's number one supplement. Number two, whey protein.
- **[02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPDzypsisI4&t=163s)** — Because whey protein powder per scoop gives you enough leucine to stimulate muscle growth.
- **[02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPDzypsisI4&t=171s)** — And when you have whey protein, you'll get enough leucine as well as all of the amino acids that you need to develop muscle.
- **[03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPDzypsisI4&t=180s)** — If you're going to take whey protein powder, I would just take it once a day.
- **[03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPDzypsisI4&t=183s)** — And number three supplement is zinc. Because zinc increases testosterone.
- **[03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPDzypsisI4&t=189s)** — Even if you're mildly deficient in zinc, you will have less production of testosterone.
- **[03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPDzypsisI4&t=195s)** — Testosterone is very, very important in developing muscle size and strength.
- **[03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPDzypsisI4&t=200s)** — And like I said before, as we get older, when our testosterone goes down, we just cannot develop muscle like we used to.
- **[03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPDzypsisI4&t=207s)** — Now, let me shift gears to the food that you should eat.
- **[03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPDzypsisI4&t=210s)** — Now, if we're trying to build muscle, we want to eat muscle.
- **[03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPDzypsisI4&t=213s)** — Okay. And the best muscle to eat is grass-fed red meat. Why?
- **[03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPDzypsisI4&t=217s)** — Because grass-fed red meat has high levels of creatine.
- **[03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPDzypsisI4&t=223s)** — It also has all of the amino acids, including leucine.
- **[03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPDzypsisI4&t=226s)** — And it also has zinc, MB12, and carnosine, which is another thing that can help you.
- **[03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPDzypsisI4&t=233s)** — And if that red meat also has fat in it, that can give you the cholesterol, the building block to help build testosterone because you need the cholesterol.
- **[04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPDzypsisI4&t=240s)** — Now, you can also do eggs. Eggs are great too. And fish, salmon.
- **[04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPDzypsisI4&t=243s)** — But out of all of the proteins and foods you can eat to build muscle, red meat is going to be at the top of the list.
- **[04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPDzypsisI4&t=251s)** — And now you know why. There's a couple last interesting points I want to mention.
- **[04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPDzypsisI4&t=255s)** — We talked about overtraining, right? That's the worst killer for trying to develop muscle because you're not going to develop muscle.
- **[04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPDzypsisI4&t=260s)** — You're going to spike cortisol and you're going to reduce testosterone.
- **[04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPDzypsisI4&t=264s)** — It's going to affect your cognitive function and it's going to increase your appetite.
- **[04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPDzypsisI4&t=267s)** — It's going to cause you to eat the wrong foods.
- **[04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPDzypsisI4&t=269s)** — There's also a protein called myostatin that inhibits your muscle growth.
- **[04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPDzypsisI4&t=276s)** — You have this protein that kind of keeps you from growing muscles too big.
- **[04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPDzypsisI4&t=280s)** — And it just so happens that when you do heavy training, resistant exercise training, you inhibit that protein.
- **[04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPDzypsisI4&t=286s)** — And creatine also decreases that protein as well. And vitamin D also can decrease that protein.
- **[04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPDzypsisI4&t=294s)** — So you want to get a lot of sun on top of what I just told you.
- **[04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPDzypsisI4&t=297s)** — So I hope this data will help you.
- **[04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPDzypsisI4&t=299s)** — Thanks for watching and I will see you in the next video.

- **[00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoxwcE6g7Qw&t=0s)** — So today I'm going to talk about some of the other benefits of coffee that go beyond just
- **[00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoxwcE6g7Qw&t=4s)** — waking up in the morning. In other words, I'm going to give you some really important
- **[00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoxwcE6g7Qw&t=7s)** — reasons to drink coffee. That being said, I'm not recommending coffee if it gives you
- **[00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoxwcE6g7Qw&t=12s)** — anxiety, it increases your heart rate, and if it prevents you from sleeping. And I'm
- **[00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoxwcE6g7Qw&t=16s)** — not recommending large amounts of coffee. Just one cup a day. I am the human guinea
- **[00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoxwcE6g7Qw&t=21s)** — pig for drinking way too much coffee in college. I drank pots of coffee and it
- **[00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoxwcE6g7Qw&t=26s)** — burned out my adrenals because too much coffee can increase cortisol and adrenaline. So why
- **[00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoxwcE6g7Qw&t=33s)** — am I recommending coffee in the first place? Well, there's some different chemicals in
- **[00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoxwcE6g7Qw&t=39s)** — the coffee itself, as well as this one chemical called caffeine. And the benefits
- **[00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoxwcE6g7Qw&t=45s)** — of coffee come from both caffeine and these other chemicals. And just so you know,
- **[00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoxwcE6g7Qw&t=51s)** — caffeine is a phytochemical. It comes from plants. It's actually an insecticide and
- **[00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoxwcE6g7Qw&t=58s)** — it's in 30 plants. But the question is, how can an insecticide be good for us? Well,
- **[01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoxwcE6g7Qw&t=63s)** — sometimes a little poison or a little stress can actually create benefits in our body.
- **[01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoxwcE6g7Qw&t=68s)** — So what is coffee? Really, it's just a fermented coffee bean. That means that
- **[01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoxwcE6g7Qw&t=72s)** — they're interacting with a microbe to enhance something about that food. I want
- **[01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoxwcE6g7Qw&t=76s)** — to talk about these other benefits other than the one that most people know. Caffeine inhibits
- **[01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoxwcE6g7Qw&t=83s)** — a certain compound called adenosine. That keeps us awake. It normally helps us go to sleep.
- **[01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoxwcE6g7Qw&t=89s)** — It makes us tired. Well, by inhibiting that chemical, caffeine will wake you up. But let's
- **[01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoxwcE6g7Qw&t=94s)** — get into some of the other things that coffee can do for you. It can give you mental acuity.
- **[01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoxwcE6g7Qw&t=99s)** — It can help you focus. It can actually help you actually even learn a little bit better.
- **[01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoxwcE6g7Qw&t=105s)** — It also speeds up the rate of metabolism. It also helps your blood sugars, especially if you add
- **[01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoxwcE6g7Qw&t=112s)** — some MCT oil or butter to the coffee to make it bulletproof coffee. There's some data that
- **[01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoxwcE6g7Qw&t=118s)** — shows that it can decrease your risk of getting dementia and decrease certain symptoms
- **[02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoxwcE6g7Qw&t=125s)** — related to Parkinson's disease and even Alzheimer's. It has certain properties that
- **[02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoxwcE6g7Qw&t=130s)** — decrease your risk of getting gallstones. And that's because it increases the production of bile
- **[02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoxwcE6g7Qw&t=136s)** — and the flow of bile. It also has properties to help prevent a kidney stone. There's data to
- **[02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoxwcE6g7Qw&t=142s)** — show that it has anti-cancer properties, which is interesting. And no, I don't think just
- **[02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoxwcE6g7Qw&t=147s)** — drinking more coffee is going to get rid of your cancer. It has anti-inflammatory properties,
- **[02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoxwcE6g7Qw&t=153s)** — hepatoprotection properties. It's basically protection against your liver. There's certain
- **[02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoxwcE6g7Qw&t=157s)** — things in coffee like polyphenols that help feed your microbiome. There's a condition called
- **[02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoxwcE6g7Qw&t=167s)** — postural hypotension. Basically you stand up and your blood pressure drops, right? You feel dizzy.
- **[02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoxwcE6g7Qw&t=172s)** — Coffee can help that. If I drink too much coffee, more than one cup, and later in the day,
- **[02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoxwcE6g7Qw&t=178s)** — I won't be able to sleep that well. So what I do is I have one cup of coffee.
- **[03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoxwcE6g7Qw&t=182s)** — Do I put cream in it? Yes, I do. Do I put sugar in it? No, I don't. And I don't use any sweeteners,
- **[03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoxwcE6g7Qw&t=189s)** — even alternative sugar alcohols in my coffee. Coffee also helps, apparently, with exercise
- **[03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoxwcE6g7Qw&t=195s)** — performance, increasing cardiac output and delaying soreness in your muscles. Because
- **[03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoxwcE6g7Qw&t=203s)** — apparently the neurotransmitters that it activates helps to vasodilate your lungs. Also,
- **[03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoxwcE6g7Qw&t=210s)** — coffee can help decrease the symptoms of being at a high altitude. So some people have problems
- **[03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoxwcE6g7Qw&t=218s)** — with that. Well, coffee can help that. And I think that has to do with the sympathetic nervous
- **[03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoxwcE6g7Qw&t=222s)** — system activation more than anything else, which is really the strength of how you can adapt
- **[03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoxwcE6g7Qw&t=228s)** — to stress. Coffee can increase mitochondrial biogenesis. Now what is that? Basically,
- **[03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoxwcE6g7Qw&t=236s)** — increases the number of mitochondria in your body. Coffee also has the ability to increase
- **[04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoxwcE6g7Qw&t=242s)** — stomach acid to help you digest. Now there's some other research that I looked at that talked
- **[04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoxwcE6g7Qw&t=247s)** — about if you combine certain things with coffee, there's an enhanced effect. So for example,
- **[04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoxwcE6g7Qw&t=253s)** — if you combine alcohol with coffee, apparently you'll have less jitters, okay, you'll feel
- **[04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoxwcE6g7Qw&t=258s)** — less jittery. If you smoke or take tobacco with coffee, apparently the nicotine helps clear out
- **[04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoxwcE6g7Qw&t=267s)** — the caffeine a little faster. If you take certain medications for a headache or pain,
- **[04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoxwcE6g7Qw&t=274s)** — the caffeine can help enhance the benefits. So this is why anytime I drink coffee,
- **[04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoxwcE6g7Qw&t=279s)** — I also smoke a cigarette, take a little shot of whiskey, and take my pain medication.
- **[04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoxwcE6g7Qw&t=284s)** — And of course, I hope you understand now my dry sense of humor. I am completely being sarcastic.
- **[04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoxwcE6g7Qw&t=291s)** — And even birth control pills, which personally I do not take, can extend the half-life of
- **[04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoxwcE6g7Qw&t=296s)** — caffeine, which means that the caffeine will stay in your body longer if you're taking
- **[05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoxwcE6g7Qw&t=301s)** — birth control pills. Now for those of you that decided that you're going to start drinking
- **[05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoxwcE6g7Qw&t=305s)** — coffee, you probably need to know how to neutralize the side effects of coffee. And
- **[05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoxwcE6g7Qw&t=311s)** — for that, I put this video up right here. Check it out.

- **[00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vl_bzEBBnZA&t=0s)** — Now, out of all the things that can improve your health, this one thing is pretty much at the top
- **[00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vl_bzEBBnZA&t=6s)** — of the list. But I found out recently, I've never done a video on this one specific topic. And that
- **[00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vl_bzEBBnZA&t=12s)** — has to do with diversity of your microbes in your gut. And how to increase your own diversity of
- **[00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vl_bzEBBnZA&t=21s)** — the microbiome. So first of all, what is this word diversity? Well, it's the number of different
- **[00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vl_bzEBBnZA&t=26s)** — species that you have in your gut. And you also have a factor of richness, which is the total amount
- **[00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vl_bzEBBnZA&t=32s)** — of microbes. So ideally, you want a rich microbiome with a lot of different species. And this kind of
- **[00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vl_bzEBBnZA&t=39s)** — goes against this idea of like health is being clean, free of germs. Well, apparently, it's
- **[00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vl_bzEBBnZA&t=45s)** — just the opposite of that. You want a lot of germs in your body, but inside, and you want
- **[00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vl_bzEBBnZA&t=49s)** — them friendly. If you don't have this diversity, believe it or not, you actually get more unfriendly
- **[00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vl_bzEBBnZA&t=56s)** — pathogens. I'm talking about like salmonella, H. pylori, C. diff, E. coli. You know, all these
- **[01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vl_bzEBBnZA&t=64s)** — microbes do live in your body in a healthy environment, and they don't bother you until
- **[01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vl_bzEBBnZA&t=69s)** — the relationship changes because of the environmental changes. But if you're missing
- **[01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vl_bzEBBnZA&t=74s)** — all sorts of issues can happen. Diarrhea, inflammation in your gut. You get more toxins,
- **[01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vl_bzEBBnZA&t=81s)** — obesity, your metabolism slows down, your mood is lowered. And this all relates to something
- **[01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vl_bzEBBnZA&t=87s)** — called dysbiosis. In fact, dysbiosis is pretty much involved or associated with every single
- **[01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vl_bzEBBnZA&t=94s)** — illness out there. Even Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, ADHD, schizophrenia, bipolar,
- **[01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vl_bzEBBnZA&t=101s)** — having anxiety, depression. So I think this topic is really, really important. Even cancer. Yes,
- **[01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vl_bzEBBnZA&t=108s)** — there's usually always dysbiosis when you have cancer. So it's so important to have a wide
- **[01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vl_bzEBBnZA&t=114s)** — variety of these species to make vitamins for immune protection, to keep your inflammation
- **[02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vl_bzEBBnZA&t=121s)** — down, to feed your colon cells, to help you produce amino acids and neurotransmitters and
- **[02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vl_bzEBBnZA&t=125s)** — proteins, to keep your energy high, all sorts of health-related things. Now you have to also
- **[02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vl_bzEBBnZA&t=133s)** — realize that in your gut, 99% of all the microorganisms are bacteria, but you do have
- **[02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vl_bzEBBnZA&t=139s)** — 1% left. And that kind of makes up friendly fungus, friendly yeast, friendly mold, and other
- **[02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vl_bzEBBnZA&t=148s)** — friendly microorganisms. So it's not all bacteria. And then if we look at the bacteria,
- **[02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vl_bzEBBnZA&t=154s)** — there's two categories of bacteria. And they're both what's called anaerobes, which they
- **[02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vl_bzEBBnZA&t=160s)** — survive without oxygen. One is called obligate anaerobes. And these are the type of microbes
- **[02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vl_bzEBBnZA&t=167s)** — that they die if you expose them to oxygen. So they can only live without oxygen. And then
- **[02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vl_bzEBBnZA&t=175s)** — you have another category of anaerobic bacteria called facultative. This type of bacteria
- **[03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vl_bzEBBnZA&t=182s)** — can live, even though it's called an anaerobic bacteria, it can live without oxygen. And it
- **[03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vl_bzEBBnZA&t=190s)** — also can live with oxygen. So it can do both. And out of the majority of research that's out
- **[03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vl_bzEBBnZA&t=195s)** — there, it's the facultative anaerobic microbes that are studied. Not these other microbes
- **[03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vl_bzEBBnZA&t=203s)** — that hate oxygen, right? They die with oxygen. And those specific bacteria make up 99% of all
- **[03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vl_bzEBBnZA&t=209s)** — bacteria. Only 1% is the other ones which actually can live with oxygen or without.
- **[03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vl_bzEBBnZA&t=217s)** — And it's interesting because most of the research is on that 1% only. So in other words,
- **[03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vl_bzEBBnZA&t=222s)** — there's a lot we don't know. Because it's hard to culture those microbes that are only
- **[03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vl_bzEBBnZA&t=228s)** — dependent on an environment without oxygen. So there's a tremendous amount of things we just
- **[03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vl_bzEBBnZA&t=233s)** — don't know. But what we do know for sure is the more diversity, the more health you're
- **[03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vl_bzEBBnZA&t=237s)** — going to have. But even if we're talking about like nutrient dense foods, okay?
- **[04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vl_bzEBBnZA&t=243s)** — Nutrient dense foods are dependent on the diversity of microbes in the soil. So if you
- **[04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vl_bzEBBnZA&t=247s)** — want nutrient dense foods, you have to make sure that the soil has a great wide range
- **[04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vl_bzEBBnZA&t=254s)** — of microbes. If we want health, we need to make sure that we have a wide range of microbes
- **[04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vl_bzEBBnZA&t=261s)** — in our gut. It's the diversity of microbes in the gut that gives the plant immune protection,
- **[04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vl_bzEBBnZA&t=266s)** — that gives the plant vitamins and minerals and phytonutrients and disease resistance.
- **[04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vl_bzEBBnZA&t=274s)** — And then that plant becomes stronger and it too is filled with microbes because plants also
- **[04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vl_bzEBBnZA&t=279s)** — have their own microbiome. And so that relates to the animals that eat the plants, right?
- **[04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vl_bzEBBnZA&t=284s)** — The health of that animal is dependent on the health of the plant. Now this is going
- **[04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vl_bzEBBnZA&t=288s)** — to relate to the next topic of how do we increase the diversity of microbes in our gut?
- **[04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vl_bzEBBnZA&t=294s)** — The first way is to eat food that has been grown on soil that has diversity, okay? So buying your
- **[05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vl_bzEBBnZA&t=300s)** — salad and vegetables at the farmers market is going to be better than buying vegetables at
- **[05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vl_bzEBBnZA&t=305s)** — the grocery store that you have no idea where it came from. But you pretty much know if you
- **[05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vl_bzEBBnZA&t=309s)** — eat the food because it's like tasteless. If you have more flavor, you're going to have more
- **[05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vl_bzEBBnZA&t=313s)** — nutrients and you can be rest assured that they were grown on a really good diverse microbiome
- **[05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vl_bzEBBnZA&t=319s)** — Another way is to start eating more of a diversified types of plants, okay? So in your
- **[05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vl_bzEBBnZA&t=328s)** — salad and I'm totally guilty of this. I usually have had the same type of lettuce over and over
- **[05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vl_bzEBBnZA&t=334s)** — for a very long time. And so what I've done recently after I'm studying all this is I
- **[05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vl_bzEBBnZA&t=340s)** — started to diversify the types of plants that I eat in my salad. So I'm putting things in
- **[05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vl_bzEBBnZA&t=346s)** — my salad that I've never ate before. And then when I go in the grocery store, I just basically try
- **[05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vl_bzEBBnZA&t=351s)** — several different new plants. And so I put them in my salad and I eat them and I definitely
- **[05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vl_bzEBBnZA&t=356s)** — will tell you I noticed a big difference. Another thing that can increase diversity is
- **[06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vl_bzEBBnZA&t=360s)** — actually exercise. The exercise stress, which is a positive stress, creates more diversity in
- **[06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vl_bzEBBnZA&t=365s)** — your gut. Also better sleep will do it. And intermittent fasting. Yeah, it adds a positive
- **[06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vl_bzEBBnZA&t=373s)** — stress that increases diversity of microbes in your gut versus snacking through the day,
- **[06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vl_bzEBBnZA&t=381s)** — which basically creates a lot of lazy microbes. It's very similar to the animals on my farm.
- **[06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vl_bzEBBnZA&t=386s)** — If I feed them like snacks all day, they get overweight, they get sluggish, they don't really
- **[06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vl_bzEBBnZA&t=393s)** — do much. So for example, my pigs, I have them on an intermittent fasting schedule. They
- **[06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vl_bzEBBnZA&t=403s)** — twice a day so they can fast for 18 hours. And the same thing with my dogs, but I don't give my
- **[06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vl_bzEBBnZA&t=408s)** — dogs a lot of snacks in between little treats because that breaks the fast. The next thing that
- **[06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vl_bzEBBnZA&t=415s)** — can increase diversity is consuming more phenols. Okay, phenols. What are phenols? Well,
- **[07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vl_bzEBBnZA&t=421s)** — it's those phytonutrients like the flavonoids in different plants and lemons and limes
- **[07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vl_bzEBBnZA&t=428s)** — and berries, things like that. And also the tannins in different herbs, like eating different
- **[07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vl_bzEBBnZA&t=433s)** — teas. Coumanin in turmeric is a phenol, but phenols are a wide category of a lot of different
- **[07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vl_bzEBBnZA&t=441s)** — types of phenols. And if you're consuming a wide range of vegetables and maybe berries
- **[07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vl_bzEBBnZA&t=447s)** — and other plants, you're going to get a lot of phenols. And that's going to stimulate
- **[07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vl_bzEBBnZA&t=451s)** — a wide range of different species in your gut. A really good way to increase diversity is to
- **[07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vl_bzEBBnZA&t=458s)** — consume sprouts or microgreens that are grown on soil because sprouts normally aren't grown on
- **[07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vl_bzEBBnZA&t=465s)** — soil. But when you start getting into microgreens, not grown on like coconut fiber, I'm talking
- **[07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vl_bzEBBnZA&t=471s)** — about actual soil. It's a bit hard to find, but you can grow your own. But those microgreens
- **[07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vl_bzEBBnZA&t=478s)** — are loaded with not just friendly microbes in the plant itself, but phytonutrients,
- **[08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vl_bzEBBnZA&t=486s)** — including a lot of polyphenols and fiber that your microbes will really love. So when
- **[08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vl_bzEBBnZA&t=491s)** — you're eating microgreens, you're really supporting your gut health in a big way.
- **[08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vl_bzEBBnZA&t=495s)** — And the cool thing is you don't need a lot of them. You just need a little bit because
- **[08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vl_bzEBBnZA&t=498s)** — they're so concentrated with these phytonutrients. The next thing is probiotic foods,
- **[08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vl_bzEBBnZA&t=504s)** — kefir, sauerkraut, essential. They have such a wide range of different microbes. You talk about
- **[08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vl_bzEBBnZA&t=514s)** — diversity of microbes in sauerkraut and kimchi and even kefir. I mean, there's just a lot
- **[08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vl_bzEBBnZA&t=520s)** — of different microbes. So when you eat those foods that are diversified, you get the benefit
- **[08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vl_bzEBBnZA&t=526s)** — of that. I mean, let's just take one microbe, the lactobacillus microbe. Certain
- **[08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vl_bzEBBnZA&t=532s)** — lactobacillus microbes help you make dopamine, which can help support and even potentially prevent
- **[09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vl_bzEBBnZA&t=542s)** — ADHD, depression, anxiety, and many other similar disorders. And then also, raw food,
- **[09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vl_bzEBBnZA&t=549s)** — more raw food is better. So if you're going to eat vegetables and you eat them all just
- **[09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vl_bzEBBnZA&t=553s)** — completely cooked to death, well, that's not going to support the microbiome as much as
- **[09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vl_bzEBBnZA&t=557s)** — I think a balance of steamed and cooked and raw is a good thing. Now, it's very important also to
- **[09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vl_bzEBBnZA&t=563s)** — talk about the flip side. What lowers this microbiome diversity? Okay. Number one, broad
- **[09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vl_bzEBBnZA&t=571s)** — spectrum antibiotics. It's a killer. Anytime you take an antibiotic and try to take them
- **[09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vl_bzEBBnZA&t=577s)** — sparingly, always take a probiotic at the same time or start consuming probiotic foods at
- **[09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vl_bzEBBnZA&t=583s)** — very important. There are other things that are antibiotics that you probably are not aware of,
- **[09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vl_bzEBBnZA&t=589s)** — like glyphosate, which is in the GMO foods because they spray this glyphosate on the soil
- **[09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vl_bzEBBnZA&t=595s)** — and that actually is classified as an antibiotic. And unfortunately, that chemical is
- **[10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vl_bzEBBnZA&t=603s)** — so many foods. It's, I mean, it's just, it's almost everything, which means we need to kind
- **[10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vl_bzEBBnZA&t=607s)** — of actively work on building up our gut. Now, animals that are fed on a monoculture, like only
- **[10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vl_bzEBBnZA&t=613s)** — one or two or three foods, whether it's grains or even grasses have less microbes to work with.
- **[10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vl_bzEBBnZA&t=619s)** — And they themselves have a lower amount of diversity because the animal gets its diversity
- **[10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vl_bzEBBnZA&t=625s)** — from the wide range of plants. And this is why when I entered in my beef and the study
- **[10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vl_bzEBBnZA&t=631s)** — that I did, I don't know if you saw the video on it, but I'll put a link down below,
- **[10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vl_bzEBBnZA&t=634s)** — I have a very diverse pasture of not just grasses, but weeds. I mean, it's like,
- **[10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vl_bzEBBnZA&t=640s)** — like probably over 40 or 50 different plants that these animals have a chance to eat. And
- **[10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vl_bzEBBnZA&t=647s)** — it's their smorgasbord of all sorts of things they can eat. And when I entered in my beef,
- **[10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vl_bzEBBnZA&t=653s)** — and we compare that to a lot of the other farms around the country, I mean, talk about
- **[10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vl_bzEBBnZA&t=658s)** — I mean, even the phytonutrients in the beef was like three times higher than most other farms.
- **[11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vl_bzEBBnZA&t=666s)** — That's right. There are plant based chemicals in animals. That's right. So now you can get
- **[11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vl_bzEBBnZA&t=671s)** — your antioxidants by eating beef, right? You just have to make sure that it's
- **[11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vl_bzEBBnZA&t=675s)** — really, really healthy. So another thing that will lower the diversity is stress,
- **[11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vl_bzEBBnZA&t=680s)** — artificial sweeteners, inflammation will do it, a fatty liver. In fact, any liver problem,
- **[11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vl_bzEBBnZA&t=686s)** — because the liver makes bile and without the quantities of bile, then we get an imbalance
- **[11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vl_bzEBBnZA&t=693s)** — in our microbes, we get this dysbiosis. So bile is actually made by your microbes,
- **[11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vl_bzEBBnZA&t=700s)** — but also bile controls the ratios of certain microbes. So we need a healthy liver to have
- **[11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vl_bzEBBnZA&t=706s)** — this diversity. Too many sterilized foods, pasteurized food, radiated food, overly processed
- **[11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vl_bzEBBnZA&t=713s)** — food, really bad for your gut. Like I said before, also less variety of foods, right? So
- **[11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vl_bzEBBnZA&t=719s)** — the next time you go to the grocery store is just start picking out different
- **[12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vl_bzEBBnZA&t=723s)** — vegetable varieties and start to build out your salad and try new things. Now another
- **[12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vl_bzEBBnZA&t=729s)** — couple points, if you're pregnant or going to have a child is breastfeeding. Because if
- **[12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vl_bzEBBnZA&t=734s)** — you're not breastfeeding, you're not going to be able to inoculate with the microbes,
- **[12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vl_bzEBBnZA&t=739s)** — as well as the colostrum into that infant. And that can be a problem later in life with their
- **[12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vl_bzEBBnZA&t=746s)** — microbiome, the diversity of microbiome. And of course, that also goes with the C-section.
- **[12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vl_bzEBBnZA&t=750s)** — Having a natural birth enhances the diversity of your microbes. So I wanted to shine a very
- **[12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vl_bzEBBnZA&t=756s)** — bright light and focus in on this diversity, because I think it's a really important thing.
- **[12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vl_bzEBBnZA&t=760s)** — And if you haven't seen my more comprehensive video on digestion, okay, that's a real
- **[12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vl_bzEBBnZA&t=767s)** — interesting one. I put that up right here. Check it out.

- **[00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7wgLehFAbc&t=0s)** — High blood pressure, hypertension is not a disease. It's a symptom.
- **[00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7wgLehFAbc&t=4s)** — 90% of hypertension is a known cause.
- **[00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7wgLehFAbc&t=8s)** — Well, today I'm going to tell you what the cause is.
- **[00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7wgLehFAbc&t=10s)** — When you start telling people that 90% of hypertension is unknown,
- **[00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7wgLehFAbc&t=13s)** — you make the drug companies rich because you turn the person into an ATM for certain medications.
- **[00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7wgLehFAbc&t=18s)** — It's very profitable if you don't let people know what the primary cause is.
- **[00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7wgLehFAbc&t=22s)** — Let me show you what the primary cause is.
- **[00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7wgLehFAbc&t=24s)** — Okay, so here we have an artery.
- **[00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7wgLehFAbc&t=25s)** — You have a certain layer, it's called an endothelial layer of cells.
- **[00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7wgLehFAbc&t=30s)** — That cell layer has these little tiny receptors for insulin.
- **[00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7wgLehFAbc&t=35s)** — And insulin triggers something that causes the artery to relax.
- **[00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7wgLehFAbc&t=41s)** — When that receptor becomes damaged, you get high blood pressure.
- **[00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7wgLehFAbc&t=45s)** — But the problem is, if you fix insulin resistance, sometimes it doesn't lower the blood pressure.
- **[00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7wgLehFAbc&t=51s)** — The question is, why? Because when you damage that receptor, the receptor won't let insulin in anymore.
- **[00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7wgLehFAbc&t=55s)** — Now it's really hard to regulate and relax the blood vessels.
- **[00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7wgLehFAbc&t=59s)** — Also, insulin causes too much calcium to go inside the cells.
- **[01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7wgLehFAbc&t=64s)** — And this is why they use calcium channel blockers.
- **[01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7wgLehFAbc&t=67s)** — The cause is insulin resistance. That's ignored.
- **[01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7wgLehFAbc&t=70s)** — Because like I said before, 90% of hypertension is unknown cause.
- **[01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7wgLehFAbc&t=75s)** — That's very interesting. But let me just give you a little bit more data.
- **[01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7wgLehFAbc&t=78s)** — There is normally supposed to be a little protective shield around that endothelium, that layer.
- **[01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7wgLehFAbc&t=84s)** — It's kind of like something on your frying pan that is a non-stick surface.
- **[01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7wgLehFAbc&t=88s)** — And when that substance becomes damaged, then we get damage directly to cells.
- **[01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7wgLehFAbc&t=94s)** — And then you start having a cascade of issues where you get holes into the area.
- **[01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7wgLehFAbc&t=98s)** — You get inflammation, calcium buildup, excess clotting.
- **[01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7wgLehFAbc&t=102s)** — What's that little protective shield? The glycocalyx.
- **[01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7wgLehFAbc&t=105s)** — And that glycocalyx is super vulnerable to getting damaged from too much glucose or fructose.
- **[01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7wgLehFAbc&t=111s)** — And it's kind of weird that a sugar actually destroys sugar, but it does.
- **[01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7wgLehFAbc&t=114s)** — So when the sugar is too high or there's too much starch, you start getting this rusting out of that layer.
- **[02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7wgLehFAbc&t=120s)** — It's like acid rain. It goes in there. It dissolves it very quickly.
- **[02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7wgLehFAbc&t=124s)** — And without it, you get a lot of damage inside that artery, especially hypertension.
- **[02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7wgLehFAbc&t=128s)** — And I'm going to talk about that. But I first want to talk about some other things.
- **[02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7wgLehFAbc&t=132s)** — Because insulin resistance also creates serious deficiencies of other nutrients that if you don't fix those,
- **[02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7wgLehFAbc&t=139s)** — it's going to take a long time to get your blood pressure lowered.
- **[02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7wgLehFAbc&t=142s)** — So I'm going to recommend a combination of two different things to fix your hypertension very, very fast.
- **[02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7wgLehFAbc&t=148s)** — Going on a low carb diet and doing intermittent fasting.
- **[02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7wgLehFAbc&t=151s)** — And I'm going to also put the link down below of how to do that correctly.
- **[02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7wgLehFAbc&t=154s)** — At the same time, we want to get the blood pressure down very, very quickly.
- **[02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7wgLehFAbc&t=158s)** — So there's several things to add to the low carb diet.
- **[02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7wgLehFAbc&t=162s)** — Number one is vitamin D.
- **[02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7wgLehFAbc&t=164s)** — But you must take at least 10 to 20, sometimes 30,000 I use of vitamin D3 every single day to reestablish this.
- **[02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7wgLehFAbc&t=172s)** — Second thing is magnesium. Magnesium glycinate is the one I recommend.
- **[02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7wgLehFAbc&t=178s)** — Magnesium helps take the calcium out of the place where it shouldn't be.
- **[03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7wgLehFAbc&t=183s)** — And help to balance out the calcium to magnesium ratios.
- **[03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7wgLehFAbc&t=188s)** — Because what you need to know is calcium causes contraction.
- **[03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7wgLehFAbc&t=191s)** — Magnesium causes relaxation.
- **[03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7wgLehFAbc&t=193s)** — Plus magnesium is going to help vitamin D to work.
- **[03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7wgLehFAbc&t=197s)** — In fact, vitamin D won't work without magnesium.
- **[03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7wgLehFAbc&t=200s)** — And magnesium won't work without vitamin D.
- **[03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7wgLehFAbc&t=202s)** — They're both really, really important, especially with hypertension.
- **[03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7wgLehFAbc&t=206s)** — Plus magnesium reduces cortisol and adrenaline.
- **[03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7wgLehFAbc&t=211s)** — Magnesium also has anti-inflammatory properties.
- **[03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7wgLehFAbc&t=214s)** — And magnesium helps reestablish that little layer, that protective glycocalyx.
- **[03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7wgLehFAbc&t=219s)** — The next nutrient that is important is potassium.
- **[03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7wgLehFAbc&t=222s)** — And I would recommend taking a good amount of potassium.
- **[03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7wgLehFAbc&t=225s)** — You can get potassium supplements in a thousand milligrams per serving size.
- **[03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7wgLehFAbc&t=229s)** — But what potassium does is it directly helps to fix that glycocalyx as well.
- **[03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7wgLehFAbc&t=236s)** — And potassium reduces the sodium.
- **[03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7wgLehFAbc&t=238s)** — And potassium directly lowers blood pressure.
- **[04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7wgLehFAbc&t=240s)** — Because it helps to relax the smooth muscle.
- **[04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7wgLehFAbc&t=243s)** — And then the last thing you need to really get the blood pressure down is to increase your sulfur.
- **[04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7wgLehFAbc&t=248s)** — Sulfur is going to help reestablish this protective sugar-coating glycocalyx.
- **[04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7wgLehFAbc&t=253s)** — But I wouldn't take it in a supplement. I would get it from food.
- **[04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7wgLehFAbc&t=255s)** — One of the best sources of sulfur is grass-fed red meat.
- **[04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7wgLehFAbc&t=259s)** — Eggs also are loaded with sulfur.
- **[04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7wgLehFAbc&t=261s)** — But it's pretty wild that some people will tell you that,
- **[04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7wgLehFAbc&t=264s)** — Oh, you don't want to have eggs or red meat for blood pressure because it has cholesterol and blah, blah, blah.
- **[04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7wgLehFAbc&t=271s)** — When in fact, the red meat and eggs will totally turn this thing around.
- **[04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7wgLehFAbc&t=274s)** — So to fix insulin resistance, we want to avoid too much carbohydrate.
- **[04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7wgLehFAbc&t=278s)** — We want to avoid, of course, sugar starch.
- **[04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7wgLehFAbc&t=280s)** — We want to avoid seed oils because that can create inflammation.
- **[04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7wgLehFAbc&t=283s)** — Also, make sure when you're doing this, you do not have like the hidden carbohydrates.
- **[04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7wgLehFAbc&t=289s)** — So in other words, I would really keep a food log and monitor your carbohydrates.
- **[04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7wgLehFAbc&t=293s)** — You want to keep them really, really low without cheating for a period of time.
- **[04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7wgLehFAbc&t=298s)** — Sometimes it takes some weeks and then you're going to start to see it come down.
- **[05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7wgLehFAbc&t=301s)** — I would highly recommend getting a home blood pressure kit so you can test yourself throughout the day and monitor this.
- **[05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7wgLehFAbc&t=308s)** — And on a rare occasion, you'll see maybe the bottom numbers start coming down,
- **[05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7wgLehFAbc&t=312s)** — but the top number might not come down.
- **[05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7wgLehFAbc&t=314s)** — The top number is primarily a problem with the sympathetic nervous system.
- **[05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7wgLehFAbc&t=318s)** — So sometimes you need to focus more on your stress by getting enough sleep, doing long walks,
- **[05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7wgLehFAbc&t=324s)** — sometimes to take ashwagandha or maybe even more magnesium before bed.
- **[05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7wgLehFAbc&t=328s)** — I've just given you a really powerful solution for hypertension.
- **[05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7wgLehFAbc&t=333s)** — You have to try it. Go ahead and then comment down below in the comments.
- **[05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7wgLehFAbc&t=337s)** — And thanks for watching.

- **[00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQC5mxxgEF4&t=0s)** — How not sleeping is actually killing you slowly. Out of all the things you can do to create health,
- **[00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQC5mxxgEF4&t=6s)** — sleep is near the top of the list. Let's say you're not getting at least six hours of sleep
- **[00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQC5mxxgEF4&t=12s)** — consistently. Your risk of premature death increases by 30%. Cancer risk increases by 40%.
- **[00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQC5mxxgEF4&t=19s)** — Increased risk of diabetes by 50%. Increasing your risk of dementia problems like Alzheimer's.
- **[00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQC5mxxgEF4&t=26s)** — There's a huge percentage of Alzheimer's patients that just don't sleep. And also just getting one
- **[00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQC5mxxgEF4&t=31s)** — hour or four hours of sleep will literally shut down your immune system by 70%. Why do we really
- **[00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQC5mxxgEF4&t=38s)** — need sleep? One of the reasons is that sleep is the best way to clean your brain. There's a
- **[00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQC5mxxgEF4&t=44s)** — certain effect that sleep does to your brain. It acts like a dishwasher. It's cleaning the
- **[00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQC5mxxgEF4&t=49s)** — brain of damaged proteins. In sleep, you're actually cleaning those proteins out of the
- **[00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQC5mxxgEF4&t=54s)** — brain. But only if you're actually getting real sleep. When you take a sleep medication,
- **[00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQC5mxxgEF4&t=59s)** — it might create some type of sedation, but you're not getting the quality of sleep.
- **[01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQC5mxxgEF4&t=63s)** — The other thing that's really important to know is what alcohol does to your sleep. This is
- **[01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQC5mxxgEF4&t=68s)** — why when people drink alcohol just a little bit, they snore more. They have more sleep
- **[01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQC5mxxgEF4&t=72s)** — apnea. They're tossing and turning more. One of the main purposes of sleeping is cleaning
- **[01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQC5mxxgEF4&t=77s)** — out the brain. The second one is repairing and restoration of the entire body, including your
- **[01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQC5mxxgEF4&t=82s)** — system. This is why when we don't get enough sleep, our immune system just shuts down.
- **[01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQC5mxxgEF4&t=87s)** — And then things start happening in a negative way. Our brain becomes more vulnerable to
- **[01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQC5mxxgEF4&t=92s)** — infections. Let's first start with the REM sleep. REM sleep happens in several stages, more
- **[01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQC5mxxgEF4&t=98s)** — in the second half of sleep. The brain activity is very similar to when you're awake. You have
- **[01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQC5mxxgEF4&t=104s)** — muscle paralysis, but you can have very vivid dreams that you remember. This part of the
- **[01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQC5mxxgEF4&t=112s)** — certain parts of the brain involve in creativity, memories, problem solving activities. This is why
- **[01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQC5mxxgEF4&t=119s)** — a lot of discoveries are related to this stage of sleeping because people will get these great
- **[02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQC5mxxgEF4&t=126s)** — ideas from a dream. REM sleep is also involved in improving more social interactions with
- **[02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQC5mxxgEF4&t=132s)** — people, more emotional stability, a better mood through the day, and having more empathy with
- **[02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQC5mxxgEF4&t=139s)** — Now let's get into the other phase of sleep called the non-REM sleep. This is the deep sleep.
- **[02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQC5mxxgEF4&t=146s)** — Most of the repair happens in this delta wave sleep. There's a cleaning up of unnecessary
- **[02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQC5mxxgEF4&t=151s)** — connections in the brain in this phase. It's very similar to when you're working in the
- **[02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQC5mxxgEF4&t=156s)** — garden with your tomato plants where you're trimming them down because they're just growing
- **[02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQC5mxxgEF4&t=160s)** — too much and you need to trim them up so other things can grow better. The problem is,
- **[02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQC5mxxgEF4&t=165s)** — with age, the deep delta wave sleep becomes diminished to the point where you reach 60 years
- **[02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQC5mxxgEF4&t=172s)** — old. You have like 90% less of this non-REM delta wave sleep. When you're 18, you don't
- **[02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQC5mxxgEF4&t=179s)** — have a problem with this. You probably sleep like a rock and everything is fine.
- **[03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQC5mxxgEF4&t=182s)** — In this delta wave sleep, you have fat burning, you have cell regeneration,
- **[03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQC5mxxgEF4&t=186s)** — repair going on, and this is where your body can fight infection the most too.
- **[03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQC5mxxgEF4&t=190s)** — There are certain things that will just kill the delta wave sleep. Alcohol is at the top of the
- **[03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQC5mxxgEF4&t=196s)** — list. Now let's get into what to do to really optimize your sleep. I've had years of waking up
- **[03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQC5mxxgEF4&t=202s)** — feeling so tired I couldn't even think mentally. It was like a helmet over my head.
- **[03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQC5mxxgEF4&t=208s)** — And of course, I did everything wrong. Eating a lot of Ben and Jerry's and trying to
- **[03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQC5mxxgEF4&t=211s)** — induce a deeper sleep. It never really worked. I tried alcohol. That didn't work. It actually
- **[03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQC5mxxgEF4&t=216s)** — made me worse. Never drive if you have not slept. Over 100,000 accidents occur every
- **[03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQC5mxxgEF4&t=223s)** — single year in the United States because they're not sleeping and they're drowsy through the day.
- **[03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQC5mxxgEF4&t=229s)** — And some of these are fatal car accidents. Let's go through the list of things that you
- **[03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQC5mxxgEF4&t=234s)** — can do to improve your sleep. Avoiding alcohol. Instead, use kombucha tea. It
- **[03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQC5mxxgEF4&t=238s)** — gives a similar effect. It'll make you feel calm. It'll give you the same texture as
- **[04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQC5mxxgEF4&t=243s)** — Regular aerobic exercise. Whether it's going to be on the treadmill or going for long walks,
- **[04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQC5mxxgEF4&t=247s)** — you're going to reduce a lot of stress. In the wintertime when it's really cold and I
- **[04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQC5mxxgEF4&t=251s)** — don't go outside much, I don't sleep as well. Next thing is to avoid eating too late at night
- **[04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQC5mxxgEF4&t=256s)** — and definitely eating large meals at night where you just go to bed when you're stuffed.
- **[04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQC5mxxgEF4&t=259s)** — That'll keep you up. If you're doing intermittent fasting, take two of those meals
- **[04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQC5mxxgEF4&t=263s)** — and have them more on the early part of the day. That way you will sleep better.
- **[04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQC5mxxgEF4&t=267s)** — Eating late at night. I don't need all that energy right before bed. And especially if
- **[04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQC5mxxgEF4&t=272s)** — you're eating too much protein, that can keep you up. I remember growing up and we did a lot of
- **[04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQC5mxxgEF4&t=276s)** — snacking and I used to work at a theater and I was the person who made the popcorn. I would
- **[04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQC5mxxgEF4&t=280s)** — bring home a garbage bag full of popcorn on a regular basis and we would all just eat mindless.
- **[04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQC5mxxgEF4&t=286s)** — It's very important to have your room be slightly cooler. I like to use a sheet,
- **[04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQC5mxxgEF4&t=291s)** — not a blanket when I sleep. I like to crack the window open. Also, it has to be dark.
- **[04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQC5mxxgEF4&t=296s)** — The other thing about sleep is making sure you don't do too much caffeine,
- **[05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQC5mxxgEF4&t=301s)** — tea, coffee, and chocolate. I just have one small cup of coffee in the morning. When I do
- **[05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQC5mxxgEF4&t=307s)** — more than that, it does affect my sleep because it takes a period of time for your liver to get
- **[05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQC5mxxgEF4&t=312s)** — rid of this caffeine. If you have too much, it can prevent that delta wave sleep. Too much
- **[05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQC5mxxgEF4&t=317s)** — blue light from the cell phone or your computer. You can get these blue blockers
- **[05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQC5mxxgEF4&t=323s)** — wear them if you're watching TV. Try to at least a couple hours before bed,
- **[05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQC5mxxgEF4&t=328s)** — turn off the lights, kind of keep it dim so it's not so bright, especially the blue lights.
- **[05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQC5mxxgEF4&t=333s)** — You don't want that. If you just filter the blue light, you'll retain more melatonin.
- **[05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQC5mxxgEF4&t=338s)** — Melatonin helps induce the sleepiness. Getting enough sun during the day can definitely help
- **[05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQC5mxxgEF4&t=343s)** — you sleep at night for various reasons. Of course, the vitamin D. 50% of the sun is
- **[05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQC5mxxgEF4&t=349s)** — an infrared. An infrared can increase melatonin in all of your cells and also any other type of
- **[05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQC5mxxgEF4&t=355s)** — orange or yellow flame, whether a a bonfire, a fireplace, candles. You can get more infrared.
- **[06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQC5mxxgEF4&t=361s)** — The other thing is when you go to bed, let's say for example, that at 8 30, you're like
- **[06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQC5mxxgEF4&t=366s)** — really tired. Just go to bed. Don't go to bed by the clock. Go to bed when you're tired.
- **[06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQC5mxxgEF4&t=371s)** — Because if you push through that tiredness and all of a sudden you wake up, now it's
- **[06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQC5mxxgEF4&t=377s)** — going to take you longer to go to bed because everything works on a wave. And sometimes these
- **[06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQC5mxxgEF4&t=382s)** — waves are 90 minute cycles. The other thing is the movies that you watch before bed. If I'm
- **[06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQC5mxxgEF4&t=387s)** — watching anything action, it's going to take a long time to go to bed. I'm not tired. I would
- **[06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQC5mxxgEF4&t=392s)** — watch even a Hallmark movie because it just literally puts me to sleep. I know some people
- **[06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQC5mxxgEF4&t=396s)** — in different social situations around family and things and holidays, there's always going
- **[06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQC5mxxgEF4&t=400s)** — to be some snacks involved. You're going to have blood sugar issues. You probably would be
- **[06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQC5mxxgEF4&t=405s)** — off doing some type of berries or fruit, then popcorn, starch, things like that. Even like
- **[06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQC5mxxgEF4&t=412s)** — when you do nuts before bed, you're going to feel a lot of bloating around your gallbladder.
- **[06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQC5mxxgEF4&t=417s)** — And that can definitely keep you up. As far as nutrients go, the three most important
- **[07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQC5mxxgEF4&t=422s)** — magnesium, vitamin D, and zinc. Magnesium is involved in the contraction and relaxation of
- **[07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQC5mxxgEF4&t=428s)** — muscles. Your muscles will be less tense. Magnesium is necessary for producing energy.
- **[07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQC5mxxgEF4&t=434s)** — You need energy to actually go to sleep. Some people are too tired to go to sleep. The type
- **[07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQC5mxxgEF4&t=438s)** — of magnesium you want is magnesium glycinate. The time to take that would be in the evenings.
- **[07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQC5mxxgEF4&t=443s)** — It actually can help you increase melatonin. Then we get to vitamin D. Vitamin D is needed
- **[07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQC5mxxgEF4&t=449s)** — to decrease inflammation in the body, especially in your lower back. It also helps
- **[07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQC5mxxgEF4&t=454s)** — you make melatonin. Vitamin D will increase the duration of sleep. What about zinc? Zinc is
- **[07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQC5mxxgEF4&t=464s)** — important. It will help you increase your oxygen and serotonin. All these key neurotransmitters
- **[07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQC5mxxgEF4&t=466s)** — and improve your overall repair of the body. But there's one more thing that I'm going to
- **[07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQC5mxxgEF4&t=472s)** — highly suggest that you do. Introduce a probiotic in the form of something that you
- **[07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQC5mxxgEF4&t=478s)** — can culture and make called El-Ru-Toray. Making it yourself with a yogurt maker. El-Ru-Toray
- **[08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQC5mxxgEF4&t=484s)** — is absent in 96% of the population. And it is the microbe that can help increase your
- **[08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQC5mxxgEF4&t=491s)** — oxygen and serotonin. This is why it's so important in sleep. If you're not consuming
- **[08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQC5mxxgEF4&t=498s)** — enough salt, you may find your sleep is going to be off. You need sodium to help you sleep.
- **[08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQC5mxxgEF4&t=504s)** — Try to have a little more salt during the day or even maybe in the later part of the day.
- **[08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQC5mxxgEF4&t=509s)** — Take a fourth of a teaspoon of salt, mix in some water, drink it down and just see if
- **[08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQC5mxxgEF4&t=514s)** — you don't sleep better. The bottom line is if you want to live longer, but not just live
- **[08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQC5mxxgEF4&t=517s)** — longer, live a quality of life, focus on sleep. I just gave you a road map on all the things that
- **[08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQC5mxxgEF4&t=524s)** — you can do right now to fix your sleep. And if you wanted to see that video related to
- **[08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQC5mxxgEF4&t=528s)** — building up that microbe that can help you sleep El-Ru-Toray, you should watch it. It's
- **[08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQC5mxxgEF4&t=532s)** — right here.

- **[00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KHTDAnsSO5k&t=0s)** — Let's talk about a natural antibiotic drink that you can make at home that is really powerful, non-toxic,
- **[00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KHTDAnsSO5k&t=7s)** — and you want to take this at the first sign of a cold or the flu.
- **[00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KHTDAnsSO5k&t=11s)** — But let's first step back for a moment and just take a look at the big picture.
- **[00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KHTDAnsSO5k&t=14s)** — A couple very important things about antibiotics.
- **[00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KHTDAnsSO5k&t=17s)** — Number one, they only kill bacteria. They do not kill viruses.
- **[00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KHTDAnsSO5k&t=22s)** — So if you have a viral infection, it's not going to work.
- **[00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KHTDAnsSO5k&t=25s)** — The problem with that is there is a big over-prescription of antibiotics, especially in the US.
- **[00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KHTDAnsSO5k&t=33s)** — But when you take an antibiotic that you don't need over time, it can start building up this resistance.
- **[00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KHTDAnsSO5k&t=39s)** — So the antibiotic kills a good portion of the good microbes,
- **[00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KHTDAnsSO5k&t=44s)** — but the ones that don't die become stronger. They become more resistant.
- **[00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KHTDAnsSO5k&t=49s)** — They start becoming pathogenic.
- **[00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KHTDAnsSO5k&t=52s)** — So now the next time you take an antibiotic, it doesn't work anymore.
- **[00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KHTDAnsSO5k&t=56s)** — And realize this too. In your microbes, if you're only going to kill the antibiotic off
- **[01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KHTDAnsSO5k&t=61s)** — and you're not going to kill the candida or the yeast or other microbes that are in your
- **[01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KHTDAnsSO5k&t=67s)** — microbiome, now we just threw things off.
- **[01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KHTDAnsSO5k&t=71s)** — So in other words, these bacteria were there to keep other things in check,
- **[01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KHTDAnsSO5k&t=76s)** — like the yeast and the candida.
- **[01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KHTDAnsSO5k&t=79s)** — This is why one of the big side effects of an antibiotic is an overgrowth of candida or yeast.
- **[01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KHTDAnsSO5k&t=86s)** — There's antibiotics that are not as strong. They kind of slow down the growth of microbial reproduction.
- **[01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KHTDAnsSO5k&t=94s)** — Those are usually like penicillin or tetracycline.
- **[01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KHTDAnsSO5k&t=98s)** — Now other types of antibiotics like Cipro or Levoquin, those are more powerful.
- **[01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KHTDAnsSO5k&t=104s)** — They have like a black box warning on them because they create side effects.
- **[01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KHTDAnsSO5k&t=108s)** — Like they can rupture your tendon. Tendonitis? Yeah, not good.
- **[01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KHTDAnsSO5k&t=113s)** — And if you ever have to take those antibiotics, always make sure you take
- **[01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KHTDAnsSO5k&t=118s)** — three things with them. Magnesium, also vitamin E, and probiotics.
- **[02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KHTDAnsSO5k&t=125s)** — But for any antibiotics that you take from the doctor, make sure you always
- **[02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KHTDAnsSO5k&t=128s)** — take a probiotic at the same time.
- **[02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KHTDAnsSO5k&t=131s)** — Antibiotics have been around for a very, very long time, but they weren't necessarily
- **[02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KHTDAnsSO5k&t=135s)** — called antibiotics back then. They were just taken by some bit of wisdom.
- **[02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KHTDAnsSO5k&t=140s)** — I mean even like a thousand years ago they found in this Nubian mummy
- **[02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KHTDAnsSO5k&t=144s)** — significant amounts of tetracycline. Where did that come from?
- **[02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KHTDAnsSO5k&t=149s)** — Antibiotics naturally come from molds and other microorganisms in the soil.
- **[02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KHTDAnsSO5k&t=155s)** — I mean even like there's antibiotics in like the mold and bread.
- **[02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KHTDAnsSO5k&t=158s)** — So I think there's a lot of wisdom in the past as far as us taking
- **[02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KHTDAnsSO5k&t=162s)** — natural remedies for various things. So who knows how that culture got that
- **[02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KHTDAnsSO5k&t=168s)** — tetracycline. But you know it's been there for a thousand years.
- **[02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KHTDAnsSO5k&t=172s)** — Now the other important thing to know about antibiotics is that after taking them,
- **[02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KHTDAnsSO5k&t=176s)** — it could take weeks to years before you get back these original microbes.
- **[03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KHTDAnsSO5k&t=183s)** — I believe 80% of your immune system is your microbiome.
- **[03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KHTDAnsSO5k&t=187s)** — But what I'm going to recommend in this video is to tap into and borrow from
- **[03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KHTDAnsSO5k&t=193s)** — herbs the natural antibiotic chemicals that these plants have developed over eons.
- **[03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KHTDAnsSO5k&t=201s)** — You can actually use them like anti-inflammatory effects,
- **[03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KHTDAnsSO5k&t=204s)** — anti-microbial effects, anti-diabetic effects, anti-cancer effects.
- **[03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KHTDAnsSO5k&t=209s)** — I mean even like garlic for example has like 33 different sulfur antibiotic chemicals.
- **[03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KHTDAnsSO5k&t=215s)** — Now if you compare that to like penicillin which only has one,
- **[03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KHTDAnsSO5k&t=220s)** — you can see very quickly that your microbiome it's going to be easy for them to wipe out
- **[03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KHTDAnsSO5k&t=224s)** — that one antibiotic. It's going to be more difficult to wipe out the complex
- **[03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KHTDAnsSO5k&t=229s)** — group of antibiotics in garlic. In fact it's not going to happen.
- **[03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KHTDAnsSO5k&t=233s)** — Right now they're actually testing and researching using some of these
- **[03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KHTDAnsSO5k&t=237s)** — natural antibiotics that don't create this resistance to microbes
- **[04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KHTDAnsSO5k&t=241s)** — on bacteria that have resistance to you know antibiotics.
- **[04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KHTDAnsSO5k&t=245s)** — So we're borrowing these complex chemicals that have virtually no side effects and we're
- **[04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KHTDAnsSO5k&t=250s)** — going to use them to our advantage. Two quick points before I dive into the actual recipe.
- **[04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KHTDAnsSO5k&t=256s)** — Number one, if you get a fever don't try to automatically suppress the fever because
- **[04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KHTDAnsSO5k&t=261s)** — you're going to increase the duration of the infection.
- **[04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KHTDAnsSO5k&t=265s)** — A better solution would be to dress up really warm bundle up and have all these blankets on
- **[04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KHTDAnsSO5k&t=270s)** — you when you're in bed after maybe you took a hot shower and just start sweating to
- **[04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KHTDAnsSO5k&t=275s)** — increase the temperature to cook off these microbes both bacteria and viruses.
- **[04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KHTDAnsSO5k&t=281s)** — The second thing is stress. Stress, cortisol, paralyzes the immune system.
- **[04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KHTDAnsSO5k&t=288s)** — Your white blood cells go down. They become suppressed.
- **[04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KHTDAnsSO5k&t=291s)** — So I've noticed this in practice with virtually almost 100% of the
- **[04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KHTDAnsSO5k&t=296s)** — people coming in that had an infection. They always had a stress event that occurred
- **[05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KHTDAnsSO5k&t=302s)** — before that made them susceptible to getting the infection. So just realize that and do what
- **[05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KHTDAnsSO5k&t=308s)** — you can to keep that stress at a minimum especially if you're getting run down.
- **[05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KHTDAnsSO5k&t=313s)** — So this particular drink should be taken at the first sign of a cough. The first sign of a
- **[05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KHTDAnsSO5k&t=319s)** — you start sneezing excessively or like a tickle in your throat. Start this because you
- **[05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KHTDAnsSO5k&t=324s)** — can actually stop it in its tracks so you don't have to go through like 10 days of
- **[05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KHTDAnsSO5k&t=329s)** — So the first thing is garlic. You're going to take three cloves of garlic.
- **[05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KHTDAnsSO5k&t=334s)** — Okay, you're going to put those in the blender. Garlic has like I said before 33
- **[05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KHTDAnsSO5k&t=337s)** — different sulfur compounds that have anti-microbial properties. The cool thing
- **[05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KHTDAnsSO5k&t=343s)** — about garlic it's very anti-viral. Then we're going to use echinacea. The cool
- **[05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KHTDAnsSO5k&t=347s)** — thing about echinacea is that it works really good to stop the start of an infection.
- **[05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KHTDAnsSO5k&t=354s)** — And it's really good for strep and staph and sore throat stuff and other pathogens as well.
- **[06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KHTDAnsSO5k&t=361s)** — And you want to consume a good amount of it. So I'm going to recommend in this one 16
- **[06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KHTDAnsSO5k&t=366s)** — ounce drink using 90 drops. Okay, now some people just like use 30 drops in some water
- **[06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KHTDAnsSO5k&t=373s)** — every hour. 90 is not excessive. So we're going to take these 90 drops,
- **[06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KHTDAnsSO5k&t=378s)** — put it into the blender. And the cool thing about echinacea it'll kind of numb your
- **[06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KHTDAnsSO5k&t=382s)** — throat if you have a sore throat. The next thing is you're going to throw a whole
- **[06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KHTDAnsSO5k&t=385s)** — organic lemon in it. Okay, don't just use the juice. Don't use lemon juice. Use the whole
- **[06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KHTDAnsSO5k&t=391s)** — lemon. What's in a lemon? Vitamin C. There's some other things in the lemon too. The lemon
- **[06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KHTDAnsSO5k&t=396s)** — peel. You have all these essential oils that have anti-microbial properties. There's
- **[06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KHTDAnsSO5k&t=402s)** — anti-microbial properties in the seeds. So you're going to blend all that and you're
- **[06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KHTDAnsSO5k&t=406s)** — going to consume it. Now we're going to add one tablespoon of apple cider vinegar. I
- **[06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KHTDAnsSO5k&t=412s)** — like the Braggs because Fairchild's is more concentrated. The Braggs adds water to dilute
- **[06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KHTDAnsSO5k&t=417s)** — it. Anyway, you're going to take this apple cider vinegar. You're going to put a tablespoon
- **[07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KHTDAnsSO5k&t=421s)** — in there. And the apple cider vinegar is going to act as an acid to stimulate something
- **[07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KHTDAnsSO5k&t=426s)** — called the phagocytosis, which is the immune system's cleaning action of certain cells.
- **[07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KHTDAnsSO5k&t=433s)** — It's going to stimulate those, get those guys in action and start cleaning mucus and
- **[07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KHTDAnsSO5k&t=439s)** — things involved, especially pathogens. Then we're going to add one tablespoon of raw honey.
- **[07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KHTDAnsSO5k&t=446s)** — You can also use manuka honey. So with the raw honey, you're going to have all these enzymes.
- **[07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KHTDAnsSO5k&t=451s)** — You're going to have these plant-based chemicals from a wide range of flowers. I mean,
- **[07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KHTDAnsSO5k&t=458s)** — if you think about it, raw honey was the first antibiotic. It has antibiotic properties
- **[07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KHTDAnsSO5k&t=464s)** — unless you heat it and pasteurize it. There's some really interesting things in raw honey. You
- **[07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KHTDAnsSO5k&t=468s)** — have hydrogen peroxide, which can act as an antiseptic. And the pH of it is slightly lower,
- **[07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KHTDAnsSO5k&t=474s)** — so it's kind of acidic. Then you're going to add 16 ounces of water. You're going to blend
- **[07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KHTDAnsSO5k&t=478s)** — it up for about 45 seconds. And you're going to drink one-third of that and then put the
- **[08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KHTDAnsSO5k&t=484s)** — rest in the refrigerator and then wait for several hours and then do the next dosage.
- **[08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KHTDAnsSO5k&t=489s)** — You're going to take one-third three times in one day. And then after the second dosage,
- **[08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KHTDAnsSO5k&t=494s)** — you'll take the last a little bit later in the evening. Now, what you should notice is a
- **[08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KHTDAnsSO5k&t=498s)** — diminishing of the symptoms. You should feel better. You should sleep better. You may want
- **[08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KHTDAnsSO5k&t=503s)** — to do this a second day or a third day. And if you're in the middle of an infection,
- **[08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KHTDAnsSO5k&t=507s)** — I would recommend to do this throughout the entire infection because it will actually speed
- **[08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KHTDAnsSO5k&t=511s)** — up the process of you recovering. Do not forget to take 50,000 IUs of vitamin D3.
- **[08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KHTDAnsSO5k&t=519s)** — I've kind of a quick boost to your immune system because vitamin D3 is awesome for the immune
- **[08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KHTDAnsSO5k&t=525s)** — system. Every part of your immune system needs vitamin D3. I would also add some zinc in there,
- **[08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KHTDAnsSO5k&t=530s)** — maybe 100 to 150 milligrams, to get your system all geared up to fight off this thing
- **[08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KHTDAnsSO5k&t=536s)** — a little bit better. And so just give yourself time to allow yourself to go through this cycle.
- **[09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KHTDAnsSO5k&t=540s)** — And if you do these things, it'll be faster than if you didn't. Now, if you haven't seen
- **[09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KHTDAnsSO5k&t=545s)** — my other really popular video on the antibiotic drink, I put that up right here. Check it out.

- **[00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRtkgrBHySQ&t=0s)** — Let's talk about enzymes. What would be the number one symptom that you would get if you were
- **[00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRtkgrBHySQ&t=5s)** — deficient in digestive enzymes? You're really dealing with about five different pieces of
- **[00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRtkgrBHySQ&t=11s)** — this puzzle that you have to understand. You have the stomach, you have the pancreas, you have the
- **[00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRtkgrBHySQ&t=16s)** — gallbladder. Even though the gallbladder does not produce enzymes, it's involved in enzymes. And
- **[00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRtkgrBHySQ&t=22s)** — you have the small intestine and you have the large intestine. So let's start with the stomach.
- **[00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRtkgrBHySQ&t=26s)** — What enzymes does the stomach produce? Well, primarily one called pepsin. And pepsin has
- **[00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRtkgrBHySQ&t=34s)** — everything to do with digesting protein. But the stomach also makes another enzyme called lipase,
- **[00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRtkgrBHySQ&t=40s)** — which can help you break down fats, but only like a backup if you don't make it from other organs.
- **[00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRtkgrBHySQ&t=46s)** — We'll talk about that. But pepsin is a very powerful protein enzyme that helps you break down
- **[00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRtkgrBHySQ&t=54s)** — protein. And pepsin is activated by hydrochloric acid in the stomach. And one of the big problems
- **[01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRtkgrBHySQ&t=60s)** — with you not having enough of this enzyme is really not having enough hydrochloric acid. But
- **[01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRtkgrBHySQ&t=67s)** — maybe you have acid in your stomach, but just the pH is not acid enough. And if you don't have
- **[01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRtkgrBHySQ&t=74s)** — the acid, you're not going to have the release of the enzyme. And you're going to experience
- **[01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRtkgrBHySQ&t=78s)** — various symptoms. The number one symptom you're going to experience is indigestion. And then
- **[01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRtkgrBHySQ&t=84s)** — you're going to get gas. Those are the two primary ones. But if you're not digesting protein,
- **[01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRtkgrBHySQ&t=91s)** — because you don't have enough acid, you're going to have all sorts of things that are
- **[01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRtkgrBHySQ&t=95s)** — going to occur lower in the digestive tract. For example, that acid is also necessary
- **[01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRtkgrBHySQ&t=103s)** — to activate the gallbladder to release bile. And if you don't have that activation, then
- **[01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRtkgrBHySQ&t=109s)** — have enough bile. And then we don't get the necessary detergent to help extract
- **[01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRtkgrBHySQ&t=115s)** — the fat-siable nutrients from the fat that you eat. And then we have undigested protein
- **[02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRtkgrBHySQ&t=120s)** — material that ends up in the small intestine. And now both the pancreas and the small
- **[02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRtkgrBHySQ&t=126s)** — intestine have to overcompensate. And they have to produce more enzymes to help break down
- **[02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRtkgrBHySQ&t=133s)** — this material. And many times this doesn't happen. So you end up with all sorts of
- **[02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRtkgrBHySQ&t=137s)** — issues with gas and bloating and constipation, all stemming from this lack of acid that's
- **[02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRtkgrBHySQ&t=144s)** — supposed to activate and release the enzyme. So typically in this situation, a lot of people
- **[02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRtkgrBHySQ&t=150s)** — take pepsin, but they don't take the hydrochloric acid that's necessary to activate it.
- **[02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRtkgrBHySQ&t=155s)** — So it doesn't really work that well. Why are we not producing hydrochloric acid? It could be
- **[02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRtkgrBHySQ&t=161s)** — you're just getting older because as we age, we don't produce enough hydrochloric acid. It
- **[02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRtkgrBHySQ&t=165s)** — could be because you're taking antacids. That's one big reason why you don't have enough acid,
- **[02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRtkgrBHySQ&t=169s)** — because maybe you have heartburn, which by the way, it comes from a lack of stomach acid in the
- **[02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRtkgrBHySQ&t=174s)** — first place. And that valve is not closing. So if the valve doesn't close, you get
- **[02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRtkgrBHySQ&t=178s)** — regurgitation, you get GERD, and you can have a lot of problems as an acid reflux,
- **[03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRtkgrBHySQ&t=185s)** — which could also be caused from a lack of vitamin B1, as well as a lack of vitamin D.
- **[03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRtkgrBHySQ&t=191s)** — So the first thing that I would do if I had indigestion
- **[03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRtkgrBHySQ&t=195s)** — gas is I would take betaine hydrochloride. Betaine hydrochloride is a really good,
- **[03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRtkgrBHySQ&t=201s)** — simple solution for activating this enzyme in the stomach to help you with protein digestion.
- **[03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRtkgrBHySQ&t=209s)** — All right, let's shift gears to the pancreas. Okay. So if you don't have the full function
- **[03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRtkgrBHySQ&t=216s)** — of the pancreas, you can have what's called pancreatic enzyme insufficiency. Okay. So you
- **[03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRtkgrBHySQ&t=221s)** — just don't make enough enzymes and the majority of enzymes for digestion actually come from that
- **[03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRtkgrBHySQ&t=227s)** — pancreas. So this is very, very important. The pancreas works like crazy to produce enough
- **[03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRtkgrBHySQ&t=232s)** — enzymes to help you digest food. So based on what you're chewing, there's little signals get
- **[03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRtkgrBHySQ&t=237s)** — sent down to tell the pancreas to get ready to digest, whether it's fats, proteins,
- **[04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRtkgrBHySQ&t=241s)** — carbohydrates, or other things. And so the pancreas has to produce that in preparation for
- **[04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRtkgrBHySQ&t=246s)** — the food that's coming through. And then depending on how much acid you have in your
- **[04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRtkgrBHySQ&t=250s)** — stomach is whether you're going to release enough bile to help work to break down the fats small
- **[04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRtkgrBHySQ&t=257s)** — enough. So the enzymes, the lipase enzymes, the fat enzymes can act on this fat. You see,
- **[04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRtkgrBHySQ&t=265s)** — if you don't have enough bile to do the big work, then that lipase enzyme really is going
- **[04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRtkgrBHySQ&t=272s)** — to have a hard time breaking down that fat. And then you end up with undigested fat that
- **[04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRtkgrBHySQ&t=276s)** — goes through the small intestine into the large bowel. And then that symptom, which can come from
- **[04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRtkgrBHySQ&t=284s)** — a pancreas problem, is called steatorea, which is undigested fat. So you have this large
- **[04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRtkgrBHySQ&t=291s)** — volume of stool, very bad odor. Sometimes it's floating. Sometimes it leaves skid marks. The
- **[05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRtkgrBHySQ&t=307s)** — pancreatic enzymes or even a lack of bile. Maybe you don't have a gallbladder. Maybe you have a
- **[05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRtkgrBHySQ&t=314s)** — bile deficiency. Maybe you're just not producing enough bile. But if you're deficient in the
- **[05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRtkgrBHySQ&t=320s)** — enzymes coming out of the pancreas, you're going to have problems with the digestion of fat.
- **[05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRtkgrBHySQ&t=325s)** — You're going to have bloating. You're going to have abdominal pain. And you're going to have a
- **[05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRtkgrBHySQ&t=331s)** — lack of fat soluble vitamins like vitamin A, vitamin K, vitamin E, vitamin D. And you can
- **[05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRtkgrBHySQ&t=339s)** — have a lot of different symptoms from that. I almost forgot to mention if there's a problem
- **[05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRtkgrBHySQ&t=343s)** — in the stomach and you don't have enough hydrochloric acid, you can be deficient in
- **[05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRtkgrBHySQ&t=347s)** — amino acids. Okay. And that could be a big issue with building your muscle. And you may
- **[05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRtkgrBHySQ&t=353s)** — just start losing weight and you might feel weak. Now with the pancreas, one common cause
- **[06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRtkgrBHySQ&t=360s)** — of this enzyme deficiency is pancreatitis. So what could cause that? Well, there's some rare
- **[06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRtkgrBHySQ&t=367s)** — things like tumors, certain diseases like cystic fibrosis, which is a problem with certain
- **[06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRtkgrBHySQ&t=373s)** — fluids like digestive fluids or juices, like your mucus in your lung. But more commonly,
- **[06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRtkgrBHySQ&t=380s)** — okay, what can happen is you have either gallstones or gallbladder sludge. Okay. And this
- **[06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRtkgrBHySQ&t=390s)** — in the bile ducts, the bile duct as it comes out through the liver kind of branches over into the
- **[06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRtkgrBHySQ&t=396s)** — pancreas and the gallbladder. So if you have a stone or sludge in these ducts, it can back up
- **[06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRtkgrBHySQ&t=403s)** — not just the gallbladder, but the pancreas as well. And it can create all sorts of
- **[06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRtkgrBHySQ&t=408s)** — inflammation. And it's a much more common problem than other problems. And the solution
- **[06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRtkgrBHySQ&t=414s)** — is something called TUT cup, which is a type of bile salt that can just open up those ducts
- **[07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRtkgrBHySQ&t=420s)** — because it allows the sludge to open up and become thinned. Okay. And you can actually
- **[07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRtkgrBHySQ&t=425s)** — even help to reduce gallstones with that. And the very reason why you have a sludge in the
- **[07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRtkgrBHySQ&t=430s)** — first place is maybe you're on a low-fat diet. Maybe you don't have enough saturated
- **[07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRtkgrBHySQ&t=435s)** — fat in your diet that actually activates this whole thing. Maybe you're eating too many carbs,
- **[07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRtkgrBHySQ&t=439s)** — increasing your insulin. Maybe it's from too much stress or you're on steroids for some
- **[07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRtkgrBHySQ&t=444s)** — or you are on birth control pills because too much estrogen can create that problem.
- **[07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRtkgrBHySQ&t=450s)** — Now, another common problem with the pancreas is that let's say you have diabetes
- **[07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRtkgrBHySQ&t=454s)** — and you have chronic diabetes. And so you have a big problem with the beta cell
- **[07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRtkgrBHySQ&t=461s)** — of the pancreas. Well, the pancreas both produces hormones like insulin and another
- **[07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRtkgrBHySQ&t=468s)** — called glucagon, but it also half of it is all about enzymes. So being a diabetic can put a big
- **[07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRtkgrBHySQ&t=476s)** — strain on the digestive part of that pancreas. One of the best things to do if you know you
- **[08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRtkgrBHySQ&t=481s)** — have a pancreatic problem is to take pancreatic enzymes. Pancreatin is a group of
- **[08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRtkgrBHySQ&t=488s)** — pancreatic enzymes you can take in a supplement. And that can take a huge strain
- **[08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRtkgrBHySQ&t=493s)** — off your digestion and help you. And if you were to take that, I would also recommend you
- **[08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRtkgrBHySQ&t=498s)** — take betaine hydrochloride to have the complete package and probably wouldn't hurt to also take
- **[08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRtkgrBHySQ&t=504s)** — with that some ox bile. So let's now shift gears to the gallbladder. The gallbladder is
- **[08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRtkgrBHySQ&t=510s)** — also going to help you extract fat soluble nutrients because the bile that's made by the
- **[08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRtkgrBHySQ&t=516s)** — liver and stored in the gallbladder concentrates. So every time you eat, it's squeezed out and
- **[08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRtkgrBHySQ&t=522s)** — going to go into the small intestine and help as a part of this digestive synergy between the
- **[08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRtkgrBHySQ&t=529s)** — stuff that's coming out of the stomach into the small intestine and then the help from the
- **[08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRtkgrBHySQ&t=533s)** — pancreas. That lipase from the pancreas is like the icing on the cake. It helps to
- **[08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRtkgrBHySQ&t=538s)** — fully break down that fat so you have the complete digestion of fat. And even though the
- **[09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRtkgrBHySQ&t=544s)** — gallbladder doesn't produce enzymes, it really contributes to these other enzymes. And it's a
- **[09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRtkgrBHySQ&t=553s)** — lot of people don't have enough bile. Some common symptoms of that would be bloating,
- **[09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRtkgrBHySQ&t=560s)** — belching and burping. Not to mention a lack of fat soluble nutrients, vitamin A, D, E and K.
- **[09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRtkgrBHySQ&t=567s)** — But also you can notice pain in your right shoulder right through in here that goes up
- **[09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRtkgrBHySQ&t=572s)** — into the neck or that wraps around into like in the rhomboid area and a fullness underneath
- **[09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRtkgrBHySQ&t=578s)** — your right rib cage. Now let's move right down to the small intestine. 90% of all your digestion
- **[09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRtkgrBHySQ&t=585s)** — occurs in the small intestine. Your small intestine actually make enzymes as well.
- **[09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRtkgrBHySQ&t=591s)** — Normally you're not supposed to have a lot of bacteria in your small intestine compared to
- **[09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRtkgrBHySQ&t=598s)** — the large intestine. So primarily we want the help from the enzymes. And so depending on what's
- **[10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRtkgrBHySQ&t=604s)** — happening at the stomach level and the pancreatic level and the gallbladder is going to
- **[10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRtkgrBHySQ&t=611s)** — determine how hard that small intestine has to compensate or work or release these enzymes.
- **[10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRtkgrBHySQ&t=617s)** — So all these organs are working in synergy together. Now let's just for example say that
- **[10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRtkgrBHySQ&t=623s)** — you don't have enough strong stomach acid. Okay. And that's one of your problems.
- **[10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRtkgrBHySQ&t=629s)** — Well a lot of bacteria in the food can get through because now it can't be killed.
- **[10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRtkgrBHySQ&t=635s)** — That's one of the key functions of that acid to prevent microbes from going through. But now
- **[10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRtkgrBHySQ&t=641s)** — we get these microbes to go through there and they end up in a small intestine where they
- **[10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRtkgrBHySQ&t=645s)** — shouldn't be there. And also because we don't get the signaling from the gallbladder to
- **[10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRtkgrBHySQ&t=651s)** — release bile salts. So it's both the acid and the bile salts to act strongly on that
- **[10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRtkgrBHySQ&t=657s)** — intestine to ensure that there's not a lot of bacteria that grow in that small intestine
- **[11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRtkgrBHySQ&t=663s)** — too. And so now we have an increase of bacteria in the small intestine that can then
- **[11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRtkgrBHySQ&t=670s)** — reproduce and grow and develop into what's called small intestinal bacterial overgrowth.
- **[11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRtkgrBHySQ&t=679s)** — I mean one function of bile salts is to act as a detergent to kill off these microbes
- **[11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRtkgrBHySQ&t=684s)** — in your small intestine. And then when it gets all the way down to the last part of the small
- **[11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRtkgrBHySQ&t=688s)** — intestine, it gets reabsorbed and it starts over again. So it's a really important action
- **[11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRtkgrBHySQ&t=693s)** — to prevent SIBO. The same thing with the hydrochloric acid. So now we end up with the
- **[11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRtkgrBHySQ&t=699s)** — SIBO. What is the problem with SIBO? Small intestinal bacterial overgrowth. Wow. You have
- **[11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRtkgrBHySQ&t=705s)** — bloating, you have belching, you have abdominal pain. And now you also have competition from
- **[11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRtkgrBHySQ&t=712s)** — these microbes that are hungry and they're going to eat a lot of your nutrition from your food.
- **[11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRtkgrBHySQ&t=716s)** — So you're going to end up with all sorts of nutritional deficiencies, malnutrition,
- **[12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRtkgrBHySQ&t=720s)** — digestive issues, and the fiber that you eat is going to be fermented at the wrong place
- **[12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRtkgrBHySQ&t=728s)** — in the small intestine instead of the large intestine. So now we get worsening problems
- **[12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRtkgrBHySQ&t=734s)** — when you have your salads and you get worsening problems with gas going down the other end.
- **[12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRtkgrBHySQ&t=741s)** — And we get worsening problems if you take a probiotic because you're adding more bacteria.
- **[12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRtkgrBHySQ&t=747s)** — So it becomes a big issue. How can we solve that? Well, there are certain tests that you can do
- **[12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRtkgrBHySQ&t=753s)** — to identify if that's your problem. But the solution is to start taking
- **[12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRtkgrBHySQ&t=758s)** — the tain hydrochloride to fix the stomach. The solution is to start taking some ox bile
- **[12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRtkgrBHySQ&t=764s)** — to help with the gallbladder. Cut down the amount of fiber that you consume. In fact,
- **[12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRtkgrBHySQ&t=770s)** — would do carnivore for a while and also do routine intermittent fasting. And you can also
- **[12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRtkgrBHySQ&t=776s)** — do other things like you could take a natural antibiotic like garlic, for example. That would
- **[13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRtkgrBHySQ&t=780s)** — be something that can help kill off these microbes. It's not going to be as important
- **[13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRtkgrBHySQ&t=785s)** — as those two other actions. Now, what about the large intestine? Does your large intestine
- **[13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRtkgrBHySQ&t=790s)** — produce enzymes? And the answer is no, but the microbes, the flora, the microbiome,
- **[13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRtkgrBHySQ&t=797s)** — do produce a lot of different enzymes to help you with digesting a lot of things, especially
- **[13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRtkgrBHySQ&t=802s)** — things that you can't digest, like fiber. So they're working hard to digest this. And they
- **[13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRtkgrBHySQ&t=808s)** — also digest certain leftover sugars and even leftover proteins. If you don't have enough of
- **[13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRtkgrBHySQ&t=815s)** — the right microbes, the diversity, this is where you get diarrhea, constipation, and of course,
- **[13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRtkgrBHySQ&t=822s)** — fatty stool. That's something that floats. It has a very bad odor. And so the best solution would be
- **[13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRtkgrBHySQ&t=828s)** — to fortify the microbiome. If you don't have SIBO, you can feed a wide variety of different
- **[13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRtkgrBHySQ&t=835s)** — plant leaves or plants to help increase that diversity. You can also take a probiotic,
- **[14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRtkgrBHySQ&t=840s)** — which I would highly recommend, or consume fermented foods that have probiotics. Of course,
- **[14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRtkgrBHySQ&t=846s)** — only if you don't have SIBO. I hope that answers some of the questions on your digestive track.
- **[14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRtkgrBHySQ&t=854s)** — But this leads me to the next thing. What is the most underlying important thing you can do
- **[14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRtkgrBHySQ&t=860s)** — to prevent all of these issues? And for that answer, I put this video up on just
- **[14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRtkgrBHySQ&t=866s)** — implementing the right diet right here. Check it out.

- **[00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=350bk9Ph3ak&t=0s)** — Here it goes. Another lie we've been told about certain foods.
- **[00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=350bk9Ph3ak&t=3s)** — And this topic is on gluten-free. Anytime something says gluten-free,
- **[00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=350bk9Ph3ak&t=8s)** — it's perceived as being healthier, right? You got honey nut Cheerios, gluten-free,
- **[00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=350bk9Ph3ak&t=15s)** — frosted Cheerios, gluten-free. And the reason I want to do this video is I hear this all the
- **[00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=350bk9Ph3ak&t=19s)** — time. I'm on the gluten-free diet. I'm eating less gluten. But there's a couple things I want
- **[00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=350bk9Ph3ak&t=23s)** — to mention. Number one, what are they replacing that gluten with? Well, we have sugar,
- **[00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=350bk9Ph3ak&t=30s)** — cornstarch. This is a step they use in ironing to make your clothes very, very stiff. But would
- **[00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=350bk9Ph3ak&t=35s)** — you ever eat cornstarch by itself? No. So in the kind breakfast, we have brown rice flour,
- **[00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=350bk9Ph3ak&t=41s)** — cane syrup, 29 grams of carbohydrate per serving. There's a lot of carbohydrates in here. And if
- **[00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=350bk9Ph3ak&t=46s)** — you look at the fine print for this one, it contains bio-engineered food ingredients. That
- **[00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=350bk9Ph3ak&t=53s)** — is a nice way of saying it's GMO. So gluten is the only protein that humans cannot digest.
- **[01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=350bk9Ph3ak&t=60s)** — And over the years, we've added more and more gluten to the diet. It's created a lot of
- **[01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=350bk9Ph3ak&t=64s)** — problems with gut inflammation. My main point is that gluten-free is not any healthier at all.
- **[01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=350bk9Ph3ak&t=69s)** — They're still loaded with seed oils, sugar, and starches. And sometimes it's not even
- **[01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=350bk9Ph3ak&t=75s)** — cornstarch. It'll say foodstarch because then they can use other types of starches. We know
- **[01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=350bk9Ph3ak&t=83s)** — starches and sugars actually also destroy the gut. The good bacteria prefer fiber,
- **[01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=350bk9Ph3ak&t=88s)** — but the bad bacteria will thrive on refined sugars and starches. So when you're dumping
- **[01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=350bk9Ph3ak&t=94s)** — all this extra carbohydrate into the digestive system, you are creating an overgrowth of bad
- **[01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=350bk9Ph3ak&t=101s)** — bacteria. And when this bad bacteria breaks down and dies, a lot of times it releases a
- **[01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=350bk9Ph3ak&t=107s)** — byproduct. And this byproduct is very, very toxic. And this creates a whole chain reaction
- **[01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=350bk9Ph3ak&t=112s)** — of inflammation of the liver, of fatty liver. In fact, so many people have skin issues,
- **[01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=350bk9Ph3ak&t=118s)** — inflammation of the skin. It's called dermatitis. And so they use creams and lotions and potions
- **[02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=350bk9Ph3ak&t=123s)** — and all these other things, but they're not looking deep into the gut because there's a big
- **[02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=350bk9Ph3ak&t=128s)** — disconnect between what's going on in the gut and your skin. And if you have too much
- **[02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=350bk9Ph3ak&t=132s)** — bad bacteria in your gut, your skin's going to be terrible. It's going to have a lot of
- **[02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=350bk9Ph3ak&t=136s)** — issues. That's problem number one. The second thing I want to talk about is how do they remove
- **[02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=350bk9Ph3ak&t=140s)** — this gluten protein from the grain? Do they just add water to it and kind of let it just
- **[02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=350bk9Ph3ak&t=147s)** — dissolve? No, they add several chemicals, enzymes, acids to extract the protein
- **[02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=350bk9Ph3ak&t=154s)** — from the grain. And what are we left with? A more highly refined product. So if it was
- **[02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=350bk9Ph3ak&t=160s)** — refined before, now it's really refined. You also have to realize what starch is.
- **[02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=350bk9Ph3ak&t=164s)** — Starch is basically sugar. It's a chain of sugar molecules connected together. It will create more
- **[02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=350bk9Ph3ak&t=171s)** — of a blood sugar effect than actual sugar. So in your mind, if you think that starches are
- **[02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=350bk9Ph3ak&t=176s)** — healthier than sugars, no, starch is worse than sugar on the glycemic index because they spike
- **[03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=350bk9Ph3ak&t=183s)** — your blood sugars. So they have gluten-free cookies, gluten-free bread, gluten-free
- **[03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=350bk9Ph3ak&t=187s)** — crackers and granola bars. So just don't buy the concept that they're any healthier at all.
- **[03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=350bk9Ph3ak&t=191s)** — The other interesting thing about gluten-free products is it's just low in protein. Protein is
- **[03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=350bk9Ph3ak&t=197s)** — the thing that satisfies us. The problem is there's such low protein in this. We'll just
- **[03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=350bk9Ph3ak&t=202s)** — keep eating it and eating it because there's nothing to satisfy us. This creates overeating.
- **[03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=350bk9Ph3ak&t=206s)** — This creates cravings. Two of the common ingredients that they use in gluten-free
- **[03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=350bk9Ph3ak&t=211s)** — products would be rice flour and tapioca flour because both of those don't have gluten in it.
- **[03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=350bk9Ph3ak&t=217s)** — Let's just talk about rice flour. Rice has a unique ability to bind with arsenic in the soil.
- **[03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=350bk9Ph3ak&t=223s)** — It's a poison. So on top of all the carbohydrates and sugars, we have extra added
- **[03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=350bk9Ph3ak&t=228s)** — arsenic. Gluten-free was supposed to initially help us with digestive problems. It's going
- **[03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=350bk9Ph3ak&t=233s)** — to give us something called small intestinal bacterial overgrowth. These pathogens that are
- **[03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=350bk9Ph3ak&t=238s)** — growing in the small intestine compete with the good bacteria. They basically grab and eat
- **[04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=350bk9Ph3ak&t=245s)** — up your vitamins and minerals. In their minds, a lot of times they think that fiber is going to
- **[04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=350bk9Ph3ak&t=250s)** — help them. The more fiber they consume, the worse that they get because they're going to get
- **[04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=350bk9Ph3ak&t=256s)** — fermentation that normally should be in the large intestine happening in the small intestine.
- **[04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=350bk9Ph3ak&t=261s)** — All that inflammation over a period of time, if they continue to do it, is going to create
- **[04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=350bk9Ph3ak&t=265s)** — a lot of inflammation, leaky gut. Whatever's going on in the gut is going to be happening
- **[04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=350bk9Ph3ak&t=269s)** — up here too. Mentally, you're going to be moody. You're going to have a lower emotion.
- **[04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=350bk9Ph3ak&t=274s)** — You might have anxiety. You might have depression. And all of that is coming from the gut. Now,
- **[04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=350bk9Ph3ak&t=280s)** — I've talked to a lot of patients who had SIBO in the past. And it's interesting because when
- **[04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=350bk9Ph3ak&t=285s)** — they get an antibiotic for maybe some other reason, they feel wonderful. It's the thing that
- **[04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=350bk9Ph3ak&t=292s)** — really solves their bloating. And so they might think that's a good thing. So they want
- **[04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=350bk9Ph3ak&t=296s)** — to get another antibiotic. But the reason why it's working, it's killing off bacteria,
- **[05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=350bk9Ph3ak&t=300s)** — but it's killing off the good and the bad. Certain types of other bacteria start to grow
- **[05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=350bk9Ph3ak&t=306s)** — in large amounts, especially yeast and especially candida. And this is why one of the side effects
- **[05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=350bk9Ph3ak&t=311s)** — from antibiotics is a candida infection, a yeast infection. Now we have nothing in there
- **[05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=350bk9Ph3ak&t=318s)** — to keep those bad guys in check. They get out of control. So a person normally will feel
- **[05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=350bk9Ph3ak&t=322s)** — better after the antibiotic, but then over time they get worse. And so they go on another
- **[05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=350bk9Ph3ak&t=326s)** — antibiotic, they feel better, and it gets worse to the point where these antibiotics
- **[05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=350bk9Ph3ak&t=330s)** — don't work anymore. These microbes have developed this resistance. And now the next
- **[05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=350bk9Ph3ak&t=336s)** — round of antibiotics don't work anymore because they have such an altered microbiome. They
- **[05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=350bk9Ph3ak&t=342s)** — no longer have the diversity of microbes. Now they have a hard time digesting anything. They
- **[05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=350bk9Ph3ak&t=347s)** — have certain allergies. It might develop an autoimmune disease. One way to develop an overgrowth
- **[05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=350bk9Ph3ak&t=353s)** — of unfriendly bacteria is to consume a lot of gluten-free ingredients. Another way is
- **[05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=350bk9Ph3ak&t=358s)** — to take antibiotics. The solution is if you see something that's gluten-free, read the actual
- **[06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=350bk9Ph3ak&t=364s)** — ingredients. And yes, you may need to avoid gluten, but don't get another product that has
- **[06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=350bk9Ph3ak&t=369s)** — even worse ingredients. I'd highly recommend taking all grains in general and all seed oils
- **[06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=350bk9Ph3ak&t=376s)** — and all sugars and put them way over here. Put them to the side. Start eating whole foods
- **[06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=350bk9Ph3ak&t=381s)** — like meats and vegetables. But if the fiber from the vegetables make things worse, where you feel
- **[06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=350bk9Ph3ak&t=387s)** — bloated, you may need to do a carnivore diet for a few months to get things back in check.
- **[06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=350bk9Ph3ak&t=392s)** — But here's the thing. When someone does a carnivore diet, they're eliminating a lot of
- **[06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=350bk9Ph3ak&t=396s)** — things that can create problems with the small intestine. So they're going to feel a lot
- **[06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=350bk9Ph3ak&t=401s)** — better. The question we still have is, can you do this long term? We don't know. Should
- **[06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=350bk9Ph3ak&t=406s)** — we go back to some fiber? And at what point? We don't know. But what we do know is there's
- **[06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=350bk9Ph3ak&t=411s)** — probably missing microbes that created the problem in the first place. The inability
- **[06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=350bk9Ph3ak&t=415s)** — to digest fiber, for example, because that's what microbes do. They help break down fiber.
- **[07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=350bk9Ph3ak&t=420s)** — We don't have the ability to break down fiber. If you have any problems with digesting fiber,
- **[07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=350bk9Ph3ak&t=425s)** — we know there's missing microbes probably from an antibiotic or it could be from just eating
- **[07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=350bk9Ph3ak&t=430s)** — this crap right here. In which case you have to put these microbes back into the gut. One
- **[07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=350bk9Ph3ak&t=436s)** — way to do it is to start consuming more fermented foods. Now this could be fermented dairy,
- **[07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=350bk9Ph3ak&t=443s)** — unless you're allergic to dairy, like raw cheese or kefir or yogurt, but also fermented
- **[07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=350bk9Ph3ak&t=450s)** — vegetables like sauerkraut, kimchi, pickled vegetables, pickles. All of those are excellent
- **[07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=350bk9Ph3ak&t=457s)** — because we're on a very important topic, digestion. I want to give you a complete knowledge
- **[07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=350bk9Ph3ak&t=463s)** — of how the digestive system works. And for that information, I want you to watch this

- **[00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_JrqyBwy_eo&t=0s)** — There are 11 common mistakes that a lot of people make when they take supplements.
- **[00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_JrqyBwy_eo&t=5s)** — Now the first thing I want to mention is that I hear this a lot.
- **[00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_JrqyBwy_eo&t=8s)** — We don't really need to take supplements because we can get all we need from our diet.
- **[00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_JrqyBwy_eo&t=14s)** — And it's almost impossible to get vitamin D from food.
- **[00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_JrqyBwy_eo&t=17s)** — So it's not actually very easy to get all of our nutrients even if we ate a really good diet.
- **[00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_JrqyBwy_eo&t=22s)** — Not to mention certain foods that the pletus of nutrients, especially if you're doing a lot of refined carbs.
- **[00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_JrqyBwy_eo&t=28s)** — Okay, number one, let's talk about timing.
- **[00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_JrqyBwy_eo&t=31s)** — Okay, during the day, when should you take your supplements?
- **[00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_JrqyBwy_eo&t=34s)** — Personally, I like to take almost all of my supplements in the morning
- **[00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_JrqyBwy_eo&t=37s)** — because I want all these cofactors to be available in the first part of the day when I need more energy.
- **[00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_JrqyBwy_eo&t=41s)** — In fact, I switched my intermittent fasting pattern where I'm doing two meals.
- **[00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_JrqyBwy_eo&t=46s)** — One is breakfast and then a late lunch and then I don't have a dinner.
- **[00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_JrqyBwy_eo&t=50s)** — That seems to work.
- **[00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_JrqyBwy_eo&t=51s)** — And the reason I did that is because it gives me more energy during the day rather than doing fasting.
- **[00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_JrqyBwy_eo&t=57s)** — And then eating late at night when I don't need the energy before I go to bed.
- **[01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_JrqyBwy_eo&t=62s)** — Now, as far as taking electrolytes right before bed, I don't really recommend it because
- **[01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_JrqyBwy_eo&t=67s)** — electrolytes can push fluid out of your body.
- **[01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_JrqyBwy_eo&t=71s)** — Now, as far as vitamin D goes, some people do better to take the vitamin D in the morning.
- **[01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_JrqyBwy_eo&t=77s)** — Some people do better right before bed. It tends to help them sleep better.
- **[01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_JrqyBwy_eo&t=80s)** — You can experiment with that.
- **[01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_JrqyBwy_eo&t=82s)** — The other thing I want to mention about the timing is that you don't want to take
- **[01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_JrqyBwy_eo&t=86s)** — any calcium supplements right before you eat because calcium neutralizes the stomach acid
- **[01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_JrqyBwy_eo&t=91s)** — and it's going to inhibit your digestion.
- **[01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_JrqyBwy_eo&t=95s)** — And if you're taking a fat-soluble vitamin like vitamin C or the B vitamins, you can take them anytime.
- **[01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_JrqyBwy_eo&t=100s)** — The next mistake I want to talk about is taking too many supplements at one time and trying to swallow them.
- **[01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_JrqyBwy_eo&t=106s)** — I personally use myself as a human guinea pig for a long time.
- **[01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_JrqyBwy_eo&t=109s)** — I've tried pretty much every single nutrient vitamin cleanse alternative program you can imagine.
- **[01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_JrqyBwy_eo&t=115s)** — And one time, long ago, I decided to do a gallbladder flush.
- **[02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_JrqyBwy_eo&t=122s)** — In this gallbladder flush, you take beetroot supplements and olive oil.
- **[02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_JrqyBwy_eo&t=127s)** — I took a hand of these beetroot supplements, put it in my mouth, and washed them down with 12 ounces of oil.
- **[02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_JrqyBwy_eo&t=135s)** — Big, big mistake. I should have used some water and I should have taken a little bit at a time
- **[02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_JrqyBwy_eo&t=141s)** — because those beet supplements got stuck in my esophagus.
- **[02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_JrqyBwy_eo&t=146s)** — And it was like I started getting chest pain. I thought it was going to die like a heart attack.
- **[02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_JrqyBwy_eo&t=150s)** — Oh my gosh, I'm going to die from taking supplements.
- **[02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_JrqyBwy_eo&t=154s)** — So I just kind of laid in a ball and just pushed through it and somehow I survived.
- **[02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_JrqyBwy_eo&t=158s)** — But I don't recommend that. That was very, very scary.
- **[02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_JrqyBwy_eo&t=160s)** — Some people do better just taking their supplements with a meal. It seems to go down easier.
- **[02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_JrqyBwy_eo&t=167s)** — Next mistake is this. If you're trying to solve a health problem, whatever it is,
- **[02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_JrqyBwy_eo&t=172s)** — and you introduce a lot of different supplements at one time, you're not going to know what worked.
- **[02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_JrqyBwy_eo&t=177s)** — So always introduce them one at a time, especially if you're trying to solve some health problem.
- **[03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_JrqyBwy_eo&t=182s)** — The next mistake is thinking these vitamins are going to work if your diet sucks.
- **[03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_JrqyBwy_eo&t=190s)** — I have a personal example of this.
- **[03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_JrqyBwy_eo&t=192s)** — Yes, I was eating too many carbs at one time, but I wasn't consuming enough protein, especially for breakfast.
- **[03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_JrqyBwy_eo&t=199s)** — And no matter how many vitamins I took, I was still tired.
- **[03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_JrqyBwy_eo&t=203s)** — What I really needed was protein. Once I had protein, I'm like, oh my gosh, everything works now.
- **[03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_JrqyBwy_eo&t=207s)** — But also if you're eating too many carbs and things like that, you're going to get a lot of bloating.
- **[03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_JrqyBwy_eo&t=211s)** — And I don't care how many vitamins you take for this or that. It's not going to create the effect.
- **[03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_JrqyBwy_eo&t=216s)** — Next mistake is going for the cheapest vitamin possible, especially these one a days.
- **[03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_JrqyBwy_eo&t=221s)** — If you read the label, which I have right here, I'm going to show you the first ingredient calcium carbonate,
- **[03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_JrqyBwy_eo&t=229s)** — which is the type of calcium and cement.
- **[03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_JrqyBwy_eo&t=231s)** — So they're putting the cheapest vitamins you could possibly imagine, mostly made from petroleum and chemicals.
- **[03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_JrqyBwy_eo&t=238s)** — A lot of the vitamin companies out there are owned by either chemical companies,
- **[04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_JrqyBwy_eo&t=244s)** — Big Pharma or some of the junk food brands.
- **[04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_JrqyBwy_eo&t=247s)** — What I'm observing is they're not going for quality ingredients.
- **[04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_JrqyBwy_eo&t=250s)** — They get the cheapest possible, especially when you get into antioxidants like beta carotene, for example,
- **[04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_JrqyBwy_eo&t=256s)** — and you're taking it synthetically. There's some side effects.
- **[04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_JrqyBwy_eo&t=259s)** — It shows that increases your risk for cancer.
- **[04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_JrqyBwy_eo&t=262s)** — Of course, they're not doing a comparison with that study and using antioxidants from actual food.
- **[04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_JrqyBwy_eo&t=268s)** — No, it's the synthetic version.
- **[04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_JrqyBwy_eo&t=269s)** — It's probably not the best way to do it.
- **[04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_JrqyBwy_eo&t=271s)** — And the other thing you'll notice with the synthetics is the RDAs are the same,
- **[04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_JrqyBwy_eo&t=274s)** — supplying 100%, 100%, 100%. In nature, you don't have that.
- **[04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_JrqyBwy_eo&t=280s)** — And of course, you have fillers, you have colorings.
- **[04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_JrqyBwy_eo&t=283s)** — And sometimes people think that there's no difference between vitamins.
- **[04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_JrqyBwy_eo&t=286s)** — The synthetics are the same as natural. Well, I don't think so.
- **[04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_JrqyBwy_eo&t=291s)** — Now, there are a couple vitamins that I think are fine to take synthetically.
- **[04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_JrqyBwy_eo&t=295s)** — One is niacin and then the other one is benfotamine.
- **[04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_JrqyBwy_eo&t=299s)** — But for some of the other vitamins, I would try to go more natural
- **[05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_JrqyBwy_eo&t=303s)** — or get the vitamins in the natural complex that nature has provided.
- **[05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_JrqyBwy_eo&t=308s)** — Now, let's talk about the mistake sometimes people make with supplements and drug interactions.
- **[05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_JrqyBwy_eo&t=314s)** — They're on a medication that's creating an effect.
- **[05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_JrqyBwy_eo&t=317s)** — And then they want to take a supplement that also creates the same effect.
- **[05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_JrqyBwy_eo&t=321s)** — Doctors don't like that because then that might make the problem worse.
- **[05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_JrqyBwy_eo&t=326s)** — So if you're taking a medication for high blood pressure,
- **[05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_JrqyBwy_eo&t=328s)** — and then you take a supplement to also help lower your high blood pressure
- **[05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_JrqyBwy_eo&t=332s)** — and you end up with low blood pressure, then that might be an issue.
- **[05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_JrqyBwy_eo&t=336s)** — So you need to check with your doctor so they can monitor that because
- **[05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_JrqyBwy_eo&t=339s)** — I mean, my thought is why not introduce something natural?
- **[05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_JrqyBwy_eo&t=343s)** — I'll give you an example. Let's say you're diabetic and you're taking metformin.
- **[05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_JrqyBwy_eo&t=346s)** — Well, Berberine also creates an effect very similar to metformin.
- **[05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_JrqyBwy_eo&t=350s)** — Why not work with the doctor to just take less of the metformin?
- **[05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_JrqyBwy_eo&t=354s)** — Because that could have some side effects.
- **[05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_JrqyBwy_eo&t=356s)** — One thing I want to say about antibiotics is that you should always take a probiotic
- **[06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_JrqyBwy_eo&t=362s)** — when you're taking an antibiotic so you can at least salvage the good bacteria.
- **[06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_JrqyBwy_eo&t=368s)** — But here's the thing. If you're on medication, let's say for example,
- **[06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_JrqyBwy_eo&t=371s)** — for high blood pressure and you're taking magnesium and all of a sudden
- **[06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_JrqyBwy_eo&t=374s)** — your blood pressure starts going too low. Is that really a bad thing?
- **[06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_JrqyBwy_eo&t=379s)** — Why not just get with the doctor to take less of that medication?
- **[06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_JrqyBwy_eo&t=382s)** — Because magnesium is such an important natural remedy for everything related to the
- **[06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_JrqyBwy_eo&t=386s)** — heart. One of the worst medications you can take for your liver,
- **[06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_JrqyBwy_eo&t=389s)** — which is over-the-counter, is Tylenol. You might want to try milk thistle,
- **[06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_JrqyBwy_eo&t=394s)** — an herbal supplement that can actually minimize the damage of your liver
- **[06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_JrqyBwy_eo&t=399s)** — from some of these other medications. Next mistake a lot of people make
- **[06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_JrqyBwy_eo&t=403s)** — with supplements is that there's certain vitamin or mineral interactions
- **[06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_JrqyBwy_eo&t=407s)** — that people need to know about. For example, if you're taking high doses of vitamin D3
- **[06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_JrqyBwy_eo&t=413s)** — without magnesium, this could be a problem. You need magnesium for vitamin D to do its job.
- **[07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_JrqyBwy_eo&t=421s)** — And without magnesium, vitamin D can't work. And also taking high levels of zinc
- **[07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_JrqyBwy_eo&t=426s)** — over a long period of time, you can end up with a copper deficiency.
- **[07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_JrqyBwy_eo&t=431s)** — So just realize that a lot of times these minerals go in pairs like sodium and potassium.
- **[07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_JrqyBwy_eo&t=437s)** — If you're consuming a lot of salt without potassium, that could be a problem.
- **[07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_JrqyBwy_eo&t=443s)** — This is why I don't recommend taking one mineral for a long period of time,
- **[07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_JrqyBwy_eo&t=446s)** — especially if you're doing high dosage. I would rather you take the one mineral
- **[07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_JrqyBwy_eo&t=450s)** — in a blend of other minerals or trace minerals just to make sure that you don't create another problem.
- **[07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_JrqyBwy_eo&t=456s)** — Alright, next point I want to bring up is taking advice from someone
- **[07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_JrqyBwy_eo&t=460s)** — that gives you an opinion about vitamins that's not really based on a good evaluation.
- **[07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_JrqyBwy_eo&t=466s)** — There's not enough time in school to really fully understand about chemistry.
- **[07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_JrqyBwy_eo&t=471s)** — All you have time to do is memorize things like this Krebs cycle,
- **[07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_JrqyBwy_eo&t=475s)** — pass the test and move on to the next subject.
- **[07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_JrqyBwy_eo&t=478s)** — So there's a big difference between learning and understanding and memorizing.
- **[08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_JrqyBwy_eo&t=482s)** — They're not the same thing. So you really want to get opinions from people
- **[08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_JrqyBwy_eo&t=485s)** — that have a lot of experience in the area of what you're trying to get an opinion on.
- **[08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_JrqyBwy_eo&t=490s)** — Like you wouldn't want to take marriage advice from someone that's never been married.
- **[08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_JrqyBwy_eo&t=494s)** — And one last point about this, I think it's really important.
- **[08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_JrqyBwy_eo&t=497s)** — A lot of the institutions and journals do not like to publish anything positive on vitamin D.
- **[08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_JrqyBwy_eo&t=504s)** — Now why would that be? Because it competes with the drug companies
- **[08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_JrqyBwy_eo&t=507s)** — and vitamin D is very inexpensive because you can get it from the sun.
- **[08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_JrqyBwy_eo&t=510s)** — Alright, next mistake I'm going to mention with supplements is not taking high enough doses.
- **[08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_JrqyBwy_eo&t=517s)** — There's two reasons why people take supplements.
- **[08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_JrqyBwy_eo&t=520s)** — One is to compensate for not having enough from their diet.
- **[08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_JrqyBwy_eo&t=524s)** — The other reason is to create a therapeutic effect.
- **[08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_JrqyBwy_eo&t=528s)** — And there's a lot of other reasons why high doses of certain vitamins are good.
- **[08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_JrqyBwy_eo&t=531s)** — There's actually quite a few genetic weaknesses that make it more difficult to absorb certain nutrients.
- **[08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_JrqyBwy_eo&t=538s)** — I recently had over 20 people get their DNA testing on vitamin D
- **[09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_JrqyBwy_eo&t=545s)** — and 100% of them had at least one genetic problem or weakness with either absorbing vitamin D or converting.
- **[09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_JrqyBwy_eo&t=554s)** — So the solution is just to take a little bit more.
- **[09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_JrqyBwy_eo&t=556s)** — Another common vitamin that I think people are not taking enough of is vitamin B1.
- **[09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_JrqyBwy_eo&t=562s)** — I mean the RDAs for vitamin B1 is ridiculous.
- **[09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_JrqyBwy_eo&t=566s)** — Ridiculous. It's not going to do anything.
- **[09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_JrqyBwy_eo&t=568s)** — Like they're 100 years old and they're just based on what you would need to prevent a deficiency.
- **[09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_JrqyBwy_eo&t=576s)** — They're not based on correcting something or to create a therapeutic benefit.
- **[09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_JrqyBwy_eo&t=582s)** — The other thing is if your stomach is not acid enough, it's too alkaline,
- **[09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_JrqyBwy_eo&t=587s)** — you're not going to be able to absorb the minerals.
- **[09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_JrqyBwy_eo&t=589s)** — You're not going to be able to break down B12 because you have to break down that protein that's connected to it.
- **[09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_JrqyBwy_eo&t=594s)** — In which case you would need to take, you know,
- **[09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_JrqyBwy_eo&t=597s)** — butane hydrochloride to acidify the stomach so you can absorb some of these nutrients.
- **[10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_JrqyBwy_eo&t=601s)** — All right. The next point I want to talk about is if you are a vegan, right?
- **[10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_JrqyBwy_eo&t=604s)** — You're not getting animal sources.
- **[10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_JrqyBwy_eo&t=607s)** — So you really want to make sure you take additional nutrients on top of your diet because you're going to be deficient.
- **[10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_JrqyBwy_eo&t=613s)** — You would need to take B12. You need D3, omega-3 fatty acids.
- **[10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_JrqyBwy_eo&t=618s)** — If you don't want to get it from fish sources, you can get it from algae, iron, zinc, iodine,
- **[10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_JrqyBwy_eo&t=624s)** — and calcium. Now let's get to the last one, dosing.
- **[10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_JrqyBwy_eo&t=628s)** — And when I'm talking about dosing, I'm talking about how many times a week do you need vitamin D?
- **[10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_JrqyBwy_eo&t=633s)** — This is so, so important simply because vitamin D is the most important vitamin because of
- **[10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_JrqyBwy_eo&t=639s)** — what happens when you're deficient.
- **[10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_JrqyBwy_eo&t=641s)** — The RDAs that they originally came up with, which is, you know, 600 IUs,
- **[10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_JrqyBwy_eo&t=646s)** — is sufficient, but there's another system that a lot of people do not know about.
- **[10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_JrqyBwy_eo&t=652s)** — And this system is called the paracrine-autocrine system.
- **[10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_JrqyBwy_eo&t=658s)** — So this system is mainly dependent on either the sun converting the cholesterol in your skin to vitamin D
- **[11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_JrqyBwy_eo&t=665s)** — or the vitamin D in your food or the vitamin D in your supplements.
- **[11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_JrqyBwy_eo&t=671s)** — And the half-life for that is like 24 hours.
- **[11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_JrqyBwy_eo&t=675s)** — So after 24 hours, it's pretty much gone.
- **[11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_JrqyBwy_eo&t=678s)** — So if you're trying to support your immune system, you need to be taking vitamin D every single day
- **[11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_JrqyBwy_eo&t=684s)** — or getting sun every single day, or it's very likely you're going to be deficient.
- **[11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_JrqyBwy_eo&t=688s)** — The amount that I would recommend as a maintenance would be no less than 10,000 IUs.
- **[11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_JrqyBwy_eo&t=693s)** — That's not unreasonable. It might sound like a lot. It's not.
- **[11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_JrqyBwy_eo&t=697s)** — But the dangers of having a vitamin D deficiency are much, much greater than having any excess.
- **[11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_JrqyBwy_eo&t=704s)** — And since we're ending off on this vitamin D topic, if you have not seen this interview with
- **[11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_JrqyBwy_eo&t=709s)** — Professor Hollis, who is the pioneer in vitamin D research, you have to check it out.
- **[11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_JrqyBwy_eo&t=714s)** — We go into this topic a lot more in depth. And I put that video up right here. Check it out.

- **[00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LFWspXbN8jY&t=0s)** — Hey, Dr. Berg here again. Today we are going to talk about the 7 visible signs that you have hormonal imbalance.
- **[00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LFWspXbN8jY&t=7s)** — And you can see these things very easily when you look in the mirror.
- **[00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LFWspXbN8jY&t=10s)** — At the end of this video, you are going to be able to look across the room and observe something.
- **[00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LFWspXbN8jY&t=15s)** — And pretty much know if that person has too much of a certain hormone or not enough.
- **[00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LFWspXbN8jY&t=20s)** — Let's first start out with the thyroid gland. Your thyroid gland is like right here. It's like
- **[00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LFWspXbN8jY&t=24s)** — 2.5 inches wide. The thyroid is a small gland, but it controls your metabolism.
- **[00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LFWspXbN8jY&t=28s)** — If these hormones are too high, your eyes are actually going to start bulging out.
- **[00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LFWspXbN8jY&t=34s)** — Your metabolism is going to be very fast to the point where you are going to lose a lot of weight.
- **[00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LFWspXbN8jY&t=38s)** — This is not a good thing because it's going to be a very unhealthy weight loss.
- **[00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LFWspXbN8jY&t=44s)** — And you might see a lot of sweating with a hyperthyroid problem.
- **[00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LFWspXbN8jY&t=47s)** — On the flip side, if the thyroid is not working enough, that's called a hypothyroid condition.
- **[00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LFWspXbN8jY&t=54s)** — This is going to cause more weight gain. And the hair, you are going to see that the hair is going to be
- **[00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LFWspXbN8jY&t=58s)** — thin. It's going to be dry. 90% of hypothyroidism is a type of thyroid problem that is related to
- **[01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LFWspXbN8jY&t=65s)** — the immune system. It's called Hashimoto's. It's an autoimmune condition where your own body
- **[01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LFWspXbN8jY&t=71s)** — is creating antibodies against your own thyroid, destroying it, creating an underactive thyroid
- **[01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LFWspXbN8jY&t=77s)** — coming from the immune system. A very important thing about that condition is to avoid gluten
- **[01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LFWspXbN8jY&t=83s)** — from grains. You need to take more selenium. You can get enough selenium from having one
- **[01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LFWspXbN8jY&t=88s)** — Brazil nut. Selenium also improves the immune system and so does vitamin D. So you're going to
- **[01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LFWspXbN8jY&t=93s)** — need high doses of vitamin D3 for Hashimoto's. Let's move to number two, which is androgens.
- **[01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LFWspXbN8jY&t=100s)** — One is testosterone and the other is DHT. If there's too much androgen, you're going to get
- **[01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LFWspXbN8jY&t=108s)** — acne around your jawline, around your back, and both men and women. In women, their voice is
- **[01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LFWspXbN8jY&t=115s)** — more deeper, more facial hair. And they will also start noticing receding in the top part of their
- **[02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LFWspXbN8jY&t=121s)** — hair versus if men have too much androgen, they'll start having male pattern baldness.
- **[02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LFWspXbN8jY&t=127s)** — This is why it's so important to avoid carbohydrates, sugars, starches, and also not
- **[02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LFWspXbN8jY&t=133s)** — to eat so frequently. On the flip side, if someone doesn't have enough androgen, let's say
- **[02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LFWspXbN8jY&t=140s)** — men, if they're low in testosterone, they're going to get lowered amount of muscle. Men will
- **[02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LFWspXbN8jY&t=146s)** — also lose hair on the bottom part of their legs if they don't have enough testosterone.
- **[02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LFWspXbN8jY&t=152s)** — The other thing is to avoid plastics. So you want to get a really good water filter
- **[02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LFWspXbN8jY&t=156s)** — because that's where most people get their plastics from city water. Let's move to number
- **[02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LFWspXbN8jY&t=161s)** — three, cortisol. Cortisol is a stress hormone and if it goes too high, you're going to
- **[02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LFWspXbN8jY&t=170s)** — get like a buffalo hump on the back part of your neck. You'll tend to gain weight
- **[02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LFWspXbN8jY&t=175s)** — in your midsection. In females, a lot of times you'll see exaggerated stretch marks from too
- **[03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LFWspXbN8jY&t=182s)** — much cortisol. Cortisol will age you. It makes your skin thin and wrinkly. Number four is
- **[03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LFWspXbN8jY&t=189s)** — estrogen. What happens when the estrogen goes high? Your face will be puffy. You might see
- **[03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LFWspXbN8jY&t=198s)** — melasma, which is this pigmentation thing on your skin. You might see little patches of a
- **[03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LFWspXbN8jY&t=203s)** — darker complexion, but you can also see estrogen dominance from someone on birth control pills
- **[03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LFWspXbN8jY&t=208s)** — or estrogen replacement therapy. What happens when your estrogen goes down during menopause,
- **[03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LFWspXbN8jY&t=214s)** — for example? The skin and collagen start to disappear. This is why you start looking older
- **[03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LFWspXbN8jY&t=220s)** — or you get wrinkles or the skin looks thinner. You also have to realize that estrogen comes
- **[03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LFWspXbN8jY&t=224s)** — from cholesterol. So if you're on something that lowers cholesterol or you're on a low-fat diet,
- **[03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LFWspXbN8jY&t=230s)** — that could be a major reason why your estrogen also is excessively low. Number five,
- **[03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LFWspXbN8jY&t=237s)** — growth hormone. Typically, if your growth hormone declines too much, it's just going
- **[04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LFWspXbN8jY&t=240s)** — to make you look older and it's also going to affect your muscle. When growth hormone goes
- **[04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LFWspXbN8jY&t=245s)** — down, we gain weight, especially in the midsection. A couple things to know about
- **[04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LFWspXbN8jY&t=250s)** — growth hormone. To increase it, it's the intensity of the exercise. So sprinting or
- **[04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LFWspXbN8jY&t=256s)** — anything high intensity, short duration. Also keeping your carbs low will help increase
- **[04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LFWspXbN8jY&t=262s)** — your growth hormone. Also sleeping more can help your growth hormone because the majority
- **[04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LFWspXbN8jY&t=267s)** — of your growth hormone occurs when you're sleeping. This is another reason why some people
- **[04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LFWspXbN8jY&t=271s)** — age more quickly. Their sleep is poor. If your sleep is poor, you are going to look older.
- **[04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LFWspXbN8jY&t=278s)** — Number six, progesterone. Progesterone goes up. It's actually very, very rare. Probably have some
- **[04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LFWspXbN8jY&t=284s)** — mild fluid retention. A much more common problem is when it goes too low, which is super common.
- **[04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LFWspXbN8jY&t=289s)** — Those symptoms would be a puffy face, the person will look dull and tired, and sometimes
- **[04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LFWspXbN8jY&t=294s)** — have acne. Number seven, insulin. What visual signs occur when your insulin is too high?
- **[04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LFWspXbN8jY&t=299s)** — Well, number one, you're going to have a midsection that's going to stick out. You're
- **[05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LFWspXbN8jY&t=306s)** — going to get rid of it. Skin tags, swollen eyes. If we shift gears to low insulin,
- **[05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LFWspXbN8jY&t=313s)** — that's when you're actually losing too much weight. But again, not in a healthy way.
- **[05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LFWspXbN8jY&t=316s)** — You see this in a type one diabetic. Now we have an issue of craving for carbs,
- **[05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LFWspXbN8jY&t=321s)** — being hungry all the time. The big thing that triggers insulin is sugar and starches,
- **[05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LFWspXbN8jY&t=327s)** — as in bread, pasta, cereal, crackers, biscuits, waffles, pancakes, and also just the
- **[05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LFWspXbN8jY&t=332s)** — meals. This is why telling someone to consume a balanced diet, or this concept of everything
- **[05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LFWspXbN8jY&t=340s)** — in moderation is the worst advice ever. Out of all these hormonal imbalances, the one that I see
- **[05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LFWspXbN8jY&t=346s)** — most commonly as a problem is too much cortisol. How to bring it down naturally
- **[05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LFWspXbN8jY&t=352s)** — and keep it normal. So watch this video right now.

- **[00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0jf5NRwKBM&t=0s)** — You must know this. So this presentation is an intriguing talk about viruses.
- **[00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0jf5NRwKBM&t=7s)** — A virus is dead. It's not alive. Yet it can destroy your body.
- **[00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0jf5NRwKBM&t=12s)** — So let me just show you something. This is a cell. If we open up the cell,
- **[00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0jf5NRwKBM&t=16s)** — it has a bunch of things in it. Okay, you can see it has all these different... they're called
- **[00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0jf5NRwKBM&t=19s)** — organelles. They're just little tiny parts of this huge factory that makes stuff. Okay,
- **[00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0jf5NRwKBM&t=26s)** — you have the mitochondria in here, which is the energy factory. You have the ribosome,
- **[00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0jf5NRwKBM&t=30s)** — which is basically a protein factory. And then you have the nucleus right in the center here.
- **[00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0jf5NRwKBM&t=34s)** — Well, guess what? Viruses don't have any of this stuff right here. In fact,
- **[00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0jf5NRwKBM&t=39s)** — viruses are not even cells. A virus is just some blueprints with the sac around it that
- **[00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0jf5NRwKBM&t=46s)** — has no energy, no machine. It cannot do anything outside your cell. Today, we're going
- **[00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0jf5NRwKBM&t=52s)** — to get into some potential theories on where viruses really came from. It's really interesting.
- **[00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0jf5NRwKBM&t=59s)** — And viruses on one hand can kill you, but on the other hand, they can actually really help
- **[01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0jf5NRwKBM&t=64s)** — you. And I'm going to get into that as well. But to understand viruses, you have to just get
- **[01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0jf5NRwKBM&t=67s)** — a little bit of a foundation of what they are and what they're not. Viruses are not cells.
- **[01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0jf5NRwKBM&t=73s)** — They're very tiny things that compare to the cell. So they come in contact with a cell,
- **[01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0jf5NRwKBM&t=76s)** — and it's like a lock and a key. Something gets inserted like a spike protein,
- **[01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0jf5NRwKBM&t=81s)** — and it just activates something that then causes a chain reaction in your body, which involves the
- **[01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0jf5NRwKBM&t=89s)** — hijacking of your machinery. So they basically can tap into your energy, use your resources,
- **[01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0jf5NRwKBM&t=97s)** — not theirs, for their survival. And then they start to reproduce and make more of themselves.
- **[01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0jf5NRwKBM&t=103s)** — And then they explode your cell. Okay, they're not nice. They're classified as parasitic. Now,
- **[01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0jf5NRwKBM&t=109s)** — before I get into some of the theories on where viruses came from, which is a huge mystery,
- **[01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0jf5NRwKBM&t=116s)** — I want to just cover some ways that these viruses evade your immune system. There's one
- **[02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0jf5NRwKBM&t=121s)** — type of virus. They rupture the cell membrane. They disintegrate it. They're called lytic
- **[02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0jf5NRwKBM&t=126s)** — viruses. And then the other type of viruses are called latent viruses. So they also
- **[02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0jf5NRwKBM&t=132s)** — destroy your cell. But soon after the initial infection, they invade your DNA and they go
- **[02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0jf5NRwKBM&t=140s)** — silent. And then one day you get a little bit older and you go through stress and bam,
- **[02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0jf5NRwKBM&t=144s)** — they come out of remission and they become reactivated. Like herpes simplex, like that
- **[02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0jf5NRwKBM&t=149s)** — little blister you get on your lip is one example. HIV is another example. Epstein
- **[02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0jf5NRwKBM&t=154s)** — virus is another one. So the problem with the latent viruses is they pretty much last
- **[02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0jf5NRwKBM&t=159s)** — a very long time in your body and they never go away. And as long as you don't experience
- **[02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0jf5NRwKBM&t=164s)** — a lot of stress or poor health, you might be okay. But the lytic viruses do their destruction
- **[02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0jf5NRwKBM&t=170s)** — and the immune system eventually takes care of them and wipes them out. It's just wild that
- **[02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0jf5NRwKBM&t=175s)** — these viruses even exist in the first place. Where did they come from? And why are they
- **[03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0jf5NRwKBM&t=180s)** — here? The first one is called the virus first hypothesis. In this theory, the virus has been
- **[03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0jf5NRwKBM&t=186s)** — thought to come before even our cells existed. Another theory is called reduction theory. In this
- **[03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0jf5NRwKBM&t=192s)** — area, the virus is some type of remnants or residual something from some living cell. So
- **[03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0jf5NRwKBM&t=199s)** — it's lost its ability to survive independently. And so it must need another cell to tap into
- **[03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0jf5NRwKBM&t=205s)** — its energy. Then you get this other theory is called the giant virus and the fourth domain.
- **[03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0jf5NRwKBM&t=210s)** — This really has challenged the traditional theory of viruses because a giant virus is a lot
- **[03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0jf5NRwKBM&t=217s)** — more complex. And the theory goes that viruses are a fourth domain. So you have different
- **[03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0jf5NRwKBM&t=223s)** — types of cells. You have bacteria cells, you have other cells. It's not really a cell,
- **[03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0jf5NRwKBM&t=227s)** — it's just an entity. Then you get this next theory that has to do with contribution to
- **[03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0jf5NRwKBM&t=232s)** — evolution or having something evolve. And this theory goes like this. You have this thing
- **[03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0jf5NRwKBM&t=237s)** — called horizontal gene transfer. It's kind of like sharing knowledge, key knowledge to help
- **[04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0jf5NRwKBM&t=243s)** — someone survive. You can pass down knowledge from you to your children. In fact, 8% of our
- **[04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0jf5NRwKBM&t=250s)** — genes have viral components. Then the last theory has to do with viruses being a necessary
- **[04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0jf5NRwKBM&t=257s)** — tool to help with survival. Now those are all the theories that are known. There's a couple
- **[04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0jf5NRwKBM&t=268s)** — for your immune system. So in the immune system, you have two types. You have the type of immune
- **[04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0jf5NRwKBM&t=274s)** — system that you were born with. It's called the innate. Your mother gave it to you. But you also
- **[04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0jf5NRwKBM&t=278s)** — have another part of an immune system called the acquired immune system. This is the part
- **[04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0jf5NRwKBM&t=284s)** — that you need to develop over time. And you cannot develop it without viruses. And they cause
- **[04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0jf5NRwKBM&t=290s)** — your immune system to adapt and become very, very strong if you let this process happen. So
- **[04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0jf5NRwKBM&t=296s)** — this is why I've done videos on this where, like with a child, when they get sick and they have a
- **[05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0jf5NRwKBM&t=301s)** — fever, their response is just to stop the fever. And through a series of infections,
- **[05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0jf5NRwKBM&t=307s)** — that immune system gets trained. If we never let our immune system get trained, it can never
- **[05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0jf5NRwKBM&t=313s)** — develop and become strong. Viruses have given us the evolutionary pressure to develop this
- **[05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0jf5NRwKBM&t=318s)** — robust immune system. This could relate to just exercise, right? If you've never exercised
- **[05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0jf5NRwKBM&t=323s)** — how strong are you really going to be? Can you actually really build up this fitness reserve?
- **[05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0jf5NRwKBM&t=329s)** — No, not without exercise. And so this side will develop strategies to help them survive. And then
- **[05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0jf5NRwKBM&t=335s)** — our bodies will also develop other strategies. So they're sitting there waiting and waiting
- **[05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0jf5NRwKBM&t=340s)** — for their door to open for you to get weak. Now other viruses like the Epstein-Barr virus,
- **[05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0jf5NRwKBM&t=345s)** — for example, there's many of these that do this, but the Epstein-Barr virus downgrades
- **[05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0jf5NRwKBM&t=350s)** — your vitamin D receptor. Because somehow it knows that vitamin D is really essential for
- **[05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0jf5NRwKBM&t=357s)** — the entire immune system. So I just have to explain something about vitamin D that's super
- **[06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0jf5NRwKBM&t=362s)** — important. A lot of people don't know about this. In fact, most doctors do not know that
- **[06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0jf5NRwKBM&t=367s)** — there's two different systems for vitamin D. And there's three different types of vitamin D.
- **[06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0jf5NRwKBM&t=373s)** — You have the vitamin D that comes from the sun. And then you also have the vitamin D that
- **[06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0jf5NRwKBM&t=380s)** — gets activated inside the receptors wherever it goes. So there's two systems of vitamin D.
- **[06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0jf5NRwKBM&t=388s)** — One is all about calcium in bone. And the other system is about everything else. It's non-calcium
- **[06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0jf5NRwKBM&t=395s)** — functions. The immune system is the big one. The most important thing that you need to know
- **[06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0jf5NRwKBM&t=400s)** — is the vitamin D in the blood is in an inactive form. And this is mainly to feed
- **[06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0jf5NRwKBM&t=407s)** — the bone. A very tiny bit of it, like 0.04% of it, feeds the immune system. So if you want a
- **[06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0jf5NRwKBM&t=416s)** — strong immune system, but you're not getting daily amounts of either sun or the supplement
- **[07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0jf5NRwKBM&t=421s)** — or vitamin D in from the food, your immune system is going to suffer because the half-life
- **[07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0jf5NRwKBM&t=426s)** — is 24 hours. For the bone, you can get by with like 600 to 800 IUs. But for the immune
- **[07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0jf5NRwKBM&t=434s)** — system, you need a minimum amount of 10,000 IUs. 10,000 IUs would be basically 20 minutes
- **[07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0jf5NRwKBM&t=440s)** — in the sun. But the average person needs 10,000 IUs every single day to support a healthy immune
- **[07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0jf5NRwKBM&t=447s)** — system. Then you also have many viruses, including the rhinoviruses, which gives you
- **[07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0jf5NRwKBM&t=452s)** — the common cold. They need zinc and your immune system needs zinc too, because zinc also
- **[07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0jf5NRwKBM&t=458s)** — turns down virus reproduction. And then you have another virus called HIV. What that does is it
- **[07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0jf5NRwKBM&t=464s)** — targets this very specific immune cell that is like the quarterback of the entire immune
- **[07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0jf5NRwKBM&t=470s)** — system. And it takes that one out. One way to counter that, just as a side note, is selenium.
- **[07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0jf5NRwKBM&t=477s)** — Selenium is in Brazil nuts. It's also in shellfish. And if you have enough selenium,
- **[08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0jf5NRwKBM&t=482s)** — you can reactivate that cell and get it to work right. So now I want to just touch briefly
- **[08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0jf5NRwKBM&t=486s)** — on what reactivates certain viruses that are latent or in remission. As you age, you become
- **[08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0jf5NRwKBM&t=493s)** — weaker. And also the more stress you have, the more cortisol you have, the weaker you're going to
- **[08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0jf5NRwKBM&t=499s)** — become. So cortisol suppresses your immune system. In practice, I notice a lot of people that had
- **[08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0jf5NRwKBM&t=506s)** — viral infections had them right after a severe stress. And then other viruses can be
- **[08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0jf5NRwKBM&t=512s)** — reactivated through ultraviolet radiation, the sunlight. But the secret to this entire
- **[08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0jf5NRwKBM&t=517s)** — presentation is what can we do about viruses? You have two specific types of immune cells that
- **[08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0jf5NRwKBM&t=525s)** — kill off viruses. One is called the cytotoxic T cell. The other one is called the natural
- **[08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0jf5NRwKBM&t=531s)** — killer cell. Both of these can be greatly strengthened. And I'm going to go through a
- **[08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0jf5NRwKBM&t=535s)** — list of all the things that you can do. Vitamin D is hands down the most important
- **[09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0jf5NRwKBM&t=543s)** — immune system. It's a natural immune modulator. It means that if your immune system is
- **[09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0jf5NRwKBM&t=549s)** — working too much or too slow or not enough, it'll bring it to normal. Number two is zinc.
- **[09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0jf5NRwKBM&t=556s)** — I already talked about that. Zinc increases the immune system many different ways. One way,
- **[09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0jf5NRwKBM&t=561s)** — it counteracts this whole viral shutdown of your zinc supply. Another way is zinc just stops
- **[09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0jf5NRwKBM&t=566s)** — the reproduction of viruses. Then of course, you have vitamin C, right? The best vitamin C
- **[09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0jf5NRwKBM&t=571s)** — you can eat is raw sauerkraut. One cup of that a few times a week would give you 700mg
- **[09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0jf5NRwKBM&t=578s)** — of vitamin C. Sleep is another important thing. Try like heck to get eight hours of sleep.
- **[09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0jf5NRwKBM&t=583s)** — I was at one time bragging because I didn't need much sleep. I can get by, I can get
- **[09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0jf5NRwKBM&t=588s)** — up really early. That was a very stupid thing to brag about because I'm telling you,
- **[09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0jf5NRwKBM&t=593s)** — seven, eight hours of sleep is a necessity. Number five, the reduction of stress,
- **[09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0jf5NRwKBM&t=597s)** — whether it's physical work, going for a walk in nature, doing stretches is very, very important.
- **[10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0jf5NRwKBM&t=603s)** — Also, if you have a fever, don't try to get rid of it right away. Why? Because fever cooks
- **[10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0jf5NRwKBM&t=610s)** — the virus. And so when you take some type of thing like an aspirin or whatever to try to
- **[10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0jf5NRwKBM&t=614s)** — get rid of the fever, now you prolong the infection. You don't allow the body to run
- **[10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0jf5NRwKBM&t=620s)** — through its training cycle of fighting off the infection. But if your fever gets above 104F,
- **[10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0jf5NRwKBM&t=629s)** — just 40 degrees Celsius, at that point, maybe you do something, but not at lower temperatures.
- **[10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0jf5NRwKBM&t=635s)** — Number six, garlic. Very important. Number seven, elderberry. Awesome for viruses.
- **[10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0jf5NRwKBM&t=641s)** — Intermittent fasting. Very powerful. Also, magnesium helps increase the killer T cells. I
- **[10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0jf5NRwKBM&t=647s)** — recently stumbled on information. So one way to strengthen the immune system is to take about
- **[10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0jf5NRwKBM&t=651s)** — 800 milligrams in the evening before you go to bed. Believe it or not, laughter can also increase
- **[10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0jf5NRwKBM&t=657s)** — these killer T cells. Viruses outside your cells are powerless. They can't do anything.
- **[11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0jf5NRwKBM&t=662s)** — They just float around. They have no energy, no mechanics. So this is why it's important to
- **[11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0jf5NRwKBM&t=667s)** — understand that you need to go through infections to build up your immune system,
- **[11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0jf5NRwKBM&t=672s)** — and you need the key nutrition to support and strengthen the immune system itself. Versus the
- **[11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0jf5NRwKBM&t=677s)** — other viewpoint, which is not true, where you have a virus that is alive, which is not true,
- **[11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0jf5NRwKBM&t=683s)** — and it's controlling your body. It's stronger than your body. It goes into your body. And
- **[11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0jf5NRwKBM&t=688s)** — at all costs, you just need to suppress and try to kill it off. There's all sorts of
- **[11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0jf5NRwKBM&t=693s)** — medications, which ends up weakening your immune system. So remember this concept and apply it to your lifestyle.

- **[00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5f5JF2VXpWQ&t=0s)** — Today I'm going to tell you the fastest way to get relief from trigeminal neuralgia.
- **[00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5f5JF2VXpWQ&t=7s)** — And there's two types. So type one is unilateral, could be one side or the other, sudden,
- **[00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5f5JF2VXpWQ&t=13s)** — brief, shooting, stabbing. And it can reoccur like every two seconds up to two minutes,
- **[00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5f5JF2VXpWQ&t=20s)** — twice a day up to 200 times a day. So it can be very devastating. Type two is more achy,
- **[00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5f5JF2VXpWQ&t=27s)** — chronic, not intense, kind of always there. One of the big problems you're probably running into is
- **[00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5f5JF2VXpWQ&t=32s)** — doing a search on YouTube or Google to find good information on this topic. Because very recently
- **[00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5f5JF2VXpWQ&t=38s)** — with these new changes with Google, now it's just all medical. There's no alternatives,
- **[00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5f5JF2VXpWQ&t=44s)** — especially when you type in a medical condition, which okay, fair enough. And even if we type in
- **[00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5f5JF2VXpWQ&t=49s)** — natural remedy for trigeminal neuralgia, we get the same thing, medical, medical, medical.
- **[00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5f5JF2VXpWQ&t=54s)** — Unfortunately, it's very difficult to find alternatives to medical. Before I kind of go
- **[00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5f5JF2VXpWQ&t=59s)** — into this topic, let's just take a look at what the top video says about trigeminal neuralgia.
- **[01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5f5JF2VXpWQ&t=67s)** — Welcome back to Mayo Clinic Radio. I'm Dr. Tom Shives. And I'm Tracy McCray. Tracy,
- **[01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5f5JF2VXpWQ&t=72s)** — we recently had a listener, as you know, contact us and ask us to do a program on
- **[01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5f5JF2VXpWQ&t=76s)** — trigeminal neuralgia. And we listen, we're paying attention. And so if people want to
- **[01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5f5JF2VXpWQ&t=81s)** — hear about it, we're going to listen. We invited two of the world's experts on trigeminal
- **[01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5f5JF2VXpWQ&t=85s)** — to answer that inquiry. On trigeminal neuralgia. Oh, on trigeminal neuralgia to answer that
- **[01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5f5JF2VXpWQ&t=92s)** — inquiry. Thanks for listening. Joining us in studio are Mayo Clinic neurologist,
- **[01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5f5JF2VXpWQ&t=96s)** — Dr. Chris Baez and neurosurgeon, Dr. Bruce Pollock. Welcome to the program.
- **[01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5f5JF2VXpWQ&t=101s)** — Okay, so that's not really giving me a lot of confidence in this video so far. And why do
- **[01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5f5JF2VXpWQ&t=106s)** — they have the comments off, right? I look at the comments a lot, especially when I'm
- **[01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5f5JF2VXpWQ&t=111s)** — talking about the brain. And I'm going to talk a lot more about the comments and what people
- **[01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5f5JF2VXpWQ&t=113s)** — are saying. But let's go back to this video. I just want to know what type of treatment that
- **[01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5f5JF2VXpWQ&t=118s)** — they do for this condition. Let's take a look at that. Assuming all that's come true,
- **[02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5f5JF2VXpWQ&t=122s)** — and either the medicines have stopped working, or you can't tolerate the medications,
- **[02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5f5JF2VXpWQ&t=126s)** — then we sort of go through the different surgical options that are available.
- **[02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5f5JF2VXpWQ&t=131s)** — The best surgery that we have in terms of outcomes is where we go in and actually
- **[02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5f5JF2VXpWQ&t=135s)** — move the blood vessels away from the nerve. It is a small craniotomy, so we make a small opening
- **[02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5f5JF2VXpWQ&t=141s)** — behind the ear. And we don't go through any brain, but we work in these natural water
- **[02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5f5JF2VXpWQ&t=146s)** — sacs that we have to go down and see the trigeminal nerve and mobilize a small artery
- **[02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5f5JF2VXpWQ&t=151s)** — off the nerve and then put some padding in to keep it away. The surgery is known as a
- **[02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5f5JF2VXpWQ&t=156s)** — microvascular decompression. Typically takes us about two hours and the hospital stay is
- **[02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5f5JF2VXpWQ&t=161s)** — typically two days. But you have to go through the skull to get that. Yes, it is an open surgery.
- **[02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5f5JF2VXpWQ&t=166s)** — So the incision is behind the ear about an inch and a quarter.
- **[02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5f5JF2VXpWQ&t=168s)** — Alright, so I need to get another opinion. I need to get more information about this topic.
- **[02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5f5JF2VXpWQ&t=173s)** — Something that does involve medications and surgery. I wonder if there's anything else.
- **[02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5f5JF2VXpWQ&t=177s)** — How am I going to go about finding this? I'm just going to show you what I do. The first
- **[03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5f5JF2VXpWQ&t=181s)** — thing I do, number one, is I go to the authority on a lot of things, Wikipedia. But I
- **[03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5f5JF2VXpWQ&t=190s)** — recommend it so I can go in the exact opposite direction. And I especially look at what they
- **[03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5f5JF2VXpWQ&t=196s)** — say that definitely does not work because chances are it probably works. So I do get a lot of
- **[03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5f5JF2VXpWQ&t=201s)** — great information with Wikipedia, but it's in the reverse direction. So the next thing I do
- **[03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5f5JF2VXpWQ&t=207s)** — is I look at animal research. You will find all sorts of great remedies and information
- **[03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5f5JF2VXpWQ&t=213s)** — for animals. Because the thing with animals is that either it's going to work or it's not.
- **[03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5f5JF2VXpWQ&t=218s)** — There's not a lot of subjective things. You can't ask your pet dog how they feel about certain
- **[03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5f5JF2VXpWQ&t=222s)** — things. You have to create a change or they're not going to use it. And then the next thing I
- **[03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5f5JF2VXpWQ&t=228s)** — do is I look for what is the gold standard? What is the main treatment for a particular
- **[03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5f5JF2VXpWQ&t=233s)** — disorder? And I start looking at the mechanism. Like how this drug actually works. What does it
- **[04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5f5JF2VXpWQ&t=240s)** — do? Does it inhibit an enzyme? What exactly does it do? So then I can actually look at
- **[04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5f5JF2VXpWQ&t=245s)** — things like herbs and plants that might create a similar effect, but of course without the
- **[04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5f5JF2VXpWQ&t=251s)** — side effects. And then I'll do a patent search. I'll look at patents on this particular
- **[04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5f5JF2VXpWQ&t=258s)** — disorder or disease or problem in Europe or in some other country in relationship to
- **[04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5f5JF2VXpWQ&t=266s)** — something natural or an herb or something that I can get some clues on. Because what's really
- **[04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5f5JF2VXpWQ&t=275s)** — that's on that particular topic that you'll never be able to find if you do a search.
- **[04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5f5JF2VXpWQ&t=279s)** — Now I also will get a good understanding of the condition. And in this situation,
- **[04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5f5JF2VXpWQ&t=285s)** — trigeminal neuralgia, there's definitely problems with the myelin sheath. So I will
- **[04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5f5JF2VXpWQ&t=289s)** — look deeply at anything related to what can affect myelin, especially in the area of
- **[04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5f5JF2VXpWQ&t=295s)** — demyelinating nerves. And by the way, myelin is just the coating around the nerve. It's a
- **[05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5f5JF2VXpWQ&t=304s)** — seasonal. Does it come at a certain time of the year? Is it more in men than women? Because I
- **[05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5f5JF2VXpWQ&t=310s)** — want to know if estrogen could be more involved. At what age does a person usually get it? Is there
- **[05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5f5JF2VXpWQ&t=315s)** — anything that usually comes before this problem? Like for example, a surgery, an injury,
- **[05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5f5JF2VXpWQ&t=322s)** — a stress event, maybe it happens later in life or earlier. All these factors give me clues.
- **[05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5f5JF2VXpWQ&t=327s)** — So let me share what I found about this condition. The first bit of information I found
- **[05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5f5JF2VXpWQ&t=331s)** — related to something called polyunsaturated fatty acids. There was some research done on
- **[05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5f5JF2VXpWQ&t=338s)** — rats. So if you have a pet hamster or a gerbil or a rat, this might pertain to you.
- **[05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5f5JF2VXpWQ&t=344s)** — But this polyunsaturated fatty acid, you have two different kinds. You have the omega-3
- **[05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5f5JF2VXpWQ&t=349s)** — fatty acids, which they were using in high doses to get rid of inflammation in the nervous
- **[05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5f5JF2VXpWQ&t=356s)** — system and in the brain. But they were also looking at omega-6 fatty acids, the seed oils,
- **[06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5f5JF2VXpWQ&t=363s)** — which are not anti-inflammatory. In fact, they're pro-inflammatory. They create inflammation.
- **[06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5f5JF2VXpWQ&t=368s)** — They create a lot of oxidative stress and insulin resistance and a lot of problems. And
- **[06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5f5JF2VXpWQ&t=374s)** — these omega-6 oils, seed oils, can invade fatty membranes like the myelin sheath.
- **[06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5f5JF2VXpWQ&t=381s)** — Whereas omega-3 fatty acids help build myelin sheath. But if you're consuming both at the same
- **[06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5f5JF2VXpWQ&t=388s)** — time, they compete with each other. The omega-3 is not going to work. So you must eliminate
- **[06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5f5JF2VXpWQ&t=395s)** — the omega-6 fatty acids out of the diet. And especially in the area of processed foods and
- **[06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5f5JF2VXpWQ&t=399s)** — all the different oils in the salad dressing and the condiments and things like that. I'm
- **[06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5f5JF2VXpWQ&t=410s)** — consumed between 400 to 700 calories of the seed oil every single day. This is insane.
- **[07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5f5JF2VXpWQ&t=420s)** — We are human guinea pigs just experimenting with this oil. And it does correlate with so
- **[07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5f5JF2VXpWQ&t=425s)** — many health problems. Okay, the introduction of these oils, which are not vegetable oils.
- **[07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5f5JF2VXpWQ&t=430s)** — When you think about these oils, none of them relate to any vegetables that you eat
- **[07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5f5JF2VXpWQ&t=435s)** — on a regular basis. It's seed oils. I mean, how much corn do you have to crush to get certain
- **[07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5f5JF2VXpWQ&t=441s)** — amounts of oil and also the soybeans and the cotton seeds. So it's weird that they call them
- **[07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5f5JF2VXpWQ&t=445s)** — vegetable oils because they're really seed oils. Now I found some other interesting data
- **[07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5f5JF2VXpWQ&t=450s)** — relating to viruses. This is a pretty heavy duty association. In one research, they did
- **[07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5f5JF2VXpWQ&t=455s)** — experiments on cadavers that had this condition. And they opened it up and they found these
- **[07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5f5JF2VXpWQ&t=460s)** — viruses that apparently make their home out of your ganglion, which is the kind of a nerve
- **[07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5f5JF2VXpWQ&t=466s)** — bundle, where the trigeminal nerve originates from. So there are four primary viruses that
- **[07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5f5JF2VXpWQ&t=473s)** — they talked about, with the most common one being a herpes virus, HHV6. The next one being
- **[08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5f5JF2VXpWQ&t=482s)** — like shingles, the varicella zoster, which is like the chickenpox virus. The next one is
- **[08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5f5JF2VXpWQ&t=489s)** — the abstin-bar virus. And then you also had a cytomegaloviruses. What's interesting about
- **[08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5f5JF2VXpWQ&t=493s)** — all of these viruses is they go in and out of remission. So they're called latent viruses.
- **[08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5f5JF2VXpWQ&t=500s)** — They can be reactivated, which does explain why trigeminal neuralgia can come and go
- **[08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5f5JF2VXpWQ&t=507s)** — based on various factors. One is stress. So I want to kind of just briefly go through
- **[08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5f5JF2VXpWQ&t=512s)** — all four of these viruses to tell you some of the other research I found as the potential
- **[08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5f5JF2VXpWQ&t=517s)** — Let's start with the HHV6, the herpes virus. Because there's like 245 different herpes viruses.
- **[08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5f5JF2VXpWQ&t=525s)** — This one is more common. It can be other ones, but they're not as common. But I found a really
- **[08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5f5JF2VXpWQ&t=531s)** — good remedy for this. It's an extract from shiitake mushrooms. And I'll just give you the
- **[08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5f5JF2VXpWQ&t=536s)** — abbreviation AHCC, but there's some interesting research to show that using that to help
- **[09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5f5JF2VXpWQ&t=542s)** — reduce pain from that virus and potentially even clearing out that virus. So what I'm
- **[09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5f5JF2VXpWQ&t=546s)** — doing now is just pointing you into a certain direction to do more research on. I'm not going
- **[09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5f5JF2VXpWQ&t=551s)** — to give you specific brands or doses and things like that, because we don't know.
- **[09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5f5JF2VXpWQ&t=555s)** — Because there are multiple reasons why you might have this condition.
- **[09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5f5JF2VXpWQ&t=558s)** — It could be even from a tumor, which is very rare. It could be from physical injury.
- **[09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5f5JF2VXpWQ&t=562s)** — It could be from a surgery that you had in your sinuses. So you really want to look at
- **[09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5f5JF2VXpWQ&t=567s)** — all these factors too. Okay, now what about this varicella zoster, this like shingles virus?
- **[09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5f5JF2VXpWQ&t=575s)** — Vitamin D3 in high doses, like 50,000 I use would be a really good thing. And I would add zinc
- **[09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5f5JF2VXpWQ&t=581s)** — to that, because in order for vitamin D to work, you need zinc and you need magnesium as well.
- **[09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5f5JF2VXpWQ&t=587s)** — But vitamin D is a powerful anti-inflammatory. And it's something that you can even get
- **[09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5f5JF2VXpWQ&t=593s)** — topically for shingles. And it also works good on sciatic pain and other types of pain and
- **[10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5f5JF2VXpWQ&t=600s)** — back pain. But it can definitely help put this shingles virus back in remission. Now,
- **[10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5f5JF2VXpWQ&t=605s)** — what about Epstein-Barr virus? This is one that is really nasty, because it can really make
- **[10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5f5JF2VXpWQ&t=610s)** — you tired, cause fibromyalgia. There is a lot of different remedies out there. I'm just going
- **[10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5f5JF2VXpWQ&t=615s)** — to tell you from personal experience, from myself, and from working with a lot of patients,
- **[10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5f5JF2VXpWQ&t=620s)** — this is like 100% activated by stress. So you just have to find out what is stressing
- **[10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5f5JF2VXpWQ&t=625s)** — you out and figure out how you can reduce that stress. And that is probably the best advice I
- **[10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5f5JF2VXpWQ&t=630s)** — can give you on that virus. The cytomegalovirus. This is another one. I found some research on
- **[10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5f5JF2VXpWQ&t=635s)** — berberine. Yeah, berberine actually can help put this virus back in remission. I did find some
- **[10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5f5JF2VXpWQ&t=640s)** — other research on trigeminal neuralgia, specifically supporting that nerve tissue to drop
- **[10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5f5JF2VXpWQ&t=648s)** — inflammation. And I'll list the full name down below, but I'm just going to kind of give you
- **[10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5f5JF2VXpWQ&t=655s)** — initials of it. It's PEA slash luteolin, which is a natural thing in a lot of different foods
- **[11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5f5JF2VXpWQ&t=663s)** — that you eat. And because these molecules are fairly big, you want to get it micronized or
- **[11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5f5JF2VXpWQ&t=668s)** — broken up into small particles. But it apparently is a very powerful, neuroprotective
- **[11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5f5JF2VXpWQ&t=674s)** — anti-inflammatory. And then with the second compound, luteolin, that adds the antioxidants,
- **[11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5f5JF2VXpWQ&t=680s)** — because the first compound doesn't have that factor. But apparently this is something you
- **[11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5f5JF2VXpWQ&t=685s)** — can take orally with some good results. Now, another remedy that I found some interesting
- **[11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5f5JF2VXpWQ&t=690s)** — research on is called DMSO, which has great anti-inflammatory properties. It's very, very
- **[11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5f5JF2VXpWQ&t=699s)** — penetrating. You can put some on your foot and you can just actually taste it within seconds.
- **[11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5f5JF2VXpWQ&t=704s)** — It's like you taste like a garlic taste to it. But DMSO has been used for a lot of
- **[11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5f5JF2VXpWQ&t=710s)** — pain problems, pain syndromes. The only thing it's... it penetrates the tissues pretty fast. So
- **[11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5f5JF2VXpWQ&t=717s)** — you wouldn't want to put it with something that's toxic. So for example, if you're
- **[12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5f5JF2VXpWQ&t=722s)** — trying to kill your rat with rat poisoning and it's on your hands and you put the
- **[12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5f5JF2VXpWQ&t=726s)** — this DMSO on your hands, it's going to drive that poison rather than your tissue. So you
- **[12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5f5JF2VXpWQ&t=731s)** — want to clean the area before you put it on that tissue. So like if you have, I don't
- **[12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5f5JF2VXpWQ&t=736s)** — know, makeup on your face or some type of skin lotion, clean that off. Then you can rub in
- **[12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5f5JF2VXpWQ&t=743s)** — that DMSO wherever it originates. And there's been some really fascinating research on this.
- **[12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5f5JF2VXpWQ&t=750s)** — It's been around for a long time for things like phantom pain, post-operative, like you
- **[12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5f5JF2VXpWQ&t=755s)** — had in surgery, now you have pain. It's also good for post-traumatic type problems.
- **[12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5f5JF2VXpWQ&t=760s)** — If you had some injury and trigeminal neuralgia. So in one study, which I'm going to put down
- **[12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5f5JF2VXpWQ&t=765s)** — below, 32 out of 37 people experienced relief. And you could literally combine that first remedy,
- **[12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5f5JF2VXpWQ&t=774s)** — the PEA slash glutolin with the DMSO to drive that in deeper. I don't know. It's just an idea.
- **[13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5f5JF2VXpWQ&t=782s)** — It may work because anything you put with DMSO, it drives it in there, whether you do
- **[13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5f5JF2VXpWQ&t=788s)** — aloe vera or other types of things. Now we come to the technique I'm going to show you to
- **[13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5f5JF2VXpWQ&t=794s)** — dramatically reduce the pain very quickly. This technique doesn't fix the problem permanently,
- **[13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5f5JF2VXpWQ&t=800s)** — but it can greatly reduce the pain very fast. And I use this in practice. It was very effective.
- **[13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5f5JF2VXpWQ&t=808s)** — It works probably in 70% of the cases. The type of cases that it doesn't work on, if it's
- **[13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5f5JF2VXpWQ&t=814s)** — really, really viral related and there's like this active outbreak or infection, it will not
- **[13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5f5JF2VXpWQ&t=819s)** — work. It works really good on if you had some type of injury or post-surgery. So the whole
- **[13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5f5JF2VXpWQ&t=826s)** — theory of it is you're breaking up this brain circuitry that it keeps causing pain. It just
- **[13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5f5JF2VXpWQ&t=832s)** — keeps going and going. There's an amazing technique that I'm going to show you right
- **[13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5f5JF2VXpWQ&t=835s)** — now to drop the pain. It doesn't correct it, but at least it'll drop the pain pretty fast.
- **[14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5f5JF2VXpWQ&t=841s)** — And here's what you do. First of all, you isolate where the pain is coming from. Let's
- **[14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5f5JF2VXpWQ&t=849s)** — on the mirror image on the opposite side. The key is to mirror image to get the exact epicenter
- **[14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5f5JF2VXpWQ&t=856s)** — of wherever this is on the good side. Don't mess on the bad side. Just press on the good
- **[14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5f5JF2VXpWQ&t=862s)** — side and you're going to massage it. Now, the way that you know you have the exact correct
- **[14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5f5JF2VXpWQ&t=867s)** — spot to press on is it'll be very tender. It will. The good side will be tender,
- **[14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5f5JF2VXpWQ&t=872s)** — actually probably more tender than the side. So you find it and you just kind of massage it
- **[14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5f5JF2VXpWQ&t=877s)** — for about a minute. And then notice the bad side. If it's there at all, it's going to drop the
- **[14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5f5JF2VXpWQ&t=886s)** — pain. So let's say, for example, you did this and it moved down. Then you just go down.
- **[14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5f5JF2VXpWQ&t=891s)** — And then all of a sudden, oh wow, that got rid of that. But now it moved back over here

- **[15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5f5JF2VXpWQ&t=901s)** — as you start using some of these other remedies to help yourself. But I've used this in
- **[15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5f5JF2VXpWQ&t=905s)** — practice for years. It really came in handy and it's not something they teach you in school.
- **[15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5f5JF2VXpWQ&t=910s)** — In fact, they teach you the opposite. They'll teach you to put therapy on this side,
- **[15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5f5JF2VXpWQ&t=915s)** — you know, mess with this nerve. No, work on the good side. You'll see it'll work. Just

- **[00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bN3vjumXPLU&t=0s)** — And has a grocery store that looks like it's straight out of The Walking Dead. There's nothing
- **[00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bN3vjumXPLU&t=4s)** — left on the shelves except for the vegan section. And even in a natural disaster, people would rather
- **[00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bN3vjumXPLU&t=13s)** — die than eat fake meat foods, fake meat substitutes. What I'm going to share with
- **[00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bN3vjumXPLU&t=19s)** — you today is absolutely crazy. And I was shocked to hear about this. But when you hear about the
- **[00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bN3vjumXPLU&t=26s)** — trying to pass this bill that basically tags livestock for a reason that they say is just for
- **[00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bN3vjumXPLU&t=34s)** — the environment, it's to protect the animals from disease. But there's actually another motivation
- **[00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bN3vjumXPLU&t=39s)** — to this. You've got to hear the story. And today we have John Moody, who's a homesteader.
- **[00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bN3vjumXPLU&t=44s)** — He knows a lot about it. He's personally experienced this area for years. So I brought
- **[00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bN3vjumXPLU&t=50s)** — him on to kind of explain to us what is going on because it involves you and I,
- **[00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bN3vjumXPLU&t=55s)** — because it involves our food. So welcome, John. Thanks for being on here. Hey, good morning.
- **[01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bN3vjumXPLU&t=62s)** — Good morning, John. Can you just give us a little brief overview of what's going on now
- **[01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bN3vjumXPLU&t=67s)** — with this bill they're trying to pass related to electronic identification of livestock?
- **[01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bN3vjumXPLU&t=74s)** — Animal Livestock Tracking ID goes way, way back in history. Started with branding animals out on
- **[01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bN3vjumXPLU&t=82s)** — open ranges. How do you know whose cow is whose? That's where branding originally came from,
- **[01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bN3vjumXPLU&t=86s)** — being able to sort, keep track of cattle, know when they got sold at market, who gets
- **[01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bN3vjumXPLU&t=91s)** — paid for this cow. Very practical nitty gritty issue as a farmer. So branding was replaced as
- **[01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bN3vjumXPLU&t=97s)** — time went on by these ear tags that cattle now wear. So if you've ever seen a cattle in a
- **[01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bN3vjumXPLU&t=102s)** — field, see it got this big ear tag with a number and whatnot. That was like the updated version
- **[01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bN3vjumXPLU&t=107s)** — of branding, ear tagging cattle. And back in the 1990s, the government, USDA, FISUS,
- **[01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bN3vjumXPLU&t=115s)** — some of these agencies, along with the rise of the big beef industry, which is very different
- **[02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bN3vjumXPLU&t=122s)** — than the actual farmers, they wanted an even newer version of cattle tagging. They wanted
- **[02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bN3vjumXPLU&t=130s)** — electronic animal tagging that would allow them to know the exact number and location
- **[02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bN3vjumXPLU&t=138s)** — of all livestock animals all the time. Wow. And what was the apparent reason that they said
- **[02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bN3vjumXPLU&t=145s)** — that this is going to be good for everyone? Like so many government programs, it's sold
- **[02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bN3vjumXPLU&t=149s)** — under the idea of safety. So the government said, oh, we sometimes have disease outbreaks
- **[02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bN3vjumXPLU&t=157s)** — in animals and we need to be able to know where these animals were, where they came from,
- **[02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bN3vjumXPLU&t=162s)** — to quickly respond to when we have a significant disease outbreak. The irony there
- **[02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bN3vjumXPLU&t=170s)** — is Ireland in 2022 rolled out electronic ID under this guise. Well, we need this
- **[02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bN3vjumXPLU&t=179s)** — to track diseases and other things in our animals. Now, this is a country that as far
- **[03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bN3vjumXPLU&t=186s)** — as I'm aware has never ever, ever once had a significant animal. Have you ever been
- **[03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bN3vjumXPLU&t=191s)** — perusing the newspaper or listening to the nightly news? And it's Ireland epicenter of
- **[03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bN3vjumXPLU&t=198s)** — animal disease outbreak that rocks. So on the one hand, congresswoman Hageman and others
- **[03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bN3vjumXPLU&t=205s)** — have pointed out this idea we need a new system to deal with animal disease outbreaks
- **[03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bN3vjumXPLU&t=212s)** — has no evidence at all. We've never had an animal disease outbreak in America.
- **[03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bN3vjumXPLU&t=217s)** — Get out of hand. No other country that's implemented this program has even had, you know,
- **[03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bN3vjumXPLU&t=225s)** — nationally, let alone globally, significant animal disease outbreaks.
- **[03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bN3vjumXPLU&t=229s)** — I mean, even in Ireland, I think a year later, right, they announced the need to
- **[03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bN3vjumXPLU&t=234s)** — call which aka that means kill right? Yeah, 41,000 livestock because to me climate change
- **[04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bN3vjumXPLU&t=242s)** — targets, right? Yeah. And that's one of the, you know, what's really going on here.
- **[04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bN3vjumXPLU&t=249s)** — When you look at what the industry is saying about this. And then what, you know, non
- **[04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bN3vjumXPLU&t=255s)** — governmental organizations, NGOs and what like are saying about this is, I think your listeners
- **[04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bN3vjumXPLU&t=261s)** — already well aware, there's been a huge push to get Americans in Western countries to eat less
- **[04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bN3vjumXPLU&t=268s)** — meat. Yep. You know, since we just had the hurricane, I always love there's this really
- **[04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bN3vjumXPLU&t=274s)** — funny man, my friends always post after natural disasters, and has a grocery store looks like
- **[04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bN3vjumXPLU&t=280s)** — it's straight out of the Walking Dead. There's nothing left on the shelves, except for the
- **[04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bN3vjumXPLU&t=289s)** — natural disaster people would rather die. Fake, fake meat foods, fake meat substitutes,
- **[04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bN3vjumXPLU&t=297s)** — the World Economic Forum, the World Health Organization, the United Nations,
- **[05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bN3vjumXPLU&t=303s)** — listeners can easily go look up their push to get people to eat less meat. Yep. They want
- **[05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bN3vjumXPLU&t=311s)** — them to eat less meat because they say it's bad for us, which is ridiculous. They want us
- **[05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bN3vjumXPLU&t=315s)** — eat less meat because it's harmful to the environment, which to anybody who's ever been
- **[05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bN3vjumXPLU&t=320s)** — on a pastured cattle farm, versus any other type of environmental use of land would know how
- **[05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bN3vjumXPLU&t=327s)** — absolutely insane such a claim is. But the real reason they want us to eat less meat
- **[05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bN3vjumXPLU&t=333s)** — is because they want us to eat bugs, and they want us to eat plants. And nobody's doing it.
- **[05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bN3vjumXPLU&t=340s)** — Yeah. No amount of propaganda, no amount of subsidization has successfully gotten a large
- **[05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bN3vjumXPLU&t=347s)** — number of Westerners to adopt a plant bug-based diet. So now in certain countries, they're
- **[05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bN3vjumXPLU&t=356s)** — using EID, RFID. And those are... that stands for electronic ID identification. Yeah. RFID was
- **[06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bN3vjumXPLU&t=365s)** — one of the earlier names for it, radio frequency identification. Now it's often being called EID,
- **[06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bN3vjumXPLU&t=371s)** — electronic identification of animals. And so in these countries, they'll roll it out under
- **[06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bN3vjumXPLU&t=376s)** — safety. And then lo and behold, within a few years, they're then using it for environmental
- **[06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bN3vjumXPLU&t=383s)** — reasons and trying to force farmers to radically reduce the number of livestock.
- **[06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bN3vjumXPLU&t=389s)** — Because what will happen if we radically reduce the number of livestock?
- **[06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bN3vjumXPLU&t=394s)** — They have a solution waiting for us, but it's kind of like a... it's a little bit of a bait and
- **[06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bN3vjumXPLU&t=397s)** — switch. And I'm being sarcastic because it's a lot of bait and switch. They come in with this
- **[06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bN3vjumXPLU&t=403s)** — apparent, oh yeah, safety, we're going to protect the farmer. But these farmers are
- **[06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bN3vjumXPLU&t=408s)** — being wiped out. Right? What happened in Michigan? Michigan, I think it was around
- **[06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bN3vjumXPLU&t=414s)** — 2000, somewhere between 2007 and 11. I believe they implemented EID type tracking.
- **[07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bN3vjumXPLU&t=421s)** — And a number of groups looked at the performance... what happened to the Michigan
- **[07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bN3vjumXPLU&t=426s)** — farm economy and farm base compared to states that did not require electronic
- **[07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bN3vjumXPLU&t=432s)** — tracking and stuff. And Michigan was just a nightmare. They lost significantly more farms.
- **[07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bN3vjumXPLU&t=440s)** — I think it was over 4000 farms, wasn't it? Yeah, just a very, very large number of farms
- **[07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bN3vjumXPLU&t=445s)** — and you know, maybe this will help listeners. Why? Why would changing an ear tag
- **[07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bN3vjumXPLU&t=452s)** — cause you to lose more farmers? Yeah, because all of these things are more labor,
- **[07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bN3vjumXPLU&t=458s)** — more compliance, more cost that gets passed on to your farmer, which means at the end
- **[07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bN3vjumXPLU&t=465s)** — of the day, you eventually see this on your plate. You know, if farmers are forced to call
- **[07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bN3vjumXPLU&t=473s)** — animals under the guise of environmental reasons, or under the guise of eggs during
- **[08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bN3vjumXPLU&t=480s)** — coronavirus. Eggs went up in price, eggs still haven't came all the way back down.
- **[08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bN3vjumXPLU&t=486s)** — Well, why? Because there was forced calling of large numbers of chickens and whatnot.
- **[08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bN3vjumXPLU&t=492s)** — It's funny how they use even they use that word calling. I mean, it sounds benign.
- **[08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bN3vjumXPLU&t=497s)** — It's like, why don't you say killing? Yeah, one of the differences though,
- **[08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bN3vjumXPLU&t=500s)** — often when animals are called, they're not allowed to go into the food supply.
- **[08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bN3vjumXPLU&t=505s)** — When chicken houses are liquidated, that's literally the you know, so you'll have these
- **[08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bN3vjumXPLU&t=509s)** — large KFO chicken houses. If they get a disease in one of these houses, they quite literally
- **[08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bN3vjumXPLU&t=517s)** — liquidate the whole house. I think they use nitrogen gas or some other gas, and they gas
- **[08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bN3vjumXPLU&t=523s)** — the entire house, kill all of the chickens, and then bury them in a giant landfill hole,
- **[08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bN3vjumXPLU&t=529s)** — taking stuff out of the food supply to where people can no longer access it. This just
- **[08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bN3vjumXPLU&t=536s)** — happened to the Strong Sisters farm in Michigan. A number of months ago, they had pigs at a
- **[09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bN3vjumXPLU&t=542s)** — butcher in Indiana, and they went to pick up the pigs that had been slaughtered and dressed
- **[09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bN3vjumXPLU&t=549s)** — and whatnot. And I think they're going to take them to another facility then to be cut up,
- **[09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bN3vjumXPLU&t=554s)** — turned into sausage and other things. And health inspectors forced them to call those pigs.
- **[09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bN3vjumXPLU&t=562s)** — They poured motor oil on the carcasses so that they could not go into the food supply.
- **[09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bN3vjumXPLU&t=569s)** — Incredible. Incredible. You know, what's so ironic is they're going after the key
- **[09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bN3vjumXPLU&t=578s)** — food that actually is probably the most healing food that you can eat is grass-fed red meat.
- **[09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bN3vjumXPLU&t=583s)** — And I find it very interesting. I mean, that's how I turn my health around. And so many others
- **[09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bN3vjumXPLU&t=588s)** — are using red meat to heal their bodies. And of course, out of all the things, yeah,
- **[09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bN3vjumXPLU&t=593s)** — we have to get rid of that. This is what I want to know. Like the tagging,
- **[09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bN3vjumXPLU&t=596s)** — does this also involve all livestock, even the big companies or just the small farms or
- **[10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bN3vjumXPLU&t=602s)** — just everyone? So the current version that's going to go into effect November 5th,
- **[10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bN3vjumXPLU&t=609s)** — there's some debate of what version it is at the moment. I was actually just talking with somebody
- **[10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bN3vjumXPLU&t=614s)** — this morning before you and I talked, because originally the rule was only going to apply to
- **[10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bN3vjumXPLU&t=621s)** — STEERS traveling for interstate commerce. But last I heard they've already expanded on this
- **[10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bN3vjumXPLU&t=627s)** — rule. But to some extent, it doesn't matter what the current version they're rolling out is,
- **[10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bN3vjumXPLU&t=633s)** — back in the early 2000s, they told us what program they really want. It was called the
- **[10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bN3vjumXPLU&t=639s)** — National Animal Identification System, NACE. And it would require every farmer and homesteader in
- **[10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bN3vjumXPLU&t=648s)** — America to individually radio frequency ID tag every single livestock animal they have.
- **[10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bN3vjumXPLU&t=657s)** — Cattle, pork, chickens, lamb, goats, you just name it. The program came with a 1-800 phone
- **[11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bN3vjumXPLU&t=664s)** — number. The perennial question, why did the chicken cross the road? The USDA did not want
- **[11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bN3vjumXPLU&t=669s)** — to know why the chicken crossed the road, but you had 24 hours to report when and where the
- **[11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bN3vjumXPLU&t=675s)** — chicken crossed the road to the government or face, I believe it was a $500 fine per animal
- **[11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bN3vjumXPLU&t=682s)** — fence. Now what made this program really interesting though, is it exempted confinement
- **[11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bN3vjumXPLU&t=689s)** — animal feeding operations. No, no way. I mean, it logically makes sense. Why would you need
- **[11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bN3vjumXPLU&t=697s)** — to track an animal that is trapped in a concrete barn and is never going anywhere its
- **[11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bN3vjumXPLU&t=702s)** — entire life? Homesteaders, farmers and whatnot, we would have to do this. We would have to
- **[11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bN3vjumXPLU&t=709s)** — phone calls. We would have to keep very stringent records on all of our animals.
- **[11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bN3vjumXPLU&t=715s)** — Butchers would not be allowed to accept animals that do not have the upgraded animal
- **[12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bN3vjumXPLU&t=720s)** — ear tagging. But if you're a CAFO, well, your animals are never going anywhere anyway.
- **[12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bN3vjumXPLU&t=726s)** — So just tell us what CAFO stands for? Confined animal feeding operation. So this is where
- **[12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bN3vjumXPLU&t=733s)** — the vast majority of animals in America, the vast majority of beef is still born right where I'm
- **[12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bN3vjumXPLU&t=740s)** — sitting on farms like mine. So the vast majority of beef in America starts somewhere like this.
- **[12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bN3vjumXPLU&t=746s)** — But then they're sold at auctions, which that'd be a whole other story for your listeners,
- **[12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bN3vjumXPLU&t=751s)** — the broken beef auction system, where you go to the auction house and there's 200, 300 sellers.
- **[12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bN3vjumXPLU&t=759s)** — And guess how many buyers show up to buy cattle? How many? One or two. Because why would the four
- **[12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bN3vjumXPLU&t=766s)** — or five big beef companies bid against each other? Why would they give farmers more money?
- **[12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bN3vjumXPLU&t=773s)** — When, hey, you go to that auction, Tim, and Jeff, you go to this other auction and
- **[12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bN3vjumXPLU&t=779s)** — will never be bidding against each other. Wow. And so all this beef starts in places like
- **[13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bN3vjumXPLU&t=787s)** — here, but it goes through these auction houses and then the beef get relocated to these feed lots,
- **[13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bN3vjumXPLU&t=793s)** — which you're very familiar with and your listeners have heard of, where they will have
- **[13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bN3vjumXPLU&t=798s)** — thousands and thousands of cattle basically sitting in mud pits, being fed nothing but
- **[13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bN3vjumXPLU&t=804s)** — corn and soy to quickly fatten them up until they run them through the processing facilities.
- **[13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bN3vjumXPLU&t=811s)** — Yeah. You know, pigs and chickens, though, are often raised their entire lives
- **[13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bN3vjumXPLU&t=818s)** — in enclosed barn structures. So animal housing units and other things, as they're called.
- **[13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bN3vjumXPLU&t=825s)** — In China, I want to say they were building something like a hundred thousand pig
- **[13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bN3vjumXPLU&t=831s)** — confinement farming operation. It's like the size of a small city, this building that's going
- **[13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bN3vjumXPLU&t=838s)** — to house over 10,000 sows alone and then all of the piglets. Terrible. Yeah, I have two pigs
- **[14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bN3vjumXPLU&t=846s)** — and they get five acres. So that's a lot of space, a lot of exercise. This bill, they try
- **[14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bN3vjumXPLU&t=853s)** — to pass it a couple times, but with your persistence and help, you got it defeated.
- **[14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bN3vjumXPLU&t=860s)** — But then you're saying it's coming up one more time to be voted on? Well, no. So this is
- **[14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bN3vjumXPLU&t=868s)** — actually the way the USDA is doing this. And this is just one of the problems with how these
- **[14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bN3vjumXPLU&t=873s)** — agencies operate. They can write what they call rules without a bill or law ever having been
- **[14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bN3vjumXPLU&t=880s)** — passed. So the NACE is a program created by the USDA out of thin air by them just basically
- **[14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bN3vjumXPLU&t=891s)** — grabbing a sheet of paper and some Crayola crayons and going, you got to put these tags on your
- **[14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bN3vjumXPLU&t=897s)** — animals. And so we have a bill in Congress and the Senate. It is Congresswoman Harriet
- **[15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bN3vjumXPLU&t=905s)** — Hageman's bill to stop the USDA from doing this. She has successfully stopped RFID,
- **[15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bN3vjumXPLU&t=914s)** — I think on two or three different occasions now, either through bills or through lawsuits.
- **[15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bN3vjumXPLU&t=920s)** — You know, in 2009, we stopped it through protests. And farmers like Wendell Berry and
- **[15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bN3vjumXPLU&t=927s)** — Joel Salatin and others saying, we're just not going to tag our animals. You'll have to take
- **[15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bN3vjumXPLU&t=933s)** — us to jail before we start throwing these tags on. Wow. Okay. So is this a national
- **[15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bN3vjumXPLU&t=939s)** — program or does it go state by state? This is national. So this is a national program
- **[15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bN3vjumXPLU&t=945s)** — from the USDA. And again, they've tried to get people to accept it this time
- **[15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bN3vjumXPLU&t=951s)** — by rolling back everything that's involved, which is why I've been out there sounding the
- **[15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bN3vjumXPLU&t=957s)** — fire alarm because their goal is to get people not to care as much because it's only
- **[16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bN3vjumXPLU&t=963s)** — interstate steers or maybe it's only interstate steers now and dairy cattle.
- **[16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bN3vjumXPLU&t=969s)** — But they've told us repeatedly for two decades, what they want is a universal livestock tracing
- **[16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bN3vjumXPLU&t=977s)** — system that gives them complete and total knowledge of location and numbers of every
- **[16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bN3vjumXPLU&t=984s)** — livestock animal in the nation. So what can an average person do about this? Because
- **[16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bN3vjumXPLU&t=992s)** — there's sometimes it's kind of hopeless and overwhelming. Well, the good news is it was
- **[16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bN3vjumXPLU&t=996s)** — the average people who stopped this program in 2009. The protests I went to for the USDA
- **[16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bN3vjumXPLU&t=1004s)** — listening hearings for every one farmer that was there, there was 10 people eating. And
- **[16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bN3vjumXPLU&t=1011s)** — that's why people like you are so important because the majority of your audience are eaters
- **[16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bN3vjumXPLU&t=1017s)** — and they're just always like, well, I'm not a farmer. And that's why we need you
- **[17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bN3vjumXPLU&t=1021s)** — to speak up for your farmers because America I think is now down to maybe only two or three
- **[17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bN3vjumXPLU&t=1029s)** — million farming households in the nation. Contrast that with just a hundred years ago,
- **[17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bN3vjumXPLU&t=1038s)** — 50% of American households were farming households. Wow. Incredible. And now it's
- **[17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bN3vjumXPLU&t=1045s)** — just two or three million total farming households are left. There's not enough
- **[17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bN3vjumXPLU&t=1049s)** — farmers left to successfully push back anymore against basically the calling of the farmers
- **[17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bN3vjumXPLU&t=1057s)** — themselves at this point. So, you know, your listeners, average people, it really starts with
- **[17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bN3vjumXPLU&t=1064s)** — you buying your food directly from local farmers. That is one of the biggest things you
- **[17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bN3vjumXPLU&t=1070s)** — can do is reallocate where you're spending your money. So your cows are no longer going
- **[17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bN3vjumXPLU&t=1076s)** — through these feed lots and through all of these just atrocious systems and places.
- **[18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bN3vjumXPLU&t=1083s)** — For helping stop RFID proper, you can call your Congress person or your Senator.
- **[18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bN3vjumXPLU&t=1090s)** — Really it's best to call both and ask them to support Hageman's amendment that would stop
- **[18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bN3vjumXPLU&t=1097s)** — the USDA from being able to require RFID tagging on animals of any kind. And so what we'll
- **[18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bN3vjumXPLU&t=1103s)** — just in the description, we'll put this information specifically so they can remember it. But I think
- **[18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bN3vjumXPLU&t=1108s)** — everyone needs to step up the table and do something about it because if we have
- **[18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bN3vjumXPLU&t=1113s)** — a number of people do this, then they're not going to pass it or actually it's going to be
- **[18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bN3vjumXPLU&t=1118s)** — defeated. Yeah. And other things you can do, some farmers still don't even realize this is
- **[18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bN3vjumXPLU&t=1124s)** — happening in November. The USDA did a very good... they learned from their mistakes previously
- **[18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bN3vjumXPLU&t=1130s)** — where they'd announced this very broadly it was happening. So they would get a lot of pushback.
- **[18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bN3vjumXPLU&t=1136s)** — This time they've been very, very quiet about the implementation of the program.
- **[19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bN3vjumXPLU&t=1142s)** — Because they're like, well, it's just for one small type of animal. So this has really
- **[19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bN3vjumXPLU&t=1148s)** — flown under the radar over the last year. So letting your farmer know that this is going
- **[19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bN3vjumXPLU&t=1154s)** — letting butchers know this is going to happen and getting them on board with not complying.
- **[19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bN3vjumXPLU&t=1162s)** — I've been able to get some butchering associations, homesteaders, farmers,
- **[19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bN3vjumXPLU&t=1168s)** — non-compliance and your farmer knowing that you will support them if they don't comply
- **[19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bN3vjumXPLU&t=1174s)** — is really, really crucial. Years ago when my buying club was rated,
- **[19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bN3vjumXPLU&t=1180s)** — one of the reasons I was willing to stand up to my state health department
- **[19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bN3vjumXPLU&t=1184s)** — to protect people's access to food in Kentucky is I had people who said to me,
- **[19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bN3vjumXPLU&t=1190s)** — if you will fight for this, even if it means you're going to jail, we'll make sure your
- **[19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bN3vjumXPLU&t=1196s)** — wife and kids are taken care of while this happens. Your farmers need that kind of
- **[20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bN3vjumXPLU&t=1200s)** — committed support to be willing to risk running afoul, you know, of the USDA.
- **[20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bN3vjumXPLU&t=1206s)** — So there's also a seminar. There's I think there's two seminars. There's one in November,
- **[20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bN3vjumXPLU&t=1212s)** — then there's one next year. Tell us about this seminar, what that's all about.
- **[20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bN3vjumXPLU&t=1216s)** — Yeah. So years ago, Joel Saliton, you had him on your show a couple months ago.
- **[20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bN3vjumXPLU&t=1220s)** — I think people loved it. Joel approached me about starting a conference to organize pushback
- **[20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bN3vjumXPLU&t=1227s)** — against all of this regulation that makes accessing real food so hard and so expensive.
- **[20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bN3vjumXPLU&t=1235s)** — And we named it the rogue food conference. So and our next one is in November, November,
- **[20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bN3vjumXPLU&t=1242s)** — I think it's eighth and ninth in Dallas, Fort Worth. It's actually on the Fort Worth side,
- **[20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bN3vjumXPLU&t=1248s)** — kind of north east, sorry, northwest side of the Dallas, Fort Worth area. And that church,
- **[20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bN3vjumXPLU&t=1253s)** — beautiful church, beautiful location. And the theme is going to be come and tag it.
- **[20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bN3vjumXPLU&t=1259s)** — And so the theme is people coming together to work together, not just to stop RFID,
- **[21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bN3vjumXPLU&t=1266s)** — but to really remind the government that we get to decide what we eat and who it comes from.
- **[21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bN3vjumXPLU&t=1272s)** — Years ago, there was a lawsuit that was filed against the federal government
- **[21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bN3vjumXPLU&t=1277s)** — over the interstate ban on the sale of raw milk. So there's supposedly an interstate ban
- **[21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bN3vjumXPLU&t=1285s)** — on transporting raw milk across state lines for sale. No law was ever passed for this, by the
- **[21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bN3vjumXPLU&t=1292s)** — way. This is once again, some government agency, some government bureaucrat grabbing colored
- **[21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bN3vjumXPLU&t=1298s)** — pencils and making law out of thin air. Some people sued over this interstate ban on the sale
- **[21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bN3vjumXPLU&t=1305s)** — of raw milk. The government's response to this lawsuit is startling. If you've never seen
- **[21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bN3vjumXPLU&t=1312s)** — it, I'll send it to you afterwards because you might want to just read it to your listeners
- **[21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bN3vjumXPLU&t=1315s)** — sometimes. But in this response, they say things like, there is no fundamental right
- **[22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bN3vjumXPLU&t=1323s)** — to choose what you eat or what you feed your family. There is no fundamental right to food.
- **[22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bN3vjumXPLU&t=1333s)** — They went point by point basically to saying, we are the final arbiter of what food is and
- **[22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bN3vjumXPLU&t=1340s)** — we're the final decider of who you can get food from. Wow, that's totally 100,000% insane. That
- **[22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bN3vjumXPLU&t=1347s)** — is crazy. I'll have to put the link down below so people can read that. And also,
- **[22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bN3vjumXPLU&t=1354s)** — we'll put the link for this seminar in November. Is it October or November? November,
- **[22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bN3vjumXPLU&t=1360s)** — November 8th and 9th, Dallas, Fort Worth. So rogue food conference, come and tag it.
- **[22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bN3vjumXPLU&t=1366s)** — And then we're going to be down in Florida in March, doing a rogue health and wellness in
- **[22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bN3vjumXPLU&t=1372s)** — Florida for people who need some vitamin D come deep winter. Yeah. Yeah. So and then just
- **[23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bN3vjumXPLU&t=1381s)** — as a side note, I just think this is fascinating. Tell the listeners what happened
- **[23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bN3vjumXPLU&t=1387s)** — to you. You got raided and how you overcame that raid. Yeah. So it was Memorial Day weekend,
- **[23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bN3vjumXPLU&t=1394s)** — 2011. This was at the height of the government shutting down raw milk farmers, local food
- **[23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bN3vjumXPLU&t=1403s)** — buying clubs, you know, basically anybody who was a little too successful at local food.
- **[23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bN3vjumXPLU&t=1411s)** — The government went on a decades long rampage trying to shut them down, put them in jail,
- **[23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bN3vjumXPLU&t=1419s)** — find them out of existence. So you can go on YouTube, see the video footage of raw some
- **[23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bN3vjumXPLU&t=1426s)** — food co-op in California. So this is like total hippie California people. And
- **[23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bN3vjumXPLU&t=1433s)** — all of these police and SWAT people are running through raw some co-op with guns drawn
- **[23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bN3vjumXPLU&t=1439s)** — as if the hippies and the kale are going to shoot back. Right. Just totally absurd things.
- **[24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bN3vjumXPLU&t=1445s)** — So we were raided and served cease and desist and quarantine orders Memorial Day weekend, 2011.
- **[24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bN3vjumXPLU&t=1453s)** — Up until that point, pretty much everybody who'd been raided or faced the government had
- **[24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bN3vjumXPLU&t=1459s)** — been shut down or lost. And we were just really, really fortunate that all of my
- **[24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bN3vjumXPLU&t=1464s)** — buying club members almost like 90% of the members were all willing to go to jail with me.
- **[24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bN3vjumXPLU&t=1470s)** — Wow. And so my strategy for beating the Kentucky health department was pretty simple.
- **[24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bN3vjumXPLU&t=1477s)** — I look really bad in prison stripes. And so if I'm going to jail, I'm going to jail with
- **[24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bN3vjumXPLU&t=1484s)** — friends. And so I took two sheets of paper on one sheet of paper. I typed up the pertinent
- **[24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bN3vjumXPLU&t=1492s)** — sections of the Kentucky state constitution. And then on the second sheet of paper,
- **[24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bN3vjumXPLU&t=1498s)** — I put a simple line at the top and it said, I be undersigned in accord with my God given
- **[25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bN3vjumXPLU&t=1505s)** — in Kentucky constitutional rights and taking my milk from my cows.
- **[25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bN3vjumXPLU&t=1512s)** — And if anyone at the Kentucky State Department of Health would like to talk with me about this,
- **[25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bN3vjumXPLU&t=1518s)** — they can reach me at the name and phone number below. I put these two sheets of paper
- **[25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bN3vjumXPLU&t=1522s)** — right next to the cease and desist and quarantine orders. Because I wanted people
- **[25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bN3vjumXPLU&t=1527s)** — to know that cease and desist and quarantine orders are real credible threats. It was something
- **[25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bN3vjumXPLU&t=1532s)** — like a minimum of 30 to 90 days in jail for breaking a cease and desist and quarantine order,
- **[25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bN3vjumXPLU&t=1538s)** — a minimum of five to $10,000 in fines. So I didn't want to dupe people into doing this.
- **[25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bN3vjumXPLU&t=1546s)** — I wanted them to fully know like, if you sign this with me, this is what they're
- **[25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bN3vjumXPLU&t=1552s)** — threatening us over milk. So I put the cease and desist and quarantine orders,
- **[25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bN3vjumXPLU&t=1556s)** — I put these sheets of paper, and we had like 90% of our members choose to break the quarantine
- **[26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bN3vjumXPLU&t=1563s)** — and take their milk anyway. So then I went on a media campaign to make the Kentucky Health
- **[26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bN3vjumXPLU&t=1572s)** — Department look really, really bad. You know, because like I live in Kentucky, I always
- **[26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bN3vjumXPLU&t=1582s)** — roughly 80% of all smokers of America who are left smoking still live in Kentucky.
- **[26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bN3vjumXPLU&t=1587s)** — And 100% of them seem to live in my county. We have a gas station just up the road from my
- **[26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bN3vjumXPLU&t=1593s)** — farm. And it almost seems like a lot of my neighbors exclusively eat breakfast, lunch,
- **[26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bN3vjumXPLU&t=1599s)** — and dinner out of that gas station diner. You look at the data on health, especially in
- **[26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bN3vjumXPLU&t=1607s)** — these, you know, these southern central states, it's terrifying. So I would go on radio shows and
- **[26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bN3vjumXPLU&t=1615s)** — other places and I'd just be like, I don't understand why the health department is spending
- **[27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bN3vjumXPLU&t=1621s)** — all of this energy on people who are desperately trying to be healthy,
- **[27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bN3vjumXPLU&t=1627s)** — desperately trying to raise healthy families, while Kentucky literally has a smoking,
- **[27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bN3vjumXPLU&t=1633s)** — opioid, obesity, diabetes, heart disease, cancer epidemic.
- **[27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bN3vjumXPLU&t=1641s)** — And so I just asked this question to get people thinking about like,
- **[27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bN3vjumXPLU&t=1647s)** — why does the government spend an inordinate amount of time and money
- **[27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bN3vjumXPLU&t=1651s)** — trying to make it so hard for people to access healthy food?
- **[27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bN3vjumXPLU&t=1655s)** — Right. It's like, it's almost as if they want to make us sick. And again, being very
- **[27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bN3vjumXPLU&t=1662s)** — sarcastic. What was the final thing of that story? What happened? Yeah. So it took about a
- **[27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bN3vjumXPLU&t=1667s)** — week, but on Wednesday night or Thursday morning, I started to get emails from some of my buying
- **[27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bN3vjumXPLU&t=1673s)** — club members where they were forwarding something from the health department. And the health
- **[27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bN3vjumXPLU&t=1678s)** — department never said they did something wrong. They never apologized. But the email basically
- **[28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bN3vjumXPLU&t=1684s)** — said that there had been a misunderstanding, you know, because sending people to a private
- **[28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bN3vjumXPLU&t=1691s)** — buying club where people are merely picking up food from local farmers and threatening them
- **[28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bN3vjumXPLU&t=1696s)** — all with fines and jail is just a misunderstanding. But they completely walked away. And the best
- **[28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bN3vjumXPLU&t=1704s)** — news for us has been ever since that, that's 13 years ago now, unless a farmer in Kentucky
- **[28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bN3vjumXPLU&t=1712s)** — does something really silly, like tries to sell raw milk on Craigslist or Facebook Marketplace,
- **[28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bN3vjumXPLU&t=1720s)** — the Kentucky health department has left raw milk alone in our state. Raw milk has been
- **[28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bN3vjumXPLU&t=1726s)** — allowed to thrive because a bunch of good people up in Louisville, just like moms with babies
- **[28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bN3vjumXPLU&t=1733s)** — and dads who are plumbers and doctors and professors and accountants, they were willing
- **[28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bN3vjumXPLU&t=1739s)** — just to sign a single sheet of paper and see if the government would come and take it.
- **[29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bN3vjumXPLU&t=1746s)** — You know, I think the moral of the story is just that we all can do something about it. And you
- **[29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bN3vjumXPLU&t=1751s)** — have to not leave it for the other guy. You have to personally stand up and fight for this,
- **[29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bN3vjumXPLU&t=1757s)** — your food. And they don't want to be embarrassed. So they'll they back down. So
- **[29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bN3vjumXPLU&t=1762s)** — that's amazing. That's an amazing story. So thank goodness we got people like you that are
- **[29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bN3vjumXPLU&t=1768s)** — like setting the trend or at least figuring it out so other people can do similar things.
- **[29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bN3vjumXPLU&t=1773s)** — Well, again, like I'm only not in jail because my members agreed with me
- **[29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bN3vjumXPLU&t=1780s)** — that I'm the sole arbiter of who gets to decide what my family eats and where it comes from.
- **[29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bN3vjumXPLU&t=1786s)** — And that's why Joel and I are doing rogue food in Dallas this year, moving it to Texas.
- **[29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bN3vjumXPLU&t=1792s)** — Listeners that are down in that region, come join us. Because I'm just one person.
- **[29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bN3vjumXPLU&t=1799s)** — I'm easy for the government to jail, get rid of silence. A friend was pointing out this morning
- **[30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bN3vjumXPLU&t=1806s)** — that he was searching for rogue food conference on podcasts and stuff and other places.
- **[30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bN3vjumXPLU&t=1811s)** — And he's like, you're clearly being censored. You know, because he put it in, he's like,
- **[30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bN3vjumXPLU&t=1816s)** — I don't see it anywhere. He's like, you've been on you and Joel have done 20 podcasts
- **[30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bN3vjumXPLU&t=1821s)** — in three weeks. And it doesn't show up in any search results. Because the thing
- **[30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bN3vjumXPLU&t=1826s)** — corporations and governments fear most are people who actually take action.
- **[30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bN3vjumXPLU&t=1832s)** — And people who realize, I really can make a difference. I'm not as helpless as they're
- **[30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bN3vjumXPLU&t=1838s)** — trying to make me feel and think I am. Right. Right. And so I'm going to put these links
- **[30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bN3vjumXPLU&t=1844s)** — down below. So I think we really appreciate if everyone contacts their representative and tells
- **[30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bN3vjumXPLU&t=1851s)** — them that you object to this. And this crazy stupid bill. And I guess we'll just put the
- **[30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bN3vjumXPLU&t=1857s)** — details as well. So everyone can not have to memorize that. Amazing. John, I really
- **[31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bN3vjumXPLU&t=1864s)** — appreciate you coming on. This is going to be, I think, a really big deal to stop this
- **[31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bN3vjumXPLU&t=1868s)** — because it's at the heart of healing someone is the grass fed meat. So thank you for being
- **[31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bN3vjumXPLU&t=1874s)** — on. And we'll have to do an update really soon to see what happens after this November
- **[31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bN3vjumXPLU&t=1880s)** — thing. And again, thank you so much for your work. Since getting to know you now over the
- **[31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bN3vjumXPLU&t=1885s)** — course of the last few months, we've had like friends from all over through our house and
- **[31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bN3vjumXPLU&t=1890s)** — they're like, oh, they're like, I love Dr. Berg. You know, love his videos. I love what he's
- **[31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bN3vjumXPLU&t=1895s)** — doing. And so you, you know, men like you are making such a difference for small farmers and
- **[31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bN3vjumXPLU&t=1901s)** — homesteaders because you're using your influence not to enrich yourself, but to enrich everybody.
- **[31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bN3vjumXPLU&t=1908s)** — I just want to thank you for that. Hey, my pleasure. Thank you.

- **[00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NJFOF_VEwFs&t=0s)** — I like to share with you the number one absolute worst food that you could consume for your liver,
- **[00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NJFOF_VEwFs&t=9s)** — especially if you're concerned about developing a fatty liver. And hint, it's not sugar, it's not
- **[00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NJFOF_VEwFs&t=18s)** — carbs, and this particular ingredient is not even high fructose corn syrup. Even though sugar,
- **[00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NJFOF_VEwFs&t=24s)** — starch, and high fructose corn syrup is really bad for the liver, there's something much worse. Now,
- **[00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NJFOF_VEwFs&t=30s)** — the big problem with the liver is that there's very few symptoms that occur with the liver.
- **[00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NJFOF_VEwFs&t=35s)** — I had a liver problem for probably, I don't know, 22 years. I didn't know it was a liver problem.
- **[00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NJFOF_VEwFs&t=42s)** — Now, I did have some symptoms, but I didn't connect the dots. A lot of my symptoms were
- **[00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NJFOF_VEwFs&t=47s)** — my right shoulder, right through this trap right here, and right back into on the back of
- **[00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NJFOF_VEwFs&t=53s)** — the scapula, and then also right underneath my right rib cage, like right here. It was just always
- **[01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NJFOF_VEwFs&t=61s)** — just completely, you know, painful, sore, tight, and bloated. For years, I didn't know what that was.
- **[01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NJFOF_VEwFs&t=70s)** — Of course, this problem down here was my bile duct, like the little tubes that connect to the
- **[01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NJFOF_VEwFs&t=75s)** — gallbladder, but that's part of the liver because the liver makes bile. So, I had this
- **[01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NJFOF_VEwFs&t=80s)** — problem for a very long time, and that's why I do a lot of videos on the liver because
- **[01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NJFOF_VEwFs&t=85s)** — I completely reversed it. And that's one big myth that I want to talk about because
- **[01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NJFOF_VEwFs&t=90s)** — people think that once you have a liver problem, you always have a liver problem. Absolutely
- **[01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NJFOF_VEwFs&t=94s)** — not. The liver is so robust and so rugged. It's one of the only organs that can completely,
- **[01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NJFOF_VEwFs&t=101s)** — 100% regenerate. So, that's one myth. Another myth is that the liver is filled with toxins.
- **[01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NJFOF_VEwFs&t=108s)** — It's very toxic. That's not true. The liver detoxifies poisons. It doesn't store
- **[01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NJFOF_VEwFs&t=117s)** — poisons. The fat cells store poisons. The liver gets rid of the toxins. Once the liver gets
- **[02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NJFOF_VEwFs&t=124s)** — to the point where it starts developing scar tissue and getting into cirrhosis, the risk
- **[02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NJFOF_VEwFs&t=131s)** — of getting liver cancer goes way up. The treatment that the medical profession has is not
- **[02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NJFOF_VEwFs&t=137s)** — very good. It's just like liver transplant. Get on the list. And there's not a lot of people
- **[02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NJFOF_VEwFs&t=142s)** — that have healthy livers to give you. You're playing this waiting game. Hopefully, you'll be
- **[02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NJFOF_VEwFs&t=146s)** — able to survive to the point where you can get a liver. Then if you get a liver, you have to
- **[02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NJFOF_VEwFs&t=151s)** — take anti-rejection medication like prednisone. And now you got to deal with those side
- **[02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NJFOF_VEwFs&t=157s)** — effects. The simple solution is you want to prevent a liver problem. Now, there is a very
- **[02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NJFOF_VEwFs&t=163s)** — interesting study on rats that I want to tell you. And there's three groups of rats. And in the
- **[02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NJFOF_VEwFs&t=169s)** — first group, they fed lard and alcohol to these rats. Okay, lard is pig fat. Second group, they
- **[02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NJFOF_VEwFs&t=177s)** — fed beef fat. It's called tallow and alcohol to these rats. And then in the third group,
- **[03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NJFOF_VEwFs&t=183s)** — they fed them corn oil and alcohol. Now, what's interesting is the first group, the lard and
- **[03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NJFOF_VEwFs&t=190s)** — alcohol, had minimal damage to the livers. And then this test, they were testing for like liver
- **[03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NJFOF_VEwFs&t=195s)** — damage and then the development into a fatty liver because there was alcohol involved. I kind
- **[03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NJFOF_VEwFs&t=201s)** — of wish they would have added one more group with this test, like a group of mice that only
- **[03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NJFOF_VEwFs&t=206s)** — consumed alcohol just to see what would happen. But anyway, the first group that had pig fat,
- **[03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NJFOF_VEwFs&t=212s)** — lard and alcohol, they had minimal damage to the liver. The next group with the tallow,
- **[03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NJFOF_VEwFs&t=217s)** — beef fat and alcohol, they had virtually no damage to the liver. What does that mean?
- **[03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NJFOF_VEwFs&t=224s)** — That means that beef fat could potentially be protective to the liver. That's one idea.
- **[03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NJFOF_VEwFs&t=229s)** — That's interesting. It's actually fascinating, especially since I consume a lot of beef fat in
- **[03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NJFOF_VEwFs&t=235s)** — my diet and I don't seem to have a lot of liver problems anymore. But then the third group
- **[04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NJFOF_VEwFs&t=240s)** — of rats that were fed corn oil and alcohol, guess what happened to them? Not good. Severe
- **[04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NJFOF_VEwFs&t=249s)** — liver damage is the most damage of all three groups. The worst food or ingredient we'll call
- **[04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NJFOF_VEwFs&t=256s)** — it for a fatty liver or a liver in general is seed oils. Seed oils are very inflammatory.
- **[04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NJFOF_VEwFs&t=265s)** — They're very damaging, especially the way that they're processed. Right here, you can see this
- **[04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NJFOF_VEwFs&t=270s)** — now. What's interesting about this seed oil right here, you see these pictures of the vegetable
- **[04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NJFOF_VEwFs&t=275s)** — oils because that's where it's called the vegetable oil. To me, that's like false advertising
- **[04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NJFOF_VEwFs&t=279s)** — because you're having vegetables on there thinking that that oil is coming from vegetables
- **[04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NJFOF_VEwFs&t=284s)** — when it's not. This is like soy oil. I think just a matter of time before these guys get
- **[04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NJFOF_VEwFs&t=292s)** — in trouble with advertising because it's not vegetable oil. But the specific type of fat
- **[04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NJFOF_VEwFs&t=298s)** — that's omega-6 that we're getting way too much, like an average person in the US gets between 25
- **[05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NJFOF_VEwFs&t=305s)** — to 30 percent of their calories, it's called linoleic acid. And so lard, pig fat, has about
- **[05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NJFOF_VEwFs&t=312s)** — 2.5 percent of it, linoleic acid. Taylor beef fat only has 0.7 percent linoleic acid.
- **[05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NJFOF_VEwFs&t=321s)** — That's like less than 1 percent. But corn oil has like 56.6 percent linoleic acid. So it's this
- **[05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NJFOF_VEwFs&t=330s)** — heated linoleic acid in the seed oils that are oxidized or damaged to the point where it can
- **[05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NJFOF_VEwFs&t=337s)** — create a lot of free radical damage in like a rusting out effect on your cells, especially
- **[05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NJFOF_VEwFs&t=344s)** — in the liver and the nervous system. And then from that, you get a lot of byproducts. I mean,
- **[05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NJFOF_VEwFs&t=351s)** — I've done several videos on this topic. If you haven't seen those, you can check them out. But
- **[05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NJFOF_VEwFs&t=355s)** — you want to get these oils out of your diet big time. Our diet is composed of way too much of
- **[06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NJFOF_VEwFs&t=361s)** — it, 25 to 30 percent of it. It's highly inflammatory. It also gets lodged and stuck in
- **[06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NJFOF_VEwFs&t=367s)** — our cells and our fat cells in the membranes around our nervous system for two to three years.
- **[06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NJFOF_VEwFs&t=376s)** — Yeah. So when you eat sugar, for example, you'll burn it off pretty fast. But when you can
- **[06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NJFOF_VEwFs&t=381s)** — something like this, it gets lodged in the body, it gets stuck in there. We can't even use it as
- **[06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NJFOF_VEwFs&t=387s)** — energy. So what are we using it as? Well, cell membranes, hormones. I mean, it's going right
- **[06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NJFOF_VEwFs&t=396s)** — into our tissues and creating all sorts of inflammation and especially inflammation in the
- **[06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NJFOF_VEwFs&t=402s)** — liver, which then leads to insulin resistance. And you should just start reading the ingredients
- **[06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NJFOF_VEwFs&t=409s)** — on things. And when you go to restaurants, right, just ask what type of oil are you frying
- **[06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NJFOF_VEwFs&t=413s)** — my food in? I would avoid anything fried at any fast food restaurant or any restaurant. I
- **[06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NJFOF_VEwFs&t=419s)** — would not consume them because you're just getting more of the soy oil, the corn oil,
- **[07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NJFOF_VEwFs&t=423s)** — maybe canola or cottonseed oil. You want to avoid that for at least two to three years
- **[07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NJFOF_VEwFs&t=429s)** — to get it out of the system. Create a demonstration on yourself how good you could
- **[07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NJFOF_VEwFs&t=433s)** — actually were to replace that crappy oil with something healthier. You want to start replacing
- **[07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NJFOF_VEwFs&t=440s)** — with omega-3 fatty acids. That would be like the fish oils, the olive oil, things like that.
- **[07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NJFOF_VEwFs&t=445s)** — That oil is anti-inflammatory. They're not only using this severely damaged oxidative oil,
- **[07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NJFOF_VEwFs&t=451s)** — but they're reheating it over and over and over up to 100 or more times. I mean,
- **[07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NJFOF_VEwFs&t=457s)** — you imagine the amount of byproducts that are given off and the amount of
- **[07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NJFOF_VEwFs&t=463s)** — oxidative stress that's creating for your cells. So number one, remove the seed oils
- **[07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NJFOF_VEwFs&t=470s)** — from the diet. Start reading ingredients. Number two, start adding in more omega-3 fatty acids.
- **[07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NJFOF_VEwFs&t=477s)** — Number three, start decreasing the amount of animal foods like chicken,
- **[08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NJFOF_VEwFs&t=485s)** — turkey, even beef that are grain fed and even eggs are fed grains unless you can find
- **[08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NJFOF_VEwFs&t=493s)** — an egg that is higher in omega-3 fatty acids. The point is that you want to start cutting down
- **[08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NJFOF_VEwFs&t=498s)** — these seed oils and high omega-6 fats from your diet and replace this with grass-fed,
- **[08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NJFOF_VEwFs&t=506s)** — grass-finished beef, grass-fed lamb, grass-fed goat, grass-fed buffalo, things like that.
- **[08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NJFOF_VEwFs&t=513s)** — And I also don't think it would hurt if you also added cruciferous vegetables in there like
- **[08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NJFOF_VEwFs&t=517s)** — cabbage, sauerkraut, things like that because that's really good for the liver as well.
- **[08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NJFOF_VEwFs&t=522s)** — Now that you know the number one worst food for the liver, let's talk about what foods
- **[08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NJFOF_VEwFs&t=526s)** — are really good for the liver. And for that information, I put this video up right here.

- **[00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8zzRq8aMo8&t=0s)** — Most doctors know the side effects from taking medication.
- **[00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8zzRq8aMo8&t=3s)** — But what I don't think hardly any doctors really understand is the side effects from taking multiple drugs,
- **[00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8zzRq8aMo8&t=9s)** — the interaction between certain drugs.
- **[00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8zzRq8aMo8&t=11s)** — Let's talk about some really common medications that can actually cause dementia,
- **[00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8zzRq8aMo8&t=16s)** — or at least put you at a major risk for getting dementia.
- **[00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8zzRq8aMo8&t=19s)** — From my viewpoint, I would get really upset if I got a side effect, especially dementia, from another medication.
- **[00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8zzRq8aMo8&t=27s)** — Let's go through common drugs that have a known side effect of dementia.
- **[00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8zzRq8aMo8&t=31s)** — First category of drugs are those that block or inhibit acetylcholine.
- **[00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8zzRq8aMo8&t=36s)** — That's a neurotransmitter.
- **[00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8zzRq8aMo8&t=37s)** — These drugs include Benadryl, which is antihistamine, certain drugs for depression,
- **[00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8zzRq8aMo8&t=42s)** — as well as drugs that treat an overactive bladder.
- **[00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8zzRq8aMo8&t=46s)** — If someone's on these for a prolonged period of time, the risk for dementia goes way up.
- **[00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8zzRq8aMo8&t=50s)** — Next one is something called benzodiazepine.
- **[00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8zzRq8aMo8&t=54s)** — This drug treats anxiety, insomnia, and seizures.
- **[00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8zzRq8aMo8&t=57s)** — We're talking about Valium and Xanax.
- **[01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8zzRq8aMo8&t=60s)** — Apparently this drug affects the central nervous system, aka your brain,
- **[01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8zzRq8aMo8&t=64s)** — and it can greatly increase the risk of getting dementia.
- **[01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8zzRq8aMo8&t=66s)** — Then we have something called PPIs, proton pump inhibitors.
- **[01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8zzRq8aMo8&t=70s)** — Those medications treat indigestion, heartburn, like Prilocyte and Nexium.
- **[01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8zzRq8aMo8&t=76s)** — They can increase the risk of cognitive decline.
- **[01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8zzRq8aMo8&t=80s)** — Then the last one, which is a big one, is opioids, like morphine or oxycodone.
- **[01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8zzRq8aMo8&t=85s)** — Anything that creates sedation on the brain, like when you go in for surgery
- **[01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8zzRq8aMo8&t=89s)** — and they give you certain anesthetics,
- **[01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8zzRq8aMo8&t=90s)** — that can greatly affect your cognitive function leading to dementia.
- **[01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8zzRq8aMo8&t=95s)** — There's also the side effects from drug interactions.
- **[01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8zzRq8aMo8&t=98s)** — And unfortunately, as people get older and eventually end up in an assisted living home or nursing home,
- **[01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8zzRq8aMo8&t=103s)** — boy, they just are just given medications routinely.
- **[01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8zzRq8aMo8&t=106s)** — In fact, let's interview this gentleman that owns several assisted living homes
- **[01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8zzRq8aMo8&t=111s)** — and see what he has to say.
- **[01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8zzRq8aMo8&t=113s)** — We have a whole lot of people that come with between 20 and 30 medications each.
- **[01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8zzRq8aMo8&t=118s)** — Our record is 54. We have a guy who had 54 medications.
- **[02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8zzRq8aMo8&t=123s)** — What's really unique about your program is you do this very cutting edge,
- **[02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8zzRq8aMo8&t=130s)** — complex therapy called introducing real food, right?
- **[02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8zzRq8aMo8&t=134s)** — Basically, you just... is that simple? You give them real food because as you told me,
- **[02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8zzRq8aMo8&t=139s)** — like a lot of these nursing facilities or assisted living,
- **[02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8zzRq8aMo8&t=142s)** — they're living on all the processed food, right?
- **[02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8zzRq8aMo8&t=146s)** — Very much so. Yes. It's what they use for their budget to keep, you know, costs low
- **[02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8zzRq8aMo8&t=152s)** — or the big facilities have contracts with large food distribution companies
- **[02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8zzRq8aMo8&t=157s)** — and sort of serve what they provide.
- **[02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8zzRq8aMo8&t=160s)** — You have to work with the family, of course, and because they have to authorize it.
- **[02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8zzRq8aMo8&t=164s)** — You have a whole protocol and give me an example of what foods that you don't give them.
- **[02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8zzRq8aMo8&t=170s)** — How long have you got?
- **[02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8zzRq8aMo8&t=174s)** — So anything pretty much if you think of the middle aisles of the grocery store,
- **[02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8zzRq8aMo8&t=179s)** — that's what we avoid. Any packaged food.
- **[03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8zzRq8aMo8&t=182s)** — We really try to avoid any sugars.
- **[03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8zzRq8aMo8&t=185s)** — I have a health coach that has taught my cooks and caregivers
- **[03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8zzRq8aMo8&t=189s)** — how to prepare the food and what foods to prepare.
- **[03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8zzRq8aMo8&t=193s)** — She's given us lists of ingredients that are sugar, basically,
- **[03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8zzRq8aMo8&t=199s)** — but they don't call it sugar. There's 65 different names for sugar.
- **[03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8zzRq8aMo8&t=203s)** — She's taught us how to read food labels.
- **[03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8zzRq8aMo8&t=206s)** — We really try to get one ingredient foods.
- **[03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8zzRq8aMo8&t=209s)** — When you buy broccoli or you buy steak, there's one ingredient on that list.
- **[03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8zzRq8aMo8&t=214s)** — And that's kind of how we do it.
- **[03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8zzRq8aMo8&t=216s)** — Anything with very multiple ingredients or something from a chemistry class,
- **[03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8zzRq8aMo8&t=221s)** — we don't serve them.
- **[03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8zzRq8aMo8&t=223s)** — So simple. Now, tell me, are any of the people coming to you
- **[03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8zzRq8aMo8&t=228s)** — kind of eventually getting off some of these meds?
- **[03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8zzRq8aMo8&t=231s)** — Oh, tremendously. We argue with their doctors all the time.
- **[03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8zzRq8aMo8&t=236s)** — We work off their meds frequently.
- **[04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8zzRq8aMo8&t=240s)** — Our personal goal is to get them off.
- **[04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8zzRq8aMo8&t=243s)** — We get a lot of diabetics.
- **[04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8zzRq8aMo8&t=244s)** — So we worked and we've successfully got people off insulin,
- **[04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8zzRq8aMo8&t=248s)** — that form and blood pressure medication, statins.
- **[04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8zzRq8aMo8&t=252s)** — Obviously, we work with all our medical professionals and get them to de-prescribe it.
- **[04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8zzRq8aMo8&t=258s)** — We have to by the Department of Health have an order to stop the medications.
- **[04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8zzRq8aMo8&t=263s)** — But we're constantly having those discussions of what we can do.
- **[04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8zzRq8aMo8&t=266s)** — The guy with 54 medications,
- **[04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8zzRq8aMo8&t=268s)** — he's living on his own in the department by himself now,
- **[04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8zzRq8aMo8&t=272s)** — and he's down around 20 medications.
- **[04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8zzRq8aMo8&t=275s)** — So give you an example.
- **[04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8zzRq8aMo8&t=276s)** — Now, you have people that come to you that were actually in hospice?
- **[04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8zzRq8aMo8&t=281s)** — Oh, frequently, yes.
- **[04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8zzRq8aMo8&t=283s)** — They get charged from a hospital or rehab on hospice and come to us.
- **[04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8zzRq8aMo8&t=287s)** — And we'll work very hard to get them to no longer qualify for hospice.
- **[04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8zzRq8aMo8&t=292s)** — We call it graduating from hospice.
- **[04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8zzRq8aMo8&t=295s)** — What type of results are you seeing in general physically?
- **[04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8zzRq8aMo8&t=298s)** — Physically, we're seeing all sorts of...
- **[05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8zzRq8aMo8&t=300s)** — A lot of the dementia people, we work with an outside company to do a whole bunch of lab testing.
- **[05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8zzRq8aMo8&t=306s)** — But we see hormone levels go up.
- **[05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8zzRq8aMo8&t=310s)** — We see inflammation go way down.
- **[05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8zzRq8aMo8&t=314s)** — Vitamin D levels, all kinds of vitamin levels go up.
- **[05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8zzRq8aMo8&t=319s)** — Plus, you see it physically.
- **[05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8zzRq8aMo8&t=321s)** — You know, we have people come bedbound and they go into wheelchairs,
- **[05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8zzRq8aMo8&t=326s)** — and the wheelchairs go to walkers, and the walkers go to walking.
- **[05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8zzRq8aMo8&t=330s)** — So, you know, then they can spend more time with their family.
- **[05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8zzRq8aMo8&t=334s)** — We had a 98-year-old gentleman go on a cruise with his family for a week.
- **[05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8zzRq8aMo8&t=341s)** — You know, something he couldn't have done when he first came to us.
- **[05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8zzRq8aMo8&t=344s)** — And we let them borrow a caregiver.
- **[05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8zzRq8aMo8&t=346s)** — She got a free cruise out of it.
- **[05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8zzRq8aMo8&t=349s)** — And, you know, he had the time of his life, came back,
- **[05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8zzRq8aMo8&t=353s)** — passed away six months later, but, you know, was very happy those last six months.
- **[05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8zzRq8aMo8&t=358s)** — Amazing. I'll tell you one thing.
- **[06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8zzRq8aMo8&t=360s)** — If I know anyone that is in that situation where they need to go somewhere,
- **[06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8zzRq8aMo8&t=365s)** — I'm referring them to you. So, I will, I think you're in Arizona.
- **[06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8zzRq8aMo8&t=368s)** — I'm going to put your link down below so more people can know about it.
- **[06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8zzRq8aMo8&t=371s)** — But it's incredible. I wish more organizations did what you're doing.
- **[06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8zzRq8aMo8&t=375s)** — And I think we need to spread the word.
- **[06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8zzRq8aMo8&t=377s)** — It's really difficult when dealing with someone, a lot of medications,
- **[06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8zzRq8aMo8&t=381s)** — to know what is causing what.
- **[06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8zzRq8aMo8&t=384s)** — The other complexity on top of that is you have multiple doctors involved.
- **[06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8zzRq8aMo8&t=388s)** — They each have their own viewpoint.
- **[06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8zzRq8aMo8&t=389s)** — They're each focusing on a different part of the body.
- **[06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8zzRq8aMo8&t=392s)** — There's this term called adverse drug reactions.
- **[06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8zzRq8aMo8&t=395s)** — This is the unexpected side effect directly caused from drugs.
- **[06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8zzRq8aMo8&t=399s)** — 90% of these are under reported.
- **[06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8zzRq8aMo8&t=401s)** — Adverse drug reactions are responsible for 10% of all hospital visits.
- **[06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8zzRq8aMo8&t=406s)** — It's also the fourth leading cause of death.
- **[06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8zzRq8aMo8&t=409s)** — I wanted to bring on a board certified endocrinologist
- **[06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8zzRq8aMo8&t=411s)** — and ask her some questions about this topic.
- **[06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8zzRq8aMo8&t=414s)** — We know drugs have side effects,
- **[06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8zzRq8aMo8&t=417s)** — but have we studied the interaction between drugs?
- **[07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8zzRq8aMo8&t=421s)** — Patients don't always know.
- **[07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8zzRq8aMo8&t=423s)** — They get these little package inserts that are in fine print.
- **[07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8zzRq8aMo8&t=426s)** — Most of us, it's too difficult to read those little tiny papers.
- **[07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8zzRq8aMo8&t=430s)** — And, you know, where I practice in India,
- **[07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8zzRq8aMo8&t=432s)** — a lot of medications just come in aluminum blister packs without any insert.
- **[07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8zzRq8aMo8&t=438s)** — So the patient may not really have a list of side effects to read through.
- **[07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8zzRq8aMo8&t=442s)** — Drug interactions is written in tiny print.
- **[07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8zzRq8aMo8&t=444s)** — Busy doctors are prescribing.
- **[07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8zzRq8aMo8&t=446s)** — And what I do is I use a free software.
- **[07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8zzRq8aMo8&t=450s)** — There's a free version of it. It's called Epocrates.
- **[07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8zzRq8aMo8&t=453s)** — E-P-O-C-R-A-T-E-S.
- **[07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8zzRq8aMo8&t=456s)** — And I look for drug interactions there just to keep on top of it.
- **[07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8zzRq8aMo8&t=460s)** — Because there are so many new medications coming out.
- **[07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8zzRq8aMo8&t=462s)** — Even when I was in practice, I would have patients come in.
- **[07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8zzRq8aMo8&t=464s)** — They're on 5, 10, 15, up to 20, even more medications.
- **[07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8zzRq8aMo8&t=470s)** — Are you seeing some of that as well?
- **[07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8zzRq8aMo8&t=472s)** — Just the number of prescriptions are just really going high.
- **[07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8zzRq8aMo8&t=476s)** — Really long. And especially in the space of where you and I see a lot of things is chronic conditions.
- **[08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8zzRq8aMo8&t=484s)** — Where it's not a fever or a back sprain and you're done with your medications in 4 to 7 days or a course of antibiotics.
- **[08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8zzRq8aMo8&t=492s)** — It's something more prolonged like blood pressure or diabetes.
- **[08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8zzRq8aMo8&t=496s)** — And these pills end up not really being looked at as when do we get you off of it?
- **[08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8zzRq8aMo8&t=502s)** — That's something I focus on a lot is to keep looking at the medication list to cut back whenever we can.
- **[08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8zzRq8aMo8&t=509s)** — And a lot of times the patient is going to different specialists.
- **[08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8zzRq8aMo8&t=513s)** — And unfortunately, the busy specialist might be looking at the one body part that they've been asked to look at.
- **[08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8zzRq8aMo8&t=519s)** — And they're not always looking at interactions of what I'm prescribing with what maybe the other specialist is prescribing.
- **[08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8zzRq8aMo8&t=527s)** — So even though I'm an endocrinologist and I still count as a specialist or a top, you know, super specialized.
- **[08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8zzRq8aMo8&t=534s)** — I end up zooming out and doing what a primary care doctor often does is let's look at all these drugs.
- **[08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8zzRq8aMo8&t=539s)** — And we're so often surprised you'll see two things that cause constipation, two things that cause drowsiness.
- **[09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8zzRq8aMo8&t=547s)** — There's so many interactions.
- **[09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8zzRq8aMo8&t=549s)** — Even with my mother-in-law, she started noticing signs of Alzheimer's when she was getting older.
- **[09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8zzRq8aMo8&t=553s)** — And so I just looked at her medications because she was on quite a few and I'm like, wait a second.
- **[09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8zzRq8aMo8&t=559s)** — I started talking to the doctor. I'm like, this causes dementia, right? As a side effect.
- **[09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8zzRq8aMo8&t=564s)** — So do we really need it? I think it was a bladder medication because that's a common one that has a side effect of dementia.
- **[09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8zzRq8aMo8&t=572s)** — So yeah, off that she's just started doing better.
- **[09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8zzRq8aMo8&t=574s)** — But I mean, I'm sure you see it all the time, all the time.
- **[09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8zzRq8aMo8&t=577s)** — And sometimes you're prescribing like a pain medication.
- **[09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8zzRq8aMo8&t=582s)** — And sometimes rebound pain comes in or an antidepressant.
- **[09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8zzRq8aMo8&t=587s)** — And temporarily some people have increased, you know, negative thoughts.
- **[09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8zzRq8aMo8&t=591s)** — What I really like about you is you include the diet as part of the equation when you evaluate someone like you're you emphasize that.
- **[09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8zzRq8aMo8&t=598s)** — I heard a joke recently where a pet owner was joking that, you know, when you go to the vet with your pet,
- **[10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8zzRq8aMo8&t=604s)** — the first thing the vet asks you is what are you feeding them?
- **[10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8zzRq8aMo8&t=609s)** — Wow, wow, that would be a smart thing to ask.
- **[10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8zzRq8aMo8&t=614s)** — But why don't why don't doctors ask that? That's the question for the human pet owners, right?
- **[10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8zzRq8aMo8&t=619s)** — And so it seems like an obvious question for the pet.
- **[10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8zzRq8aMo8&t=623s)** — I can't think of anything else that contributes to either more health or more disease than what we put in our bodies.
- **[10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8zzRq8aMo8&t=629s)** — 100%. And, you know, I talk about this step by step when I when I work with people over three months or six months is
- **[10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8zzRq8aMo8&t=636s)** — the four wheels of the lifestyle car. And, you know, the first wheel is always nutrition is what are we putting in the body?
- **[10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8zzRq8aMo8&t=643s)** — You're putting a medication in the body. So like we want to reduce the medication.
- **[10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8zzRq8aMo8&t=648s)** — What else is going into your mouth or into your body every day is food.
- **[10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8zzRq8aMo8&t=652s)** — And then we go into sleep. Then we go into stress management, exercise.
- **[10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8zzRq8aMo8&t=656s)** — And after that may be fasting. But the first wheel is always nutrition.
- **[11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8zzRq8aMo8&t=660s)** — I also want to talk about some really common symptoms that are directly caused by so many medications.
- **[11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8zzRq8aMo8&t=667s)** — Let's take constipation, for example.
- **[11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8zzRq8aMo8&t=669s)** — Did you realize that the side effect constipation can come from over a hundred and fifty different medications?
- **[11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8zzRq8aMo8&t=676s)** — The problem with chronic constipation is it can lead to something called mega colon where your colon is just enlarged and you can develop infections.
- **[11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8zzRq8aMo8&t=684s)** — It can burst. That's why we have laxatives, right?
- **[11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8zzRq8aMo8&t=687s)** — The doctor is going to probably give someone a laxative to try to stimulate the release of this waste.
- **[11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8zzRq8aMo8&t=692s)** — The problem with laxatives is they destroy the lining of the colon.
- **[11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8zzRq8aMo8&t=696s)** — And also it's hard to come off of them. Your body depends on them.
- **[11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8zzRq8aMo8&t=701s)** — With the diabetes medication, what that does is it gets the sugar out of the blood to help normalize the blood sugar.
- **[11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8zzRq8aMo8&t=707s)** — But the question is, what does it do with that sugar? It's pushing it through the kidneys, pushing it out through the urine.
- **[11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8zzRq8aMo8&t=712s)** — Of course, when someone has this symptom, they're then put on medications that cause urinary retention.
- **[11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8zzRq8aMo8&t=718s)** — Then they get a risk for urinary tract infections.
- **[12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8zzRq8aMo8&t=721s)** — Dizziness is another really common side effect of quite a few medications.
- **[12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8zzRq8aMo8&t=725s)** — One big problem, especially with the elderly, is that dizziness is the number one cause of why someone, when they're older, falls.
- **[12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8zzRq8aMo8&t=733s)** — So dizziness comes from like taking high blood pressure medication, antidepressants, and even sleeping pills.
- **[12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8zzRq8aMo8&t=739s)** — There's also something called paradoxical drug side effects.
- **[12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8zzRq8aMo8&t=742s)** — You're taking a medication for a certain effect, but you end up getting that same effect.
- **[12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8zzRq8aMo8&t=749s)** — This happens quite frequently too. You're taking an antidepressant, but it actually caused you to become more depressed.
- **[12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8zzRq8aMo8&t=754s)** — Or you take an antacid, and then you end up getting heartburn.
- **[12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8zzRq8aMo8&t=757s)** — One of the biggest reasons why people develop chronic disease.
- **[12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8zzRq8aMo8&t=761s)** — I personally think it comes from what the patient eats.
- **[12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8zzRq8aMo8&t=764s)** — I'm primarily talking about processed foods.
- **[12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8zzRq8aMo8&t=766s)** — Junk food is at the top of the list as far as the reason why people go to the doctor for their chronic disease.
- **[12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8zzRq8aMo8&t=773s)** — A really big part of big pharma's medications are really about treating the side effect from this processed food.
- **[13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8zzRq8aMo8&t=782s)** — Because the doctor does not really evaluate what the person's eating,
- **[13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8zzRq8aMo8&t=786s)** — it's the doctor's omission of real food and that connection between junk food and chronic disease that is literally holding this whole thing together.
- **[13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8zzRq8aMo8&t=795s)** — And it keeps allowing the drugs to be prescribed and then new medications added to treat the side effect from this other drug.
- **[13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8zzRq8aMo8&t=803s)** — What is the one thing that can literally turn this whole thing around?
- **[13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8zzRq8aMo8&t=807s)** — It's this tiny little simple thing where we're going to switch out the junk food for real food.
- **[13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8zzRq8aMo8&t=813s)** — And if you want more information about what real food is, you should check out this video right here.

- **[00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgYcVR7YBBQ&t=0s)** — Grass-fed beef is the biggest scam on the planet. It's a complete lie.
- **[00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgYcVR7YBBQ&t=4s)** — What I'm going to share with you is going to piss you off.
- **[00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgYcVR7YBBQ&t=7s)** — Less than 1% of beef sold in the US is truly grass-fed.
- **[00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgYcVR7YBBQ&t=11s)** — This whole idea of grass-fed is just filled with loopholes all over the place.
- **[00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgYcVR7YBBQ&t=15s)** — In 2016, the USDA dropped the official definition of grass-fed.
- **[00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgYcVR7YBBQ&t=20s)** — All of the cows are grass-fed. It's the last 3-6 months where they're fed other things,
- **[00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgYcVR7YBBQ&t=25s)** — like grains and some other ingredients that I had no idea.
- **[00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgYcVR7YBBQ&t=28s)** — Over 99% of all the beef that people are buying is not fully grass-fed,
- **[00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgYcVR7YBBQ&t=33s)** — despite what it says on the label. There is a tremendous amount of beef sold to
- **[00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgYcVR7YBBQ&t=38s)** — America from other countries. Then with a little bit of processing,
- **[00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgYcVR7YBBQ&t=43s)** — like packaging the beef, it now becomes a product of the US.
- **[00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgYcVR7YBBQ&t=47s)** — In other words, this country of origin labeling rule was repealed, which means revoked,
- **[00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgYcVR7YBBQ&t=53s)** — for both beef and pork. Here's just another example of a lack of transparency where,
- **[00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgYcVR7YBBQ&t=58s)** — well, at least if it's from America, it's probably healthier when it's actually not
- **[01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgYcVR7YBBQ&t=62s)** — even coming from America. And by the way, as a side note, did you know that when you
- **[01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgYcVR7YBBQ&t=66s)** — eat a burger from a fast food place, the number of cows that that hamburger comes from
- **[01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgYcVR7YBBQ&t=71s)** — literally can be over a hundred different sources? Because they have this entire
- **[01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgYcVR7YBBQ&t=75s)** — processing plant where they're getting meat from all over the place. What people need to
- **[01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgYcVR7YBBQ&t=79s)** — realize is what we're talking about is a cow that's very sedentary, that is fatty.
- **[01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgYcVR7YBBQ&t=84s)** — And the reason why it's tender is because it has barely any collagen. And without
- **[01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgYcVR7YBBQ&t=87s)** — it's very, very tender. People do like marbled meat that's tender, but what they don't want
- **[01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgYcVR7YBBQ&t=93s)** — to know about is how that animal is raised. Because what I'm going to tell you now is
- **[01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgYcVR7YBBQ&t=98s)** — literally going to make you fall off your chair. And it's what these animals actually eat.
- **[01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgYcVR7YBBQ&t=103s)** — You might think, wow, grains. Well, it's probably a bucket of whole grains,
- **[01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgYcVR7YBBQ&t=108s)** — pretty healthy. No, they actually feed these animals in the feedlot, something called DDGS.
- **[01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgYcVR7YBBQ&t=114s)** — And that stands for dried distillers grain with soluble, a.k.a. the waste product from making
- **[02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgYcVR7YBBQ&t=122s)** — ethanol. They take dent corn, which is field corn. It's inedible. You can't eat it. What
- **[02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgYcVR7YBBQ&t=126s)** — are they going to do with this GMO waste product filled with glyphosate? It's basically the
- **[02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgYcVR7YBBQ&t=131s)** — toxic byproduct from making ethanol. And what I found out is because of the subsidies,
- **[02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgYcVR7YBBQ&t=139s)** — taxpayers contribution to this, the cost for one metric ton of this waste material that is fed to
- **[02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgYcVR7YBBQ&t=146s)** — the animals is roughly $150. Now, do you see why they can make so much profit on this?
- **[02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgYcVR7YBBQ&t=152s)** — Because what they're trying to do is they need to put on about 600 pounds of extra weight
- **[02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgYcVR7YBBQ&t=157s)** — on that cow. And the only way they can do it is with something so cheap, $150 per metric
- **[02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgYcVR7YBBQ&t=164s)** — ton. Crazy. So that's the base. And then they add a little fiber. They add limestone, some
- **[02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgYcVR7YBBQ&t=170s)** — synthetic vitamins and minerals. And then they add something else called monicin. It's an
- **[02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgYcVR7YBBQ&t=174s)** — antibiotic. Antibiotics are used on a regular basis in feedlots in the U.S. And the reason
- **[03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgYcVR7YBBQ&t=180s)** — why they use these antibiotics is because it increases weight gain. Even your grass-fed beef
- **[03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgYcVR7YBBQ&t=185s)** — has been given antibiotics. Unless it says on the label, no antibiotics. But that's not all.
- **[03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgYcVR7YBBQ&t=190s)** — They also add in the U.S. something called beta agonist. This is a medication that enhances
- **[03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgYcVR7YBBQ&t=197s)** — the muscle growth to increase another 30 pounds of muscle. And it's something that mimics
- **[03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgYcVR7YBBQ&t=203s)** — adrenaline. There's been some studies that show that that can actually increase anxiety
- **[03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgYcVR7YBBQ&t=207s)** — in humans if you consume that food. So there's two types of feedlots. You have one that's
- **[03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgYcVR7YBBQ&t=211s)** — closed, like indoor, and they have another one that's open. Let's talk about the one that's
- **[03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgYcVR7YBBQ&t=216s)** — That animal, which is 1,500 pounds, only gets a space that is 24 square feet. If I were to ask
- **[03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgYcVR7YBBQ&t=224s)** — you how much that is, you might have to measure it out. But let me just tell you,
- **[03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgYcVR7YBBQ&t=228s)** — a parking space that you drive your car into is 128 square feet. So let's compare that.
- **[03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgYcVR7YBBQ&t=234s)** — 20 to 24 square feet to 128 square feet. So basically, it's 1 6th of a parking place.
- **[04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgYcVR7YBBQ&t=242s)** — Not a parking lot, a parking space. So basically, you can fit six cows into one parking space.
- **[04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgYcVR7YBBQ&t=251s)** — That's what they live in for three to six months. They have to make them sedentary and
- **[04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgYcVR7YBBQ&t=257s)** — to add all this cheap food to gain the massive weight. So that way you can make the meat
- **[04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgYcVR7YBBQ&t=263s)** — marbled and have it very tender, aka a very sick animal. That's what you're eating. Now,
- **[04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgYcVR7YBBQ&t=268s)** — open space in the feedlot doesn't get that much more space. They get roughly about 150
- **[04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgYcVR7YBBQ&t=273s)** — square feet, which is about the same size as a little bit more than that parking space that
- **[04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgYcVR7YBBQ&t=278s)** — I just talked about. But again, not much space. So how do you find truly grass-fed beef? You
- **[04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgYcVR7YBBQ&t=284s)** — need to look for this. 100% grass-fed. Because if it just says grass-fed, it doesn't
- **[04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgYcVR7YBBQ&t=290s)** — mean anything. And I highly recommend you spend a little bit more for this higher quality
- **[04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgYcVR7YBBQ&t=295s)** — of meat because that way you support the small farmer that seems to be
- **[04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgYcVR7YBBQ&t=299s)** — squeezed out of this marketplace. Thanks for watching and I will see you in the next video.

- **[00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGIX50eYaGU&t=0s)** — Your feet are a diagnostic window into your health problems. In other words, this right here will
- **[00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGIX50eYaGU&t=6s)** — tell you a lot about early signs of many different problems. At the end of this video, you're going
- **[00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGIX50eYaGU&t=12s)** — to have the ability to understand a lot about what's going on inside your body just by looking
- **[00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGIX50eYaGU&t=17s)** — at your foot or someone else's foot. Right here, we have the heart and we have the foot. And this
- **[00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGIX50eYaGU&t=22s)** — little connection between the heart and the foot is your blood vessels. You have the most
- **[00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGIX50eYaGU&t=28s)** — oxygen starting at the heart and you have the least oxygen starting in your foot. The foot is
- **[00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGIX50eYaGU&t=34s)** — going to receive oxygen and nutrition through tiny little capillaries. If someone has sugar in their
- **[00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGIX50eYaGU&t=39s)** — blood as in diabetes, it's going to show up in your foot first as the earliest sign. I'm going
- **[00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGIX50eYaGU&t=45s)** — to go through a series of indicators that will tell you what's going on in the rest of the
- **[00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGIX50eYaGU&t=50s)** — body. The first topic I want to cover is something called peripheral neuropathy. You might
- **[00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGIX50eYaGU&t=55s)** — start with numbness or even like burning and then it can go into some weird sensations. It
- **[01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGIX50eYaGU&t=62s)** — just feels abnormal. That's because the sensory nerves are breaking down because of mainly one
- **[01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGIX50eYaGU&t=69s)** — missing vitamin called vitamin B1 thiamine. There's not enough thiamine in that nerve to
- **[01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGIX50eYaGU&t=75s)** — allow the nerve to work. That nerve is dependent on B1. You need a very special type
- **[01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGIX50eYaGU&t=80s)** — B vitamin that has been changed to a fat soluble version. The name of that is called
- **[01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGIX50eYaGU&t=87s)** — benfotamine. I'll put in the description of how to spell it. There's not enough thiamine in
- **[01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGIX50eYaGU&t=91s)** — that nerve to allow the nerve to work. There's a couple things that will deplete B1 from the
- **[01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGIX50eYaGU&t=97s)** — nerve. Sugar destroys nerves. If you drink a lot of alcohol, it destroys your liver. Sugar and
- **[01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGIX50eYaGU&t=104s)** — alcohol deplete B1 and you want to put that back. Benfotamine is what you need. Whatever
- **[01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGIX50eYaGU&t=109s)** — recommends on the dosage on the back of the bottle times four because you want to take more
- **[01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGIX50eYaGU&t=115s)** — to really penetrate to fix this problem right here. Another diagnostic indicator or a window
- **[02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGIX50eYaGU&t=122s)** — to look inside your body is to notice if your toes get blue. It could be the fingertips too.
- **[02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGIX50eYaGU&t=128s)** — It has to do with a part of the nervous system called the sympathetic nervous system. Another
- **[02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGIX50eYaGU&t=133s)** — word for that is called the fight-or-flight system. And there's a problem with this system
- **[02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGIX50eYaGU&t=138s)** — in that it's over-activated. One of the treatments for this, the medical treatment,
- **[02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGIX50eYaGU&t=143s)** — is they use a calcium channel blocker. When they're exposed to cold, their fingers and
- **[02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGIX50eYaGU&t=149s)** — their toes become blue. What would be a natural version of a calcium channel blocker? That's
- **[02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGIX50eYaGU&t=155s)** — magnesium. Magnesium is the primary regulator of calcium that's stuck inside the cell. And so
- **[02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGIX50eYaGU&t=161s)** — one cause of high blood pressure is too much calcium because calcium is all about contraction
- **[02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGIX50eYaGU&t=168s)** — and magnesium is all about relaxation. So magnesium fixes this over-contraction problem.
- **[02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGIX50eYaGU&t=174s)** — The thing to know about magnesium is that you don't want to just take any type of magnesium.
- **[02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGIX50eYaGU&t=179s)** — You want to take magnesium glycinate because that's the one that you can absorb like 80%.
- **[03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGIX50eYaGU&t=183s)** — The next one also relates to what I just talked about. Foot cramps, especially at night
- **[03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGIX50eYaGU&t=189s)** — or in the early morning. Magnesium in the tissue is going to be lowest in the early
- **[03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGIX50eYaGU&t=194s)** — morning. You can also get those cramps in the calf muscle right above here. Cramps or
- **[03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGIX50eYaGU&t=198s)** — trolley horses are the earliest symptom of a magnesium deficiency. The simple remedy is to
- **[03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGIX50eYaGU&t=203s)** — take magnesium glycinate. Remember we talked about that. You want to take at least four
- **[03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGIX50eYaGU&t=208s)** — to five to six to even up to 800 milligrams for a period of weeks to really fix this
- **[03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGIX50eYaGU&t=216s)** — deficiency. Just by taking it one time doesn't really help it. The problem with
- **[03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGIX50eYaGU&t=220s)** — magnesium deficiency is that it's very hard to detect. A lot of people are deficient in it.
- **[03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGIX50eYaGU&t=224s)** — Magnesium is really important in a lot of things. If you're deficient, you're going to
- **[03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGIX50eYaGU&t=228s)** — have cramps. Putting the magnesium back in there will help the cramp. The next thing
- **[03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGIX50eYaGU&t=232s)** — we're going to talk about is when you have swollen feet. This usually is involved with
- **[03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGIX50eYaGU&t=237s)** — diabetes because they have more sugar in the blood. And if someone has more sugar,
- **[04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGIX50eYaGU&t=241s)** — they're going to be retaining a lot more sodium and a lot more water and they're
- **[04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGIX50eYaGU&t=244s)** — going to have puffy feet. The antidote is to come up with sugar if you have diabetes.
- **[04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGIX50eYaGU&t=249s)** — Another problem that you might have is discoloration of the lower leg. Just the
- **[04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGIX50eYaGU&t=254s)** — feet start changing colors and they look very unhealthy. It could be a circulation problem.
- **[04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGIX50eYaGU&t=260s)** — You can have deep vein thrombosis, which is a condition where you're getting clots in
- **[04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGIX50eYaGU&t=266s)** — the veins and that's going to create fluid retention in the foot, discoloration in the
- **[04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGIX50eYaGU&t=272s)** — lower part of the leg. And so those clots can come from many different reasons. One being
- **[04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGIX50eYaGU&t=276s)** — high levels of stress and also vitamin E is an antidote to excess clotting because vitamin E
- **[04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGIX50eYaGU&t=282s)** — kind of thins the blood. If you get more pain or more weakness when you exercise, suspect
- **[04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGIX50eYaGU&t=288s)** — something called intermittent clodification and get it checked out from the doctor because
- **[04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGIX50eYaGU&t=292s)** — that's a vascular problem. And with that problem you get better when you rest. Next
- **[04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGIX50eYaGU&t=297s)** — problem is big toe pain right here. That's gout. Gout usually is a problem with too much uric
- **[05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGIX50eYaGU&t=304s)** — Some people even notice if they cut down their oxalates, their toe pain goes away and that would
- **[05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGIX50eYaGU&t=309s)** — be like spinach, almonds, chocolate. The antidote to high levels of oxalates, whether it's a
- **[05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGIX50eYaGU&t=316s)** — kidney stone or whatever, is magnesium and prevent the kidney stone situation or the oxalate
- **[05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGIX50eYaGU&t=324s)** — arthritic situation that some people have. Other ways that you can diagnose things on your foot
- **[05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGIX50eYaGU&t=328s)** — If you have an ulcer on the foot, that's classic diabetes because you're not getting
- **[05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGIX50eYaGU&t=333s)** — enough oxygen. In a diabetic situation, if you notice the toes of the feet get destroyed first
- **[05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGIX50eYaGU&t=340s)** — and then it moves up this way. This is why they have to sometimes remove the toes in
- **[05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGIX50eYaGU&t=345s)** — diabetics. Completely unnecessary. You need that benfotamine and you need to get on a low carb
- **[05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGIX50eYaGU&t=350s)** — diet but unfortunately you probably won't hear that from your doctor. They're more into
- **[05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGIX50eYaGU&t=354s)** — symptoms. Couple things with the nail bed. You can look at the nail bed of your toes and tell a
- **[06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGIX50eYaGU&t=360s)** — lot about your overall health. For example, if it's yellowish, that could be fungus but it
- **[06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGIX50eYaGU&t=366s)** — could be jaundice too with the liver. But if there's a fungus, that means there's a problem
- **[06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGIX50eYaGU&t=370s)** — with your gut and you can fix fungus by adding probiotics and really getting healthy
- **[06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGIX50eYaGU&t=377s)** — starting with your gut. Now there's all sorts of remedies as well like tea tree oil and
- **[06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGIX50eYaGU&t=382s)** — iodine on the toenail. If your immune system is weak because you don't have enough vitamin D,
- **[06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGIX50eYaGU&t=386s)** — then the yeast wins. And of course yeast lives on sugar so you're gonna have to get off sugar
- **[06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGIX50eYaGU&t=392s)** — as well. If there's funkiness with the toenail like splitting, let's say it's curving up or
- **[06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGIX50eYaGU&t=397s)** — curving down, these are all indicators of not necessarily disease but nutritional deficiencies.
- **[06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGIX50eYaGU&t=404s)** — But in this video, I just wanted to give you some insights on how to use your foot
- **[06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGIX50eYaGU&t=409s)** — as a diagnostic window to other issues. And if you want to know more information

## Video 90: What Causes Eye Floaters and Dry Eyes?

- **[00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T9WkRYMfvp8&t=0s)** — So some years back, I moved from one state to another. We packed up this massive trailer that I was going to drive to another state and tow my car on the back. And then my wife and kids were going to fly to where we're going. And we'd meet them at a certain location. So I'm driving on the street and I'm actually taking these small little town roads in the middle of nowhere. And I'm driving along and all of a sudden, my eyes are really dry.
- **[00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T9WkRYMfvp8&t=29s)** — And so I'm blinking my eyes really sticky and I close it and I open up and my cornea rips. And now I can't see. So I could barely drive with one eye and I'm driving down the street and I'm like, now what I need to pull off and maybe get some rest, right? So I pull off somewhere in some little town in the middle of nowhere. And I find a little motel six or something and I go in there. And I'm going to just take a nap, right? So I lay there for a couple hours, fall asleep.
- **[00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T9WkRYMfvp8&t=59s)** — And I, I'm like, okay, good. So it's all healed up. I don't feel it. And I open my eye and it rips again. I'm like, no, I need to find an eye doctor. It's a Saturday. Okay. So I start walking on the side of the street looking for an eye doctor, you know, just stumbling around. And I happen to look up it happens to be an eye doctor right, right down the street. So I go up to the office, knocking the door. They says, Oh, yeah, we can't see you until Monday.
- **[01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T9WkRYMfvp8&t=89s)** — Because we're really backed up. And I'm like, No, I need to get on the road because I have to meet my my wife and kids very soon. And so they said, I'm sorry, we can't see you. And I just basically walked right back to the doctor's office. And I said, Listen, I need your help. I need to you need to do something with my eye cannot see I have to drive back. So it gives me a little couple drops of medication. Now I can see because it numbs the pain. I get back on the road. And then I eventually make it to my destination. What that was was something called
- **[01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T9WkRYMfvp8&t=119s)** — dry eye. So let's take a look at my whiteboard here. Dry eye. Little did I know that this was a vitamin A deficiency. So be sticky, and it can rip your cornea. And it's very irritating. Also, a vitamin A deficiency can cause night blindness. Now typically, when someone's deficient in vitamin A, it could be they're eating too much junk food. And in my case, that's what it was. Or it could be a problem with the gallbladder. So they can't extract the vitamin A from the food.
- **[02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T9WkRYMfvp8&t=149s)** — But typically, you're going to get vitamin A from egg yolks, liver, butter, cod liver oil. Now a lot of times people will say that you can get your vitamin A from plants because there's a lot of vitamin A. But in reality, what you have in plants is the precursor called beta carotene. But the conversion is not that much. So you would have to consume a tremendous amount of vegetables to just get a little bit of the active form of vitamin A, which is retinol.
- **[02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T9WkRYMfvp8&t=178s)** — And also as a side note, you need zinc to allow vitamin A to work. So you could be getting enough vitamin A, but not enough zinc. Zinc is in red meat. It's in oysters, shellfish, it's in liver. But you're not going to get a lot of zinc if you're eating refined foods and refined sugar.
- **[03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T9WkRYMfvp8&t=197s)** — The next condition we'll talk about is something called retinopathy. You usually see that with diabetes. That's a problem with the retina. The retina is basically brain tissue that's extending into the eye. It's picking up information and it's bringing into the brain. So you can actually see and diabetes is the number one cause of retinopathy. And so all this glucose is creating oxidation or rusting on your nervous system. It's a lot of free radical damage.
- **[03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T9WkRYMfvp8&t=227s)** — A lot of problems. So the antidote to that is something called benfotamine. Benfotamine is a type of B1 that's made in a fat soluble form. So it can go into the nerve tissue. So many complications of diabetes like peripheral neuropathy, like diabetic retinopathy can be helped by taking higher doses of benfotamine.
- **[04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T9WkRYMfvp8&t=257s)** — It can act as an antioxidant and it actually really helps to support the nervous system and the blood flow to the nerves, especially in the retina. Now we get to this thing called floaters. When you consume protein with sugar, it causes this chemical reaction called glycation. So it sticks together and it becomes like glue and it gets stuck in the body. And that's what floaters are.
- **[04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T9WkRYMfvp8&t=283s)** — Now the way to get rid of floaters, one is just by changing your diet and that can handle it right there. Low carb can help it. And some people even need to do what's called carnivore for a month or two. But also there's a condition called autophagy where your body is recycling damaged proteins. Anything in the body recycle that and the way to get your body in autophagy is doing fasting. This is why I recommend if you have floaters, you should be doing intermittent fasting and sometimes prolonged fasting.
- **[05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T9WkRYMfvp8&t=312s)** — That can really help clean up those floaters if you have them. Alright, let's dive into this thing called macular degeneration. Now sometimes you'll hear age related macular degeneration and it's interesting how they put this cause the age. You're getting older. That's what's causing this. I just don't buy it. And I don't think everyone as they get older gets macular degeneration. But the first of all, what is the macula? Well, that's the back part of the
- **[05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T9WkRYMfvp8&t=342s)** — eye that's extending out of the brain. There's a lot of things that can affect that. So you have blue light. Okay, blue light. That's your LED light, the smartphones, your laptop. You also have, of course, the obvious stuff, alcohol, smoking, sugar. But the biggest thing is the seed oils. And so he's an MD that specializes in eye diseases. And he made this huge connection between seed oils and macular degeneration. So all these heroes are going to
- **[06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T9WkRYMfvp8&t=372s)** — lodge into this membrane and it's going to get stuck there for like three years. And so the problem is these are rancid oils and anything that increases inflammation like omega six oils, seed oils are going to cause more of a degeneration, not just with the macula, but different parts of the eye as well. And of course, the antidote to that is to cut down on the seed oils and then increase the omega three fats. There's three natural compounds that protect you.
- **[06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T9WkRYMfvp8&t=403s)** — Against macular degeneration. And that would be lutein, zeaxanthin, and mesozeaxanthin. And all three of these are carotenoids. So where do you get lutein, zeaxanthin, or mesozeaxanthin? Well, you can get it from green vegetables, yellow vegetables or fruits, orange vegetables or fruits. You can get it from egg yolks, seafood, like salmon and shrimp.
- **[07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T9WkRYMfvp8&t=432s)** — And also grass fed animals. I sent my beef into a study. I live on a farm and I raised some beef. Guess what? We had a tremendous amount of carotenoids in that beef. Now also macular degeneration is the second cause of blindness in adults. And so when we start to increase these in our diet, we can sometimes improve our vision.
- **[07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T9WkRYMfvp8&t=456s)** — Alright, let's now talk about glaucoma. Okay, this is an eye condition where you have a lot of pressure in the eye. And the pressure is creating damage on the back part of the eye where the retina is. Now I recently did an entire video on this topic that was based on a book by an ophthalmologist on taking high doses of vitamin D for glaucoma. And apparently there's some great results. When you normally check the blood, this doctor mentioned the current normal values are severely
- **[08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T9WkRYMfvp8&t=486s)** — outdated. Especially for a vitamin D deficiency being like below 20 nanograms per milliliter. I mean, that's like so outdated. He recommends vitamin D levels to be between 100 nanograms per milliliter to 150 nanograms per milliliter. And the reason for that is that apparently this condition, there's a lot of evidence that it's an autoimmune disease. So if that's true, then you need to break through the resistance.
- **[08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T9WkRYMfvp8&t=516s)** — So you have to take a lot of vitamin D to penetrate that barrier and resolving the problem. And now let's talk a little bit about cataracts. Cataracts are an opaque situation with the lens of the eye. Sticky proteins develop in the body that become non functional because you're consuming a ton of sugar in general. And the antidote is vitamin D in higher amounts.
- **[09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T9WkRYMfvp8&t=541s)** — Another remedy called N acetylcarnosine drops, if you can find them, and then zinc. All of these contain antioxidants that will give protection against the eye. So anytime you see like a vegetable or even a fruit that's dark purple or red or orange or yellow, all of those pigments are antioxidants that can greatly help the eye. Now, if you haven't seen my recent video on glaucoma, that would be a really good one to see next.
- **[09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T9WkRYMfvp8&t=571s)** — Simply because of the amount of details I give you for vitamin D. So check that out right here.

- **[00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i80vA_8MJQI&t=0s)** — What would happen if you drank lemon water every single day for 30 days?
- **[00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i80vA_8MJQI&t=4s)** — We are so focused on high blood pressure, really no one's talking about low blood pressure,
- **[00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i80vA_8MJQI&t=9s)** — where you just don't have enough volume of blood in your body. When you wake up in the morning,
- **[00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i80vA_8MJQI&t=14s)** — you have the lowest volume of blood compared to at the end of the day. When your blood volume
- **[00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i80vA_8MJQI&t=20s)** — is too low, if you stand up too fast, you could feel dizzy. Your blood pressure might even be
- **[00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i80vA_8MJQI&t=25s)** — low. If we just take an elite athlete and compare that athlete to an average person that doesn't
- **[00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i80vA_8MJQI&t=31s)** — really exercise, the elite athlete is carrying around 50% more blood volume. You definitely
- **[00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i80vA_8MJQI&t=39s)** — are not going to have the same performance when you exercise. You're just not going to
- **[00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i80vA_8MJQI&t=42s)** — feel quite the same. I do not like drinking anything in the morning because typically when
- **[00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i80vA_8MJQI&t=47s)** — I drink liquid in the morning, I just don't feel right. I'll drink coffee, but I don't want
- **[00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i80vA_8MJQI&t=52s)** — to drink anything else until the afternoon. I finally realize what that is and I want to
- **[00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i80vA_8MJQI&t=58s)** — give you a solution. If you just drink water, especially in the morning when you have the
- **[01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i80vA_8MJQI&t=63s)** — lowest blood volume, you're basically going to be diluting these electrolytes, specifically
- **[01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i80vA_8MJQI&t=68s)** — sodium. That's a huge mistake because you're going to be more dehydrated. It's not just
- **[01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i80vA_8MJQI&t=73s)** — water that increases the volume of blood. You also need to add some salt. That salt
- **[01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i80vA_8MJQI&t=79s)** — will allow you to hold the water in your blood. Just a pinch of that sea salt with lemon is
- **[01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i80vA_8MJQI&t=84s)** — going to make you feel so much better, especially if you do it for 30 days and especially one hour
- **[01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i80vA_8MJQI&t=89s)** — before you exercise as well. For some people, they might even feel better if they add even
- **[01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i80vA_8MJQI&t=93s)** — more salt. Then if you also look at the circadian rhythm of the entire 24 hours,
- **[01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i80vA_8MJQI&t=98s)** — where's the highest amount of cortisol? In the morning at 8 a.m. That's when you have the
- **[01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i80vA_8MJQI&t=103s)** — highest level of cortisol. Did you know what can lower cortisol is sodium? That's right.
- **[01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i80vA_8MJQI&t=108s)** — This is why some people have a little salt before they go to bed to lower cortisol so they can
- **[01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i80vA_8MJQI&t=113s)** — sleep better. In the morning when cortisol is very, very high, that can also affect feeling
- **[01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i80vA_8MJQI&t=118s)** — stressed or also mobilizing sugar from your liver, which affects your blood sugar. What you
- **[02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i80vA_8MJQI&t=123s)** — need to know is that salt can help reduce cortisol. By having salt in the morning, you
- **[02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i80vA_8MJQI&t=127s)** — can start with a stress-free day and with enough volume of fluid to be able to have the
- **[02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i80vA_8MJQI&t=133s)** — energy and the exercise that you need. And also to prevent if you get up too quickly and
- **[02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i80vA_8MJQI&t=137s)** — a little dizzy, you won't have that if you have enough volume of fluid. That's a salt benefit.
- **[02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i80vA_8MJQI&t=142s)** — Of course I would use like a pinch of Himalayan sea salt. Or if you do have a tendency that
- **[02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i80vA_8MJQI&t=147s)** — high blood pressure and you want more potassium magnesium, you can use the Baja gold salt,
- **[02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i80vA_8MJQI&t=152s)** — which is only 70% sodium and then the rest is all these other minerals. But now let's talk
- **[02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i80vA_8MJQI&t=158s)** — about the benefits of the lemon. If you use the fresh lemon and say you cut it in half and
- **[02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i80vA_8MJQI&t=162s)** — you take both sides of lemon, you just squeeze them in there so you have the juice of one
- **[02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i80vA_8MJQI&t=166s)** — lemon. You'll be getting some additional things that you wouldn't get from bottle lemon juice
- **[02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i80vA_8MJQI&t=170s)** — and that would be vitamin C. Vitamin C is good for skin. It's good as an antioxidant for the
- **[02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i80vA_8MJQI&t=174s)** — inside of your arteries. But you know having an actual lemon is not always convenient. It is
- **[02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i80vA_8MJQI&t=178s)** — more convenient when you have a bottle of lemon juice in your refrigerator. I would highly
- **[03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i80vA_8MJQI&t=182s)** — recommend always doing organic lemon juice or an organic lemon because they use pesticides and
- **[03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i80vA_8MJQI&t=187s)** — you don't want that in this drink. There's one thing about lemons and limes. When you
- **[03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i80vA_8MJQI&t=191s)** — spray them, they absorb that pesticide inside the actual lemon. We also have the benefit of
- **[03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i80vA_8MJQI&t=196s)** — something called citric acid. Citric acid helps to reduce the risk of kidney stones because it
- **[03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i80vA_8MJQI&t=203s)** — binds with the this oxalate thing and then it reduces the chance of the formation of that
- **[03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i80vA_8MJQI&t=209s)** — stone. Lemon also has a tendency to reduce the incidence of gout because it can help lower
- **[03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i80vA_8MJQI&t=215s)** — uric acid. So it's really good for the kidneys. Certain things in lemon like the
- **[03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i80vA_8MJQI&t=219s)** — nutrients actually help the phase one phase two detoxification of the liver which allows you to
- **[03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i80vA_8MJQI&t=224s)** — pull out different chemicals. The lemon also acts on the bile and also the tartness of the
- **[03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i80vA_8MJQI&t=230s)** — lemon. It helps to thin the bile. It helps to reduce the incidence of gallstones as it helps
- **[03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i80vA_8MJQI&t=236s)** — to detoxify the liver. Also the actual stomach. The combination of lemon and salt. It's really
- **[04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i80vA_8MJQI&t=242s)** — good for digestion because it can stimulate digestive enzymes and juices to get the
- **[04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i80vA_8MJQI&t=248s)** — flowing. The properties in lemon can also help regulate cholesterol issues. It can provide
- **[04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i80vA_8MJQI&t=253s)** — antioxidants to the inside of the arteries to help reduce the risk of certain types of
- **[04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i80vA_8MJQI&t=258s)** — problems for the heart. The polyphenols in the lemon actually increase the diversity of the
- **[04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i80vA_8MJQI&t=263s)** — microbiome. The microbes in your gut actually thrive which is pretty wild. There's certain
- **[04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i80vA_8MJQI&t=267s)** — properties in lemon and salt that are antimicrobial. Lemons also can help increase
- **[04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i80vA_8MJQI&t=272s)** — the absorption of non-heme iron which is iron in plants. So if someone's anemic,
- **[04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i80vA_8MJQI&t=279s)** — taking lemon juice can help them. Also as a side note, if you have a tendency to develop
- **[04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i80vA_8MJQI&t=282s)** — kidney stones, I would also add magnesium and potassium to your protocol. One big mistake with
- **[04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i80vA_8MJQI&t=288s)** — lemon water. If you're doing this over a period of time and you're drinking it in your
- **[04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i80vA_8MJQI&t=292s)** — mouth, the acidity can affect your enamel and your teeth. So I would highly recommend using
- **[04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i80vA_8MJQI&t=298s)** — and then of course, cleaning out your mouth with water after you're done. I do my lemon salt water
- **[05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i80vA_8MJQI&t=303s)** — right after I drink my coffee in the morning. Another thing that I occasionally do is I'll take
- **[05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i80vA_8MJQI&t=308s)** — an organic lemon, the whole thing, the peel and all with the seeds and I will blend it
- **[05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i80vA_8MJQI&t=313s)** — with a glass of water and then also add this little pinch of sea salt to it because
- **[05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i80vA_8MJQI&t=319s)** — there are so many additional things in the actual peel itself and right underneath the peel
- **[05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i80vA_8MJQI&t=325s)** — all these bioflavonoids are really good for so many things. But for some people salty lemon
- **[05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i80vA_8MJQI&t=331s)** — water might be too tart and they'd like it sweet. I would highly recommend adding a couple drops
- **[05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i80vA_8MJQI&t=336s)** — of liquid stevia and then we turn this tart thing into lemonade. It actually is amazing.
- **[05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i80vA_8MJQI&t=341s)** — Your kids would love it as well and some people also add a little bit of alpacitor vinegar
- **[05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i80vA_8MJQI&t=345s)** — to that mix. So that would be one tablespoon if you wanted to take it to the next level.
- **[05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i80vA_8MJQI&t=349s)** — But anyway, I just wanted to give you this simple quick tip to see if it can help you.

- **[00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-K2kwojNXw&t=0s)** — You know, heart disease is right at the top of the list among all causes of death. And I talk a lot
- **[00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-K2kwojNXw&t=7s)** — about what to avoid for heart problems and cardiovascular disease. But today we're going
- **[00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-K2kwojNXw&t=11s)** — to talk about what to eat to clean out your arteries, whether you already have an existing
- **[00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-K2kwojNXw&t=17s)** — heart problem or you want to just prevent some things. So I'm going to talk about what to eat.
- **[00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-K2kwojNXw&t=21s)** — But I think it's going to be important to also cover what not to eat. So I just want to
- **[00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-K2kwojNXw&t=25s)** — briefly talk about that and then get right into exactly what you should eat. So that way
- **[00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-K2kwojNXw&t=29s)** — you know why you should eat certain things. All right, so where does this heart problem actually
- **[00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-K2kwojNXw&t=33s)** — start and originate? Well, it starts on the inside of your artery. There's a very thin
- **[00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-K2kwojNXw&t=40s)** — layer of cells. In fact, it's just a one cell layer thickness inside your arteries. And it's
- **[00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-K2kwojNXw&t=45s)** — called the endothelial layer. And it's permeable. It allows things to go back and
- **[00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-K2kwojNXw&t=51s)** — forth. And it lines all your vascular system, as well as the lymphatic system. And your
- **[00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-K2kwojNXw&t=57s)** — kidneys are connected to this. So when you filter blood to the kidneys, you have this
- **[01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-K2kwojNXw&t=63s)** — little thin wall that helps to filter things out, as well as keep things in. And so this
- **[01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-K2kwojNXw&t=68s)** — cell wall actually has a lot of different receptors for controlling blood pressure.
- **[01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-K2kwojNXw&t=75s)** — There's hormonal interactions. There's a huge immune part of these cells. So whatever's in
- **[01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-K2kwojNXw&t=80s)** — your blood is going to affect that layer. I mean, the obvious thing is like when you
- **[01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-K2kwojNXw&t=85s)** — those things as toxins end up in your blood, and it actually influences that cell wall.
- **[01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-K2kwojNXw&t=90s)** — And I do want to emphasize the word chronic, because you have people that
- **[01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-K2kwojNXw&t=94s)** — occasionally go off their plans, right? But then you have people that chronically
- **[01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-K2kwojNXw&t=98s)** — do certain things, right? They're chronically exposing their arteries to whatever's in the
- **[01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-K2kwojNXw&t=102s)** — smoke or whatever's in their food or alcohol. And that really creates the big problem. And
- **[01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-K2kwojNXw&t=107s)** — you also have as another aspect, stress can affect that cell layer. And of course,
- **[01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-K2kwojNXw&t=113s)** — sugar, refined sugars, especially refined carbohydrates, even sometimes worse than sugar,
- **[02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-K2kwojNXw&t=120s)** — even the gluten and grains can irritate that cell wall. And another big one is seed oils,
- **[02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-K2kwojNXw&t=126s)** — okay, canola, soy oil, corn oil, cotton seed oil. So when the inside layer of your arteries
- **[02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-K2kwojNXw&t=133s)** — are exposed to these things, you induce inflammation. And that is really the start of
- **[02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-K2kwojNXw&t=138s)** — this cascade of things where your body starts triggering this healing response where
- **[02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-K2kwojNXw&t=142s)** — you get this band-aid, which includes proteins like fibrous tissue called fibrin. And then you
- **[02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-K2kwojNXw&t=148s)** — have a combination of cholesterol and calcium. So that's what makes up this clot. And there's
- **[02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-K2kwojNXw&t=153s)** — really some good tests out there, especially the coronary artery calcification test, the CAC
- **[02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-K2kwojNXw&t=159s)** — test, I would highly recommend to do that. I had it done. You want it zero. And that's a
- **[02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-K2kwojNXw&t=163s)** — really good predictor of mortality. Another really good test is a heart rate variability
- **[02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-K2kwojNXw&t=169s)** — test. There's a lot of research on that, which is a certain devices that you can hook up to
- **[02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-K2kwojNXw&t=175s)** — even your finger or a band around your waist or your arm to pick up what's happening with the
- **[03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-K2kwojNXw&t=180s)** — contraction and relaxation of not just the heart, but all the vessels involved. And from
- **[03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-K2kwojNXw&t=185s)** — that test, you can tell what's happening with the cardiovascular system. It's really good,
- **[03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-K2kwojNXw&t=190s)** — especially with long distance runners who look healthy, but some of them are not healthy.
- **[03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-K2kwojNXw&t=195s)** — They're overtraining or something, and they have inflammation going on in the arteries,
- **[03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-K2kwojNXw&t=199s)** — which then can create a problem like a heart attack after they reach the finish line. So
- **[03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-K2kwojNXw&t=204s)** — you can't always go by how someone looks on the outside. There's certain tests that can pick
- **[03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-K2kwojNXw&t=209s)** — up things on the inside. Another really good test would be to measure the small dense particle
- **[03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-K2kwojNXw&t=214s)** — size of your LDLs. That's a really good indicator of something called oxidative LDL,
- **[03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-K2kwojNXw&t=220s)** — which is basically this protein carrier of certain fat that has been exposed to certain
- **[03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-K2kwojNXw&t=226s)** — things. And it's a bit pathogenic because it can invade inside of that layer and get deeper
- **[03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-K2kwojNXw&t=232s)** — into the area. And it can create inflammation and it lingers around longer than the other
- **[03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-K2kwojNXw&t=237s)** — LDL called the large buoyant, which I don't want to get too deep into that topic,
- **[04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-K2kwojNXw&t=242s)** — but you just need to know that there's two types of LDL and there's kind of one that is
- **[04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-K2kwojNXw&t=246s)** — pathogenic and one that is not as pathogenic. You also have this other bar marker, which
- **[04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-K2kwojNXw&t=252s)** — actually indicates a B vitamin deficiency. Okay. And that would be homocysteine. So that's
- **[04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-K2kwojNXw&t=257s)** — another test that could be done. If homocysteine is too high, this means that you're deficient
- **[04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-K2kwojNXw&t=263s)** — certain B vitamins that are necessary to protect the inside of the artery. And if you
- **[04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-K2kwojNXw&t=269s)** — have high homocysteine, you can be at risk for heart attack and stroke. And for that,
- **[04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-K2kwojNXw&t=273s)** — you're going to need natural forms of certain vitamins like folate and also B6 and also B12.
- **[04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-K2kwojNXw&t=283s)** — Because here's the thing, there is a certain genetic problem that a lot of people have,
- **[04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-K2kwojNXw&t=289s)** — and it's called MTHFR. And if you have a problem with this, this means that you can't
- **[04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-K2kwojNXw&t=293s)** — convert these synthetic versions of these vitamins to the active form. A lot of people
- **[05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-K2kwojNXw&t=300s)** — homocysteine level goes up and they're at risk for a lot of problems. So a simple solution is
- **[05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-K2kwojNXw&t=306s)** — just to consume more folate, not folic acid, which is in a lot of the enriched flour products
- **[05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-K2kwojNXw&t=313s)** — and rich grains. They also put in energy drinks and they put in supplements. You want to stay
- **[05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-K2kwojNXw&t=318s)** — away from folic acid. And then we have this question of like, how does the calcium end up
- **[05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-K2kwojNXw&t=321s)** — in the arteries? Well, there's one protein in the body that helps you keep calcium from
- **[05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-K2kwojNXw&t=327s)** — building up in the soft tissues in the arteries. And that protein is controlled by vitamin K2.
- **[05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-K2kwojNXw&t=334s)** — So part of this list of foods are going to be heavy in the vitamin K2 because we want to
- **[05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-K2kwojNXw&t=339s)** — keep the calcium out of the arteries. Another really common deficiency that creates a lot of
- **[05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-K2kwojNXw&t=347s)** — problems in the arteries, because it's a real strong protective thing for the inside of
- **[05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-K2kwojNXw&t=350s)** — the arteries, is vitamin E. So part of this list is also going to include vitamin E. And
- **[05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-K2kwojNXw&t=355s)** — one food that really depletes your vitamin E is the refined grains. The problem with grains
- **[06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-K2kwojNXw&t=361s)** — is it's loaded with gluten too. And then you say, well, what if I have gluten free? Well,
- **[06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-K2kwojNXw&t=364s)** — then it's refined. So we have this higher sugar, this product that turns in the sugar
- **[06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-K2kwojNXw&t=369s)** — faster. And we don't want sugar to end up in the arteries. Niacin is another really
- **[06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-K2kwojNXw&t=374s)** — important nutrient that is going to be in these lists of foods. And of course, vitamin C
- **[06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-K2kwojNXw&t=379s)** — is going to be in there as well, because that's a very important antioxidant that can
- **[06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-K2kwojNXw&t=383s)** — decrease some of the damage that you're exposed to in the environment with the foods you eat
- **[06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-K2kwojNXw&t=389s)** — and other things. So let's dive right into the list. Okay, number one is the heavy on
- **[06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-K2kwojNXw&t=394s)** — the omega-3 fatty acids. That would be of course salmon, other fatty fish, sardines,
- **[06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-K2kwojNXw&t=399s)** — very, very important. And there's one more thing too, that I consume on a regular basis.
- **[06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-K2kwojNXw&t=404s)** — And you probably heard of cod liver oil, but you may have not heard of cod liver. That's
- **[06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-K2kwojNXw&t=413s)** — the cod liver in the oil. And sometimes I crave it. So I'll do this, you know, maybe once or
- **[07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-K2kwojNXw&t=420s)** — twice a week, it has my protein source. It's bathed in this omega-3 fatty acid. So
- **[07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-K2kwojNXw&t=426s)** — I wouldn't drink all that. I would just have the salmon and maybe feed the oil to your
- **[07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-K2kwojNXw&t=432s)** — animals, like dogs, for example, they like it. But it's a lot of oil to consume. And
- **[07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-K2kwojNXw&t=437s)** — sometimes I'll do sardines as well. And of course, the sardines, I do an olive oil. So
- **[07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-K2kwojNXw&t=441s)** — that would be number two. Olive oil. Olive oil has a lot of great properties for the cardiovascular
- **[07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-K2kwojNXw&t=447s)** — system to help people prevent the high blood pressure. It's a really good fat. It's loaded
- **[07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-K2kwojNXw&t=452s)** — with heart healthy, supportive things for the endothelial cells. And you really want to make
- **[07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-K2kwojNXw&t=457s)** — sure that it's extra virgin olive oil from a location or farm that really cares about their
- **[07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-K2kwojNXw&t=462s)** — olive oil, that does a good job of producing it compared to some of the olive oil that you
- **[07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-K2kwojNXw&t=467s)** — take. It's just so bland. It's not even real. And there's also a lot of fake olive oil out there.
- **[07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-K2kwojNXw&t=472s)** — So make sure you have the good stuff. I like the stuff from Italy, but there's also great
- **[07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-K2kwojNXw&t=476s)** — stuff from Greece, Spain, France, all over the place. And number three, dark leafy green
- **[08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-K2kwojNXw&t=482s)** — vegetables. Okay, so you can put the olive oil on that dark leafy green to help extract
- **[08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-K2kwojNXw&t=488s)** — these phytonutrients, because a lot of the phytonutrients in plants, especially salad,
- **[08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-K2kwojNXw&t=493s)** — are fat soluble. And the dark leafy green vegetables have a good amount of vitamin C.
- **[08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-K2kwojNXw&t=499s)** — Okay, they also are loaded with folate, which is the natural form of B9. And the
- **[08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-K2kwojNXw&t=504s)** — dark leafy green vegetables also has magnesium, as well as potassium. Okay, and the next food
- **[08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-K2kwojNXw&t=509s)** — I'm going to recommend is a type of cheese that you'll put on your salad. Now a lot of
- **[08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-K2kwojNXw&t=513s)** — people use the American version of this called parmesan cheese, right, which is I think by
- **[08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-K2kwojNXw&t=518s)** — craft, from my viewpoint, doesn't even compare to the real stuff that they specialize in a
- **[08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-K2kwojNXw&t=524s)** — certain part of Italy to create this one type of cheese, which is loaded in vitamin K2,
- **[08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-K2kwojNXw&t=530s)** — which is really important in keeping that calcium out of the artery. And please excuse
- **[08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-K2kwojNXw&t=533s)** — me if I butcher the name of this, but it's called parmigiano. And you can usually find
- **[08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-K2kwojNXw&t=538s)** — this at any store. You have to make sure that you get the right kind, because a lot of
- **[09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-K2kwojNXw&t=542s)** — times the regular parmesan cheese that you get in America, they have this added ingredient
- **[09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-K2kwojNXw&t=546s)** — called cellulose, which is from wood pulp, kind of like a filler. Like, let me ask you this,
- **[09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-K2kwojNXw&t=551s)** — why would you want to put a filler in this cheese? I will guarantee if you get the real
- **[09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-K2kwojNXw&t=555s)** — stuff from Italy, they're not going to put wood pulp in there, okay, in the form of
- **[09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-K2kwojNXw&t=558s)** — cellulose. And I actually did a tour of how they make this cheese, and they put a lot of
- **[09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-K2kwojNXw&t=563s)** — care into this traditional cheese. It's dynamite on your salad. So you get all this vitamin K2,
- **[09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-K2kwojNXw&t=569s)** — you add the extra virgin olive oil on there. And then I also put nutritional yeast, okay.
- **[09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-K2kwojNXw&t=575s)** — Remember when I said unfortified, right? You want to get the one that's not fortified with
- **[09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-K2kwojNXw&t=579s)** — anything synthetic. If you fortify it with natural vitamins, fine, but not with synthetics,
- **[09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-K2kwojNXw&t=583s)** — like most companies do. But the point is that this nutritional yeast has a good natural
- **[09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-K2kwojNXw&t=589s)** — form of B9. And the one that I recommend, which I'll put a link down below, also has the
- **[09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-K2kwojNXw&t=594s)** — right form of B12, which is methylcobolamine. But it gives it a natural boost of B vitamins,
- **[10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-K2kwojNXw&t=600s)** — including B1 for stress. And it also has a nice little cheesy taste to it. I love it.
- **[10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-K2kwojNXw&t=604s)** — So there's another food that I'm going to add to this list that's loaded with vitamin K2
- **[10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-K2kwojNXw&t=609s)** — and loaded with vitamin C. In fact, it is the top food that I know of that has the most vitamin
- **[10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-K2kwojNXw&t=615s)** — C of anything, and it's raw sauerkraut. So it's very important not to buy sauerkraut in
- **[10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-K2kwojNXw&t=622s)** — a bottle that has been pasteurized. You want it raw. But sauerkraut is loaded with vitamin
- **[10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-K2kwojNXw&t=628s)** — K2. And it's also a probiotic. It's a prebiotic. And it also has a lot of vitamin C, like 700
- **[10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-K2kwojNXw&t=636s)** — milligrams per cup. The next heart healthy food I'm going to recommend almonds, believe it or
- **[10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-K2kwojNXw&t=641s)** — not, are loaded with magnesium. And so is spinach, and also vitamin E. But both of those
- **[10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-K2kwojNXw&t=646s)** — are loaded with oxalates. So if you have cheese close to the meal, okay, you'll have
- **[10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-K2kwojNXw&t=653s)** — calcium that will bind with the oxalates and prevent that potential irritation to your kidney
- **[10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-K2kwojNXw&t=659s)** — or even a kidney stone if someone is predisposed to it. All right, the next food I'm going to
- **[11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-K2kwojNXw&t=664s)** — recommend is liver. That's right. And you can do beef liver. You can even do this
- **[11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-K2kwojNXw&t=670s)** — cob liver, right? It's liver or chicken livers. Make sure they're quality. But I know you might
- **[11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-K2kwojNXw&t=676s)** — disagree with me on this point. But just think about it. If you have a high quality
- **[11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-K2kwojNXw&t=680s)** — liver product, like a beef liver or whatever, look what you're getting. You're getting pretty much
- **[11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-K2kwojNXw&t=686s)** — all the nutrients you can imagine. I mean, almost every vitamin that's in there in great
- **[11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-K2kwojNXw&t=690s)** — quantities. It has the folate, which is high in vegetables, and it has vitamin K2. So we're
- **[11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-K2kwojNXw&t=696s)** — about to tell you the last one. And then I'm going to explain why I'm telling you this.
- **[11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-K2kwojNXw&t=701s)** — Okay. First of all, if you do a search on heart healthy foods, they will give you,
- **[11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-K2kwojNXw&t=707s)** — you know, vegetables, fruits, whole grains, right? Which we know is not very healthy from
- **[11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-K2kwojNXw&t=714s)** — my viewpoint. And then they say stay away from, you know, sugars, junk food. And then they say
- **[12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-K2kwojNXw&t=721s)** — red processed meat. And that is everywhere. So they're including red meat as being very
- **[12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-K2kwojNXw&t=728s)** — dangerous to your heart. And so they kind of lump in all this meat together, okay,
- **[12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-K2kwojNXw&t=732s)** — but hasn't man consumed red meat for quite some time? Haven't we evolved on red meat? I mean,
- **[12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-K2kwojNXw&t=740s)** — is that really the source of all of our heart problems? Red meat, really? And of course,
- **[12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-K2kwojNXw&t=744s)** — I'm talking about the grass fed. I'm not talking about grain fed. And I know a lot
- **[12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-K2kwojNXw&t=748s)** — of farmers in the area and a lot of them use grains too fat in the cattle, because it
- **[12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-K2kwojNXw&t=754s)** — makes the meat marbleized. And the same thing with pigs and even horses, right? You could
- **[12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-K2kwojNXw&t=758s)** — grain too much to a horse or a pig, they get fat. I mean, what about humans? Why would we want to
- **[12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-K2kwojNXw&t=764s)** — recommend like 65% of our carbohydrates being grain? Why do we want to make that push? If
- **[12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-K2kwojNXw&t=769s)** — you consume grass fed grass finished beef, it's leaner, and it's healthier. And I raise my
- **[12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-K2kwojNXw&t=775s)** — own beef, and it's extremely healthy for the heart. It has all of the B vitamins I
- **[13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-K2kwojNXw&t=780s)** — talked about, including folate and B6 and B12. It has iron, people aren't going to be
- **[13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-K2kwojNXw&t=786s)** — allergic to it. It's not going to irritate your gut. It's loaded with glutamine, which is good
- **[13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-K2kwojNXw&t=790s)** — for inflammation. So I just want to talk a little bit more about this red meat because
- **[13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-K2kwojNXw&t=794s)** — there's been an extensive, extensive, very large credible study that was done fairly recently
- **[13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-K2kwojNXw&t=801s)** — that I'm going to share with you. And I actually found it in an article from Time Magazine
- **[13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-K2kwojNXw&t=805s)** — titled, Eat less red meat. Scientists said, now some believe that was bad advice. So check
- **[13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-K2kwojNXw&t=812s)** — this out. It says the evidence is too weak to justify telling individuals to eat less beef and
- **[13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-K2kwojNXw&t=817s)** — pork, according to the new research. The findings erode public trust, critics said,
- **[13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-K2kwojNXw&t=822s)** — which I'm going to get to why they're saying that. If there are health benefits from eating
- **[13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-K2kwojNXw&t=827s)** — less beef and pork, they're small. The researchers concluded. Indeed, the advantages
- **[13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-K2kwojNXw&t=832s)** — are so faint that they can be discerned only when looking at large populations,
- **[13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-K2kwojNXw&t=837s)** — the scientists said, and are not sufficient to tell individuals to change their meat eating
- **[14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-K2kwojNXw&t=842s)** — habits. I mean, that's incredible because, I mean, look what they're trying to push with
- **[14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-K2kwojNXw&t=846s)** — this red meat. They're trying to get rid of the cows, you know, mainly for environmental
- **[14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-K2kwojNXw&t=849s)** — thing, but they throw in there that it's bad for your health, which is absolutely based on
- **[14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-K2kwojNXw&t=856s)** — no real evidence. Already they have been met with fierce criticism by public health
- **[14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-K2kwojNXw&t=861s)** — researchers, the American Heart Association, the American Cancer Society, and Harvard Chan
- **[14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-K2kwojNXw&t=869s)** — School of Public Health and other groups. Some called for the journals editors to
- **[14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-K2kwojNXw&t=874s)** — delay publication altogether. In a statement, scientists at Harvard warned that the
- **[14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-K2kwojNXw&t=879s)** — conclusions harm the credibility of nutrition science and erode public trust in scientific
- **[14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-K2kwojNXw&t=886s)** — Let me just ask you a question. If we find something based on science that is more true,
- **[14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-K2kwojNXw&t=895s)** — that's kind of a new piece of knowledge, what you think that's because it's conflicting
- **[15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-K2kwojNXw&t=901s)** — with what we've been told before, that's going to erode trust, it's going to basically
- **[15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-K2kwojNXw&t=904s)** — increase trust. And who's telling us that? What should we just ignore this new finding
- **[15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-K2kwojNXw&t=909s)** — because, you know, we don't want to confuse the public. I mean, for me, I want to know
- **[15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-K2kwojNXw&t=914s)** — That's what builds trust. Hiding it from the public or telling a different narrative
- **[15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-K2kwojNXw&t=918s)** — creates more distrust. I mean, it's so funny. It harms the credibility of nutritional science.
- **[15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-K2kwojNXw&t=924s)** — Well, if nutritional science was based on good studies, then they wouldn't be harmed because
- **[15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-K2kwojNXw&t=928s)** — they would be telling the truth. The Physicians Committee for Responsible Medicine, a group
- **[15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-K2kwojNXw&t=933s)** — advocating a plant-based diet, on Wednesday filed a petition against the journal with the
- **[15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-K2kwojNXw&t=938s)** — Trade Commission. Wow. So you're going to attack a research paper based on your disagreement. Now
- **[15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-K2kwojNXw&t=945s)** — you're going to start involving the Federal Trade Commission? Like this is like, ridiculous. This
- **[15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-K2kwojNXw&t=949s)** — is not science. In science, we want to welcome opposing viewpoints. We don't want to science
- **[15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-K2kwojNXw&t=955s)** — the other side, the competition, basically. This is what they said in the study. It says,
- **[15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-K2kwojNXw&t=959s)** — the World Health Organization International Agency for Research on Cancer has indicated that
- **[16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-K2kwojNXw&t=964s)** — red meat is probably carcinogenic to humans, whereas processed meat is considered carcinogenic
- **[16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-K2kwojNXw&t=971s)** — to humans. These recommendations are, however, primarily based on observational studies
- **[16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-K2kwojNXw&t=976s)** — that are at high risk for confounding and thus are limited in establishing
- **[16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-K2kwojNXw&t=983s)** — causal inferences. Nor did they report the absolute magnitude of any possible effects.
- **[16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-K2kwojNXw&t=989s)** — Furthermore, the organizations that produce guidelines did not conduct or assess rigorous
- **[16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-K2kwojNXw&t=995s)** — systematic reviews of the evidence, were also limited in addressing conflicts of interests,
- **[16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-K2kwojNXw&t=1001s)** — and did not explicitly address population values and preferences, raising questions regarding the
- **[16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-K2kwojNXw&t=1008s)** — adherence to guideline standards for trustworthiness. So in other words, this
- **[16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-K2kwojNXw&t=1014s)** — red meat is a probable cancer is based on information that has conflict of interest,
- **[17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-K2kwojNXw&t=1022s)** — which I've already been through that research and I'll share more of that
- **[17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-K2kwojNXw&t=1026s)** — down below with some links. So check this out. Our analysis has several strengths. We
- **[17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-K2kwojNXw&t=1032s)** — conducted five separate rigorous systematic reviews addressing both the evidence and
- **[17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-K2kwojNXw&t=1037s)** — randomized trials and observational studies regarding the impact of unprocessed red meat
- **[17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-K2kwojNXw&t=1043s)** — and processed meat on cardiovascular and cancer outcomes and community values and preferences
- **[17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-K2kwojNXw&t=1049s)** — regarding red meat and processed meat consumption. Despite our findings from our assessment of
- **[17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-K2kwojNXw&t=1054s)** — intake studies versus dietary pattern studies, their conclusion is that unprocessed red meat
- **[17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-K2kwojNXw&t=1061s)** — and processed meat are unlikely, the causal factor for adverse health outcomes. I wanted
- **[17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-K2kwojNXw&t=1069s)** — to bring it up because one of the things that the tobacco industry used to do or started to do,
- **[17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-K2kwojNXw&t=1074s)** — which then the ultra-processed food companies are doing, is putting doubt into your mind about
- **[18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-K2kwojNXw&t=1081s)** — what is good and what is bad to keep everyone confused. And one definite thing about red meat
- **[18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-K2kwojNXw&t=1086s)** — is to put doubts in your mind that that could be bad for you. And so here you are avoiding
- **[18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-K2kwojNXw&t=1090s)** — it when really it's not based on sound science at all. Just going forward, I'm going to
- **[18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-K2kwojNXw&t=1099s)** — add PR on how unhealthy red meat is. I mean, it's really important to look at the source of
- **[18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-K2kwojNXw&t=1104s)** — this data that's being pushed out there. Who's pushing it out there and who's really
- **[18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-K2kwojNXw&t=1107s)** — going to benefit from people not eating beef. But red meat when it's high quality is very good
- **[18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-K2kwojNXw&t=1113s)** — for the heart, especially if you're not consuming with it these grains and sugars and
- **[18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-K2kwojNXw&t=1118s)** — junk food. Now, if you enjoyed this video, there's another video talking about the best meal
- **[18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-K2kwojNXw&t=1125s)** — for your arteries to keep your arteries really clean. If you haven't seen that video,

- **[00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UHd3ODiJxyQ&t=0s)** — So, if you're deciding to take magnesium to help yourself sleep or maybe for anxiety or stress,
- **[00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UHd3ODiJxyQ&t=6s)** — today we're going to talk about when you might not need magnesium. In fact, the worst thing you could
- **[00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UHd3ODiJxyQ&t=10s)** — do is buy some magnesium and then find out it doesn't really work for them. That's not what
- **[00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UHd3ODiJxyQ&t=14s)** — they needed. Or it worsens their sleep situation. Magnesium is supposed to calm you down. It's
- **[00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UHd3ODiJxyQ&t=20s)** — supposed to lower cortisol and adrenaline. How could it actually make you more stressed out?
- **[00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UHd3ODiJxyQ&t=27s)** — That's the question. Your anxiety could come from many different causes. So, magnesium is just one
- **[00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UHd3ODiJxyQ&t=33s)** — remedy to handle one aspect of sleep and anxiety. As far as sleep goes, we dissect sleep into two
- **[00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UHd3ODiJxyQ&t=39s)** — different categories. People that can't get the sleep versus people that can't stay asleep. When
- **[00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UHd3ODiJxyQ&t=45s)** — you initially try to go to sleep, if you can go to sleep very easily, chances are you have
- **[00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UHd3ODiJxyQ&t=51s)** — good parasympathetics. What does that mean? Well, there's two parts of the nervous system.
- **[00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UHd3ODiJxyQ&t=55s)** — You have the parasympathetic and that's kind of like the system that actually pushes you into a
- **[01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UHd3ODiJxyQ&t=60s)** — deep restful sleep. It keeps you calm and it's mainly responsible for the first part of the
- **[01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UHd3ODiJxyQ&t=66s)** — sleep, especially the deeper delta wave sleep. But the second part of the sleep is more
- **[01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UHd3ODiJxyQ&t=73s)** — what's called REM sleep. People that have higher levels of adrenaline and cortisol tend to wake up
- **[01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UHd3ODiJxyQ&t=80s)** — like two o'clock in the morning or two thirty or three o'clock in the middle of night.
- **[01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UHd3ODiJxyQ&t=85s)** — And they're like laying there like, okay, so I'm more awake now than I am during the day.
- **[01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UHd3ODiJxyQ&t=90s)** — So if we look at this circadian wave rhythm of cortisol hormone, the lowest point should be
- **[01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UHd3ODiJxyQ&t=97s)** — at 2 a.m. and the highest point should be roughly about eight o'clock in the morning.
- **[01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UHd3ODiJxyQ&t=103s)** — But a lot of times it's kind of backwards and you're always going to wake up feeling
- **[01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UHd3ODiJxyQ&t=107s)** — not very refreshed. So then people take magnesium because magnesium is supposed to lower
- **[01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UHd3ODiJxyQ&t=112s)** — cortisol and adrenaline, but sometimes it doesn't. Why? Because the actual cause of this high
- **[01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UHd3ODiJxyQ&t=117s)** — cortisol is not coming from a lack of magnesium. You see the problem is it's really hard to
- **[02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UHd3ODiJxyQ&t=121s)** — test for a magnesium deficiency because as soon as you test it in the blood, it's not going
- **[02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UHd3ODiJxyQ&t=127s)** — to really show up necessarily unless you're really, really deficient because most of your
- **[02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UHd3ODiJxyQ&t=132s)** — magnesium 98 to 99 percent is inside the cell. Let's say you don't consume a lot of green
- **[02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UHd3ODiJxyQ&t=138s)** — things. I'm talking about vegetables that are green because chlorophyll has magnesium in it,
- **[02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UHd3ODiJxyQ&t=144s)** — but it's also high in some nuts like almonds. It's high in chocolate. It's also high in
- **[02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UHd3ODiJxyQ&t=149s)** — pumpkin seeds. So let's say, for example, you don't eat a lot of those foods. Let's say
- **[02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UHd3ODiJxyQ&t=153s)** — instead you are heavy on the carbs. Okay. You do a lot of sugar and grains. Refined
- **[02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UHd3ODiJxyQ&t=159s)** — sugar and grains will deplete your magnesium. If you're fatigued or maybe have cramps in your
- **[02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UHd3ODiJxyQ&t=163s)** — legs at night, you could be deficient magnesium. Okay. So you go to bed and you're lying there.
- **[02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UHd3ODiJxyQ&t=169s)** — You just can't get into a sleep, right? Chances are you don't have enough parasympathetic
- **[02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UHd3ODiJxyQ&t=174s)** — nervous system. If you're experiencing a lot of stress and you're not exercising,
- **[02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UHd3ODiJxyQ&t=178s)** — that's definitely going to screw up your sleep. Exercise helps. Long walks help. But what
- **[03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UHd3ODiJxyQ&t=183s)** — really helps more than both of those is physical work. Yeah. Outside. Because it also
- **[03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UHd3ODiJxyQ&t=189s)** — handles the mental component. It takes your mind off the stress. Now also if you're low in
- **[03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UHd3ODiJxyQ&t=196s)** — vitamin B1, okay, you're going to have this situation where you're going to lie down and
- **[03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UHd3ODiJxyQ&t=201s)** — you're going to try to go to sleep, but you're thinking you're solving problems 24-7. You
- **[03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UHd3ODiJxyQ&t=205s)** — can't turn it off. That means you need B1. And chances are you're doing too many carbs,
- **[03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UHd3ODiJxyQ&t=211s)** — which deplete B1. In my situation when I was younger in my 20s, I'm in my 30s right now,
- **[03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UHd3ODiJxyQ&t=218s)** — and I'm being also very sarcastic. I used to consume a lot of carbs and not any B1.
- **[03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UHd3ODiJxyQ&t=225s)** — So I had restless leg syndrome. I had a lot of nervous anxiety. But one thing that could have
- **[03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UHd3ODiJxyQ&t=230s)** — helped me if just to take B1, if I would have known about it, I probably would have
- **[03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UHd3ODiJxyQ&t=234s)** — got rid of my restless leg syndrome. But when you take B1, you'll feel the sense of relief
- **[03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UHd3ODiJxyQ&t=239s)** — and you can finally turn it off and go to sleep. Also, if you're doing a lot of coffee or tea,
- **[04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UHd3ODiJxyQ&t=244s)** — that can deplete you of the B1. If you're going to take a B1, make sure it's a natural
- **[04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UHd3ODiJxyQ&t=248s)** — version. I'll put a link down below for more information on that point. Now you have another
- **[04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UHd3ODiJxyQ&t=252s)** — factor too. Melatonin. I don't recommend taking a melatonin supplement. Even though
- **[04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UHd3ODiJxyQ&t=259s)** — melatonin will help you get to sleep, it's not good at helping you stay asleep. I suggest
- **[04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UHd3ODiJxyQ&t=264s)** — kind of looking at the reason why you might not have enough melatonin in the first place.
- **[04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UHd3ODiJxyQ&t=268s)** — And there's a precursor thing that turns in the melatonin. That's called tryptophan. But there's
- **[04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UHd3ODiJxyQ&t=274s)** — another thing you can do as well. And this has to do with, I think, a better way to get your
- **[04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UHd3ODiJxyQ&t=280s)** — melatonin. See, melatonin is inhibited by blue light. Okay, like sitting in front of your
- **[04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UHd3ODiJxyQ&t=286s)** — computer screen, the cell phone, the whole thing that can really deplete your melatonin.
- **[04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UHd3ODiJxyQ&t=292s)** — What recharges the melatonin is number one darkness or certain types of light,
- **[04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UHd3ODiJxyQ&t=299s)** — like infrared. Over 50% of the sun's rays are infrared. One really good remedy for sleep
- **[05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UHd3ODiJxyQ&t=306s)** — cycles is just to be outside more to get exposure to the sun. The sunset and the
- **[05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UHd3ODiJxyQ&t=313s)** — sunrise has certain colors of like orange, yellow. That is higher levels of infrared,
- **[05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UHd3ODiJxyQ&t=319s)** — which can greatly help wind things down for you. So you can maybe even get one of those
- **[05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UHd3ODiJxyQ&t=328s)** — lights that helps wake you up. And this is really good in the wintertime when you're
- **[05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UHd3ODiJxyQ&t=333s)** — not outside very much. And it's also good if you have to stay inside a lot and work a lot
- **[05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UHd3ODiJxyQ&t=338s)** — inside and you don't have access to the outside, you should have some type of internal
- **[05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UHd3ODiJxyQ&t=342s)** — full spectrum light. But these lights are really, really important. We want to
- **[05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UHd3ODiJxyQ&t=347s)** — not be overexposed to the blue lights. If you can get incandescent, that would be the best thing.
- **[05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UHd3ODiJxyQ&t=352s)** — If you have a fireplace, if you could be exposed to that, that would be great. Or a campfire.
- **[05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UHd3ODiJxyQ&t=356s)** — All of this will give you infrared. Very beneficial. Also, I find that when people
- **[06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UHd3ODiJxyQ&t=362s)** — take vitamin D before bed, it really helps their sleep. And one more point about magnesium.
- **[06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UHd3ODiJxyQ&t=370s)** — Magnesium will not work if you're really low in vitamin D. And vitamin D won't work either
- **[06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UHd3ODiJxyQ&t=377s)** — if you're low in magnesium. If you're fasting and you're new at fasting and you go to bed hungry,
- **[06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UHd3ODiJxyQ&t=384s)** — that could keep you up because you're not adapted yet and starts releasing sugar.
- **[06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UHd3ODiJxyQ&t=389s)** — And all of a sudden you wake up because of the cortisol. Realize if the fasting
- **[06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UHd3ODiJxyQ&t=394s)** — triggered your sleep problem, maybe you need to gradually work into it slower. And maybe
- **[06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UHd3ODiJxyQ&t=403s)** — you increase your carbs to 50 grams. Have a bunch of berries, for example, and figure out
- **[06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UHd3ODiJxyQ&t=410s)** — what 50 grams would be to get more carbs, just to handle this spike in cortisol situation,
- **[06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UHd3ODiJxyQ&t=416s)** — which can be a problem for certain people. Now let's talk about what happens when people
- **[07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UHd3ODiJxyQ&t=421s)** — cannot stay asleep. They're getting up and they don't get that last part of the sleep.
- **[07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UHd3ODiJxyQ&t=425s)** — The sympathetic nervous system activates adrenaline, but also cortisol can be involved as well because
- **[07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UHd3ODiJxyQ&t=430s)** — they both work together in the stress response. And this REM sleep, rapid eye movement,
- **[07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UHd3ODiJxyQ&t=437s)** — is kind of a very superficial wave. Have these vivid dreams. It's almost like you're awake,
- **[07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UHd3ODiJxyQ&t=443s)** — but you're sleeping. So all it takes is just a little stress to kind of bump you out of
- **[07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UHd3ODiJxyQ&t=448s)** — that. What you need to do to reduce cortisol is to exercise more, but make sure you do
- **[07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UHd3ODiJxyQ&t=455s)** — not over train. Really working hard and you can sweat and use up a lot of your energy,
- **[07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UHd3ODiJxyQ&t=461s)** — but don't go overboard and don't do this every single day, maybe twice a week. And then you
- **[07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UHd3ODiJxyQ&t=467s)** — stopped exercising. Your mitochondria now are so used to that energy production and you're
- **[07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UHd3ODiJxyQ&t=473s)** — just like going to bed with all this extra energy. You just, you have to deplete it.
- **[07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UHd3ODiJxyQ&t=477s)** — Long walks are excellent at reducing cortisol as well. Anytime the blood sugars go low,
- **[08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UHd3ODiJxyQ&t=483s)** — you could have a situation with high cortisol. But here's the thing. If you do it right,
- **[08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UHd3ODiJxyQ&t=489s)** — you do intermittent fasting correctly and gradually over time, it'll be very smooth
- **[08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UHd3ODiJxyQ&t=494s)** — where you won't have a major problem with cortisol. Why? Because you've adapted to your
- **[08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UHd3ODiJxyQ&t=499s)** — fat and you're burning fat and there's not a need to rely on sugar. So I found that having
- **[08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UHd3ODiJxyQ&t=505s)** — a little bit more salt, especially if you're on a low carb diet or you're doing fasting,
- **[08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UHd3ODiJxyQ&t=509s)** — is going to be vital. That alone can solve your sleeping problems without even taking magnesium.
- **[08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UHd3ODiJxyQ&t=516s)** — Okay. Have some salt right before you go to bed and just see what happens. Cool thing about
- **[08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UHd3ODiJxyQ&t=519s)** — salt is salt retains fluid, which means you're not going to get up and have to use the
- **[08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UHd3ODiJxyQ&t=526s)** — bathroom as much. If you have a little more salt versus not having enough salt,
- **[08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UHd3ODiJxyQ&t=531s)** — you'll tend to pee more at night. But what about anxiety, right? Anxiety is kind of
- **[08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UHd3ODiJxyQ&t=537s)** — tied in with insomnia. But if you just have anxiety, obviously you want to evaluate what's
- **[09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UHd3ODiJxyQ&t=542s)** — causing anxiety, but if you just have anxiety for no reason, I'm telling you B1 is the answer
- **[09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UHd3ODiJxyQ&t=548s)** — to that. You should just try some. If you ever notice someone with anxiety, their inhalation
- **[09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UHd3ODiJxyQ&t=552s)** — is not matching the timing of their exhalation. And so what happens is that you don't get the
- **[09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UHd3ODiJxyQ&t=559s)** — right CO2 retention to allow the oxygen to go into the cells. I mean, just picture someone
- **[09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UHd3ODiJxyQ&t=566s)** — has a panic attack, right? They're getting too much oxygen. So just by slowing down the breath,
- **[09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UHd3ODiJxyQ&t=572s)** — and I've done other videos on this, especially if you're trying to go to sleep,
- **[09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UHd3ODiJxyQ&t=576s)** — or get back to sleep, breathing through your nose, slowly in, slowly out, the same rhythm.
- **[09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UHd3ODiJxyQ&t=583s)** — Boy, that helps a lot. But also like a lot of medications, especially metformin,
- **[09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UHd3ODiJxyQ&t=588s)** — will deplete you a B1. Let's say you do need magnesium, right? Magnesium glycinate is a
- **[09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UHd3ODiJxyQ&t=595s)** — good for sleep and anxiety because of the glycinate part. The glycinate part of the
- **[10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UHd3ODiJxyQ&t=602s)** — magnesium is really glycine. And glycine is a calming amino acid. When should you take
- **[10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UHd3ODiJxyQ&t=609s)** — magnesium glycinate? Maybe about a half hour before you go to bed. And so there's other
- **[10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UHd3ODiJxyQ&t=613s)** — types of magnesium out there. You can get this magnesium citrate. It works, but probably
- **[10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UHd3ODiJxyQ&t=618s)** — not as good. You can take the magnesium oxide or the carbonate. Those don't get absorbed as
- **[10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UHd3ODiJxyQ&t=625s)** — well. They're very cheap and they don't seem to work as well as the glycinate. The magnesium
- **[10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UHd3ODiJxyQ&t=630s)** — glycinate is really good because so many people are also deficient in glycine. And if you have
- **[10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UHd3ODiJxyQ&t=636s)** — not seen my video where I talk more on glycine, you should check that one out. It's

- **[00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wo_9gjsFT9o&t=0s)** — So the question we're going to resolve today is why do most Indian men have this protruding pot belly?
- **[00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wo_9gjsFT9o&t=7s)** — Indian women also are getting larger midsections as well. Why is this and what could be done about
- **[00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wo_9gjsFT9o&t=13s)** — it? When I was in practice a good portion of my patients were from India and the reason they
- **[00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wo_9gjsFT9o&t=18s)** — came in is to get rid of this belly fat. But it's not just belly fat. There is a huge component
- **[00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wo_9gjsFT9o&t=25s)** — of digestive problems. Anytime someone has a belly, they're also going to have a fatty
- **[00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wo_9gjsFT9o&t=31s)** — liver. And then when you do a deep dive into the topic of digestive problems in India,
- **[00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wo_9gjsFT9o&t=38s)** — well, we don't really know. It's unknown. It's probably stress. It's a lack of exercise,
- **[00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wo_9gjsFT9o&t=43s)** — but they're missing the obvious. What's the elephant in the room? Let's dive into that topic
- **[00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wo_9gjsFT9o&t=48s)** — right now. If you understand the word omnivore, that's a specific diet that involves plant base
- **[00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wo_9gjsFT9o&t=55s)** — as well as animal products like meats. Then you have the word herbivore who eats plants.
- **[01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wo_9gjsFT9o&t=63s)** — And if we look at a gorilla, which is an herbivore, and they're grazing all day long
- **[01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wo_9gjsFT9o&t=68s)** — to get enough food, they always have a protruded huge belly, sometimes even wider
- **[01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wo_9gjsFT9o&t=77s)** — than their shoulders. Now, if we compare that to a chimpanzee who is an omnivore, they will eat
- **[01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wo_9gjsFT9o&t=83s)** — other animals and meat as well as plants. Chimpanzees have flat stomachs. We have a
- **[01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wo_9gjsFT9o&t=90s)** — goat named Billy. Karen was gone for a few days, so I was looking after the goats and I
- **[01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wo_9gjsFT9o&t=95s)** — noticed baby Billy had this huge protruded stomach and I was concerned. And so I drove
- **[01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wo_9gjsFT9o&t=101s)** — over an hour to go to the vet to see what was wrong. And the vet took one look at Billy and
- **[01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wo_9gjsFT9o&t=108s)** — said, this is normal. Goats are supposed to have a belly. And I'm like, oh, okay, I had no idea.
- **[01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wo_9gjsFT9o&t=114s)** — So what's going on there? And how is that similar to humans? Well,
- **[01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wo_9gjsFT9o&t=118s)** — in an herbivore situation, they are fermenting fiber, but it's actually the microbes in the
- **[02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wo_9gjsFT9o&t=124s)** — And so the animal gets its protein from the bacteria that's eating the fiber,
- **[02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wo_9gjsFT9o&t=131s)** — because bacteria is like 60% protein, which can then be absorbed by the herbivore,
- **[02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wo_9gjsFT9o&t=138s)** — because these animals cannot digest the fiber directly. Out of all the countries in the world,
- **[02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wo_9gjsFT9o&t=144s)** — India consumes the least amount of animal meat. They're getting way too much fermentation
- **[02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wo_9gjsFT9o&t=150s)** — in the small intestine. And there's a condition called SIBO, small intestinal bacterial overgrowth.
- **[02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wo_9gjsFT9o&t=157s)** — And that's a situation where you're getting fermentation in the wrong place,
- **[02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wo_9gjsFT9o&t=161s)** — because you have the stomach, then you have this long small intestine, and then you have
- **[02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wo_9gjsFT9o&t=165s)** — the large intestine. The way it should work is that you should digest the fiber in the large
- **[02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wo_9gjsFT9o&t=171s)** — intestine. If you look at the history of what an Indian ate 5,000 years ago, 100 years ago,
- **[02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wo_9gjsFT9o&t=179s)** — they were not big meat eaters. However, they did eat meat here and there. And occasionally they had
- **[03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wo_9gjsFT9o&t=185s)** — goat and sheep, but not beef. In the current diet, the three primary ingredients that are in
- **[03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wo_9gjsFT9o&t=192s)** — pretty much all ultra processed foods are the sugar. This is glucose syrup. So it's not even
- **[03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wo_9gjsFT9o&t=198s)** — like real sugar cane. It's synthetic sugar. Then you have the seed oils right here, highly
- **[03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wo_9gjsFT9o&t=204s)** — industrial processed, highly inflammatory. And then of course, we have the starches in the form
- **[03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wo_9gjsFT9o&t=211s)** — of multidextrin food starch. We're not talking about potatoes. We're not even talking about
- **[03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wo_9gjsFT9o&t=218s)** — unrefined rice. We're talking about refined starches. So we have all of that in their
- **[03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wo_9gjsFT9o&t=224s)** — diet, especially when someone doesn't have the money and can't afford higher quality foods.
- **[03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wo_9gjsFT9o&t=230s)** — And so if we add that into the mix, now we start to really break down the stomach lining
- **[03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wo_9gjsFT9o&t=236s)** — to the point where you can get ulcers, something called gastritis. And it's when we start eating
- **[04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wo_9gjsFT9o&t=242s)** — junk foods and we weaken the system that that microbe comes out and starts creating a
- **[04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wo_9gjsFT9o&t=249s)** — wearing of that mucus lining in our stomach. Suspect that's H. pylori. And H. pylori has a
- **[04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wo_9gjsFT9o&t=255s)** — interesting strategy to help it survive decreasing your stomach acid. So it starts making
- **[04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wo_9gjsFT9o&t=263s)** — ammonia. And so that changes the pH of your stomach. So now it can survive. And here you
- **[04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wo_9gjsFT9o&t=269s)** — are having a stomach that's no longer acid. So now try to digest, right? And now you can't
- **[04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wo_9gjsFT9o&t=275s)** — kill off the microbes. Not to mention a lot of people take antacids, which weaken the
- **[04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wo_9gjsFT9o&t=281s)** — system even more. And that can even increase the risk of getting H. pylori. And then when
- **[04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wo_9gjsFT9o&t=285s)** — GI doctor looks at you, they're not finding anything. So they just treat you. They're not
- **[04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wo_9gjsFT9o&t=290s)** — trained in diet or food therapy. That's the big omission. That being said, how do we correct
- **[04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wo_9gjsFT9o&t=295s)** — this problem? Anything that's bloating you is not good for you. Mark it off the list.
- **[05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wo_9gjsFT9o&t=300s)** — Don't eat it again. And this could involve fiber, vegetables. It can also involve fruit.
- **[05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wo_9gjsFT9o&t=306s)** — And a lot of these grains also are very high in omega-6. So it's going to create
- **[05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wo_9gjsFT9o&t=311s)** — inflammation. Now, the other thing I would do parallel to this is I would not do
- **[05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wo_9gjsFT9o&t=316s)** — snacks between meals. I would do intermittent fasting because that's going to instantly give
- **[05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wo_9gjsFT9o&t=321s)** — your digestive system a break, a chance to heal. Now, what's interesting about meat,
- **[05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wo_9gjsFT9o&t=328s)** — there's something called the carnivore diet. I'm not telling you to do it. I'm not telling
- **[05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wo_9gjsFT9o&t=332s)** — you not to do it. But a lot of people do the carnivore diet to heal their gut
- **[05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wo_9gjsFT9o&t=336s)** — because you eliminate all these other fibers that are irritating the inflamed stomach.
- **[05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wo_9gjsFT9o&t=343s)** — Meat is loaded with glutamine that seals the gut. I tried to be a vegetarian and I got too
- **[05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wo_9gjsFT9o&t=350s)** — much bloating because in my mind I thought that, oh wow, you need fiber to eliminate.
- **[05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wo_9gjsFT9o&t=355s)** — And that is absolutely, positively not true. Now, whether you're going to do a carnivore or
- **[05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wo_9gjsFT9o&t=359s)** — not based on religious reasons or whatever, you do want to start introducing more protein.
- **[06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wo_9gjsFT9o&t=365s)** — And that can be fish, eggs, things like that. And typically animal protein is much easier to
- **[06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wo_9gjsFT9o&t=373s)** — digest. So what I'm telling you to do is clean up the refined carbs. See how that goes.
- **[06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wo_9gjsFT9o&t=380s)** — And if you still have bloating, you're going to have to start eliminating some of these other
- **[06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wo_9gjsFT9o&t=384s)** — foods. There's a couple other things I would recommend. One remedy is called betaine
- **[06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wo_9gjsFT9o&t=388s)** — hydrochloride. The only time I wouldn't take it is if you have an ulcer or gastritis.
- **[06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wo_9gjsFT9o&t=393s)** — It's going to increase the acid of your stomach. And so when you take this betaine hydrochloride,
- **[06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wo_9gjsFT9o&t=397s)** — you take like maybe five or six of them at a time before you eat, your stomach's going to
- **[06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wo_9gjsFT9o&t=402s)** — start feeling better and better and better because you're reestablishing that pH. So when
- **[06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wo_9gjsFT9o&t=406s)** — you eat food, if there's pathogens in there, they'll be killed and then they won't end up
- **[06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wo_9gjsFT9o&t=412s)** — in your small intestine and start to ferment and all these other issues. So I think this is
- **[06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wo_9gjsFT9o&t=417s)** — turn things around. But for a more detailed understanding of the digestive system and
- **[07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wo_9gjsFT9o&t=424s)** — what to do for various situations, I put that up right here. Check it out.

- **[00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1N9si1HRIo&t=0s)** — Alright guys, we are at the last video. So, how do we determine if something is synthetic?
- **[00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1N9si1HRIo&t=4s)** — Just read the Bacca label and it should tell you in the ingredients if it comes from
- **[00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1N9si1HRIo&t=9s)** — actual vegetables or an herb or some food versus some chemical name. Also, if the milligrams are
- **[00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1N9si1HRIo&t=15s)** — all the same, like 100, 100, 100, 100, then we know it's synthetic because natural vitamins
- **[00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1N9si1HRIo&t=20s)** — come in different amounts that are not whole numbers like 6.5, 5.3, that type of thing.
- **[00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1N9si1HRIo&t=26s)** — And so we don't want to do synthetics, okay? And do food-based vitamins, not just natural,
- **[00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1N9si1HRIo&t=33s)** — but food-based, food concentrates. Okay, to get rid of phytic acid, you want to soak the nuts
- **[00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1N9si1HRIo&t=39s)** — in the seeds overnight, dry them out, or you can get them roasted, okay? For foods like
- **[00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1N9si1HRIo&t=47s)** — oxalates, add lemon juice. That's what we need to do with that. Lemon juice each day,
- **[00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1N9si1HRIo&t=52s)** — lemon in the water every day, that would be very important, especially to counteract the
- **[00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1N9si1HRIo&t=57s)** — oxalates from spinach or peanuts or some of the cruciferous vegetables. But in general,
- **[01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1N9si1HRIo&t=62s)** — cruciferous tends to deplete iodine, so find a good sea kelp. I have one called Icelandic
- **[01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1N9si1HRIo&t=69s)** — organic sea kelp. You can try that. It's high quality and you don't need much,
- **[01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1N9si1HRIo&t=74s)** — probably one in the morning. Don't take it before you go to sleep because it'll keep you
- **[01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1N9si1HRIo&t=77s)** — up at night because it gives you energy. Now for vitamin A, make sure that you get it from
- **[01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1N9si1HRIo&t=81s)** — animal fats or fish oils or butter or cod liver oil, very important vitamin A. You can get it
- **[01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1N9si1HRIo&t=89s)** — from eggs as well. Iron comes from animal proteins, beef, chicken, turkey, lamb, eggs.
- **[01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1N9si1HRIo&t=98s)** — Okay? B12, you can get it from spirulina, chlorella, wheatgrass juice, but you can also
- **[01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1N9si1HRIo&t=106s)** — get it from animal protein as well. Now, if the stomach acid is low, you need something called
- **[01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1N9si1HRIo&t=113s)** — digest formula. This gives you a combination of alpacite of vinegar and betaine hydrochloride
- **[01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1N9si1HRIo&t=119s)** — together. You take them before a meal, take maybe two or up to four, and it helps you
- **[02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1N9si1HRIo&t=126s)** — acidify the stomach to start pulling in those minerals. The way you know you need more
- **[02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1N9si1HRIo&t=131s)** — stomach acid is if you get indigestion, gas, bloating, and you feel that the food's not
- **[02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1N9si1HRIo&t=137s)** — digesting fast enough. Okay, lastly, the gallbladder. If you have gallbladder symptoms,
- **[02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1N9si1HRIo&t=140s)** — you have right shoulder pain, you get bloating, you have a lot of deficiencies with the fat
- **[02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1N9si1HRIo&t=145s)** — soluble vitamins. I recommend taking one gallbladder formula after the meal. The gallbladder
- **[02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1N9si1HRIo&t=150s)** — formula I have is not just purified bile salts. It has betaine hydrochloride for the stomach,
- **[02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1N9si1HRIo&t=156s)** — it has pancreatic enzymes, it has other things to help lubricate the colon, it has other herbs
- **[02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1N9si1HRIo&t=164s)** — to prevent gallstones. Okay guys, so you completed the mini course and now you know why
- **[02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1N9si1HRIo&t=169s)** — someone that tries eat healthy could still have a nutritional deficiency.
- **[02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1N9si1HRIo&t=173s)** — So share this course with your friends and family and I will see you in the next mini course.

## Video 96: Why Fasting Is MORE Important than Diet

- **[00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oql3QUD2JyI&t=0s)** — You know, boy, my viewpoint in intermittent fasting has gone from all the way over here to all the way over here.
- **[00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oql3QUD2JyI&t=7s)** — At one time, when someone mentioned fasting, I'm like, what is that going to do?
- **[00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oql3QUD2JyI&t=11s)** — Fasting? It's not going to help you. And then when I started looking into it,
- **[00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oql3QUD2JyI&t=16s)** — I'm like, wow, fasting is the most important thing you can do for your health out of all the things.
- **[00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oql3QUD2JyI&t=22s)** — And I want to talk about why that is. I mean, if you look at fasting from a scale of
- **[00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oql3QUD2JyI&t=26s)** — what can a person do to create more health, it's right at the top of the list.
- **[00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oql3QUD2JyI&t=31s)** — It's more important in what you eat. It's more important than exercise.
- **[00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oql3QUD2JyI&t=35s)** — I mean, when you think about the survival mechanism in our bodies, right, we have developed
- **[00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oql3QUD2JyI&t=40s)** — some serious biochemistry relating to preventing dying from starvation, preventing being frozen
- **[00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oql3QUD2JyI&t=49s)** — to death, also preventing being eaten by lions by running away. So we have this fasting, we
- **[00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oql3QUD2JyI&t=55s)** — have cold therapy, we have exercise that tends to mimic how our bodies develop these survival
- **[01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oql3QUD2JyI&t=62s)** — mechanisms. So when you do fasting, you directly trigger all these amazing survival genes.
- **[01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oql3QUD2JyI&t=70s)** — And this involves pretty much every part of your body. Every part of your body starts to
- **[01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oql3QUD2JyI&t=74s)** — improve. I mean, if you compare the environment that we used to be in, which is
- **[01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oql3QUD2JyI&t=78s)** — not frequent eating, to the environment now, which is grazing all day long, you can see the
- **[01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oql3QUD2JyI&t=85s)** — I mean, today is the day after Christmas, okay. Now yesterday there was food available
- **[01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oql3QUD2JyI&t=91s)** — all day long. And it wasn't unhealthy food, but it was just a lot of food. And I grazed pretty
- **[01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oql3QUD2JyI&t=97s)** — much all day long. And I can tell you, I don't feel very good. I don't feel good when I eat
- **[01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oql3QUD2JyI&t=103s)** — in a constant way. So when you start fasting, you know, the first thing you do is you give up
- **[01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oql3QUD2JyI&t=108s)** — your snacks. And then the second thing you do is you tend to let that breakfast go away.
- **[01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oql3QUD2JyI&t=111s)** — You go as long as you can until you can get to that first meal, which is roughly maybe at lunch
- **[01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oql3QUD2JyI&t=116s)** — time. And then you wait until dinner, and then you eat, and then you don't snack. And yes,
- **[02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oql3QUD2JyI&t=120s)** — you can have coffee, you can have tea, you can drink liquids. Just make sure it's not
- **[02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oql3QUD2JyI&t=124s)** — like juice or sodas or anything sweet or anything of any calories. Now typically,
- **[02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oql3QUD2JyI&t=130s)** — everyone fasts when they're sleeping, right? Why would you want to mess up the whole fasting
- **[02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oql3QUD2JyI&t=134s)** — by eating breakfast? Many people are not hungry in the morning. Unless they eat a little
- **[02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oql3QUD2JyI&t=140s)** — something, and then they'll be hungry an hour and a half. So eating does cause you to be hungry.
- **[02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oql3QUD2JyI&t=146s)** — But if you don't give into that and you start fasting, you start to repair your pancreas.
- **[02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oql3QUD2JyI&t=152s)** — The pancreas has taken a beating from all this frequent eating, all the carbohydrates.
- **[02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oql3QUD2JyI&t=157s)** — So the little cells that regulate insulin, called the beta cells, are really the cell that
- **[02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oql3QUD2JyI&t=163s)** — gets hammered the most when we eat a lot of carbs and we eat very frequently. And so
- **[02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oql3QUD2JyI&t=168s)** — it's pumping out all this insulin all the time. And rarely does anyone actually test the insulin.
- **[02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oql3QUD2JyI&t=174s)** — They look at the blood sugar. And basically 10 to 20, 30 years, your blood sugar could be
- **[02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oql3QUD2JyI&t=179s)** — normal. But in the background, you have this massive insulin spike. But you don't really test
- **[03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oql3QUD2JyI&t=184s)** — that. Over time, your body starts developing something called insulin resistance. Insulin
- **[03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oql3QUD2JyI&t=191s)** — resistance is a situation where the receptors are going to protect you against this excess
- **[03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oql3QUD2JyI&t=197s)** — amount of insulin and carbohydrate. It's a protective survival mechanism. So even though
- **[03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oql3QUD2JyI&t=202s)** — you're eating a lot of carbs, everything looks normal unless you check this insulin situation.
- **[03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oql3QUD2JyI&t=206s)** — And then over time, when this pancreas gets exhausted, it can no longer compensate. So your
- **[03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oql3QUD2JyI&t=213s)** — insulin production starts going down. And insulin keeps the blood sugar lower. So now we
- **[03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oql3QUD2JyI&t=219s)** — don't have that control. So now the blood sugar has no choice but to start going up.
- **[03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oql3QUD2JyI&t=223s)** — So we start getting prediabetes and then diabetes, which is a high level of sugar in the blood because
- **[03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oql3QUD2JyI&t=228s)** — we now have so much insulin resistance and your beta cells in the pancreas are so tired, they
- **[03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oql3QUD2JyI&t=233s)** — just can't work anymore. Well guess what? Fasting starts to repair and protect the beta
- **[04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oql3QUD2JyI&t=240s)** — cell. The beta cell starts to heal and insulin starts to become more sensitive. So you have
- **[04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oql3QUD2JyI&t=246s)** — less insulin resistance, which is going to help everything. So because you're not eating
- **[04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oql3QUD2JyI&t=252s)** — so darn frequently, your digestive system finally has a chance to relax in between eating. I mean,
- **[04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oql3QUD2JyI&t=260s)** — most people are eating so frequently. Just think about how much work that digestive system has
- **[04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oql3QUD2JyI&t=265s)** — to work. But when you do intermittent fasting, finally the system has a chance to not work so
- **[04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oql3QUD2JyI&t=270s)** — hard. You will also have an antidepressant effect. Your mood is going to be elevated. So
- **[04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oql3QUD2JyI&t=279s)** — 18-hour window of fasting. So the first meal might be at 12. The second meal might be at 6.
- **[04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oql3QUD2JyI&t=286s)** — There's also a large amount of people who also go to one meal a day. Now this is not
- **[04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oql3QUD2JyI&t=292s)** — necessarily just to focus on reducing calories, but it is very difficult to consume the same
- **[04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oql3QUD2JyI&t=297s)** — calories from three meals to one meal. What you're actually doing too is you're not
- **[05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oql3QUD2JyI&t=302s)** — slowing your metabolism. You are correcting a slowed metabolism, which really at the heart of
- **[05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oql3QUD2JyI&t=308s)** — is insulin resistance. Okay, so now that you're at one meal a day, what's going to happen next is
- **[05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oql3QUD2JyI&t=314s)** — your inflammation is going to go way down. All of these inflammatory conditions start to
- **[05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oql3QUD2JyI&t=319s)** — be improved. Your body actually makes antioxidants. It's called endogenous from within
- **[05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oql3QUD2JyI&t=327s)** — a production of antioxidants. So when you fast, your body starts making more antioxidants
- **[05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oql3QUD2JyI&t=334s)** — to help counter the oxidative stress. You see, if you think about oxidative stress,
- **[05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oql3QUD2JyI&t=339s)** — all the things that, you know, from radiation to pollution, junk foods, it all produces a lot
- **[05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oql3QUD2JyI&t=344s)** — of free radical damage. Well, if you have enough antioxidants, you can counter that.
- **[05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oql3QUD2JyI&t=349s)** — And the microbes in your digestion, which has a huge influence over your immune system,
- **[05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oql3QUD2JyI&t=355s)** — start to thrive. And you get more microbes. So your microbes do better when you don't feed
- **[06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oql3QUD2JyI&t=362s)** — And having this diversified microbiome, you get all sorts of improvements, definitely in the
- **[06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oql3QUD2JyI&t=367s)** — cognitive function. There's something called brain derived neurotrophic factor. That would be
- **[06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oql3QUD2JyI&t=373s)** — like miracle grow for your brain. Now, and then a lot of people add prolonged fasting,
- **[06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oql3QUD2JyI&t=378s)** — okay, here and there. And that produces even bigger benefits. In prolonged fasting, like,
- **[06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oql3QUD2JyI&t=384s)** — let's say you fast for two days, you're going to strengthen autophagy. Autophagy is the
- **[06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oql3QUD2JyI&t=390s)** — recycling of old damaged proteins, viruses, pathogens in your cell. Your body cleans those up
- **[06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oql3QUD2JyI&t=397s)** — and recycles them into healthy tissue, which is pretty wild. And even in the guts of your
- **[06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oql3QUD2JyI&t=403s)** — cells, you have these mitochondria, which is the key for energy production for so many
- **[06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oql3QUD2JyI&t=410s)** — things that are related to disease. You can actually start to repair and clean out the
- **[06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oql3QUD2JyI&t=415s)** — damaged mitochondria, which also can trigger cancer, and get rid of those and build new
- **[07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oql3QUD2JyI&t=421s)** — mitochondria. So the term for that is called mitochondrial biogenesis. And then some people
- **[07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oql3QUD2JyI&t=426s)** — fast longer for like 72 hours. And when you start doing that, you really start to strengthen
- **[07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oql3QUD2JyI&t=433s)** — this stimulation of stem cells, especially for your immune system. So a lot of people do
- **[07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oql3QUD2JyI&t=440s)** — prolonged fasting to get rid of cancer. In fact, it is one of the best things you can do.
- **[07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oql3QUD2JyI&t=444s)** — So in this video, I just wanted to touch on the real reason why you should be doing fasting,
- **[07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oql3QUD2JyI&t=448s)** — and the amazing benefits. There's a lot of details on how to do it.

- **[00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRKrUPIpfU&t=0s)** — Today I'm excited to show you something really cool. To be able to take flabby arms and tone them up.
- **[00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRKrUPIpfU&t=5s)** — And I'm going to go through about eight or nine different exercises.
- **[00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRKrUPIpfU&t=9s)** — Some people are not going to be able to do certain exercises. I'm going to start really small and then increase from there.
- **[00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRKrUPIpfU&t=14s)** — I want you to select the ones that make sense to you. When I do my workouts, I'm not very structured.
- **[00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRKrUPIpfU&t=19s)** — I get bored really easy with exercises. I think it's important to switch it up.
- **[00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRKrUPIpfU&t=22s)** — I'm going to show you a series of exercises that you can pick or choose which ones that will fit into your routine.
- **[00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRKrUPIpfU&t=27s)** — As we age, the muscles in our arms start to atrophy. The fascia that surrounds the arm.
- **[00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRKrUPIpfU&t=34s)** — Fascia is this stuff right here. Saran wrap. The tissue that we recently identified as being way more important than what we thought it was.
- **[00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRKrUPIpfU&t=42s)** — Because fascia surrounds our entire body like a wetsuit. But not just the outside. In the different layers of muscles.
- **[00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRKrUPIpfU&t=48s)** — Around the nerves, around the organs. It really gives the shape of the arm and around your whole body.
- **[00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRKrUPIpfU&t=53s)** — It holds everything together. It also shares some of the forces that you put on your body when you exercise.
- **[00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRKrUPIpfU&t=59s)** — When you stimulate the fascia, you actually cause collagen synthesis or a rebuilding effect.
- **[01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRKrUPIpfU&t=66s)** — What we want as we age is to thicken that collagen layer and make it so it can tighten everything up really nicely.
- **[01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRKrUPIpfU&t=72s)** — In the last video I did on toning the arm, we talked mainly about a stretching technique.
- **[01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRKrUPIpfU&t=77s)** — Today we're going to focus more on a strengthening technique.
- **[01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRKrUPIpfU&t=80s)** — In this video we're not just going to focus on the primary muscles like the biceps and the triceps.
- **[01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRKrUPIpfU&t=87s)** — The biceps cause your arm to go this way. The triceps extends your arm that way.
- **[01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRKrUPIpfU&t=92s)** — We're not just going to focus on those muscles even though those are the primary movers of the arm.
- **[01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRKrUPIpfU&t=97s)** — There are a lot of other associated supportive muscles that have to be toned as well.
- **[01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRKrUPIpfU&t=102s)** — We will handle the primary muscles, all the secondary and supporting muscles, and the fascia all with one type of exercise.
- **[01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRKrUPIpfU&t=111s)** — This exercise is very safe on the joints. It's going to produce a lot of strength, reshape your arm, it's going to help put tone in the arm.
- **[01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRKrUPIpfU&t=118s)** — It's not going to involve a lot of expensive equipment or even going to the gym.
- **[02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRKrUPIpfU&t=121s)** — And from what I evaluated, I think this is the best exercise for the arms that you can do hands down.
- **[02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRKrUPIpfU&t=127s)** — Most of the exercises we're going to talk about are isometric exercises.
- **[02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRKrUPIpfU&t=131s)** — Now what's an isometric exercise? It's an exercise that involves increasing tension in the muscle without lengthening or shortening a muscle.
- **[02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRKrUPIpfU&t=140s)** — And if we want to stimulate the primary muscles, the secondary muscles, the associated supporting muscles, and the fascia,
- **[02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRKrUPIpfU&t=146s)** — we want to add as much tension as we can to make changes in the arm.
- **[02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRKrUPIpfU&t=151s)** — These exercises might really appear to be very simple, but wow, they really make you sore.
- **[02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRKrUPIpfU&t=156s)** — We have the isometric exercise and then we have another exercise.
- **[02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRKrUPIpfU&t=160s)** — When you contract your muscle, this is called a concentric movement.
- **[02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRKrUPIpfU&t=164s)** — When you extend the muscle and you lengthen the muscle, that's called eccentric movement.
- **[02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRKrUPIpfU&t=170s)** — And so some of these exercises that we're going to show you are going to involve this eccentric motion, this lengthening the muscle very slowly under tension.
- **[02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRKrUPIpfU&t=179s)** — Why do we want to do that? Because it produces very fast results. It's very safe in the joint.
- **[03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRKrUPIpfU&t=183s)** — It's fairly easy to do versus going to the gym and doing this two-dimensional exercise like this.
- **[03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRKrUPIpfU&t=189s)** — You're only going to work those primary movers. You're not going to work everything else.
- **[03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRKrUPIpfU&t=193s)** — As far as the equipment for the exercises, it would be great if you had a band like this.
- **[03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRKrUPIpfU&t=198s)** — There's also going to be another piece of equipment that you may want to get.
- **[03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRKrUPIpfU&t=201s)** — It's not that expensive, but it's called an isometric band.
- **[03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRKrUPIpfU&t=204s)** — I'm also going to demonstrate a few things on the TRX, which I will show you really quick.
- **[03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRKrUPIpfU&t=209s)** — Those are not that expensive either. Or if you have some gymnastic rings, I have those as well.
- **[03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRKrUPIpfU&t=214s)** — I personally like those, but you don't really need to do these exercises on those. You can just use the TRX.
- **[03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRKrUPIpfU&t=218s)** — And even if you don't have any of those, I'm going to still show you what to do without using anything. Just using your body weight.
- **[03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRKrUPIpfU&t=223s)** — I'm excited about a new product we just released called Tudka.
- **[03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRKrUPIpfU&t=227s)** — Tudka is a special type of bile salt that helps to clean the liver, the gallbladder and the tubes connecting between the two.
- **[03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRKrUPIpfU&t=234s)** — One indication that you might need some Tudka is a full sensation underneath the right rib cage that sometimes refers up to the right shoulder or upper trap area.
- **[04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRKrUPIpfU&t=243s)** — Tudka basically thins the bile sludge and greatly assists in the digestion of fats.
- **[04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRKrUPIpfU&t=249s)** — Take two on an empty stomach either once or twice a day, depending on how severe you have the problem.
- **[04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRKrUPIpfU&t=254s)** — In this first exercise, it's real simple. You put this band around your neck.
- **[04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRKrUPIpfU&t=257s)** — As you can see in this video, the person is extending their arm, hold it in this position where you're bent over for 20 seconds and do three sets of that.
- **[04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRKrUPIpfU&t=268s)** — This is primarily going to work the back of the arm.
- **[04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRKrUPIpfU&t=270s)** — This next one I really like as well because you can actually put this band right on top of your door.
- **[04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRKrUPIpfU&t=276s)** — And then you can actually bring it down halfway and hold that position.
- **[04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRKrUPIpfU&t=281s)** — This is an isometric exercise to really also build the back of the arm.
- **[04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRKrUPIpfU&t=285s)** — And again, for all of these exercises, just to make it really easy, I would hold them for a count of 20.
- **[04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRKrUPIpfU&t=291s)** — If you can do that, if not, do it less, like do 10 seconds and then with a 10 second rest and just do it three different times.
- **[04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRKrUPIpfU&t=298s)** — In this next video, I really like this guy because Matt Schifferle does a lot of great isometrics.
- **[05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRKrUPIpfU&t=303s)** — He has several books that I have. I really like the way that he explains things.
- **[05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRKrUPIpfU&t=307s)** — Overcoming isometrics are where we're trying to push or pull against an immovable object.
- **[05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRKrUPIpfU&t=311s)** — That way the amount of resistance against your body is always equal to the amount of force you're putting into it.
- **[05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRKrUPIpfU&t=317s)** — The anterior chain is all the muscles in the front part of the body.
- **[05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRKrUPIpfU&t=319s)** — The posterior chain is all the muscles on the back part of your body.
- **[05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRKrUPIpfU&t=322s)** — And the lateral chain is all the muscles on the side of the body.
- **[05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRKrUPIpfU&t=326s)** — There's three really cool isometric exercises that you can do to just maximize your tension in your muscles to really tone those arms.
- **[05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRKrUPIpfU&t=337s)** — Let's listen to what he has to say.
- **[05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRKrUPIpfU&t=338s)** — This is why I'm particularly excited about the new isometrics that I've been doing.
- **[05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRKrUPIpfU&t=342s)** — Because they include both resistance against gravity plus an overcoming aspect where you can put as much force as possible into your muscles.
- **[05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRKrUPIpfU&t=351s)** — And it's always going to match you.
- **[05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRKrUPIpfU&t=352s)** — So let me show you some of the exercises you can try with this.
- **[05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRKrUPIpfU&t=356s)** — The best ways to do this are for the three support chains.
- **[06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRKrUPIpfU&t=360s)** — Your flexion or anterior chain, posterior extension chain, and your lateral chains.
- **[06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRKrUPIpfU&t=365s)** — So we start off with our squeezing plank where we get into hollow body and then we're into a plank.
- **[06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRKrUPIpfU&t=373s)** — So that's our yielding isometric aspect.
- **[06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRKrUPIpfU&t=376s)** — But then if we squeeze the floor between our hands and our feet.
- **[06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRKrUPIpfU&t=383s)** — Now you can kind of hear in my voice I'm shaking a little bit.
- **[06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRKrUPIpfU&t=386s)** — I can feel my core going nuts.
- **[06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRKrUPIpfU&t=389s)** — And now the amount of work in my muscles is dramatically increased.
- **[06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRKrUPIpfU&t=394s)** — You can also do the same thing for your backside of your body with a squeezing table bridge.
- **[06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRKrUPIpfU&t=399s)** — So we've got our shoulders packed down and back.
- **[06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRKrUPIpfU&t=402s)** — Right. And then we lift up.
- **[06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRKrUPIpfU&t=405s)** — And then again we squeeze the floor together between our feet and our hands.
- **[06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRKrUPIpfU&t=411s)** — My hamstrings and my glutes are going absolutely crazy to make that happen.
- **[06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRKrUPIpfU&t=418s)** — The first couple times I did that my hamstrings cramped up really quickly.
- **[07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRKrUPIpfU&t=422s)** — So feel free to apply a little bit less force the first time you try that.
- **[07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRKrUPIpfU&t=427s)** — Here's another exercise. I really like this one as well.
- **[07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRKrUPIpfU&t=429s)** — We're going to take a band underneath your feet and you're going to pull up your arm halfway.
- **[07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRKrUPIpfU&t=435s)** — This is going to work the bicep. This is called isometric bicep curl.
- **[07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRKrUPIpfU&t=439s)** — For this next one it's a little bit different.
- **[07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRKrUPIpfU&t=441s)** — And this is called an eccentric movement where we're going to take some weight.
- **[07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRKrUPIpfU&t=446s)** — You can use a dumbbell or on a bar.
- **[07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRKrUPIpfU&t=448s)** — And then you're going to bring it up and then slowly, slowly bring it back downward,
- **[07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRKrUPIpfU&t=454s)** — lengthening the bicep.
- **[07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRKrUPIpfU&t=455s)** — This is going to work your front part of your bicep.
- **[07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRKrUPIpfU&t=458s)** — And this might look pretty easy, but it's not.
- **[07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRKrUPIpfU&t=460s)** — And you're going to feel really sore after you do it.
- **[07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRKrUPIpfU&t=462s)** — I would recommend do this maybe starting out only five times.
- **[07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRKrUPIpfU&t=467s)** — But the key is to let it down really slow and gradually.
- **[07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRKrUPIpfU&t=470s)** — For this next one you're going to need something called an isometric band.
- **[07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRKrUPIpfU&t=474s)** — You can get these on Amazon. They're not that expensive.
- **[07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRKrUPIpfU&t=477s)** — And you're going to be doing an isometric pushing your arms over your head.
- **[08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRKrUPIpfU&t=482s)** — And so this is another arm exercise that kind of graduates into working your shoulders as well.
- **[08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRKrUPIpfU&t=487s)** — Let's dive into this video. I think Matt will explain it very thoroughly.
- **[08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRKrUPIpfU&t=490s)** — Employ what I like to call the PTR principle, position, tension, resistance.
- **[08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRKrUPIpfU&t=494s)** — Don't just jump in and be like, okay, here we go.
- **[08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRKrUPIpfU&t=497s)** — Instead, take your time setting up for the position to make sure everything's where you
- **[08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRKrUPIpfU&t=503s)** — want it to be. You've got good alignment because a lot of isometrics are full body exercises.
- **[08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRKrUPIpfU&t=508s)** — So elbows in good position, hands in good position.
- **[08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRKrUPIpfU&t=511s)** — Then proactively engage the muscles you want to be working.
- **[08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRKrUPIpfU&t=516s)** — And then finally, apply the resistance against the handles or whatever equipment that you're using.
- **[08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRKrUPIpfU&t=522s)** — This ensures that you have proper position, but also good tension control in the muscles you want to be using.
- **[08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRKrUPIpfU&t=529s)** — And then you apply the resistance.
- **[08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRKrUPIpfU&t=531s)** — If you apply the resistance too quickly and then think, oh yeah, that's right, my hands need to be
- **[08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRKrUPIpfU&t=536s)** — in a little bit or wait a minute, my tension in my abs isn't quite engaged enough.
- **[09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRKrUPIpfU&t=541s)** — It's a little bit harder to get that stuff really dialed in once you're already working.
- **[09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRKrUPIpfU&t=547s)** — So even just a moment of position, tension, and then you apply the resistance can go a long
- **[09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRKrUPIpfU&t=554s)** — way at making the exercises safer, more comfortable, and a lot more effective.
- **[09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRKrUPIpfU&t=558s)** — Stability is also a very important factor because you're only as strong as you are stable.
- **[09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRKrUPIpfU&t=563s)** — And if you're really fighting to stabilize your body during an exercise, that's less energy and
- **[09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRKrUPIpfU&t=569s)** — effort you can put into actually working the muscles. So in particular, if you're using
- **[09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRKrUPIpfU&t=573s)** — something like the ISO trainer or something, and you notice that when you apply force against
- **[09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRKrUPIpfU&t=579s)** — your feet, there's coming in or you're a little bit on a narrow, unstable surface.
- **[09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRKrUPIpfU&t=586s)** — And that's why I highly recommend running a strap or the equipment you're using underneath some sort
- **[09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRKrUPIpfU&t=592s)** — of a platform like an aerobic step or a plyo box or something. Now I'm going to have a lot
- **[09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRKrUPIpfU&t=598s)** — more stability with the straps and my feet are on a very stable platform. They're not getting
- **[10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRKrUPIpfU&t=603s)** — pulled inwards or outwards. And I can really put a lot more force directly into the muscles
- **[10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRKrUPIpfU&t=610s)** — without worrying about compromises to my stability. And lastly, don't forget that the
- **[10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRKrUPIpfU&t=615s)** — point of any strength training endeavor is to adequately work the muscles, not to
- **[10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRKrUPIpfU&t=621s)** — necessarily lift the weight or move the cable around. And the same is true for isometrics.
- **[10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRKrUPIpfU&t=626s)** — Your goal is not to put as much force as possible into your handles. The goal is to
- **[10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRKrUPIpfU&t=631s)** — contract the muscles as hard as possible. And you may find that this is going to be easier
- **[10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRKrUPIpfU&t=636s)** — if you don't try to always have your maximum absolute amount of force that you're applying
- **[10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRKrUPIpfU&t=642s)** — into your equipment. So as you're using that rise time, give yourself permission to only apply
- **[10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRKrUPIpfU&t=649s)** — 75-80% of the effort you have. You don't need to max out all the time. And I'm contracting
- **[10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRKrUPIpfU&t=656s)** — or focusing on contracting my biceps and my back very, very hard as opposed to trying to
- **[11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRKrUPIpfU&t=664s)** — just pull on the straps. That way you're putting your effort into creating a stronger
- **[11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRKrUPIpfU&t=670s)** — stimulus in the muscle itself versus just trying to see how hard you can pull against the handle,
- **[11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRKrUPIpfU&t=675s)** — which might lead to all sorts of compensation in your technique. Other muscle groups are really
- **[11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRKrUPIpfU&t=681s)** — trying to overkill things. You do definitely want to have everything working. This is a
- **[11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRKrUPIpfU&t=686s)** — full body exercise. There's just emphasis in the biceps. And if you find that you can do
- **[11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRKrUPIpfU&t=691s)** — that with a little less than maximum force, you're probably going to be better off for it.
- **[11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRKrUPIpfU&t=696s)** — If you want to learn more, check out my book, Overcoming Isometrics. The links to that in the
- **[11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRKrUPIpfU&t=700s)** — PDF store and Amazon is down below. And the Overcoming Isometrics playlist that I have here
- **[11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRKrUPIpfU&t=705s)** — are all sorts of videos on workouts, exercises, equipment recommendations, and many things to
- **[11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRKrUPIpfU&t=711s)** — explore. Thank you very much for watching. Best of luck in your workouts. Be fit and live free.
- **[11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRKrUPIpfU&t=716s)** — In this video, you might want to use what's called a TRX. They're a little bit less
- **[12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRKrUPIpfU&t=723s)** — This is a killer exercise. As you're seeing me here in a push-up position, you're not just
- **[12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRKrUPIpfU&t=728s)** — fighting gravity. You're fighting your arms from going out, going forward, going back. This is
- **[12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRKrUPIpfU&t=734s)** — the ultimate exercise to build up all those additional support muscles that are not the
- **[12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRKrUPIpfU&t=739s)** — primary movers, but they're secondary, as well as a fascia. You will find that if you can do
- **[12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRKrUPIpfU&t=745s)** — this, your arms are going to get really, really sore and you're going to create some
- **[12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRKrUPIpfU&t=749s)** — If you're not able to do it in this position right off the bat, then you can do it a little
- **[12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRKrUPIpfU&t=754s)** — more angled. In this shot, you can just see that I angled myself. I raised up the rings. So this
- **[12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRKrUPIpfU&t=760s)** — can be a little bit easier as you work into it. I like this because you're working more of the
- **[12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRKrUPIpfU&t=764s)** — arm than if you were just to do in a plank push-up position. And then in this last video,
- **[12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRKrUPIpfU&t=769s)** — this is a little bit more difficult, but if you can work yourself up to it, maybe you do
- **[12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRKrUPIpfU&t=773s)** — this where your feet are touching the ground. If you can do this exercise, you're going to
- **[12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRKrUPIpfU&t=777s)** — some serious tension on the entire arm and your shoulder and your back. It might not look very
- **[13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRKrUPIpfU&t=784s)** — hard, but it is difficult and it creates some serious soreness. What we're trying to do is
- **[13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRKrUPIpfU&t=788s)** — we're trying to maximize the tension in the arms using this isometric type exercise. Now
- **[13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRKrUPIpfU&t=796s)** — that we went through this, go ahead and pick out some exercises. You might have to order
- **[13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRKrUPIpfU&t=799s)** — some of the bands to do these exercises, but I think you're going to really see the
- **[13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRKrUPIpfU&t=803s)** — results if you can apply some of these exercises to your workouts. And if you haven't seen my

- **[00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJgpOsjndkA&t=0s)** — I'd like to talk about why women can't seem to lose belly fat after menopause.
- **[00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJgpOsjndkA&t=7s)** — I'm not just going to talk about that. I'm also going to talk about what to do about it as well.
- **[00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJgpOsjndkA&t=11s)** — So what is going on with this menopause thing? Well, all these changes. All stem because of this
- **[00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJgpOsjndkA&t=17s)** — one change that happens in the body. The ovaries go in retirement. They're no longer to be
- **[00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJgpOsjndkA&t=22s)** — producing or releasing eggs. Now the ovary doesn't just make eggs. It also makes hormones.
- **[00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJgpOsjndkA&t=30s)** — So what's going to happen as we go through menopause is we're not going to have the eggs.
- **[00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJgpOsjndkA&t=34s)** — We're not going to have the quantity of hormones. But normally what's supposed to happen is the
- **[00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJgpOsjndkA&t=39s)** — adrenal glands, which are the backup, are supposed to kick in. The adrenal glands make
- **[00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJgpOsjndkA&t=45s)** — all of the hormones that the ovaries make. And if the adrenal glands are strong and stable
- **[00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJgpOsjndkA&t=52s)** — going into menopause, usually there's very little symptoms, if any at all. So it's not
- **[00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJgpOsjndkA&t=59s)** — really normal to have hot flashes. It's not normal to have any symptoms going through
- **[01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJgpOsjndkA&t=64s)** — menopause unless there's a problem with the adrenal glands. But there's a bit more to this.
- **[01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJgpOsjndkA&t=69s)** — Okay, so yes, it's true that estrogen drops, but you're also going to get a more
- **[01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJgpOsjndkA&t=74s)** — significant drop in progesterone. So the ratios of estrogen progesterone, it actually
- **[01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJgpOsjndkA&t=79s)** — can make it appear that you have estrogen dominance, which is not really true. It's just
- **[01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJgpOsjndkA&t=84s)** — the ratios of estrogen to progesterone. And some women start going on hormone replacement
- **[01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJgpOsjndkA&t=90s)** — therapy. The problem with that is it comes with a lot of side effects and complications.
- **[01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJgpOsjndkA&t=96s)** — But I'm not going to get into that right now. I want to focus on another thing that
- **[01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJgpOsjndkA&t=101s)** — that gives you a solution to handling this entire problem. Because naturally,
- **[01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJgpOsjndkA&t=106s)** — the adrenals are supposed to take over and compensate for the missing hormones.
- **[01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJgpOsjndkA&t=111s)** — And no, this is not a mistake in nature. It all is supposed to work very perfectly.
- **[01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJgpOsjndkA&t=115s)** — So in adrenals, we have several things going on. We do have an increase in cortisol. That's
- **[02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJgpOsjndkA&t=121s)** — the stress hormone. This could explain why through menopause, a woman might feel anxiety,
- **[02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJgpOsjndkA&t=130s)** — excessive nervousness, difficulty sleeping, maybe agitated, and also an overall low tolerance
- **[02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJgpOsjndkA&t=137s)** — to stress. That has a lot to do with this part of the nervous system called the autonomic
- **[02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJgpOsjndkA&t=144s)** — nervous system. And that's really what I want to focus on in this video. So the autonomic
- **[02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJgpOsjndkA&t=149s)** — nervous system is basically adapting your body to the environment. Your body is constantly
- **[02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJgpOsjndkA&t=155s)** — adapting to temperature, different environments. And one part of the nervous system called the
- **[02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJgpOsjndkA&t=161s)** — sympathetic, which is the flutter fight, is increasing certain things to adapt to the stress.
- **[02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJgpOsjndkA&t=165s)** — So let's say, for example, you exercise, right? You need higher pulse rate, you need
- **[02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJgpOsjndkA&t=170s)** — higher blood pressure to compensate for the blood flow. And then right when you stop that
- **[02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJgpOsjndkA&t=175s)** — exercise, you have another system that kicks in called the parasympathetic. And that system is
- **[03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJgpOsjndkA&t=181s)** — about calming things down and bringing things back to normal. So it's really important to have
- **[03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJgpOsjndkA&t=187s)** — this balance between the sympathetic and the parasympathetic nervous system. What's interesting
- **[03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJgpOsjndkA&t=192s)** — about menopause is after menopause, a woman is usually left with a higher sympathetic nervous
- **[03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJgpOsjndkA&t=198s)** — system and a much lower parasympathetic nervous system. And if they don't know this going into
- **[03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJgpOsjndkA&t=204s)** — menopause, they might focus more on the estrogen problem, or maybe they might just
- **[03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJgpOsjndkA&t=208s)** — exercise to really get rid of that belly fat that they're concerned about, right? And then
- **[03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJgpOsjndkA&t=213s)** — they might find, wow, it's not working. It's even getting worse in some cases. And so they
- **[03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJgpOsjndkA&t=218s)** — go to one doctor after the next trying to figure this problem out. So the very important
- **[03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJgpOsjndkA&t=222s)** — thing I want to teach you right now is about focusing more on that parasympathetic nervous
- **[03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJgpOsjndkA&t=228s)** — system. So that's your recovery system. That is the system that influences your sleep
- **[03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJgpOsjndkA&t=234s)** — and your ability to recover. And all the fat burning occurs in this recovery phase. If you're
- **[04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJgpOsjndkA&t=240s)** — too high in the sympathetic and you don't have enough recovery, then you're not going to lose
- **[04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJgpOsjndkA&t=244s)** — this midsection no matter what you do. And so there's a lot of emphasis on exercise.
- **[04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJgpOsjndkA&t=250s)** — Okay, exercise stimulates the sympathetic nervous system, but it does not stimulate
- **[04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJgpOsjndkA&t=256s)** — that parasympathetic nervous system. And so what I'm going to recommend is you shift gears
- **[04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJgpOsjndkA&t=260s)** — and you start to exercise your parasympathetic. It would be like taking water and putting out a
- **[04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJgpOsjndkA&t=267s)** — fire. It calms the sympathetic and that's going to help you reduce cortisol. It's going to
- **[04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJgpOsjndkA&t=271s)** — help you sleep. It's going to help you have a midsection that's flat. And so how do we train
- **[04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJgpOsjndkA&t=277s)** — this parasympathetic nervous system? Well, that system is not passive. It's active. In other
- **[04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJgpOsjndkA&t=284s)** — words, it is actively working to calm you down. It's actively working to reset and bring you back
- **[04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJgpOsjndkA&t=291s)** — to homeostasis, which is kind of like a normal balance internally. So I guess a good way to
- **[04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJgpOsjndkA&t=297s)** — explain this is that let's say right now you run outside and you run up a hill really fast.
- **[05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJgpOsjndkA&t=302s)** — Okay. And as you run up the hill, the sympathetic nervous system kicks in there
- **[05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJgpOsjndkA&t=306s)** — and it's pushing up your pulse rate really, really high. You get your blood pressure really
- **[05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJgpOsjndkA&t=310s)** — high and you get at the top of the hill and you're huffing and puffing and you're at the
- **[05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJgpOsjndkA&t=315s)** — peak of your sympathetic nervous system. As soon as you stop, okay, and you do nothing,
- **[05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJgpOsjndkA&t=321s)** — that parasympathetic kicks in actively. It's kind of like a wave that is pushing things
- **[05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJgpOsjndkA&t=327s)** — down. It's pushing your pulse rate down. It's an active force that is trying to recover you.
- **[05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJgpOsjndkA&t=333s)** — Okay. And all you have to do is do nothing and let it do its job. And so if you were just to wait
- **[05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJgpOsjndkA&t=341s)** — until your pulse rate is all the way back to normal, you would strengthen your parasympathetic.
- **[05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJgpOsjndkA&t=347s)** — But who does that? What do people do when they work out? They go work out, they get
- **[05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJgpOsjndkA&t=352s)** — their pulse rate really high. They let it come down a little bit. They rest maybe 30 seconds,
- **[05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJgpOsjndkA&t=358s)** — if that, and they do it right back. They start exercising. And right there, you are failing to
- **[06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJgpOsjndkA&t=364s)** — exercise that recovery system. You are developing and training the sympathetic to be really,
- **[06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJgpOsjndkA&t=369s)** — really strong, but without enough recovery. And so over time, you lose the strength and
- **[06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJgpOsjndkA&t=374s)** — capacity to recover. And so your body is ending up just producing cortisol. That's creating
- **[06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJgpOsjndkA&t=379s)** — more belly fat. It has a hard time sleeping. So I wanted to make a big deal about this
- **[06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJgpOsjndkA&t=384s)** — video to emphasize this one simple point that if you really understand it, you can apply it to
- **[06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJgpOsjndkA&t=391s)** — a lot of different things. You need to rest a lot longer between your reps and sets of exercise
- **[06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJgpOsjndkA&t=398s)** — as well as days of exercise. So if you were to do a certain set of, let's say, 10 reps or
- **[06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJgpOsjndkA&t=404s)** — a certain time period of exercise, what you'd want to do is completely stop and wait for
- **[06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJgpOsjndkA&t=410s)** — your pulse rate to come all the way down. Okay. Before you start another one of those cycles.
- **[06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJgpOsjndkA&t=416s)** — The same thing goes with your entire workout. Through a given week, you have to make sure
- **[07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJgpOsjndkA&t=420s)** — you don't over train. You want to make sure when you exercise, you give your body a chance to
- **[07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJgpOsjndkA&t=424s)** — completely recover and reset. And what you're doing when you're recovering is you are
- **[07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJgpOsjndkA&t=429s)** — strengthening your parasympathetic nervous system. I tell you, this might sound like a
- **[07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJgpOsjndkA&t=433s)** — very insignificant subtle thing, but in practice, it was very, very successful. I've had people
- **[07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJgpOsjndkA&t=438s)** — that I've taken them off of working out three times a week and put them on a workout that's
- **[07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJgpOsjndkA&t=443s)** — just once a week. And then they finally start losing weight. Now on the flip side,
- **[07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJgpOsjndkA&t=448s)** — it doesn't mean you should only focus on the recovery and do nothing and sleeping all day,
- **[07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJgpOsjndkA&t=452s)** — because it takes this exercise intensity and this stress to make it all work out. Now,
- **[07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJgpOsjndkA&t=460s)** — the worst type of exercise you could do for your belly is any type of sustained exercise.
- **[07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJgpOsjndkA&t=467s)** — Now, I'm not talking about like walking or hiking. I'm talking about jogging or running
- **[07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJgpOsjndkA&t=472s)** — or doing marathons or long distance. Anything sustained of a moderate pulse rate is really bad
- **[08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJgpOsjndkA&t=480s)** — for cortisol. And it's bad for the parasympathetic because of this one
- **[08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJgpOsjndkA&t=484s)** — principle of waves. Everything in nature is on a wave. You have these circadian rhythms
- **[08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJgpOsjndkA&t=489s)** — of hormones, sleep cycles, your heart is on a wave. It comes up and down, it contracts and
- **[08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJgpOsjndkA&t=495s)** — so this is why like high intensity interval training is very, very good for so many
- **[08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJgpOsjndkA&t=501s)** — things because you're doing this short high intense exercise with lots of rest. So here are some
- **[08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJgpOsjndkA&t=507s)** — things to focus on. Start doing short types of exercise with lots of rest. Don't over train.
- **[08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJgpOsjndkA&t=514s)** — Don't train over soreness. Focus on getting more sleep. And by doing this, it's automatically
- **[08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJgpOsjndkA&t=520s)** — going to improve your sleeping because you're going to be improving the parasympathetic.
- **[08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJgpOsjndkA&t=523s)** — Certain types of body work, whether it's chiropractic, massage, physical therapy,
- **[08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJgpOsjndkA&t=527s)** — is all going to help. Omega-3 fatty acids can help as well. Also the precursor to all of
- **[08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJgpOsjndkA&t=533s)** — these hormones is called DHEA. Really good supplement to take especially through menopause.
- **[08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJgpOsjndkA&t=539s)** — But if you're female, I would highly recommend you don't take a lot of it.
- **[09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJgpOsjndkA&t=542s)** — Just take what's recommended on the bottle because if you take too much, you can start to
- **[09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJgpOsjndkA&t=547s)** — increase more testosterone, which you might not want that. It's very important to go on
- **[09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJgpOsjndkA&t=553s)** — low carb intermittent fasting because when you do that, you automatically reduce the
- **[09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJgpOsjndkA&t=559s)** — sympathetic nervous system and you increase the parasympathetic. Some really key nutrients
- **[09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJgpOsjndkA&t=563s)** — to focus on. Magnesium, choline, vitamin B1. Vitamin D is also important too.
- **[09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJgpOsjndkA&t=570s)** — Certain herbs can be helpful that are adaptogens. Lemon balm, a passion flower,
- **[09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJgpOsjndkA&t=575s)** — and ashwagandha are really good. So in summary, the parasympathetic nervous system restores
- **[09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJgpOsjndkA&t=582s)** — the sympathetic nervous system, which is that fight or flight mechanism. Now because of the
- **[09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJgpOsjndkA&t=586s)** — censoring and the suppressing of the algorithms on YouTube, it's becoming more

- **[00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kE53pHQCPiA&t=0s)** — So today I went to the drug store to look for an antacid. I wanted to see if they had a special
- **[00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kE53pHQCPiA&t=6s)** — remedy in that section. And the remedy is zinc carnosine and I could not find it anywhere. In
- **[00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kE53pHQCPiA&t=13s)** — fact, I couldn't even find it under the vitamin section, which is shocking because zinc carnosine
- **[00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kE53pHQCPiA&t=19s)** — is the cure for ulcers. That's probably because it's pretty cheap. I mean, I think it's probably
- **[00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kE53pHQCPiA&t=25s)** — less than $10 a bottle. So today I'm going to talk about the mechanism of why zinc carnosine fixes an
- **[00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kE53pHQCPiA&t=33s)** — ulcer. And I have a lot of experience with this because in college I had severe heartburn and
- **[00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kE53pHQCPiA&t=41s)** — ulcers and I didn't know what to do. And I was suffering. So what I did is I just took
- **[00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kE53pHQCPiA&t=46s)** — massive amounts of Tums, which is chalk. Three hours later, I started to hurt again.
- **[00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kE53pHQCPiA&t=51s)** — And this cycle happened over and over and over. Taking tons of antibiotics or antacids doesn't
- **[00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kE53pHQCPiA&t=58s)** — really heal the problem. So the main treatment for an ulcer is an antibiotic. Why? Because
- **[01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kE53pHQCPiA&t=64s)** — fairly recently they discovered that the cause of ulcers is a bacteria called H. pylori. But
- **[01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kE53pHQCPiA&t=73s)** — they also use an H2 inhibitor. H standing for histamine, which I'm going to explain a little
- **[01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kE53pHQCPiA&t=79s)** — bit. But I think most of the medical profession initially thought that an ulcer was really just
- **[01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kE53pHQCPiA&t=86s)** — too much acid. Right? Well, now we know it's a breakdown of the mucus layer around part of
- **[01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kE53pHQCPiA&t=95s)** — your stomach or the small intestine. And now you have this open wound and it can be infected.
- **[01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kE53pHQCPiA&t=101s)** — Let's break down the zinc carnosine. So when you take the zinc carnosine, it's a pretty
- **[01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kE53pHQCPiA&t=106s)** — stable compound that doesn't really break down too easily. So it kind of stays in the stomach and
- **[01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kE53pHQCPiA&t=112s)** — it kind of coats the area, but it eventually breaks down into zinc and carnosine.
- **[01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kE53pHQCPiA&t=117s)** — Carnosine then breaks down into L-histidine. It's the amino acid that turns into histamine.
- **[02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kE53pHQCPiA&t=124s)** — Now this is very confusing for a lot of people because when you think of histamines,
- **[02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kE53pHQCPiA&t=128s)** — you think of anahistamine, a medication that you'd use for allergies or a mucus.
- **[02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kE53pHQCPiA&t=133s)** — Histamine actually is released in the cells of the stomach that make hydrochloric acid.
- **[02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kE53pHQCPiA&t=140s)** — And histamine helps regulate that hydrochloric acid. It actually helps increase that hydrochloric
- **[02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kE53pHQCPiA&t=148s)** — acid. So when you take an H2 blocker, you're basically blocking the production of histamine
- **[02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kE53pHQCPiA&t=154s)** — and you're lowering the amount of acid production in the stomach. Now let me just
- **[02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kE53pHQCPiA&t=163s)** — say 80% of the population and it's pretty harmless. It doesn't really do anything until
- **[02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kE53pHQCPiA&t=169s)** — the environment in your stomach changes. Then it starts to penetrate and create a hole in your
- **[02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kE53pHQCPiA&t=176s)** — stomach. What it does is it releases this enzyme to help increase more production of
- **[03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kE53pHQCPiA&t=183s)** — ammonia. And so what this microbe is doing, it's changing the pH of your stomach,
- **[03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kE53pHQCPiA&t=190s)** — making it less acid and so it can survive. This is a survival mechanism. So make mental note of
- **[03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kE53pHQCPiA&t=197s)** — that because when you lose the stomach acid, you're more susceptible to having H pylori
- **[03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kE53pHQCPiA&t=202s)** — infections. Now I wonder if that's one reason why H pylori comes out of remission and creates
- **[03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kE53pHQCPiA&t=208s)** — damage in the first place. But the significance of this is that zinc blocks the enzyme that H
- **[03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kE53pHQCPiA&t=215s)** — is putting out there. It stops the production of ammonia so your stomach could be more acid.
- **[03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kE53pHQCPiA&t=222s)** — So the combination of zinc stopping this ammonia production and this increase of histamine
- **[03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kE53pHQCPiA&t=228s)** — increasing more acid is automatically going to cause that microbe to go back in remission
- **[03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kE53pHQCPiA&t=234s)** — and stop creating a hole in your stomach. Zinc is also antibacterial and zinc also increases
- **[04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kE53pHQCPiA&t=241s)** — the production of that mucus in your stomach, that protective layer. Now I did mention that
- **[04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kE53pHQCPiA&t=248s)** — carnasine breaks down into two additional things. One being histidine, which is the precursor
- **[04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kE53pHQCPiA&t=253s)** — for histamine, but another one is called beta-alanine. What does beta-alanine do? Well,
- **[04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kE53pHQCPiA&t=261s)** — it increases something called SOD, which is an antioxidant. So it's going to help reduce
- **[04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kE53pHQCPiA&t=267s)** — inflammation and it also supports the intestinal barrier. So you can imagine this L-carnasine is
- **[04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kE53pHQCPiA&t=274s)** — like the perfect remedy to do a lot of things to help heal an ulcer and decrease gastritis
- **[04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kE53pHQCPiA&t=279s)** — as well. Now there's a couple other interesting things about L-carnasine from a genetic
- **[04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kE53pHQCPiA&t=284s)** — standpoint. There is a certain type of genetic defect via polymorphism, which can put the
- **[04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kE53pHQCPiA&t=291s)** — at risk for getting an ulcer. So if someone has an ulcer, autism, or Tourette's or any ticks,
- **[05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kE53pHQCPiA&t=301s)** — I would also recommend zinc-carnasine. Now how much zinc-carnasine should you take? Well,
- **[05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kE53pHQCPiA&t=308s)** — I would recommend taking about 150 milligrams per day, broken up into two times a day. So you
- **[05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kE53pHQCPiA&t=314s)** — take 75 milligrams in the morning, 75 milligrams in the evening, and that should be enough. You
- **[05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kE53pHQCPiA&t=321s)** — want to take that for about one to three months. However, it doesn't work as fast as the medication.
- **[05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kE53pHQCPiA&t=327s)** — So what you might want to do is to use baking soda to kind of decrease the pain. And there's
- **[05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kE53pHQCPiA&t=334s)** — some other things you can do as well. You can take liquid chlorophyll on an empty stomach.
- **[05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kE53pHQCPiA&t=340s)** — Chlorophyll is a great healer and it can definitely help not just with an ulcer,
- **[05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kE53pHQCPiA&t=345s)** — but also if there's irritation in your esophagus, it'll just kind of go down
- **[05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kE53pHQCPiA&t=349s)** — and heal any type of lesions that you might have. Once you correct this ulcer,
- **[05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kE53pHQCPiA&t=355s)** — now the question is how do we prevent this problem from ever coming back?
- **[05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kE53pHQCPiA&t=359s)** — Well, for that you need a little knowledge on the stomach and stomach acid. And I have
- **[06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kE53pHQCPiA&t=364s)** — this video for that information.

- **[00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=0s)** — One French fry equals the toxicity of one cigarette.
- **[00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=3s)** — Doctors do learn what dietitians learn, but you know, that's very limited.
- **[00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=7s)** — What we do learn is most of it is not true.
- **[00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=10s)** — Never before in history, to my knowledge, had an entire organization
- **[00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=14s)** — done the deal with the devil, which they did.
- **[00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=17s)** — Kids born in the year 2000 were going to live to be 120.
- **[00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=21s)** — And I was like, that's not what I'm seeing.
- **[00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=25s)** — I'm seeing a health catastrophe unfold.
- **[00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=28s)** — So today I invited Dr. Kate Shanahan to talk about an important topic, seed oils.
- **[00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=36s)** — So welcome, Dr. Kate. I really appreciate you being on here.
- **[00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=40s)** — Thank you so much, Eric, because this is such an important topic.
- **[00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=43s)** — And I am so delighted to be able to speak about this with you.
- **[00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=48s)** — Yeah, and the reason I wanted to bring you on is because you're
- **[00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=51s)** — you're basically the first person to really bring this kind of mainstream,
- **[00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=55s)** — this really important point on some of the dangers of seed oils.
- **[01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=60s)** — But I just want to just very quickly give us a little summary on
- **[01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=64s)** — you graduated in 1994, right?
- **[01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=67s)** — Yes, from medical school. Yes, medical school.
- **[01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=70s)** — So in school, I'm sure they don't probably give you a lot of information
- **[01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=74s)** — on nutrition or even food therapy. Right. Am I correct?
- **[01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=77s)** — We had a nutrition course. We learn what dieticians learn.
- **[01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=81s)** — Doctors do learn what dieticians learn.
- **[01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=83s)** — But that's very limited.
- **[01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=85s)** — What we do learn is most of it is not true.
- **[01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=87s)** — So I'm sure you've had people discussing before.
- **[01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=89s)** — Salt doesn't cause hypertension.
- **[01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=91s)** — Fat doesn't make you fat.
- **[01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=93s)** — Sugar is not the ideal fuel for ourselves.
- **[01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=96s)** — So, you know, most of what we learn about nutrition is actually
- **[01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=100s)** — misinformation. And so it's dangerous.
- **[01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=103s)** — And so doctors are actually dangerous when if you're trusting
- **[01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=107s)** — your doctor's nutrition advice, you're going to end up sick.
- **[01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=111s)** — Yeah, even if they bring up the topic, because I don't even remember
- **[01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=114s)** — any doctor that I've ever been to ask me, OK, so the first question
- **[01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=119s)** — is, what have you been eating?
- **[02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=120s)** — Yeah, they'll bring it up.
- **[02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=121s)** — You know, if your cholesterol is high, which isn't actually a problem,
- **[02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=124s)** — that is a problem they've invented.
- **[02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=126s)** — Like, they'll bring it up under limited circumstances.
- **[02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=128s)** — But the medical doctrine is not to look for real root causes.
- **[02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=134s)** — And so, like, that's what really lights a fire under my parts
- **[02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=139s)** — about like getting getting the word out here, because if we could get
- **[02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=143s)** — to the root cause, we can fix everything.
- **[02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=146s)** — And I've seen it happen, you know, hundreds of times personally
- **[02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=150s)** — and thousands of testimonials now, as I'm sure you have,
- **[02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=153s)** — since you give similar advice.
- **[02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=155s)** — But the degree of, you know, how powerful it is and just how
- **[02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=161s)** — how much we can prevent is just so exciting.
- **[02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=166s)** — And it's so simple if you boil it down the way that I do in my latest book,
- **[02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=170s)** — Dark Calories.
- **[02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=172s)** — You know, I got I got your book and it just is I love the title of the book,
- **[02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=176s)** — Dark Calories, because I just pulled me right.
- **[02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=178s)** — I'm like, oh, what's that all about? Right.
- **[03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=180s)** — So I have a series of questions I want to ask you.
- **[03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=183s)** — And I want to dissect this topic starting from how can you possibly take
- **[03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=188s)** — seed oils, which is very unstable.
- **[03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=190s)** — What do they do to preserve it?
- **[03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=191s)** — So the oil actually is problematic because they initiate the formation of toxins
- **[03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=201s)** — and that there is no preservation.
- **[03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=204s)** — What's happening is invisible toxicity is developing in the bottle.
- **[03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=210s)** — Most of us can't even detect what would be a signal that these oils are no good,
- **[03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=216s)** — which is called rancidity, which is different from oxidation.
- **[03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=222s)** — It's not. So these oils are not necessarily are they rancid or are they oxidized?
- **[03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=229s)** — They are both.
- **[03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=230s)** — And it depends on the time frame you're talking about.
- **[03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=233s)** — So the oils that are bad are all seed oils that have these unstable fatty acids,
- **[03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=239s)** — as you mentioned, but they have also been refined, bleached and deodorized.
- **[04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=246s)** — And all of the stabilizing factors that were in the seed that makes the seeds
- **[04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=252s)** — actually even nutritious in some cases, those are stripped away as part of the refining.
- **[04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=259s)** — The reason that there's no rancidity actually is part of the refining, too.
- **[04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=262s)** — That's a necessary part of the refining.
- **[04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=267s)** — And it's actually the free fatty acids that make it rancid.
- **[04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=272s)** — So things like olive oil can also go rancid, right?
- **[04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=276s)** — But they take a longer time because they've got the stabilizing factors
- **[04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=280s)** — and they've got the better fatty acids.
- **[04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=282s)** — But it's just the problem with these oils is the lack of any nutritional value
- **[04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=287s)** — pretty much whatsoever. There's very few.
- **[04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=289s)** — In nature, you have these seeds that have protective factors.
- **[04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=292s)** — So we're removing all that stuff. And in the industrial process,
- **[04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=298s)** — what are some of the stages that you go through?
- **[04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=299s)** — You mentioned bleaching and things, but what do they actually do
- **[05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=302s)** — to turn the seed into this oil?
- **[05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=305s)** — Well, the first thing they do is they create a crude oil
- **[05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=307s)** — using a lot of heat and pressure that extracts the oil.
- **[05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=312s)** — And this process can be done with what they call cold pressing.
- **[05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=317s)** — Once it's kickstarted, you cannot stop it.
- **[05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=321s)** — So these toxins will continue to develop and multiply and even change.
- **[05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=328s)** — Like some toxins that are there at day two after refining
- **[05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=333s)** — are gone by day 14.
- **[05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=336s)** — And then when you cook with them, you get more toxins.
- **[05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=340s)** — When you reheat it, you get more toxins.
- **[05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=343s)** — So by the time you've made the, say, a French fry,
- **[05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=346s)** — which is cooked, you know, regular French fry from a fast food joint,
- **[05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=349s)** — continuously heated for a few days or weeks,
- **[05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=353s)** — the average French fry contains as much as smoking a cigarette.
- **[05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=358s)** — One French fry equals the toxicity of one cigarette.
- **[06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=362s)** — What? Oh my gosh, that's crazy.
- **[06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=365s)** — So that's how they multiply.
- **[06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=366s)** — I mean, so this multiplication problem is real.
- **[06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=369s)** — Could we relate this to free radical exposure or not?
- **[06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=374s)** — Is this just a different type of toxicity?
- **[06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=377s)** — Free radicals are definitely involved.
- **[06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=379s)** — They're involved in the process of creating the toxins
- **[06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=382s)** — because oxidation and, you know, free radicals are kind of slightly different,
- **[06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=386s)** — but very similar in that they destroy our cellular membranes.
- **[06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=391s)** — They destroy our cellular health, both of them, oxidation and free radicals.
- **[06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=394s)** — Once if you have oxidation, you're going to get free radicals.
- **[06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=397s)** — If you have free radicals, you're going to get oxidation.
- **[06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=400s)** — So when we're consuming this seed oil,
- **[06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=404s)** — what is it actually doing to our membranes?
- **[06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=407s)** — The toxins that form in the bottle, that form when we cook with seed oils,
- **[06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=412s)** — that form in our foods when we cook with seed oils,
- **[06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=415s)** — those toxins have the capacity to damage our cells.
- **[07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=420s)** — And it just will not function because these oxidation reactions
- **[07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=425s)** — are the very thing that triggers the inflammatory response system.
- **[07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=430s)** — You see this on your skin, right? With sunburn, actually,
- **[07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=433s)** — is the simplest form of visible membrane oxidation damage.
- **[07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=440s)** — And it happens worse when you have a high seed oil diet
- **[07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=443s)** — because a little bit of toxicity, a little bit of oxidation reaction
- **[07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=450s)** — becomes unstoppable on a high seed oil diet because of how it affects us.
- **[07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=456s)** — There's so many other consequences that, you know,
- **[07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=459s)** — I have to write separate chapters about each of these.
- **[07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=462s)** — It's just unbelievable.
- **[07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=465s)** — But the good news is that means it's the most powerful lever
- **[07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=468s)** — by which you can improve your health.
- **[07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=472s)** — And none of this is something that I learned in medical school.
- **[07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=475s)** — Let me go without saying.
- **[07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=478s)** — Right. This is all stuff I had to figure out because
- **[08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=481s)** — I wanted to be able to help my patients,
- **[08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=485s)** — really, truly help them.
- **[08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=486s)** — And I didn't feel like drugs were doing much.
- **[08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=489s)** — What initially got you to...
- **[08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=491s)** — start looking outside the box?
- **[08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=494s)** — Was there something that occurred?
- **[08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=496s)** — I met a family, a four generation Hawaii family,
- **[08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=500s)** — and the grandmother was...
- **[08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=502s)** — actually, this is the great grandmother who had brought in her great grandson.
- **[08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=506s)** — And she was in her 80s.
- **[08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=508s)** — And in stellar health, her chart was about five pages thick,
- **[08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=513s)** — coming in for, you know, cutness shots and stitches.
- **[08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=516s)** — And her great grandson was just 10.
- **[08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=520s)** — But he was on three daily medications, had thick bottle,
- **[08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=523s)** — you know, bottleneck glasses, braces,
- **[08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=526s)** — lots of chronic allergies, chronic learning disorder problems.
- **[08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=530s)** — The dominant narrative was we had just spent the 20th century
- **[08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=534s)** — expanding our longevity.
- **[08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=536s)** — You know, at the beginning, it was like 40 years.
- **[08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=538s)** — By the end, it was 77 on average.
- **[09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=541s)** — They were predicting that kids born in the year 2000
- **[09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=545s)** — were going to live to be 120.
- **[09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=547s)** — And I was like, that's not what I'm seeing.
- **[09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=551s)** — I'm seeing a health catastrophe unfold right before my eyes.
- **[09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=556s)** — I'm a family practice doctor.
- **[09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=558s)** — So that's why I was caring for all these different generations.
- **[09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=562s)** — And I knew the family intimately.
- **[09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=564s)** — And I was like, this is...
- **[09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=566s)** — I had just met the great grandson.
- **[09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=568s)** — And that was the tipping point, because I'm like, this is wrong.
- **[09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=572s)** — And I've got to get to the bottom of this.
- **[09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=574s)** — And I also had my own health problems,
- **[09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=576s)** — my own health challenges that had kind of just spurred me
- **[09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=579s)** — to start looking into nutrition as well.
- **[09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=582s)** — And so I felt like I needed to get to the truth
- **[09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=585s)** — because the narrative was saturated fat was the problem.
- **[09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=589s)** — And so I was like, OK, so what is doing this to us?
- **[09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=592s)** — Is it just the deprivation of nutrients
- **[09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=596s)** — like Weston Price talked about?
- **[09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=597s)** — Or is there something else going on?
- **[10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=600s)** — And two halves of my life came together
- **[10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=602s)** — because before I went to medical school, I was a biochemist.
- **[10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=605s)** — I went to Cornell for biochemistry to get a PhD
- **[10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=610s)** — and being able to modify bacteria to digest plastic.
- **[10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=614s)** — And as soon as I found out about these oils that were everywhere
- **[10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=618s)** — and I hadn't been paying attention,
- **[10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=620s)** — I was like, this is so important.
- **[10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=623s)** — And I just dove into trying to figure out the connections.
- **[10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=627s)** — And really, there wasn't any...
- **[10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=629s)** — I couldn't just read something that existed.
- **[10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=631s)** — I had to use the understanding of biochemistry that I had gained
- **[10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=637s)** — before going to medical school
- **[10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=639s)** — and then kind of push that into what I learned about medicine
- **[10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=643s)** — to create basically a whole new way of thinking about the root cause of disease.
- **[10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=648s)** — And that's what I've been writing about for like 14, 15 years now.
- **[10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=653s)** — Wow. You know, on top of this heart-healthy seed oil,
- **[10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=659s)** — so you're thinking, oh, yeah, it's fine.
- **[11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=660s)** — You know, that's just been ingrained in our minds.
- **[11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=663s)** — How can they claim that?
- **[11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=664s)** — The doctors don't know that the data that supports that claim
- **[11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=671s)** — was bought and sold by Procter & Gamble,
- **[11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=674s)** — who funded the American Heart Association,
- **[11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=678s)** — the entire organization.
- **[11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=682s)** — There have been doctors who, like individual doctors throughout history,
- **[11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=686s)** — who were willing to, you know, take money and say whatever.
- **[11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=689s)** — Say cigarettes are healthy. You know, that happened repeatedly.
- **[11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=692s)** — But never before in history, to my knowledge,
- **[11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=695s)** — had an entire organization done the deal with the devil, which they did.
- **[11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=700s)** — The person who stepped up to basically defend seed oils is Ancel Keys.
- **[11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=706s)** — And Ancel Keys had this big idea that saturated fat clogged our arteries,
- **[11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=711s)** — but polyunsaturates being liquid wouldn't.
- **[11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=714s)** — I mean, really, it was really that simplistic and frankly stupid idea.
- **[11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=719s)** — That's not how the body works.
- **[12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=720s)** — He wasn't a medical doctor, but he went around the world
- **[12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=724s)** — with all this money that Procter & Gamble gave him,
- **[12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=727s)** — creating just reams and reams of paperwork that passes for evidence.
- **[12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=735s)** — Because nobody reads it.
- **[12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=736s)** — Like when I look at it and when I read it myself, I was like,
- **[12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=740s)** — I can't believe this stuff is ever got published.
- **[12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=743s)** — It's basically random musings and rantings.
- **[12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=748s)** — There's nothing systematic about it.
- **[12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=750s)** — And it contradicts itself because there's other authors who disagree
- **[12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=753s)** — with Keys because he was kind of a jerk.
- **[12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=756s)** — And he was trying to gaslight everybody that was working with him
- **[12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=760s)** — and to going along with his theory,
- **[12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=762s)** — but the evidence wasn't showing his theory was right.
- **[12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=765s)** — Wasn't there another book called The Prudent Diet that was pushed at that time?
- **[12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=770s)** — The American Heart Association got behind this other doctor
- **[12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=775s)** — who was promoting his diet book, which was full of seed oils and margarine,
- **[13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=781s)** — because he saw the trend coming.
- **[13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=785s)** — They were interconnected buddies.
- **[13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=787s)** — And he was like, OK, great. So this is the trend.
- **[13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=789s)** — So let's jump on this trend.
- **[13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=790s)** — I'm going to write a book that basically the American Heart Association
- **[13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=796s)** — supported. There was mutual interests.
- **[13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=798s)** — They supported each other.
- **[13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=800s)** — And it became wildly popular to avoid saturated fats thanks to that book,
- **[13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=807s)** — which, again, no evidence, no evidence.
- **[13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=811s)** — But it was so promoted and popular that it radically changed
- **[13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=819s)** — what Americans ate forever.
- **[13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=822s)** — This is going to go down in history.
- **[13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=825s)** — Unfortunately, I don't know when there's going to be class action.
- **[13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=828s)** — So, you know, like trans fats have been around for like 100 years.
- **[13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=832s)** — And they finally say, OK, now it's bad after 90 years.
- **[13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=835s)** — My goal is just on a grassroots level to get people to be aware of this
- **[14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=840s)** — and start to avoid it and do the alternative things.
- **[14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=845s)** — But what about the relationship between seed oils and insulin resistance?
- **[14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=849s)** — Is there a connection there?
- **[14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=851s)** — This is so important.
- **[14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=853s)** — And this is what I call my energy model of insulin resistance,
- **[14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=859s)** — because insulin resistance is nearly ubiquitous in this country.
- **[14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=864s)** — Something close to 99 percent of the population was found to be insulin
- **[14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=869s)** — resistant on a large survey done and done in the year 2006.
- **[14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=878s)** — And it's probably worse, but nobody knows what the root cause of insulin resistance is.
- **[14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=886s)** — And people are talking about it being carbohydrates.
- **[14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=888s)** — And I would say that that's not what the science suggests.
- **[14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=892s)** — It boils down to the fact that your body fat, when you've been filling it up
- **[14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=896s)** — with the polyunsaturates from seed oils, does not give your mitochondria
- **[15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=902s)** — the fuel that they need. And it can actually hurt your mitochondria.
- **[15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=906s)** — I just want to just pause there because this is very interesting.
- **[15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=910s)** — We consume fats, we consume carbs that turn into fats, but seed oils,
- **[15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=916s)** — I just... people assume, well, they're just burned up as energy, right?
- **[15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=920s)** — Just burned up just like any other fuel.
- **[15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=922s)** — But that's not true.
- **[15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=923s)** — That's not true.
- **[15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=925s)** — Wow. Wow. So they get stored somewhere in the fat cell or something,
- **[15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=931s)** — and they just... our bodies can't use it effectively?
- **[15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=934s)** — They get stored in the fat cells. That's exactly right.
- **[15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=937s)** — And they... because of the amount that the average person is eating now,
- **[15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=941s)** — where 80% of their fat calories are coming from seed oils...
- **[15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=945s)** — What percentage?
- **[15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=946s)** — 80% of our fat calories are coming from seed oils.
- **[15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=949s)** — Now, it's not all polyunsaturates.
- **[15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=950s)** — It doesn't mean our body fat is that many polyunsaturates,
- **[15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=953s)** — but it has way more, right?
- **[15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=955s)** — It has normally historically somewhere around 5%, maybe less.
- **[15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=959s)** — Some people say more, but somewhere around 5% historically.
- **[16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=963s)** — And now people have something like 20%, 30%, 40%.
- **[16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=968s)** — We've changed the chemistry of the largest organ in our body,
- **[16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=974s)** — our adipose fat tissue.
- **[16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=976s)** — And it's making us crave foods that will raise our sugar
- **[16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=982s)** — because that's an alternative fuel, right?
- **[16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=985s)** — So just our cells are like, well, fat's not working for us.
- **[16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=988s)** — They don't know from polyunsaturate or whatever,
- **[16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=991s)** — but they do know another fuel is glucose,
- **[16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=996s)** — always in our bloodstream.
- **[16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=998s)** — And that's the key to understanding this connection
- **[16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=1002s)** — between seed oils and obesity
- **[16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=1005s)** — and seed oils and insulin resistance
- **[16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=1008s)** — and seed oils and all metabolic diseases.
- **[16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=1012s)** — Wow.
- **[16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=1012s)** — Right? That's the key.
- **[16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=1014s)** — You know, I'm developing an app to pick up and scan
- **[16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=1017s)** — and be able to identify seed oils and foods
- **[16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=1019s)** — because it's in mayonnaise, it's in dressings,
- **[17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=1023s)** — it's in pretty much all the restaurants.
- **[17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=1025s)** — You can't find a restaurant without them cooking something
- **[17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=1028s)** — in seed oil.
- **[17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=1029s)** — Yes. So that's why in the back of Dark Calories,
- **[17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=1032s)** — I give people a script to say to different restaurants
- **[17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=1037s)** — in different settings, like I help you navigate this
- **[17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=1040s)** — because it is a minefield.
- **[17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=1042s)** — The entire world wants to shove these oils
- **[17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=1045s)** — down your throat.
- **[17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=1046s)** — They don't care.
- **[17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=1047s)** — It's cheap.
- **[17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=1048s)** — There's all these excuses they use,
- **[17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=1050s)** — high smoke point neutral, nobody's allergic to it,
- **[17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=1053s)** — like peanut oil, for example.
- **[17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=1055s)** — And, you know, so it's everywhere
- **[17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=1057s)** — and you have to have your defenses ready.
- **[17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=1062s)** — So that's what the last third of the book,
- **[17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=1065s)** — Dark Calories, does is it gives you the defenses
- **[17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=1069s)** — you need to protect your health and your family's health,
- **[17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=1073s)** — your children's health, everybody you care about.
- **[17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=1076s)** — If a person is trying to figure out
- **[17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=1078s)** — what to replace it with, can you give us some ideas
- **[18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=1080s)** — and what are some safe oils that we could cook with?
- **[18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=1083s)** — Yeah, so I have my favorite five,
- **[18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=1086s)** — but there's a list of delightful dozen in the book.
- **[18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=1089s)** — So my favorite five are olive oil, butter,
- **[18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=1093s)** — coconut oil, peanut oil, and sesame oil.
- **[18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=1096s)** — There's so many choices and these things are delicious.
- **[18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=1099s)** — Right? It makes your food taste better.
- **[18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=1101s)** — Because the other thing about these deodorized oils
- **[18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=1104s)** — and being refined is they have no flavor agents in them.
- **[18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=1110s)** — And what they do, since they're so slippery and wiggly,
- **[18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=1114s)** — these palli and saturates that are flexible,
- **[18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=1117s)** — breakable molecules, they totally coat your taste buds.
- **[18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=1123s)** — So they actually kind of can make it harder
- **[18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=1125s)** — for you to taste other things.
- **[18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=1128s)** — Wow, I didn't know that.
- **[18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=1130s)** — If someone stops consuming seed oils,
- **[18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=1132s)** — how long does it take to get it out
- **[18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=1135s)** — of your fat cell or your body?
- **[18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=1137s)** — Is it possible over time?
- **[18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=1139s)** — It is absolutely possible.
- **[19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=1142s)** — And it takes a while because we're talking about,
- **[19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=1147s)** — exchanging pounds of molecules, right?
- **[19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=1151s)** — So the estimates are somewhere around a year and a half.
- **[19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=1154s)** — A lot of people do focus on,
- **[19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=1156s)** — oh my God, I don't want these things in my body
- **[19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=1158s)** — and I have to wait a year and a half.
- **[19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=1161s)** — That makes people feel panicky and they want to try
- **[19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=1165s)** — all kinds of unproven detox methods and stuff like that.
- **[19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=1170s)** — You don't need to because you are going to be able
- **[19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=1174s)** — to help your mitochondria to improve your energy
- **[19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=1177s)** — and all the good things, reverse insulin resistance.
- **[19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=1180s)** — Starting from day one,
- **[19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=1181s)** — you start to improve your mitochondrial function
- **[19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=1186s)** — because the foods that I recommend in dark calories
- **[19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=1191s)** — give your mitochondria energy.
- **[19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=1193s)** — They help you get energy.
- **[19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=1195s)** — And the other thing that they do is they help support
- **[19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=1198s)** — your body's antioxidant system,
- **[20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=1201s)** — which is so, so important so that your mitochondria
- **[20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=1205s)** — aren't quite so susceptible to shutting down
- **[20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=1210s)** — from burning a little bit of PUFA,
- **[20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=1212s)** — a little bit of the polyacetrate fatty acids, right?
- **[20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=1214s)** — And so we really need to eat a diet that helps our body
- **[20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=1219s)** — create our own antioxidant enzymes from scratch.
- **[20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=1224s)** — It's enzymes that we need,
- **[20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=1226s)** — which are biological machines made out of protein.
- **[20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=1229s)** — And they use vitamins, they use minerals
- **[20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=1232s)** — to do their machine work of capturing the free radicals
- **[20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=1238s)** — and literally catching the bad oxygen molecules.
- **[20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=1244s)** — They break these free radical chain reactions.
- **[20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=1247s)** — They block the oxidation,
- **[20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=1248s)** — but it's enzymes that we need and they come from protein.
- **[20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=1252s)** — And a lot of folks, a lot of women,
- **[20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=1254s)** — especially menopausal women, I've found don't get anywhere
- **[20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=1258s)** — near enough protein in their diet.
- **[21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=1261s)** — Right, that's really important.
- **[21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=1264s)** — So what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna put your link
- **[21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=1267s)** — in the description and I highly recommend everyone
- **[21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=1269s)** — read that book because it's called Dark Calories.
- **[21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=1272s)** — Amazing, you won't be able to put it down.
- **[21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=1274s)** — It's just filled with gold information
- **[21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=1276s)** — that wish we would have got like 30 years ago,
- **[21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=1279s)** — when I was started getting interested in nutrition.
- **[21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=1282s)** — So I just appreciate you spending the time
- **[21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=1284s)** — giving us this data and I'll have to have you back
- **[21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=1287s)** — on real soon, but thank you so much.
- **[21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=1291s)** — I appreciate your expertise, thank you.
- **[21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=1293s)** — Absolutely.

- **[00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yBOrKcsVbOs&t=0s)** — There are five critical warning signs that you should never ignore.
- **[00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yBOrKcsVbOs&t=5s)** — A lot of people have one of these five symptoms and they're normalizing them.
- **[00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yBOrKcsVbOs&t=10s)** — And I'm here to tell you that you don't want to ignore these five signs because
- **[00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yBOrKcsVbOs&t=14s)** — you can usually do something about it if you catch it in time.
- **[00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yBOrKcsVbOs&t=18s)** — Far too often when you go to the doctor, they just basically treat your symptoms.
- **[00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yBOrKcsVbOs&t=21s)** — What's causing your blood pressure? It could be this or that. Here, just take this medication.
- **[00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yBOrKcsVbOs&t=24s)** — High cholesterol, take this medication. Arthritis, take this medication.
- **[00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yBOrKcsVbOs&t=28s)** — I am more interested in finding the underlying root cause so I don't have to take medication the
- **[00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yBOrKcsVbOs&t=34s)** — rest of my life. So let's start with number one. Chronic fatigue. You could be fatigued
- **[00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yBOrKcsVbOs&t=40s)** — chronically from so many things. If you have anemia, that could be either low B12 or iron.
- **[00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yBOrKcsVbOs&t=48s)** — I was chronically fatigued for many, many years and I was taking tons and tons of
- **[00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yBOrKcsVbOs&t=54s)** — vitamins thinking that's going to help me. I'd be driving down the street with my wife and
- **[00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yBOrKcsVbOs&t=58s)** — say, honey, let's go over there. They might be able to help me in this health food store.
- **[01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yBOrKcsVbOs&t=63s)** — I'd be asking them maybe I need this vitamin or that vitamin. I'm here to tell you that
- **[01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yBOrKcsVbOs&t=67s)** — the vitamins will not work for various symptoms unless you correct the diet. There's
- **[01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yBOrKcsVbOs&t=72s)** — a basic diet that I recommend that will handle a lot of problems to the point where you might
- **[01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yBOrKcsVbOs&t=77s)** — not need any vitamins at all. It wasn't until I started having protein for breakfast
- **[01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yBOrKcsVbOs&t=82s)** — that I really had this realization that, wow, that's the protein that I needed that just
- **[01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yBOrKcsVbOs&t=87s)** — woke me up. Another cause of chronic fatigue is low vitamin B1. If you're deficient in B1,
- **[01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yBOrKcsVbOs&t=94s)** — you're going to have a lot of racing of the mind thinking about problems before you go to bed,
- **[01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yBOrKcsVbOs&t=99s)** — restless leg syndrome. You're going to have a lot of nervous energy. Chronic fatigue could
- **[01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yBOrKcsVbOs&t=103s)** — come from a tick bite. This microorganism in these ticks, they downgrade your vitamin D
- **[01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yBOrKcsVbOs&t=109s)** — receptors. Very sneaky, leaving you with the inability to use vitamin D3. If you have a
- **[01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yBOrKcsVbOs&t=115s)** — liver disease, heart disease, autoimmune disease, that's involving a lot of inflammation.
- **[02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yBOrKcsVbOs&t=122s)** — And then let's say, for example, you've checked all these things and nothing is working.
- **[02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yBOrKcsVbOs&t=126s)** — There is a small rare chance that it could be something more serious, possibly cancer,
- **[02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yBOrKcsVbOs&t=132s)** — probably not, but you can always get an assessment to rule that out. Number two,
- **[02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yBOrKcsVbOs&t=137s)** — sudden weight loss. It could be any number of things. It could be hyperthyroidism,
- **[02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yBOrKcsVbOs&t=144s)** — and that can actually speed up the thyroid and cause you to lose weight. Also, type 1 diabetes
- **[02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yBOrKcsVbOs&t=150s)** — can cause weight loss. A disease with your adrenal glands, where they're kind of shutting
- **[02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yBOrKcsVbOs&t=155s)** — down, called Addison's disease, also could cause you to lose weight. Parasites can cause you
- **[02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yBOrKcsVbOs&t=162s)** — to lose weight. Number three, persistent weakness. This could be iron. You could be
- **[02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yBOrKcsVbOs&t=172s)** — a low sodium. Low sodium will cause weakness, but you can also be weak if you're low in magnesium,
- **[02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yBOrKcsVbOs&t=179s)** — vitamin E, and then potassium deficiency can also make you weak. Number four, chronic diarrhea.
- **[03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yBOrKcsVbOs&t=186s)** — Mostly, diarrhea comes from food poisoning or eating something that your body disagreed with.
- **[03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yBOrKcsVbOs&t=193s)** — It could also be low zinc. One of the symptoms is diarrhea. I think a common reason
- **[03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yBOrKcsVbOs&t=198s)** — a lot of diarrhea is side effects from medication. So you want to look at that as well.
- **[03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yBOrKcsVbOs&t=203s)** — And a lot of people have irritable bowel syndrome, and they're doing a lot of grains,
- **[03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yBOrKcsVbOs&t=208s)** — and the grains are just tearing up their colon or getting diarrhea from that. But I think
- **[03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yBOrKcsVbOs&t=212s)** — a big one, especially if you travel overseas somewhere, getting a parasite that can create
- **[03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yBOrKcsVbOs&t=218s)** — diarrhea, in which case, when you get back, you need to take a probiotic, a strong one,
- **[03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yBOrKcsVbOs&t=224s)** — for a long time to fix that problem. And then number five is persistent stomach or abdomen
- **[03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yBOrKcsVbOs&t=231s)** — pain. I would start eating better and then get rid of the junk food. That should handle
- **[03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yBOrKcsVbOs&t=237s)** — 95% of the problem right there. If it doesn't, suspect other reasons, which could be coming
- **[04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yBOrKcsVbOs&t=245s)** — from a gallstone or a kidney stone. And you won't be able to tell the difference unless they
- **[04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yBOrKcsVbOs&t=250s)** — do an ultrasound or some other test. And so a kidney stone too is not always felt in the back
- **[04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yBOrKcsVbOs&t=256s)** — part. It could be felt in the front as well. There's another condition called small intestinal
- **[04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yBOrKcsVbOs&t=261s)** — bacterial overgrowth where the microbes are in the small intestine, not the large. The
- **[04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yBOrKcsVbOs&t=265s)** — solution is to do intermittent fasting, garlic, and some betaine hydrochloride. But this is
- **[04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yBOrKcsVbOs&t=271s)** — all generated from being very, very sick. With the abdomen, you could have like appendicitis.
- **[04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yBOrKcsVbOs&t=277s)** — You could have a parasite. I mean, it could be cancer, rare. It could be an ulcer or gallbladder
- **[04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yBOrKcsVbOs&t=284s)** — sludge, which is actually more common than you think. The bile starts to thicken in the tubes
- **[04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yBOrKcsVbOs&t=290s)** — and cause backup in the pancreas. It can even create inflammation in the pancreas called
- **[04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yBOrKcsVbOs&t=294s)** — pancreatitis, in which case the remedy is TUDCA. That will thin the bile, give you a
- **[05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yBOrKcsVbOs&t=304s)** — IQ on the area of nutrition and food and diet. And it's very ironic that I went to the
- **[05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yBOrKcsVbOs&t=311s)** — exact opposite extreme, focusing most of my time now on studying this topic. If a doctor
- **[05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yBOrKcsVbOs&t=318s)** — diagnoses you and says it's all in your head, ignore them and go to another doctor
- **[05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yBOrKcsVbOs&t=323s)** — and realize when someone gives you a prescription or even a remedy for something like this,
- **[05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yBOrKcsVbOs&t=327s)** — you have to question, is this really correcting the underlying cause or is this suppressing in a
- **[05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yBOrKcsVbOs&t=332s)** — symptom that will keep the problem there longer?

- **[00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHRGqGmGmpg&t=0s)** — It's easy to look at stuff like this and say it's kind of like medicine.
- **[00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHRGqGmGmpg&t=4s)** — And so it would be kind of regulated like medicine, tracked and vetted by our government's health agency, like medicine is.
- **[00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHRGqGmGmpg&t=11s)** — But medicine goes through a very different process, a super lengthy process, with tons of studies and clinical trials, paperwork.
- **[00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHRGqGmGmpg&t=19s)** — It takes years and years and a lot of drugs aren't ever even approved.
- **[00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHRGqGmGmpg&t=24s)** — They fail this process and never make it onto the shelf.
- **[00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHRGqGmGmpg&t=26s)** — Well, there's something about that that I think you should know more about.
- **[00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHRGqGmGmpg&t=30s)** — The thing about the FDA is the FDA is not a full-time career job.
- **[00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHRGqGmGmpg&t=37s)** — It's a few years on the FDA and then they're being courted by the pharmaceutical companies.
- **[00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHRGqGmGmpg&t=43s)** — Yeah, and now let's take a look at the next part.
- **[00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHRGqGmGmpg&t=46s)** — FDA officials are supposed to be watchdogs over pharmaceutical companies.
- **[00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHRGqGmGmpg&t=50s)** — They're also constantly courted by pharmaceutical companies.
- **[00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHRGqGmGmpg&t=53s)** — You'll have a merc going in and saying to somebody on the FDA,
- **[00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHRGqGmGmpg&t=58s)** — I'll give you $600,000 if you'll come and work on our regulatory committee to go into bat for us with the FDA.
- **[01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHRGqGmGmpg&t=66s)** — And they'll say, okay, well, I'll think about that.
- **[01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHRGqGmGmpg&t=69s)** — And then there'll be like a Pfizer will come in and say, well, we'll give you $800,000 a year to come in and work on our regulatory committee.
- **[01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHRGqGmGmpg&t=75s)** — And so it becomes like a bidding war like that.
- **[01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHRGqGmGmpg&t=78s)** — So the FDA knows that their next jumping off point to go from a lower paying government job to be a very lucrative farmer job on the inside,
- **[01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHRGqGmGmpg&t=87s)** — the manufacturing side, they know that that's part of their career path.
- **[01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHRGqGmGmpg&t=93s)** — So that, I'm sure, weighs heavily into their decision making process.
- **[01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHRGqGmGmpg&t=97s)** — And so I'm not saying that the supplement industry is not corrupt to a certain degree.
- **[01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHRGqGmGmpg&t=102s)** — But if you're implying that the drug industry doesn't have a massive control over the FDA,
- **[01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHRGqGmGmpg&t=109s)** — well, then you need to dig a little bit deeper into that topic.
- **[01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHRGqGmGmpg&t=112s)** — I mean, the rotation between people working for the FDA and the drug industry and then back to the FDA and back to the industry.
- **[01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHRGqGmGmpg&t=119s)** — This is a well-known fact.
- **[02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHRGqGmGmpg&t=121s)** — And it's a well-known problem, too, because certain drugs get pushed through without real good safety studies.
- **[02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHRGqGmGmpg&t=127s)** — And did you realize that 60% of medical reviewers that are in the approval process for these drugs,
- **[02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHRGqGmGmpg&t=135s)** — who then leave the FDA, go to not only work for the drug companies, but they consult the drug companies?
- **[02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHRGqGmGmpg&t=142s)** — Well, here's the problem with the FDA regulating supplements.
- **[02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHRGqGmGmpg&t=146s)** — Because of the ties to drug company, which is the direct competitors,
- **[02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHRGqGmGmpg&t=150s)** — you'd quickly see that a lot of supplements will be off the market.
- **[02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHRGqGmGmpg&t=153s)** — I mean, even when I was in practice for 30 years, I don't remember a lot of people being harmed by supplements.
- **[02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHRGqGmGmpg&t=160s)** — Generally, supplements are pretty safe.
- **[02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHRGqGmGmpg&t=163s)** — And supplements are in a whole different league than pharmaceutical drugs.
- **[02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHRGqGmGmpg&t=166s)** — And I'm going to bring up one aspect of this that might not relate directly, but indirectly it does.
- **[02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHRGqGmGmpg&t=171s)** — It's called GROSS. And that stands for generally recognized as safe.
- **[02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHRGqGmGmpg&t=176s)** — This also relates to a lot of the chemical companies that are allowed to do their own testing,
- **[03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHRGqGmGmpg&t=183s)** — without the FDA, and consider their ingredients safe.
- **[03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHRGqGmGmpg&t=187s)** — Companies are responsible for ensuring their products are safe,
- **[03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHRGqGmGmpg&t=189s)** — and in fact can often put new dietary supplements on the market without even telling FDA.
- **[03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHRGqGmGmpg&t=195s)** — That is a big loophole right now with all sorts of new chemicals that are coming onto the
- **[03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHRGqGmGmpg&t=200s)** — market and putting into our food supply. There's no FDA approval process for that.
- **[03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHRGqGmGmpg&t=205s)** — And so the next time you hear something that is GROSS, generally recognized as safe,
- **[03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHRGqGmGmpg&t=209s)** — realize that that is not through the FDA approval process.
- **[03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHRGqGmGmpg&t=213s)** — One of the supplements that gained popularity was called L-tryptophan.
- **[03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHRGqGmGmpg&t=218s)** — It was this health food supplement made of amino acids that claimed to help people sleep
- **[03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHRGqGmGmpg&t=223s)** — and lose weight. It sounded healthy enough until doctors found that people who took the stuff
- **[03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHRGqGmGmpg&t=228s)** — were developing blood and muscle disorders. So let's talk about this L-tryptophan because
- **[03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHRGqGmGmpg&t=233s)** — very, very interesting. In 1989, there was an incident where you had a dozen people die
- **[04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHRGqGmGmpg&t=241s)** — from apparently taking L-tryptophan. And just so you know what L-tryptophan is,
- **[04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHRGqGmGmpg&t=246s)** — it's an amino acid that can create some real interesting effects. Helping you sleep,
- **[04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHRGqGmGmpg&t=251s)** — it has an anti-depressive factor, it helps to curb cravings, because it's a precursor to
- **[04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHRGqGmGmpg&t=259s)** — Now I just want to let you know before this incident, 2% of every single household was
- **[04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHRGqGmGmpg&t=265s)** — taking L-tryptophan before this. So they did a big recall, okay, and the FDA banned
- **[04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHRGqGmGmpg&t=272s)** — the supplement. So to make a long story short, they eventually found out this problem was
- **[04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHRGqGmGmpg&t=276s)** — related to a batch of L-tryptophan that was contaminated through using a genetically modified
- **[04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHRGqGmGmpg&t=285s)** — bacteria. So anyway, it got contaminated, these batches got out, and it killed some people,
- **[04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHRGqGmGmpg&t=290s)** — which is terrible. And what you should know about this is about a year previous Prozac was
- **[04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHRGqGmGmpg&t=296s)** — released in the market. It deals with this neurotransmitter called serotonin. And when
- **[05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHRGqGmGmpg&t=301s)** — this ban occurred, which was all over the news, several days later, there was a huge
- **[05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHRGqGmGmpg&t=305s)** — promotion for Prozac. And so they banned L-tryptophan for 16 years, which is roughly
- **[05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHRGqGmGmpg&t=311s)** — the same period where the patents tend to run out on Prozac. But actually, I think the patents
- **[05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHRGqGmGmpg&t=316s)** — ran out in 2001, where they lost the monopoly over that product. I think their stocks just
- **[05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHRGqGmGmpg&t=323s)** — plummeted by several billion dollars. But after that, L-tryptophan was allowed to be used
- **[05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHRGqGmGmpg&t=328s)** — in the general market. And I don't even think a lot of people know the power of L-tryptophan.
- **[05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHRGqGmGmpg&t=333s)** — I mean, even if you think about this outbreak of E. coli from eating spinach,
- **[05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHRGqGmGmpg&t=337s)** — are they going to ban spinach for 16 years? Probably not. But they definitely banned
- **[05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHRGqGmGmpg&t=343s)** — L-tryptophan, a natural amino acid, for a very long time. This meta-analysis, which used 84
- **[05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHRGqGmGmpg&t=350s)** — studies and put it all together to find conclusions, found that vitamins and supplements
- **[05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHRGqGmGmpg&t=355s)** — were generally, quote, associated with little or no benefit in preventing cancer,
- **[06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHRGqGmGmpg&t=361s)** — cardiovascular disease, and death. Had a little bit of a benefit on treating cancer if you
- **[06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHRGqGmGmpg&t=366s)** — They also found that people with a high risk of lung cancer had an, quote, increased risk of
- **[06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHRGqGmGmpg&t=372s)** — lung cancer and other harmful outcomes by taking one vitamin, beta-carotene.
- **[06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHRGqGmGmpg&t=414s)** — So what this basically is saying is that vitamins don't work for, like, the big things,
- **[07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHRGqGmGmpg&t=420s)** — preventing the killers, like cancer and heart problems, and they maybe even hurt us in some
- **[07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHRGqGmGmpg&t=425s)** — cases, depending on the supplement.
- **[07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHRGqGmGmpg&t=455s)** — Now, it's called metabolomics that allows you to dig deep down and visualize what's happening
- **[07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHRGqGmGmpg&t=459s)** — with these biochemical pathways. One of the challenges in the field of supplements, okay,
- **[07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHRGqGmGmpg&t=467s)** — is that you have a lot of large companies that own the good majority of the supplement
- **[07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHRGqGmGmpg&t=473s)** — industry, which I believe has a huge interest in making big profits. So in other words,
- **[07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHRGqGmGmpg&t=478s)** — when you buy synthetic B1 versus natural B1, it's incredibly cheap. And then you hear these
- **[08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHRGqGmGmpg&t=484s)** — well-known claims that, well, hey, there's no difference between synthetic and natural.
- **[08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHRGqGmGmpg&t=487s)** — They're both the same molecules. They work the same. I don't think so. Two-thirds of all
- **[08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHRGqGmGmpg&t=494s)** — vitamins sold come from raw materials from China, and those are purely synthetic. Okay,
- **[08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHRGqGmGmpg&t=499s)** — those are industrial-made compounds, ascorbic acid, thiamine, all these vitamins, right?
- **[08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHRGqGmGmpg&t=505s)** — They're made in a lab. Now, even if it's on the label of, say, made in USA,
- **[08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHRGqGmGmpg&t=510s)** — means put together. Where does the raw material come from? It comes from overseas in China.
- **[08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHRGqGmGmpg&t=517s)** — I personally sell supplements, and I've been criticized by selling supplements. They say,
- **[08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHRGqGmGmpg&t=520s)** — Dr. Berg, you shouldn't be selling supplements because you're in the business.
- **[08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHRGqGmGmpg&t=523s)** — Well, my viewpoint is, would you rather have a drug company selling supplements,
- **[08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHRGqGmGmpg&t=528s)** — a large junk food company selling supplements, a marketer selling supplements when there's really
- **[08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHRGqGmGmpg&t=534s)** — no individual name behind the brand? I mean, check out these brands and who owns these brands.
- **[08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHRGqGmGmpg&t=539s)** — We have Nestle owning certain brands, Pfizer, Bayer, Clorox, Procter & Gamble,
- **[09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHRGqGmGmpg&t=548s)** — private equity firms. Another pharmaceutical company owns Nature Lab, global investment firm,
- **[09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHRGqGmGmpg&t=554s)** — it's called KKR. And then you have like Kirkland, which is owned by Costco. I mean,
- **[09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHRGqGmGmpg&t=559s)** — what's really bizarre is if you take the top-selling vitamins, the multivitamins,
- **[09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHRGqGmGmpg&t=564s)** — the first ingredient is calcium carbonate, the majority of that product. Calcium carbonate is
- **[09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHRGqGmGmpg&t=571s)** — limestone. You're dealing with like this rock and you're going to put that as a supplement.
- **[09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHRGqGmGmpg&t=575s)** — From my viewpoint, it's not the best type of calcium you should put in a supplement. And so
- **[09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHRGqGmGmpg&t=579s)** — when you read this label and you see all these chemicals put in there and the synthetic
- **[09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHRGqGmGmpg&t=583s)** — vitamins, are they really focused on quality or are they focused on profits? I spend a
- **[09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHRGqGmGmpg&t=588s)** — tremendous amount of time sourcing the ingredients in my products and making sure
- **[09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHRGqGmGmpg&t=592s)** — it doesn't come from China. I investigate the soils that these certain products are grown on.
- **[09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHRGqGmGmpg&t=597s)** — In fact, this is one of the reasons I'm actually creating a very large greenhouse to grow some of
- **[10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHRGqGmGmpg&t=605s)** — my own ingredients. So I'm going to create a lot of videos on it so you can see the soil.
- **[10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHRGqGmGmpg&t=609s)** — And I wish companies were more transparent about where their ingredients come from. I mean,
- **[10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHRGqGmGmpg&t=614s)** — even like my product with vitamin C, to make sure that vitamin C was natural, it was a
- **[10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHRGqGmGmpg&t=620s)** — lot more expensive than the synthetic ascorbic acid, which by the way, 90% of all of the
- **[10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHRGqGmGmpg&t=626s)** — vitamin C in the market is synthetic ascorbic acid. It's made from cornstarch and sulfuric
- **[10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHRGqGmGmpg&t=632s)** — acid. It doesn't even come from any plants. Does our diet actually provide all the vitamins
- **[10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHRGqGmGmpg&t=637s)** — that we need? Some people will say, oh, no, don't worry about vitamins. They're not
- **[10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHRGqGmGmpg&t=641s)** — really needed. Well, have you ever looked at the back of a label of a product and looked
- **[10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHRGqGmGmpg&t=645s)** — at some of the nutrients? It'll say it provides 2% of the RDAs for vitamin A or vitamin B,
- **[10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHRGqGmGmpg&t=652s)** — etc. Did you realize that RDAs are really just average numbers to potentially
- **[11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHRGqGmGmpg&t=660s)** — prevent a deficiency in healthy people? And then you also have the dietary requirement
- **[11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHRGqGmGmpg&t=667s)** — intake. So if our food is grown on crappy soils or even hydroponically where they're just
- **[11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHRGqGmGmpg&t=673s)** — 15 minerals, how can someone say that we have enough nutrients? And then you have the factor
- **[11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHRGqGmGmpg&t=679s)** — of genetics. We have genetics that sometimes can interfere with our ability to absorb a vitamin.
- **[11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHRGqGmGmpg&t=686s)** — And that's why when you test vitamin D, for example, they always test the inactive version
- **[11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHRGqGmGmpg&t=691s)** — in the blood and they might say, oh yeah, you're fine. But what about the conversion that
- **[11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHRGqGmGmpg&t=695s)** — has to happen through your kidney and the liver? Well, and what if you have a problem
- **[11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHRGqGmGmpg&t=700s)** — with the genes? What's the solution? You have to take more. I mean, when I was reading some
- **[11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHRGqGmGmpg&t=705s)** — of these tests with people, they have a problem with vitamin C, they have a problem with B12
- **[11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHRGqGmGmpg&t=709s)** — and folate. The point is there's a lot of barriers for these nutrients to go in our bodies
- **[11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHRGqGmGmpg&t=714s)** — from absorption, from genetics, from the amount needed. Let's say someone has chronic
- **[12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHRGqGmGmpg&t=720s)** — inflammation, they have diabetes. Or what if they exercise a lot like I do, yet I was
- **[12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHRGqGmGmpg&t=726s)** — deficient in vitamin C and glutathione? Why? Because I exercise a lot. And then when we get
- **[12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHRGqGmGmpg&t=733s)** — to other nutrients that are not necessarily vitamins like the omega-3 fatty acids,
- **[12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHRGqGmGmpg&t=737s)** — specifically DHA, which is an anti-inflammatory, if you're consuming all these seed oils,
- **[12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHRGqGmGmpg&t=743s)** — okay, that's going to block your absorption of omega-3 fatty acids. And then we also have
- **[12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHRGqGmGmpg&t=748s)** — potassium, for example. The requirements for potassium are 4,700 milligrams. You'd have to
- **[12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHRGqGmGmpg&t=755s)** — consume a lot of certain things. A lot of people aren't aware that they need that much.
- **[12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHRGqGmGmpg&t=760s)** — And then let's just take folate. There's been studies showing that if you're deficient of
- **[12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHRGqGmGmpg&t=764s)** — folate, it can mimic the same damage to your DNA as radiation can cause to your DNA. Let's
- **[12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHRGqGmGmpg&t=773s)** — also look at the type of food someone eats. Let's say they eat a lot of grains. Well,
- **[12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHRGqGmGmpg&t=779s)** — guess what? Phytic acid blocks certain nutrients like zinc. And then let's say someone
- **[13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHRGqGmGmpg&t=784s)** — is a vegan and they're thinking that they're getting all their vitamin A because they're
- **[13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHRGqGmGmpg&t=789s)** — eating a lot of carrots, getting a lot of beta carotene. You have to realize beta carotene
- **[13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHRGqGmGmpg&t=793s)** — is a precursor. It's not the active form of vitamin A, which is like retinol, which is
- **[13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHRGqGmGmpg&t=798s)** — very high in egg yolks. You'd have to consume a tremendous amount of carrots. I think it was 45
- **[13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHRGqGmGmpg&t=803s)** — pounds of carrots to get enough vitamin A for one day. And then you might be eating
- **[13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHRGqGmGmpg&t=809s)** — walnuts to get your omega-3. Walnuts do have ALA. That's the precursor. It's not the active
- **[13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHRGqGmGmpg&t=817s)** — form. And that has to be converted into EPA and DHA. And you have to consume a lot of
- **[13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHRGqGmGmpg&t=823s)** — walnuts to have that happen. And so I'm not just picking on the vegan diet. I'm just saying
- **[13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHRGqGmGmpg&t=827s)** — that if you do a vegan diet, you have to make sure that you take certain supplements.
- **[13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHRGqGmGmpg&t=831s)** — And then you have fasting where you're not eating any food and then you're on
- **[13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHRGqGmGmpg&t=836s)** — one meal a day. Well, maybe you need to take certain supplements because you're not necessarily
- **[14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHRGqGmGmpg&t=841s)** — eating the quantities of food. Now your body will adapt and it'll be more efficient and your
- **[14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHRGqGmGmpg&t=846s)** — need for certain nutrients will not be as high. So number one, we do need nutrition. Number
- **[14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHRGqGmGmpg&t=851s)** — two, I don't think we're getting enough of the right nutrition. And number three, the
- **[14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHRGqGmGmpg&t=855s)** — supplements that are sold out there sometimes might not give you the right type of vitamins
- **[14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHRGqGmGmpg&t=859s)** — that you need because the source of them are synthetic. But it's not just about vitamins,
- **[14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHRGqGmGmpg&t=865s)** — minerals, trace minerals, amino acids, fatty acids. You also have phytonutrients that I think
- **[14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHRGqGmGmpg&t=871s)** — in the future we're going to find out they create huge benefits for us. When a diabetic
- **[14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHRGqGmGmpg&t=875s)** — consumes more of these phytonutrients, they have less complications. But when I saw this
- **[14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHRGqGmGmpg&t=880s)** — video on vitamins, I wanted to correct a few things, add a few things because I am actually
- **[14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHRGqGmGmpg&t=887s)** — in this area. I know a lot about it. And yes, there is a lot of corruption going on.
- **[14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHRGqGmGmpg&t=892s)** — A lot of hidden sugars in these products. And I've done a video on that.
- **[14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHRGqGmGmpg&t=896s)** — The hidden maltodextrin. You should check it out. I put it up right here.
