- **[00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELokmLIus-Q&t=0s)** — The number one best food in the world that can help unclog your arteries,
- **[00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELokmLIus-Q&t=4s)** — prevent a heart attack and a stroke.
- **[00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELokmLIus-Q&t=6s)** — This is better than aspirin.
- **[00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELokmLIus-Q&t=9s)** — Aspirin has been around for 4,000 years.
- **[00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELokmLIus-Q&t=10s)** — And I don't know if you can see it, but there's a tiny little over-the-counter
- **[00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELokmLIus-Q&t=13s)** — pill that's used for pain, fever.
- **[00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELokmLIus-Q&t=16s)** — And yes, aspirin has saved a lot of lives.
- **[00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELokmLIus-Q&t=18s)** — Hundreds of thousands of people over the years have been helped by aspirin.
- **[00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELokmLIus-Q&t=22s)** — Before 2022, a lot more people were taking aspirin.
- **[00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELokmLIus-Q&t=25s)** — And I think it was recommended for everyone over the age of 60 to take a
- **[00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELokmLIus-Q&t=29s)** — aspirin every day to prevent heart attacks and stroke.
- **[00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELokmLIus-Q&t=32s)** — But then a report after 2022 said, no, not everyone should take this because
- **[00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELokmLIus-Q&t=37s)** — there's some slight minor complications like bleeding ulcers, bleeding in the
- **[00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELokmLIus-Q&t=42s)** — brain.
- **[00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELokmLIus-Q&t=42s)** — Aspirin does come with a package.
- **[00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELokmLIus-Q&t=44s)** — It can cause side effects and it's not for everyone.
- **[00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELokmLIus-Q&t=46s)** — The reason why a lot of people take aspirin to help prevent a heart
- **[00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELokmLIus-Q&t=49s)** — attack is because it thins the blood.
- **[00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELokmLIus-Q&t=51s)** — What I mean by thinning the blood is it reduces the formation of a clot.
- **[00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELokmLIus-Q&t=56s)** — 80% of all heart attacks and strokes come from a clot, not the blockage of
- **[01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELokmLIus-Q&t=64s)** — cholesterol building up and forming a plaque.
- **[01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELokmLIus-Q&t=67s)** — And just as a side note, almost 50% of heart attacks occur between 6 a.m.
- **[01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELokmLIus-Q&t=72s)** — and 12 noon.
- **[01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELokmLIus-Q&t=73s)** — And my theory about that is you have higher levels of cortisol in the
- **[01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELokmLIus-Q&t=77s)** — morning and both cortisol and adrenaline can increase clotting and
- **[01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELokmLIus-Q&t=82s)** — increase your chance of getting a heart attack or stroke.
- **[01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELokmLIus-Q&t=84s)** — This is why you have something called the broken heart syndrome, where a loss
- **[01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELokmLIus-Q&t=88s)** — of a loved one can increase your chance of getting a heart attack and a
- **[01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELokmLIus-Q&t=92s)** — stroke by like 2000%.
- **[01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELokmLIus-Q&t=94s)** — Let me simply explain what aspirin does.
- **[01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELokmLIus-Q&t=96s)** — In your blood, okay, you have these arteries, right?
- **[01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELokmLIus-Q&t=100s)** — And you have red blood cells that travel through the arteries.
- **[01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELokmLIus-Q&t=103s)** — They carry oxygen.
- **[01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELokmLIus-Q&t=105s)** — You also have white blood cells, your immune cells, but you also have
- **[01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELokmLIus-Q&t=108s)** — these little things called platelets that are attracted and respond to
- **[01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELokmLIus-Q&t=114s)** — injury.
- **[01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELokmLIus-Q&t=114s)** — In other words, if these were platelets and they're responding to an injury,
- **[01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELokmLIus-Q&t=118s)** — they would start to connect and form a clot.
- **[02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELokmLIus-Q&t=121s)** — Some people take this other drug called warfarin, which blocks vitamin K1.
- **[02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELokmLIus-Q&t=126s)** — It prevents that superglue from forming, keeping the blood thinner.
- **[02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELokmLIus-Q&t=131s)** — So you can provide a clot.
- **[02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELokmLIus-Q&t=132s)** — What else could do the same thing, but with less side effects,
- **[02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELokmLIus-Q&t=136s)** — if any side effects.
- **[02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELokmLIus-Q&t=138s)** — And before I talk about the actual food that will do this, let's talk
- **[02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELokmLIus-Q&t=141s)** — about the active ingredient in that food that does the magic of preventing
- **[02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELokmLIus-Q&t=146s)** — this clot formation.
- **[02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELokmLIus-Q&t=147s)** — And that compound is omega-3 fatty acid.
- **[02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELokmLIus-Q&t=151s)** — Now, when I say omega-3, you might think of fish oils, right?
- **[02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELokmLIus-Q&t=154s)** — And that's true.
- **[02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELokmLIus-Q&t=155s)** — It's in fish oils, but it's going to be a little more specific than just
- **[02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELokmLIus-Q&t=159s)** — fish oils in general.
- **[02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELokmLIus-Q&t=160s)** — In omega-3, you have two things.
- **[02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELokmLIus-Q&t=162s)** — You have EPA and you have DHA.
- **[02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELokmLIus-Q&t=165s)** — The real key factor is the EPA part of that omega-3 fatty acid.
- **[02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELokmLIus-Q&t=171s)** — How does it compare to aspirin, for example?
- **[02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELokmLIus-Q&t=174s)** — Well, in this study, they showed that EPA worked to decrease clotting
- **[02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELokmLIus-Q&t=178s)** — comparable to low dose aspirin.
- **[03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELokmLIus-Q&t=181s)** — EPA has the ability to stabilize vulnerable arterial placking by
- **[03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELokmLIus-Q&t=186s)** — decreasing inflammation.
- **[03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELokmLIus-Q&t=188s)** — And when you decrease inflammation, you also reduce the chance of rupture
- **[03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELokmLIus-Q&t=192s)** — and having some plaque break off and then float through your artery.
- **[03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELokmLIus-Q&t=196s)** — There's also another study.
- **[03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELokmLIus-Q&t=197s)** — 2019 patients were taking EPA, which is the omega-3 fatty acid, and they
- **[03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELokmLIus-Q&t=202s)** — had significant decrease in plaque, decrease inflammation and decrease
- **[03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELokmLIus-Q&t=206s)** — cardiovascular events by 25%.
- **[03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELokmLIus-Q&t=208s)** — What's even more interesting is EPA has another effect that goes beyond
- **[03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELokmLIus-Q&t=214s)** — anti-clotting and it has an effect on your mood.
- **[03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELokmLIus-Q&t=218s)** — It has the effect of reducing cortisol and adrenaline.
- **[03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELokmLIus-Q&t=222s)** — Remember I talked about that?
- **[03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELokmLIus-Q&t=223s)** — So we have this additional benefit, which could also prevent the
- **[03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELokmLIus-Q&t=226s)** — clotting formation.
- **[03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELokmLIus-Q&t=227s)** — How does EPA work compared to aspirin and warfarin, which are blood thinners?
- **[03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELokmLIus-Q&t=233s)** — Instead of making super glue, you'll get platelets that float around,
- **[03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELokmLIus-Q&t=237s)** — but they're not as sticky.
- **[03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELokmLIus-Q&t=238s)** — The omega-3 fatty acid EPA replaces a key ingredient.
- **[04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELokmLIus-Q&t=243s)** — So the super glue can't even be formed in the first place.
- **[04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELokmLIus-Q&t=247s)** — Why do I like that approach so much?
- **[04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELokmLIus-Q&t=249s)** — It's because there's no side effects.
- **[04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELokmLIus-Q&t=251s)** — Aspirin and warfarin have side effects, but EPA really doesn't.
- **[04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELokmLIus-Q&t=255s)** — If we look at the best food that has EPA, you do have salmon, mackerel,
- **[04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELokmLIus-Q&t=260s)** — you have any of the fatty fish.
- **[04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELokmLIus-Q&t=261s)** — You also have fish oil and all of those have plenty of EPA, but there's
- **[04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELokmLIus-Q&t=266s)** — one additional food that has some extra benefits to take this to the
- **[04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELokmLIus-Q&t=270s)** — next level and that would be cod liver oil as well as cod liver.
- **[04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELokmLIus-Q&t=275s)** — But either cod liver oil or cod liver will give you EPA, but it also
- **[04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELokmLIus-Q&t=280s)** — gives you two additional factors that can, like I said before, take
- **[04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELokmLIus-Q&t=284s)** — to the next level.
- **[04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELokmLIus-Q&t=285s)** — Vitamin A and vitamin D.
- **[04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELokmLIus-Q&t=287s)** — Vitamin A, and I'm talking about the active form called retinol.
- **[04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELokmLIus-Q&t=289s)** — It helps to repair the internal skin of the body, the sinuses,
- **[04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELokmLIus-Q&t=293s)** — the colon, the lungs, the inside of the arteries.
- **[04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELokmLIus-Q&t=296s)** — Vitamin A has potent anti-inflammatory effects.
- **[04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELokmLIus-Q&t=299s)** — It can also help decrease atherosclerotic placking in animal studies.
- **[05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELokmLIus-Q&t=303s)** — But adding vitamin D in there takes it to the next level.
- **[05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELokmLIus-Q&t=307s)** — In one study out of a thousand compounds, vitamin D was the most
- **[05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELokmLIus-Q&t=311s)** — effective to prevent damage to the internal layer of your arteries.
- **[05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELokmLIus-Q&t=317s)** — And this is why a lot of people take it for high blood pressure, because
- **[05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELokmLIus-Q&t=320s)** — it increases nitric oxide through that inside layer called the endothelial layer.
- **[05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELokmLIus-Q&t=324s)** — Vitamin D decreases the stiffness of the arteries.
- **[05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELokmLIus-Q&t=327s)** — It's a potent anti-inflammatory.
- **[05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELokmLIus-Q&t=329s)** — It helps to stabilize placking.
- **[05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELokmLIus-Q&t=330s)** — So the placking doesn't plug up an artery.
- **[05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELokmLIus-Q&t=333s)** — It also has been known to help prevent rupturing and decrease
- **[05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELokmLIus-Q&t=338s)** — arterial calcification with the help of vitamin K2.
- **[05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELokmLIus-Q&t=341s)** — So the number one best food for unclogging your arteries or
- **[05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELokmLIus-Q&t=347s)** — maintaining the health of the arteries to prevent a heart attack or stroke
- **[05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELokmLIus-Q&t=351s)** — is, colubr oil or cod liver.
- **[05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELokmLIus-Q&t=355s)** — And again, you can buy it in a can.
- **[05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELokmLIus-Q&t=356s)** — Make sure it's while caught.
- **[05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELokmLIus-Q&t=357s)** — Thanks so much for watching.
- **[05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELokmLIus-Q&t=358s)** — And I will see you in the next video.

- **[00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrnhb2-bQKY&t=0s)** — The number one remedy for a toxic liver is something that you need to know about simply because
- **[00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrnhb2-bQKY&t=5s)** — most people have toxicity in the liver and they don't even know it yet. And that is because it
- **[00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrnhb2-bQKY&t=10s)** — takes years, decades of damage to the liver before you even notice a symptom. Now some of
- **[00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrnhb2-bQKY&t=15s)** — the first signs of a liver problem are yellow eyes, yellow skin, nausea, little red dots on
- **[00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrnhb2-bQKY&t=25s)** — your skin, and just basically the lack of get up and go. So the cool thing is there is
- **[00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrnhb2-bQKY&t=29s)** — one thing that can greatly counter a lot of different toxic effects. For example, you might
- **[00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrnhb2-bQKY&t=37s)** — drink some alcohol, right? And you wake up with a hangover. This remedy will eliminate that
- **[00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrnhb2-bQKY&t=43s)** — hangover. Okay, it reduces the damage of alcohol to your liver. It also counters bad effects from
- **[00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrnhb2-bQKY&t=50s)** — smoking, right? So here you're smoking a cigarette or you get secondhand smoke. It
- **[00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrnhb2-bQKY&t=54s)** — goes into your lungs. It goes into your bloodstream. And guess where it ends up? In your
- **[00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrnhb2-bQKY&t=58s)** — liver. So this remedy can counter the damage from smoking. Let's say you have a toxic solvent
- **[01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrnhb2-bQKY&t=65s)** — that's on your skin, ends up in your bloodstream, ends up in the liver. Now this remedy can also
- **[01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrnhb2-bQKY&t=71s)** — handle other things like ibuprofen, which is a little bit different. It's not an anti-inflammatory.
- **[01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrnhb2-bQKY&t=77s)** — It's just something that gets rid of pain. It can help you with the fever. Then you have the
- **[01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrnhb2-bQKY&t=82s)** — toxicity from chemotherapy, radiation therapy, all the chemicals from your environment,
- **[01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrnhb2-bQKY&t=89s)** — including herbicides, pesticides, insecticides, fungicides. And this remedy is called NAC.
- **[01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrnhb2-bQKY&t=98s)** — I'm really glad that it's still in the market because they did take it off the market
- **[01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrnhb2-bQKY&t=101s)** — for a period of time because it's actually used as a drug. But it's a natural remedy.
- **[01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrnhb2-bQKY&t=106s)** — So what does NAC really do? Well, it does several things. Number one, it's a key nutrient to
- **[01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrnhb2-bQKY&t=112s)** — replenish something called glutathione, which is a very important antioxidant in your entire
- **[01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrnhb2-bQKY&t=119s)** — body, including the liver. Now glutathione acts as an antioxidant that helps to counter
- **[02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrnhb2-bQKY&t=126s)** — free radical damage. Now let me just kind of explain antioxidants and free radical damage.
- **[02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrnhb2-bQKY&t=131s)** — If you were to envision spinning a plate around in a circle, and you had a few weights that were
- **[02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrnhb2-bQKY&t=138s)** — balanced on each side of the plate, it could spin very symmetrically. But if you took one
- **[02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrnhb2-bQKY&t=142s)** — of the weights off and you spun it, it's no longer balanced. Just think about what that's
- **[02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrnhb2-bQKY&t=148s)** — doing. That's creating a lot of unpaired electrons, which then create a lot of
- **[02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrnhb2-bQKY&t=152s)** — destruction in the body. So the antioxidant donates an electron to give it to this free
- **[02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrnhb2-bQKY&t=161s)** — radical, to make it no longer a free radical, to balance out that plate that's spinning.
- **[02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrnhb2-bQKY&t=166s)** — Now here's the problem. The antioxidant now is lost electron. So it has to regenerate that,
- **[02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrnhb2-bQKY&t=173s)** — and it gets help from other antioxidants. And this is why you don't just have one antioxidant.
- **[02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrnhb2-bQKY&t=179s)** — Like in the liver, you have glutathione, you have vitamin E, you have vitamin C, and they all
- **[03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrnhb2-bQKY&t=185s)** — work together to help donate electrons. And one of the cool things about NAC is it helps to
- **[03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrnhb2-bQKY&t=193s)** — regenerate glutathione, which then help to regenerate other antioxidants. NAC also
- **[03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrnhb2-bQKY&t=200s)** — increases and enhances this other thing in the liver called phase one, phase two detoxification.
- **[03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrnhb2-bQKY&t=206s)** — So this phase one, phase two detoxification can take a fat soluble poison and turn it into a
- **[03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrnhb2-bQKY&t=213s)** — water soluble harmless particle. Guess what? NAC can enhance that process in the liver.
- **[03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrnhb2-bQKY&t=220s)** — NAC also helps to regenerate liver tissue. It can also help reduce or prevent the liver cells
- **[03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrnhb2-bQKY&t=227s)** — from committing suicide, which is kind of like the liver self-destructing. And especially I
- **[03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrnhb2-bQKY&t=236s)** — are consuming alcohol or smoking or exposed to any type of toxicity. Now I want to actually
- **[04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrnhb2-bQKY&t=243s)** — take this to the next level. I want to show you how to make NAC very, very potent. First
- **[04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrnhb2-bQKY&t=249s)** — thing is to always take it on an empty stomach. It's going to work better. Secondly,
- **[04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrnhb2-bQKY&t=253s)** — you want to take several doses throughout the day. NAC is even more potent if you add it with
- **[04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrnhb2-bQKY&t=262s)** — vitamin C and selenium. The last thing I want to mention about this is that when you take
- **[04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrnhb2-bQKY&t=269s)** — NAC, your next meal should be high in protein. That's going to help increase more amino acids to
- **[04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrnhb2-bQKY&t=275s)** — help this glutathione work a little bit better. And in addition to the animal protein that I
- **[04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrnhb2-bQKY&t=280s)** — would recommend, I would also recommend doing the cruciferous vegetables, right? Because it's
- **[04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrnhb2-bQKY&t=285s)** — with antioxidants. And so that way you have plenty of extra additional things that your
- **[04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrnhb2-bQKY&t=291s)** — body can draw from to actually help deliver. Now, if you have not seen my glutathione video,
- **[04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrnhb2-bQKY&t=297s)** — you might want to watch that. I put it right here. Check it out.

## Video 4: 11 Bizarre Symptoms of Vitamin D Deficiency (You NEED to Know)

**Watch on YouTube:** [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXq2ZdXXFCU](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXq2ZdXXFCU)

## Full Transcript with Timestamps

*Click any timestamp to jump to that moment in the video*

- **[00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXq2ZdXXFCU&t=0s)** — Today I'm going to give you 11 really bizarre wild vitamin D deficiency symptoms.
- **[00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXq2ZdXXFCU&t=6s)** — Now, of course, most people know the usual vitamin D symptoms.
- **[00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXq2ZdXXFCU&t=9s)** — Lower back pain, depression, high blood pressure, inflammation, autoimmune diseases, things like that.
- **[00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXq2ZdXXFCU&t=14s)** — But I will guarantee you do not know these.
- **[00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXq2ZdXXFCU&t=17s)** — Now, I'm going to break this up in two sections.
- **[00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXq2ZdXXFCU&t=19s)** — The first part of this video is for the person who wants just bare bones information.
- **[00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXq2ZdXXFCU&t=25s)** — They don't want anything too tactical.
- **[00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXq2ZdXXFCU&t=26s)** — And then the second part of the video, I'll go into those people who want the science behind it,
- **[00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXq2ZdXXFCU&t=31s)** — the mechanism behind these symptoms, and like the underlying reason why they develop in the first place.
- **[00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXq2ZdXXFCU&t=36s)** — You have about 25,000 genes in your body and 10% of those genes are greatly influenced by vitamin D.
- **[00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXq2ZdXXFCU&t=44s)** — Not to mention when you get your blood tests with vitamin D, they're only showing you the inactive vitamin D.
- **[00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXq2ZdXXFCU&t=49s)** — They're not showing you what's happening in the cells.
- **[00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXq2ZdXXFCU&t=51s)** — And so the blood levels of vitamin D do not correlate very well with the vitamin D that are in your cells.
- **[00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXq2ZdXXFCU&t=57s)** — It's an active suppression of anything positive about vitamin D in the news, in medical research,
- **[01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXq2ZdXXFCU&t=64s)** — because it directly competes with the top selling drugs.
- **[01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXq2ZdXXFCU&t=67s)** — I got up and presented this data to, you know, these were the top vitamin D researchers in the world all assembled there.
- **[01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXq2ZdXXFCU&t=74s)** — It was vicious. The attacks of how vitamin D doesn't do this. How could you say this?
- **[01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXq2ZdXXFCU&t=80s)** — I said I'm just presenting the data that we have assembled.
- **[01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXq2ZdXXFCU&t=84s)** — You're walking on guys careers that have spent their whole career doing this stuff.
- **[01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXq2ZdXXFCU&t=88s)** — They never conceived that this could be true.
- **[01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXq2ZdXXFCU&t=91s)** — So let's dive in. Okay, number one, head sweating.
- **[01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXq2ZdXXFCU&t=94s)** — Now, typically you'll see this in infants, but you can also see it in teenagers, adults.
- **[01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXq2ZdXXFCU&t=99s)** — But if you notice like a child or yourself sweating just more in the head, suspect a vitamin D deficiency.
- **[01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXq2ZdXXFCU&t=107s)** — Number two, sweating more at night, even if your temperature is cool.
- **[01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXq2ZdXXFCU&t=111s)** — Now this can also show up with your pillow being moist in the morning.
- **[01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXq2ZdXXFCU&t=116s)** — So excess sweating, especially at night, is a vitamin D deficiency.
- **[01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXq2ZdXXFCU&t=119s)** — Number three, mood swings.
- **[02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXq2ZdXXFCU&t=121s)** — A person going from a condition or emotion of happiness down to feeling irritable, down to angry.
- **[02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXq2ZdXXFCU&t=129s)** — And then they get sad because vitamin D controls the regulation of your mood.
- **[02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXq2ZdXXFCU&t=135s)** — And it heavily influences emotions.
- **[02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXq2ZdXXFCU&t=138s)** — And this has a lot to do with how vitamin D affects your brain.
- **[02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXq2ZdXXFCU&t=141s)** — But if you notice that yourself or a loved one is just like rollercoastering with these emotions,
- **[02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXq2ZdXXFCU&t=145s)** — it could be a vitamin D deficiency.
- **[02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXq2ZdXXFCU&t=146s)** — Number four, procrastination, being backlogged, and you just don't feel productive.
- **[02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXq2ZdXXFCU&t=152s)** — I mean, it's pretty wild that someone's motivation is connected to a vitamin D deficiency.
- **[02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXq2ZdXXFCU&t=157s)** — Alright, number five, panic attacks.
- **[02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXq2ZdXXFCU&t=159s)** — Now in other videos, I talk about panic attacks being a vitamin B1 deficiency.
- **[02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXq2ZdXXFCU&t=164s)** — But you also have a vitamin D connection to this as well.
- **[02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXq2ZdXXFCU&t=168s)** — A panic attack is a very severe fear or a very high anxiety condition.
- **[02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXq2ZdXXFCU&t=174s)** — And it definitely relates to certain hormones and neurotransmitters like serotonin.
- **[02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXq2ZdXXFCU&t=179s)** — But for those people out there that have panic attacks, resort to drugs,
- **[03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXq2ZdXXFCU&t=182s)** — they might want to consider trying high doses of vitamin D3.
- **[03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXq2ZdXXFCU&t=186s)** — I've done videos on certain breathing techniques that a person can do as well, like breathing through your nose.
- **[03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXq2ZdXXFCU&t=190s)** — And I will put that link down below.
- **[03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXq2ZdXXFCU&t=192s)** — But don't forget vitamin D.
- **[03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXq2ZdXXFCU&t=194s)** — Number six, achiness in your pelvis, in your lower back, in your hips, in your upper legs.
- **[03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXq2ZdXXFCU&t=202s)** — Vitamin D is intimately connected with the formation of bone.
- **[03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXq2ZdXXFCU&t=206s)** — And one symptom of that is literally pain, but not sharp pain.
- **[03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXq2ZdXXFCU&t=213s)** — This achiness that's the inside of the bone because that's where you're losing the bone on the inside.
- **[03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXq2ZdXXFCU&t=218s)** — It's sad because it's so easy to fix, but you would have to take higher amounts, not lower amounts.
- **[03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXq2ZdXXFCU&t=223s)** — I'm talking like 10,000, 20,000 at least.
- **[03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXq2ZdXXFCU&t=226s)** — If you have any concern about 20,000 IUs of vitamin D3 being toxic,
- **[03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXq2ZdXXFCU&t=231s)** — I just want to let you know that being out in the sun in the summer for 40 minutes will give you 20,000 IUs of vitamin D3.
- **[03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXq2ZdXXFCU&t=237s)** — Is that toxic? No.
- **[03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXq2ZdXXFCU&t=239s)** — 200,000 IUs of vitamin D3 taken over months.
- **[04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXq2ZdXXFCU&t=244s)** — That's when you get into the toxic effect. Not 20,000 IUs.
- **[04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXq2ZdXXFCU&t=247s)** — So then we have number seven, which is loss of muscle strength.
- **[04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXq2ZdXXFCU&t=251s)** — Vitamin D has a direct effect on calcium itself.
- **[04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXq2ZdXXFCU&t=253s)** — And without vitamin D, calcium is going to be deficient in the muscle.
- **[04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXq2ZdXXFCU&t=257s)** — Calcium allows the muscle to contract, but not only contraction, it's also involved in the production of muscle itself.
- **[04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXq2ZdXXFCU&t=264s)** — So without vitamin D and calcium, you cannot create muscles.
- **[04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXq2ZdXXFCU&t=268s)** — And we also get this weakness within muscles that control power and strength, primarily your legs and your shoulders.
- **[04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXq2ZdXXFCU&t=275s)** — And on top of that, vitamin D also controls and regulates pain.
- **[04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXq2ZdXXFCU&t=280s)** — Number eight, stiffness. And the stiffness usually occurs in the knees and in the fingers.
- **[04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXq2ZdXXFCU&t=286s)** — And of course, this definitely relates to inflammation, but it also has to do with what vitamin D does to your cartilage and your collagen.
- **[04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXq2ZdXXFCU&t=295s)** — So you might find that when you stretch backwards and create tension on the cartilage in your breastbone, you might feel stiffness in that area as well.
- **[05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXq2ZdXXFCU&t=304s)** — And that can also affect breathing, things like that.
- **[05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXq2ZdXXFCU&t=308s)** — Number nine, chronic fatigue. This has a lot to do with those little energy factories in your cell.
- **[05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXq2ZdXXFCU&t=315s)** — They're called mitochondria. And how important vitamin D is to support that little factory.
- **[05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXq2ZdXXFCU&t=322s)** — And if you don't have enough vitamin D, you just can't make energy.
- **[05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXq2ZdXXFCU&t=325s)** — Number ten, your ability to think quickly is diminished.
- **[05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXq2ZdXXFCU&t=330s)** — Basically, you have too many applications open on your desktop computer, but related to your brain.
- **[05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXq2ZdXXFCU&t=334s)** — And number eleven, it's just very difficult to be satisfied.
- **[05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXq2ZdXXFCU&t=337s)** — When you eat a meal, it could be that the food is just nutritionally empty and you keep eating to get these nutrients.
- **[05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXq2ZdXXFCU&t=345s)** — It can also be certain things in the food that cause you to be addicted.
- **[05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXq2ZdXXFCU&t=349s)** — But if you're low in vitamin D, you're just not going to feel satisfied.
- **[05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXq2ZdXXFCU&t=353s)** — You will definitely have a tendency to overeat.
- **[05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXq2ZdXXFCU&t=355s)** — So now that you know the general information, let me just kind of give you another layer of this data on each point, which is actually very interesting.
- **[06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXq2ZdXXFCU&t=363s)** — Okay, number one was head sweating.
- **[06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXq2ZdXXFCU&t=364s)** — There's something different about the head versus the rest of the body as far as certain sweat glands.
- **[06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXq2ZdXXFCU&t=370s)** — We have a lot more sweat glands in our head than other parts of our body.
- **[06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXq2ZdXXFCU&t=374s)** — It affects the autonomic nervous system, causing this excess sweating in the head.
- **[06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXq2ZdXXFCU&t=378s)** — Now, this also relates to number two when we talked about night sweats.
- **[06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXq2ZdXXFCU&t=381s)** — But there's something else going on with night sweats.
- **[06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXq2ZdXXFCU&t=383s)** — Vitamin D suppresses an overactive immune system.
- **[06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXq2ZdXXFCU&t=387s)** — And just think about the immune system of all the things that happen.
- **[06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXq2ZdXXFCU&t=389s)** — One would be like a fever, right? That's a normal response.
- **[06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXq2ZdXXFCU&t=393s)** — And so when you're deficient in vitamin D and you have a slightly overreactive immune system,
- **[06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXq2ZdXXFCU&t=399s)** — this whole mechanism of sweating is controlled by this little tiny computer chip in your brain called the hypothalamus.
- **[06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXq2ZdXXFCU&t=405s)** — And when you have a vitamin D deficiency in this overreactive immune system,
- **[06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXq2ZdXXFCU&t=408s)** — it's going to trigger excess sweating to compensate for this immune imbalance situation.
- **[06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXq2ZdXXFCU&t=413s)** — And one aspect of this is a fever.
- **[06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXq2ZdXXFCU&t=415s)** — Your body is generating more heat, and with that comes more sweat to compensate.
- **[07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXq2ZdXXFCU&t=420s)** — All coming from a vitamin D deficiency.
- **[07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXq2ZdXXFCU&t=421s)** — Alright, number three is a mood swing.
- **[07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXq2ZdXXFCU&t=423s)** — Now when we kind of come up and down on this emotional roller coaster,
- **[07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXq2ZdXXFCU&t=426s)** — you have your adrenals involved.
- **[07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXq2ZdXXFCU&t=428s)** — Now the adrenal gland, starting with the hypothalamus, pituitary, and adrenal is on this HPA axis,
- **[07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXq2ZdXXFCU&t=434s)** — this circuit thing going on.
- **[07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXq2ZdXXFCU&t=436s)** — But when you're vitamin D deficient, cortisol is going to go up.
- **[07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXq2ZdXXFCU&t=440s)** — Now, I don't know if this is just because it's trying to help you get rid of inflammation.
- **[07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXq2ZdXXFCU&t=444s)** — I don't know about that.
- **[07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXq2ZdXXFCU&t=445s)** — But with a vitamin D deficiency, you're going to have a dysregulation of this cortisol pattern.
- **[07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXq2ZdXXFCU&t=449s)** — And if you have too much cortisol, it's going to put you more in a different emotional state.
- **[07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXq2ZdXXFCU&t=456s)** — Let's go to number four, which is low motivation to do.
- **[07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXq2ZdXXFCU&t=459s)** — In the brain, there is this little center.
- **[07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXq2ZdXXFCU&t=461s)** — It's a tiny little nerve bundle.
- **[07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXq2ZdXXFCU&t=465s)** — It's quite fascinating.
- **[07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXq2ZdXXFCU&t=466s)** — It's called the nucleus accumbens.
- **[07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXq2ZdXXFCU&t=468s)** — And this is the heart of a lot of things, including addictions.
- **[07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXq2ZdXXFCU&t=474s)** — It kind of runs on dopamine.
- **[07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXq2ZdXXFCU&t=475s)** — And yes, dopamine is involved in addictions, but it's also a neurotransmitter that's involved with
- **[08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXq2ZdXXFCU&t=481s)** — motivation, reward, doing things, getting things done, that type of thing.
- **[08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXq2ZdXXFCU&t=487s)** — All right, number five, panic attacks, a high level anxiety, a very strong fear.
- **[08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXq2ZdXXFCU&t=494s)** — Panic attacks from a physical standpoint in the body are related to that structure I talked
- **[08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXq2ZdXXFCU&t=499s)** — about in the brain called the amygdala.
- **[08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXq2ZdXXFCU&t=502s)** — That's more like an adrenal in the brain.
- **[08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXq2ZdXXFCU&t=504s)** — It regulates fear.
- **[08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXq2ZdXXFCU&t=506s)** — That needs vitamin D.
- **[08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXq2ZdXXFCU&t=507s)** — We have several things going on.
- **[08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXq2ZdXXFCU&t=509s)** — We have serotonin, which is kind of like a happy hormone.
- **[08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXq2ZdXXFCU&t=513s)** — And so vitamin D is necessary to balance these two things.
- **[08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXq2ZdXXFCU&t=516s)** — All right, number six, achiness in the pelvis area, in the lower back,
- **[08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXq2ZdXXFCU&t=520s)** — in the upper thigh muscle.
- **[08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXq2ZdXXFCU&t=522s)** — Now this relates to a condition called osteomalacia.
- **[08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXq2ZdXXFCU&t=526s)** — Now what is osteomalacia?
- **[08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXq2ZdXXFCU&t=528s)** — That's a severe vitamin D deficiency that's affecting the calcium in the bone.
- **[08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXq2ZdXXFCU&t=531s)** — Now think about this.
- **[08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXq2ZdXXFCU&t=532s)** — Vitamin D deficiency is the number one cause of osteomalacia.
- **[08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXq2ZdXXFCU&t=536s)** — This is basically where the bones become very soft.
- **[08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXq2ZdXXFCU&t=539s)** — I think this is going on in a massive scale in society right now,
- **[09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXq2ZdXXFCU&t=543s)** — but they have a subclinical version of osteomalacia.
- **[09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXq2ZdXXFCU&t=546s)** — I think I had it in high school because I was eating poorly and I know I had a
- **[09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXq2ZdXXFCU&t=551s)** — vitamin D deficiency and I started getting fractures.
- **[09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXq2ZdXXFCU&t=554s)** — But the bones are soft, certain proteins that are just not developing as well.
- **[09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXq2ZdXXFCU&t=558s)** — You have to realize that vitamin D controls calcium absorption by 20 times in the small intestine.
- **[09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXq2ZdXXFCU&t=565s)** — And in other videos, I talk about the two systems of vitamin D.
- **[09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXq2ZdXXFCU&t=568s)** — You have the one that controls calcium and the other system that is non-calcium.
- **[09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXq2ZdXXFCU&t=573s)** — Yes, you can check the vitamin D in the blood.
- **[09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXq2ZdXXFCU&t=575s)** — If you tested that, chances are that it's going to be pretty low.
- **[09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXq2ZdXXFCU&t=578s)** — It's probably going to be 30 or less.
- **[09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXq2ZdXXFCU&t=580s)** — In which case you just need to start taking vitamin D3.
- **[09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXq2ZdXXFCU&t=583s)** — And I would take a lot of it.
- **[09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXq2ZdXXFCU&t=584s)** — I would take at least 10,000 to 20,000.
- **[09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXq2ZdXXFCU&t=589s)** — Until you can get your levels a little bit higher.
- **[09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXq2ZdXXFCU&t=591s)** — For this bone problem, you could probably get away with taking it sporadically like once a week.
- **[09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXq2ZdXXFCU&t=597s)** — If you want to do that. But I wouldn't do that if you had the problem.
- **[10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXq2ZdXXFCU&t=600s)** — So that's number six. Let's go to number seven.
- **[10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXq2ZdXXFCU&t=602s)** — Loss of muscle strength. Why?
- **[10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXq2ZdXXFCU&t=604s)** — Because vitamin D controls calcium and calcium controls the contraction of the muscle.
- **[10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXq2ZdXXFCU&t=611s)** — If you're missing calcium because you don't have enough vitamin D and you can't contract,
- **[10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXq2ZdXXFCU&t=617s)** — what's going to happen with that muscle?
- **[10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXq2ZdXXFCU&t=618s)** — Pain that's kind of all over. It's hard to pinpoint. It's just achy.
- **[10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXq2ZdXXFCU&t=622s)** — Alright, number eight is stiffness.
- **[10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXq2ZdXXFCU&t=624s)** — Mainly in the knees and the finger joints because the cartilage needs vitamin D and it's
- **[10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXq2ZdXXFCU&t=630s)** — not getting vitamin D. So it's going to be more inflamed.
- **[10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXq2ZdXXFCU&t=633s)** — And the weight bearing joints on your knees could be the hips as well.
- **[10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXq2ZdXXFCU&t=637s)** — But also if you use the computer a lot or your fingers, you're going to notice in the
- **[10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXq2ZdXXFCU&t=641s)** — fingers. This can definitely lead to osteoarthritis.
- **[10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXq2ZdXXFCU&t=644s)** — This is a lack of vitamin D.
- **[10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXq2ZdXXFCU&t=646s)** — Vitamin D is essential for maintaining this cartilage and maintaining the ligaments and
- **[10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXq2ZdXXFCU&t=652s)** — the tendons. And think about this.
- **[10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXq2ZdXXFCU&t=654s)** — Your ribs attached to the sternum with cartilage.
- **[10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXq2ZdXXFCU&t=657s)** — So you're going to notice it right through here too.
- **[11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXq2ZdXXFCU&t=660s)** — And so this is why stretching is so important to really keep this rib cage opened up.
- **[11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXq2ZdXXFCU&t=667s)** — Because it'll tend to be contracted, inflamed and pull you forward down here.
- **[11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXq2ZdXXFCU&t=671s)** — So you end up having bad posture and kind of a hunchback.
- **[11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXq2ZdXXFCU&t=674s)** — And not just take vitamin D, but they need to do a lot of stretching to reverse that.
- **[11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXq2ZdXXFCU&t=679s)** — All right, number nine, chronic fatigue syndrome.
- **[11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXq2ZdXXFCU&t=682s)** — There's two different reasons for chronic fatigue syndrome.
- **[11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXq2ZdXXFCU&t=685s)** — One is that your vitamin D controls the number of mitochondria that are produced.
- **[11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXq2ZdXXFCU&t=690s)** — The mitochondria are the energy factory.
- **[11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXq2ZdXXFCU&t=692s)** — So you're going to have less mitochondria.
- **[11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXq2ZdXXFCU&t=693s)** — It's less energy.
- **[11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXq2ZdXXFCU&t=694s)** — So without vitamin D, you're going to have dysfunctional mitochondria.
- **[11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXq2ZdXXFCU&t=697s)** — But the second reason for chronic fatigue syndrome is the immune connection.
- **[11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXq2ZdXXFCU&t=702s)** — If you are low in vitamin D, certain viruses will come out of remission and be active.
- **[11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXq2ZdXXFCU&t=709s)** — These viruses, especially the Epstein-Barr virus, will start to come out of remission and be
- **[11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXq2ZdXXFCU&t=714s)** — active. One of the symptoms that they produce is fatigue.
- **[11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXq2ZdXXFCU&t=718s)** — So it's not like you have this full-blown infection.
- **[12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXq2ZdXXFCU&t=721s)** — Now you get certain aspects of that infection, like chronic fatigue.
- **[12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXq2ZdXXFCU&t=725s)** — Nearly 100% of the people that have this reactivation of this Epstein-Barr virus
- **[12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXq2ZdXXFCU&t=730s)** — or chronic fatigue syndrome, it came after a severe loss.
- **[12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXq2ZdXXFCU&t=734s)** — Loss of a loved one or loss of a job or something like that.
- **[12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXq2ZdXXFCU&t=737s)** — But also it could be a vitamin D deficiency.
- **[12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXq2ZdXXFCU&t=740s)** — Which by the way, if you have vitamin D deficiency and you go through a loss,
- **[12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXq2ZdXXFCU&t=743s)** — boy, that stress is going to hit you a lot harder.
- **[12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXq2ZdXXFCU&t=746s)** — You just need a lot of vitamin D.
- **[12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXq2ZdXXFCU&t=747s)** — I would take 50,000. I use a vitamin D3 every single day
- **[12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXq2ZdXXFCU&t=751s)** — to pull yourself out of chronic fatigue syndrome.
- **[12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXq2ZdXXFCU&t=754s)** — Alright, number 10.
- **[12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXq2ZdXXFCU&t=756s)** — Mental sluggishness or slowness with decisions.
- **[12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXq2ZdXXFCU&t=758s)** — Thinking, focus is distracted.
- **[12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXq2ZdXXFCU&t=761s)** — Vitamin D has a profound effect in the front part of the brain,
- **[12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXq2ZdXXFCU&t=764s)** — which kind of our relay system.
- **[12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXq2ZdXXFCU&t=766s)** — And even communication between one neuron and the next needs vitamin D3.
- **[12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXq2ZdXXFCU&t=773s)** — And then we get to the last one. Feeling satisfied.
- **[12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXq2ZdXXFCU&t=775s)** — So leptin tells the brain that you're full.
- **[12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXq2ZdXXFCU&t=778s)** — If you don't have enough vitamin D, it's not going to work that well.
- **[13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXq2ZdXXFCU&t=781s)** — Vitamin D helps make leptin work better.
- **[13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXq2ZdXXFCU&t=784s)** — Then we also have insulin.
- **[13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXq2ZdXXFCU&t=785s)** — If you don't have enough vitamin D, insulin doesn't work as well.
- **[13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXq2ZdXXFCU&t=789s)** — And you're going to be hungry.
- **[13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXq2ZdXXFCU&t=791s)** — Insulin allows all the nutrition to go into the cells.
- **[13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXq2ZdXXFCU&t=793s)** — So if you have insulin resistance, because you're low in vitamin D,
- **[13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXq2ZdXXFCU&t=797s)** — you're not going to be satisfied.
- **[13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXq2ZdXXFCU&t=798s)** — So just by taking vitamin D, insulin becomes more sensitive
- **[13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXq2ZdXXFCU&t=801s)** — and you start getting more fuel to the cells.
- **[13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXq2ZdXXFCU&t=803s)** — You get more nutrients in the cells.
- **[13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXq2ZdXXFCU&t=805s)** — I hope this helped you to understand these bizarre,
- **[13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXq2ZdXXFCU&t=807s)** — unusual symptoms of vitamin D deficiency.
- **[13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXq2ZdXXFCU&t=810s)** — Start taking vitamin D. Make sure you also take magnesium,
- **[13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXq2ZdXXFCU&t=813s)** — vitamin K2, zinc, and B6 as the cofactors to prevent any issues
- **[13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXq2ZdXXFCU&t=819s)** — and just to help it work better.
- **[13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXq2ZdXXFCU&t=820s)** — Thanks for watching and I will see you in the next video.

- **[00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtBElcAs6H0&t=0s)** — Today we are going to talk about the 14 bad habits that can potentially ruin your heart.
- **[00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtBElcAs6H0&t=5s)** — Let's get to number one. Believing everything you read on labels. Let's start off with this one
- **[00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtBElcAs6H0&t=10s)** — right here. Corn oil. How can this be heart healthy? What in here helps your heart? This is
- **[00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtBElcAs6H0&t=15s)** — industrial processed seed oil that has been highly refined. And apparently this stays on
- **[00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtBElcAs6H0&t=20s)** — the shelf for a long time. Do you realize that an average person consumes eight of these
- **[00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtBElcAs6H0&t=25s)** — every year? That's like between 25 and 30 percent of our calories. This is a gallon. And this is
- **[00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtBElcAs6H0&t=32s)** — supposed to be healthy for our heart. Here's another one that's healthy for your heart.
- **[00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtBElcAs6H0&t=35s)** — Instant oatmeal. You're talking a lot of sugar in here. And it said heart healthy. And here we
- **[00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtBElcAs6H0&t=40s)** — have another one. Honey and nut Cheerios. Just different combinations of ingredients,
- **[00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtBElcAs6H0&t=45s)** — including sugar. I like this. Grandma makes my heart happy. That's good marketing. Both seed
- **[00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtBElcAs6H0&t=54s)** — whole grains are high in omega-6. And omega-6 is pro-inflammatory. It creates inflammation. And on
- **[01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtBElcAs6H0&t=61s)** — top of that, they're going to add all this extra sugar and refined starches. I highly doubt it's
- **[01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtBElcAs6H0&t=66s)** — going to lower your cholesterol. In fact, it may just increase your cholesterol. But I think
- **[01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtBElcAs6H0&t=70s)** — you should personally just consume it and then retest your cholesterol and see what it really
- **[01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtBElcAs6H0&t=74s)** — does. All right. Number two. Stay out of the sun. Use suntan lotion. Sun can cause cancer.
- **[01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtBElcAs6H0&t=80s)** — Well, this is going to reduce our vitamin D, thereby increasing our risk for heart attacks
- **[01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtBElcAs6H0&t=86s)** — by roughly 32% based on a study that I'm going to put down below. In fact, one of the best
- **[01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtBElcAs6H0&t=92s)** — remedies for high blood pressure is vitamin D. So avoiding the sun is not a good idea.
- **[01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtBElcAs6H0&t=96s)** — Let's get to number three. Excessive sitting or a sedentary lifestyle. There's a fascinating
- **[01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtBElcAs6H0&t=102s)** — study that shows an increased risk of heart disease by 147%. And not only heart attacks,
- **[01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtBElcAs6H0&t=110s)** — but strokes as well. Now, if we compare sedentary people versus people that exercise,
- **[01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtBElcAs6H0&t=115s)** — sedentary people have an increased risk of dying from a heart attack by over 50%.
- **[02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtBElcAs6H0&t=120s)** — Exercise improves your fitness. That's that extra buffer, that extra resource to help you
- **[02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtBElcAs6H0&t=126s)** — cope with stress and live longer. Number four. The overuse of certain medications. Sometimes
- **[02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtBElcAs6H0&t=131s)** — we normalize medications. It's normal to be on medications over the age of 50. We don't tend to
- **[02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtBElcAs6H0&t=138s)** — look at the side effects as much because everyone's on medication and your doctor told you
- **[02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtBElcAs6H0&t=142s)** — to take medication, so it must be fine. But even over-the-counter medications can increase
- **[02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtBElcAs6H0&t=147s)** — your risk of getting heart attacks by over 50%. I mean, there's so many medications that
- **[02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtBElcAs6H0&t=151s)** — stress the heart. Chemotherapy will definitely increase the risk of getting a heart attack,
- **[02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtBElcAs6H0&t=155s)** — especially HRT, hormonal placement therapy can increase the risk of getting heart attack
- **[02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtBElcAs6H0&t=159s)** — by 29%. So work with a doctor that's open to using alternative forms of remedies for various
- **[02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtBElcAs6H0&t=167s)** — conditions. Number five. Snacks, especially the late night snacks, especially if they're
- **[02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtBElcAs6H0&t=172s)** — carbohydrate snacks. I used to do this on a regular basis. I loved chips. I would do
- **[02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtBElcAs6H0&t=178s)** — ice cream. And that snack before bed ruined your ability to burn any fat through the night.
- **[03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtBElcAs6H0&t=184s)** — You burn most of the fat when you're sleeping if you don't eat anything, but that doesn't
- **[03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtBElcAs6H0&t=188s)** — happen if you eat something before you go to bed, especially if it's carbs. Also, growth hormone
- **[03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtBElcAs6H0&t=194s)** — spikes mostly at night. So growth hormone is the anti-aging hormone. It helps burn fat
- **[03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtBElcAs6H0&t=200s)** — and it'll be nullified when you eat these carbs before bed, unfortunately. So don't eat
- **[03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtBElcAs6H0&t=205s)** — any snacks between the meals and especially after dinner. Number six. Drinking a lot of
- **[03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtBElcAs6H0&t=211s)** — water, but also at the same time being on a low salt diet. What you're doing is you're
- **[03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtBElcAs6H0&t=218s)** — developing a condition called electrolyte called sodium. What might happen is you might develop a
- **[03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtBElcAs6H0&t=222s)** — condition called hyponatremia, which is low sodium in the blood. Hyponatremia actually can
- **[03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtBElcAs6H0&t=228s)** — cause a heart attack, swelling in the brain, and all sorts of side effects. All the water is
- **[03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtBElcAs6H0&t=234s)** — going to create a lot of pressure on the kidneys and the heart because your body has to
- **[03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtBElcAs6H0&t=238s)** — get rid of the water. And then you end up being dehydrated because you don't have the salt
- **[04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtBElcAs6H0&t=242s)** — to retain that fluid. The thing to do if you're salt sensitive is not to necessarily
- **[04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtBElcAs6H0&t=247s)** — decrease sodium, but to increase potassium. Potassium will protect you against any dangers of
- **[04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtBElcAs6H0&t=254s)** — sodium. All right, number seven. Ignoring dental care. Believe it or not, in certain studies where
- **[04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtBElcAs6H0&t=259s)** — they dissect the plaque in the arteries, they have found in that plaque dental bacteria. Now,
- **[04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtBElcAs6H0&t=265s)** — what is this bacteria from your mouth doing in your arteries? Well, there's something called
- **[04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtBElcAs6H0&t=270s)** — gum disease. We can develop infections underneath the teeth, especially if you had a root canal
- **[04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtBElcAs6H0&t=275s)** — and there's a lot of lymphatic tissue down there. And then that can leak into the lymphatic system,
- **[04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtBElcAs6H0&t=280s)** — get into the blood supply, and it can circulate throughout the body. The last thing you want to
- **[04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtBElcAs6H0&t=284s)** — do is create an infection underneath the tooth that's very, very difficult to identify. These
- **[04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtBElcAs6H0&t=289s)** — infections underneath the teeth can actually eat up your bone. And you have to do a special
- **[04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtBElcAs6H0&t=294s)** — 3D x-ray to identify necrosis of the bone. All coming from an infection. Number eight.
- **[05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtBElcAs6H0&t=301s)** — Mouth breathing. That's a bad habit. And I'm talking mainly when you're sleeping. You should
- **[05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtBElcAs6H0&t=305s)** — really practice breathing through your nose. Now, why is this so important? There's a physical
- **[05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtBElcAs6H0&t=310s)** — phenomena that's called the Bohr phenomena, where you're breathing in oxygen, okay? But that
- **[05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtBElcAs6H0&t=315s)** — oxygen that goes into the red blood cell cannot be released unless you have a certain amount of
- **[05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtBElcAs6H0&t=321s)** — CO2. So this is why when you hyperventilate and you get all this oxygen and you go into
- **[05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtBElcAs6H0&t=326s)** — panic attack, breathe into a paper bag. Why? So you can get more CO2 to allow the oxygen to
- **[05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtBElcAs6H0&t=333s)** — go into the tissues. So by nose breathing, you're actually adding more CO2. It might feel
- **[05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtBElcAs6H0&t=339s)** — like you're getting less oxygen, but you're actually getting more oxygen when you breathe
- **[05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtBElcAs6H0&t=344s)** — your nose because you're mixing more CO2. Some people get this little tape that you can
- **[05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtBElcAs6H0&t=349s)** — put on your mouth. That's available too. But nose breathing can greatly enhance your ability
- **[05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtBElcAs6H0&t=354s)** — to sleep. It can help with sleep apnea. It can also help with snoring. Number nine, microplastics.
- **[06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtBElcAs6H0&t=362s)** — Now, you can be exposed to a lot of microplastics from many different sources. Consuming water and
- **[06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtBElcAs6H0&t=366s)** — plastic bottles that are especially heated. Plastic chemicals in the inside of certain cans.
- **[06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtBElcAs6H0&t=371s)** — They're now finding that an average person has a lot of these microplastics, very tiny
- **[06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtBElcAs6H0&t=376s)** — pieces of plastic in their blood. Where is all this plastic coming from? Well, it's coming
- **[06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtBElcAs6H0&t=382s)** — in our food supply because a lot of the plastics get into the soil. There's a lot of microplastics
- **[06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtBElcAs6H0&t=386s)** — in the ocean, but a lot of these plastics don't get filtered out, unfortunately. Number 10,
- **[06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtBElcAs6H0&t=391s)** — feeling out of breath very easily when you start to exercise. Let's say you've been
- **[06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtBElcAs6H0&t=396s)** — exercising for a while and you're exerting yourself and you get out of breath super easy.
- **[06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtBElcAs6H0&t=401s)** — You have an intolerance for exercise. This is a classic sign of congestive heart failure.
- **[06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtBElcAs6H0&t=406s)** — There's something wrong with the heart that you need to evaluate. Don't ignore that. All
- **[06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtBElcAs6H0&t=411s)** — right. Number 11, jet lag, which greatly affects your sleep cycles. Also, a lot of people, when
- **[06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtBElcAs6H0&t=417s)** — they fly, their ankles or their body starts filling up with fluid. So they start getting
- **[07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtBElcAs6H0&t=422s)** — fluid retention and they get this huge expansion on their feet. And so if you do fly frequently,
- **[07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtBElcAs6H0&t=427s)** — what you should do is you should be taking niacin. Niacin helps to support the mitochondria.
- **[07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtBElcAs6H0&t=433s)** — It's a very, very important nutrient. It's vitamin B3. I would recommend taking about 250
- **[07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtBElcAs6H0&t=437s)** — milligrams every day, at least. Make sure you take the one that creates the flushing. Sometimes
- **[07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtBElcAs6H0&t=443s)** — you have to start with a smaller amount and gradually increase it. Another thing to take
- **[07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtBElcAs6H0&t=448s)** — with jet lag is higher doses of vitamin D3. About 20,000 IUs of vitamin D3. Before you
- **[07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtBElcAs6H0&t=455s)** — started flying, you would find the jet lag being a lot less because vitamin D3 helps to
- **[07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtBElcAs6H0&t=462s)** — the circadian rhythm regulation. Number 12, excessive cardio without enough rest.
- **[07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtBElcAs6H0&t=469s)** — When you exercise, a type of exercise that's really hard on the body is this sustained
- **[07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtBElcAs6H0&t=474s)** — pulse rate exercise. You are just bringing the pulse rate up and you're sustaining it
- **[07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtBElcAs6H0&t=479s)** — over a period of time. The point is that it can create extra stress on the heart. This is
- **[08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtBElcAs6H0&t=483s)** — why you see a lot of these runners who look like they're in shape. They have problems in
- **[08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtBElcAs6H0&t=488s)** — And so if you are a runner, it's called the CAC test. It stands for coronary artery calcification
- **[08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtBElcAs6H0&t=493s)** — score. It's not that expensive. It's very valuable in predicting your overall mortality.
- **[08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtBElcAs6H0&t=498s)** — Number 13, secondhand smoke. The secondhand smoke can also be a problem because you're
- **[08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtBElcAs6H0&t=503s)** — not usually, you know, you don't have a filter in your mouth. You're just getting it.
- **[08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtBElcAs6H0&t=507s)** — That can actually increase your risk of getting a heart attack by 25 to 30 percent. And this
- **[08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtBElcAs6H0&t=512s)** — is probably because it decreases oxygen into the body. Not to mention all the chemicals. There's
- **[08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtBElcAs6H0&t=519s)** — 7,000 different chemicals when you smoke and 70 of them are carcinogenic. So avoid secondhand
- **[08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtBElcAs6H0&t=527s)** — smoke and also firsthand smoke. Number 14, refined foods. Out of all the nutrients
- **[08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtBElcAs6H0&t=532s)** — that are super important for the heart, magnesium is at the top of the list because
- **[08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtBElcAs6H0&t=538s)** — number one, most people are not getting enough magnesium from their diet and they're eating
- **[09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtBElcAs6H0&t=543s)** — depleting magnesium and it's virtually impossible to test accurately your magnesium levels. You
- **[09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtBElcAs6H0&t=550s)** — can't rely on the blood test. Like 99 percent of your magnesium is not in the blood. Most of it
- **[09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtBElcAs6H0&t=555s)** — is inside the cell. Magnesium is involved in 300 different enzymes, especially in helping you
- **[09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtBElcAs6H0&t=560s)** — sleep, lowering your risk for cramping, as well as decreasing your risk for arrhythmias
- **[09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtBElcAs6H0&t=566s)** — and also preventing calcium building up in the heart. One really simple way to lower blood
- **[09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtBElcAs6H0&t=571s)** — pressure is to take not just vitamin D3 but magnesium with it. Good habits you should also
- **[09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtBElcAs6H0&t=576s)** — add to this. Cold showers or even cold immersion produces so many positive changes. Watching
- **[09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtBElcAs6H0&t=583s)** — comedies, laughing more, all these things are super important in lowering stress and improving
- **[09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtBElcAs6H0&t=589s)** — sleep. Now since we're on the topic of cardiovascular function, if you have not seen
- **[09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtBElcAs6H0&t=593s)** — this video on heart health you should check it out. I put it up right here.

- **[00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mecanOOf0SY&t=0s)** — I'm going to cover the 16 signs that your body needs more nutrition. Now the problem is when I
- **[00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mecanOOf0SY&t=5s)** — teach you this information, you're probably going to want to evaluate your friends and family and
- **[00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mecanOOf0SY&t=9s)** — neighbors. If you do that, don't mention my name. Sometimes it offends people if you're talking
- **[00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mecanOOf0SY&t=14s)** — about certain, I don't know, skin problems they have on their nose or something like that. So
- **[00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mecanOOf0SY&t=20s)** — we're going to dive through all 16, but you need to kind of know first of all why people
- **[00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mecanOOf0SY&t=23s)** — are deficient. It could be because you're just not eating nutrient-dense foods or you're eating
- **[00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mecanOOf0SY&t=28s)** — foods that are grown on soils that don't have the right nutrition or even like grown in water,
- **[00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mecanOOf0SY&t=33s)** — like hydroponic. You can also be deficient if you have genetic weaknesses or if you have low
- **[00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mecanOOf0SY&t=39s)** — stomach acid and you can't break down certain things like proteins and you can't extract
- **[00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mecanOOf0SY&t=44s)** — minerals or let's say for example you don't have a gallbladder or you have a gallbladder
- **[00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mecanOOf0SY&t=48s)** — problem, you're not going to be able to absorb vitamin A, D, E, and K. All right,
- **[00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mecanOOf0SY&t=54s)** — we go. Let's dive right in. Number one, brittle nails. This usually means low protein and this
- **[01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mecanOOf0SY&t=62s)** — is common in horses because a horse will keep eating until it gets enough protein and sometimes
- **[01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mecanOOf0SY&t=67s)** — if there's too much carbohydrate in the grass like in the spring, they'll end up eating too
- **[01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mecanOOf0SY&t=72s)** — much just because they're trying to get enough protein. In the process, they get too many
- **[01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mecanOOf0SY&t=76s)** — carbs and this is really common in humans. We keep eating until we get enough protein and
- **[01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mecanOOf0SY&t=81s)** — if you're eating a bag of chips, for example, it has no protein, it's very easy to down many
- **[01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mecanOOf0SY&t=86s)** — bags of chips because we constantly are trying to fulfill this protein requirement. All right,
- **[01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mecanOOf0SY&t=91s)** — number two, blue sclera. And what's happening is you are iron deficient, anemic. The whites
- **[01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mecanOOf0SY&t=99s)** — of your eyes are starting to turn blue and you're seeing this transparent collagen which
- **[01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mecanOOf0SY&t=105s)** — allows us to see the venous part of your blood which is blue. All right, if you have
- **[01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mecanOOf0SY&t=110s)** — pain in the tip of your scapula on the right side, that means you are deficient in bile from
- **[01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mecanOOf0SY&t=117s)** — the gallbladder. And if you're deficient in bile, you'll tend to develop gallstones. All right,
- **[02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mecanOOf0SY&t=124s)** — the next one is tetany. It's that little twitch that just kind of twitches underneath
- **[02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mecanOOf0SY&t=127s)** — the left eye or could be an arm. What that is is a magnesium deficiency. Magnesium regulates
- **[02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mecanOOf0SY&t=134s)** — this amount of calcium. And so now we don't have the normal contraction and relaxation going on
- **[02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mecanOOf0SY&t=141s)** — because the lack of magnesium accelerates the nerve impulses. So you get this like this extra
- **[02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mecanOOf0SY&t=147s)** — twitching thing that goes on in your body. Next one, flaky scaly skin. That is a classic
- **[02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mecanOOf0SY&t=154s)** — omega-3 deficiency. It also could mean you're consuming too much of the omega-6 because they
- **[02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mecanOOf0SY&t=162s)** — as in too much soy oil or corn oil or canola or cottonseed oil or safflower oil or sunflower oil.
- **[02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mecanOOf0SY&t=170s)** — Instead you want to have more like fish oil especially like cod liver oil. Next one is high
- **[02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mecanOOf0SY&t=175s)** — blood pressure. The first deficiency that I would look at is a potassium deficiency.
- **[03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mecanOOf0SY&t=183s)** — Potassium supports the tone of the arteries. It helps keep the arteries softened and it
- **[03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mecanOOf0SY&t=190s)** — also helps reduce adrenaline and reduce the sympathetic nervous system that fight or flight
- **[03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mecanOOf0SY&t=196s)** — mechanism that keeps your blood pressure high. Also potassium helps regulate the fluids
- **[03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mecanOOf0SY&t=203s)** — especially balancing out sodium. Alright next one is excessive worry. This is a classic
- **[03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mecanOOf0SY&t=212s)** — B1 deficiency. If you took some B1 you would feel really calm and you wouldn't worry as
- **[03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mecanOOf0SY&t=218s)** — even though there's something to worry about your worrying is going to be a lot less. Alright next
- **[03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mecanOOf0SY&t=224s)** — one is hyperthyroidism. The deficiency for this one is boron. Now if you were going to take
- **[03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mecanOOf0SY&t=229s)** — boron I would recommend you also take it with all of the trace minerals at the same time so
- **[03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mecanOOf0SY&t=235s)** — that way you don't knock out another trace mineral because they all tend to work together.
- **[03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mecanOOf0SY&t=239s)** — But boron is good for a lot of different things. It's actually in borax like laundry
- **[04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mecanOOf0SY&t=244s)** — but boron is also important for your bone health. It helps increase magnesium absorption
- **[04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mecanOOf0SY&t=250s)** — and it can also reduce inflammation but it's also good for someone who has a hyper
- **[04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mecanOOf0SY&t=256s)** — thyroid problem. Alright next one is hypothyroidism. The key trace mineral for this
- **[04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mecanOOf0SY&t=263s)** — that's usually deficient is something called selenium. Selenium allows the conversion from
- **[04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mecanOOf0SY&t=268s)** — T4 to the T3 the active form of the thyroid hormone. So when you think about Hashimoto's
- **[04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mecanOOf0SY&t=275s)** — think selenium. Next one is hip clicking or joint clicking. If you're getting this
- **[04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mecanOOf0SY&t=281s)** — excessive clicking the deficiency in this situation is vitamin D3. Now to fix it you
- **[04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mecanOOf0SY&t=288s)** — have to increase your vitamin D3 to at least 20,000 IUs or more because one really
- **[04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mecanOOf0SY&t=295s)** — interesting function of vitamin D3 is remodeling of the joint. Pretty wild eh? Alright next one is
- **[05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mecanOOf0SY&t=302s)** — low testosterone. This is a classic zinc deficiency. Zinc will increase testosterone.
- **[05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mecanOOf0SY&t=310s)** — The way you become deficient with zinc is eating too many grains because of the phytic acid
- **[05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mecanOOf0SY&t=315s)** — or too much refined sugar. One of the best foods for zinc is red meat or shellfish or seafood.
- **[05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mecanOOf0SY&t=323s)** — Alright next one is your hair is just taking way too long to grow. What's deficient in this
- **[05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mecanOOf0SY&t=330s)** — situation usually is manganese. Okay the trace mineral called manganese. Again anytime you take
- **[05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mecanOOf0SY&t=338s)** — a trace mineral take it in a blend of all of the trace minerals. Next one is premature
- **[05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mecanOOf0SY&t=345s)** — graying of your hair. This is usually a vitamin B5 deficiency. Now vitamin B5 is good also for
- **[05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mecanOOf0SY&t=355s)** — your adrenals and of course the more support you have with the adrenals the less stress.
- **[06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mecanOOf0SY&t=361s)** — But vitamin B5 also supports this enzyme called catalase which can then help clear out more
- **[06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mecanOOf0SY&t=368s)** — the hydrogen peroxide which can build up in the body. Next one is red gums. This is a classic
- **[06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mecanOOf0SY&t=375s)** — vitamin C deficiency. It could also be that you're consuming too much sugar because vitamin
- **[06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mecanOOf0SY&t=381s)** — C and sugar compete and one of the foods that has the most vitamin C is raw sauerkraut.
- **[06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mecanOOf0SY&t=388s)** — Next one is feeling weak. This is a sodium deficiency. You just need to consume more sea
- **[06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mecanOOf0SY&t=395s)** — and last one is you're bruising easily. Okay this is a vitamin K1 deficiency. Now if you want to
- **[06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mecanOOf0SY&t=401s)** — learn more about the different signs of nutritional deficiencies if you haven't seen
- **[06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mecanOOf0SY&t=406s)** — this video it's very interesting. I'll put it up right here.

- **[00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KgNWFyd01g&t=4s)** — You know, certain people give me the comment,
- **[00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KgNWFyd01g&t=6s)** — you don't need to take extra nutrition because you can get all of your nutrition from your diet.
- **[00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KgNWFyd01g&t=11s)** — I will guarantee those people have never looked at the amount of nutrition coming into the body,
- **[00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KgNWFyd01g&t=17s)** — let alone ever tested for vitamin nutrient deficiencies,
- **[00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KgNWFyd01g&t=20s)** — because if they did, they would find out the majority of the population is extremely low
- **[00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KgNWFyd01g&t=25s)** — in things like vitamin D, magnesium, zinc, B1, potassium, and the list goes on and on.
- **[00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KgNWFyd01g&t=32s)** — Over 50% of the population consumes ultra-processed foods, which have zero nutrition.
- **[00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KgNWFyd01g&t=38s)** — We mainly eat for pleasure and taste and not for health.
- **[00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KgNWFyd01g&t=41s)** — A good portion of the food in the grocery store is grown hydroponically in water with about 15 minerals.
- **[00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KgNWFyd01g&t=48s)** — Well, we need 160 different minerals.
- **[00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KgNWFyd01g&t=51s)** — Alright, let's dive into the video starting with number one, tingling in your toes.
- **[00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KgNWFyd01g&t=54s)** — Biggest indication for tingling in the toes is a B1 deficiency.
- **[00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KgNWFyd01g&t=59s)** — When you think about vitamin B1, think about everything related to the nerves, okay?
- **[01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KgNWFyd01g&t=64s)** — And the very end of the longest nerve in the body is going to be affected first,
- **[01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KgNWFyd01g&t=69s)** — and that happens to be in your toes.
- **[01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KgNWFyd01g&t=71s)** — And then on the bottom of the foot, eventually, or gradually, you're going to notice more of a burning pain,
- **[01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KgNWFyd01g&t=76s)** — and that pain can start getting very, very intense.
- **[01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KgNWFyd01g&t=79s)** — The term for this is called peripheral neuropathy.
- **[01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KgNWFyd01g&t=81s)** — You see this a lot in diabetics because the number one reason why someone is deficient in B1
- **[01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KgNWFyd01g&t=87s)** — is they're consuming too much sugar or carbs.
- **[01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KgNWFyd01g&t=89s)** — And for some reason, it's worse at night than during the day.
- **[01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KgNWFyd01g&t=93s)** — It could be because you're lying down and there's less circulation going on.
- **[01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KgNWFyd01g&t=98s)** — What foods have the most B1?
- **[01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KgNWFyd01g&t=99s)** — Believe it or not, pork.
- **[01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KgNWFyd01g&t=101s)** — But you can also get your B1 from liver.
- **[01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KgNWFyd01g&t=104s)** — And also, all meats have B1, eggs have B1, sunflower seeds have B1.
- **[01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KgNWFyd01g&t=109s)** — But if you have this symptom, I would recommend a very special type of B1
- **[01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KgNWFyd01g&t=113s)** — that is in a fat-soluble form and it's called benfotamate.
- **[01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KgNWFyd01g&t=117s)** — That specifically will penetrate the fat layer or the myelin into the tissues to help heal it.
- **[02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KgNWFyd01g&t=124s)** — Alright, number two is cracks in the corner of your mouth.
- **[02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KgNWFyd01g&t=127s)** — I used to have this.
- **[02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KgNWFyd01g&t=129s)** — This is a vitamin B2 deficiency.
- **[02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KgNWFyd01g&t=131s)** — You can get B2 from eating liver, red meat, or eggs.
- **[02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KgNWFyd01g&t=135s)** — Alright, number three, thinning of the hair.
- **[02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KgNWFyd01g&t=137s)** — This is usually a biotin deficiency.
- **[02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KgNWFyd01g&t=141s)** — Biotin is another B vitamin. It's B7.
- **[02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KgNWFyd01g&t=144s)** — Without B7, you can't make keratin, the protein that's involved in making hair.
- **[02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KgNWFyd01g&t=151s)** — So it's going to be thinner, it's going to be brittle, it's going to break.
- **[02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KgNWFyd01g&t=155s)** — You're going to have split ends.
- **[02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KgNWFyd01g&t=157s)** — Biotin is not just for the hair, it's for the nails, it's for your skin as well.
- **[02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KgNWFyd01g&t=161s)** — You can get biotin from eggs, nuts, seeds, organ meat, and even dairy.
- **[02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KgNWFyd01g&t=167s)** — Number four, premature graying of your hair.
- **[02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KgNWFyd01g&t=170s)** — Like right here or right here, you can see that.
- **[02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KgNWFyd01g&t=173s)** — Premature graying at an earlier age suspect a deficiency of another B vitamin, B9, which is folate.
- **[03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KgNWFyd01g&t=182s)** — It really helps you repair DNA.
- **[03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KgNWFyd01g&t=184s)** — This is why it helps prevent cancer.
- **[03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KgNWFyd01g&t=186s)** — But there's another specific thing that folate does, and that is supporting melanin.
- **[03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KgNWFyd01g&t=191s)** — Melanin is the thing that gives you your pigment, your color of your hair and your skin.
- **[03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KgNWFyd01g&t=196s)** — And so folate can help support that.
- **[03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KgNWFyd01g&t=198s)** — And the best way to get folate is from leafy greens.
- **[03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KgNWFyd01g&t=202s)** — All right, that's premature graying.
- **[03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KgNWFyd01g&t=203s)** — What about mouth ulcers?
- **[03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KgNWFyd01g&t=205s)** — This is a B12 deficiency.
- **[03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KgNWFyd01g&t=207s)** — B12 helps protect mucous membranes.
- **[03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KgNWFyd01g&t=210s)** — And if there's no protection, you start getting breakdown in that lining in the inside layer of your mouth.
- **[03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KgNWFyd01g&t=215s)** — And then you get these little ulcers.
- **[03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KgNWFyd01g&t=217s)** — But B12 does a lot.
- **[03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KgNWFyd01g&t=218s)** — It also supports our red blood cells to prevent anemia.
- **[03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KgNWFyd01g&t=222s)** — B12 is also involved in supporting the nervous system.
- **[03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KgNWFyd01g&t=225s)** — Very, very important.
- **[03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KgNWFyd01g&t=227s)** — If you're deficient in B12, you're going to have a lot of nerve damage.
- **[03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KgNWFyd01g&t=230s)** — You can even become to the point where it's permanent.
- **[03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KgNWFyd01g&t=232s)** — So we want to make sure we have enough B12.
- **[03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KgNWFyd01g&t=235s)** — Best source of B12?
- **[03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KgNWFyd01g&t=236s)** — Red meat, liver, clams.
- **[03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KgNWFyd01g&t=238s)** — All right, number six, deep pelvic bone pain.
- **[04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KgNWFyd01g&t=241s)** — And when I talk about deep bone pain, I'm talking about that extends also in your lower back, your hips and even the thighs.
- **[04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KgNWFyd01g&t=248s)** — This is a classic vitamin D deficiency.
- **[04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KgNWFyd01g&t=253s)** — Without vitamin D, your bones cannot mineralize.
- **[04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KgNWFyd01g&t=256s)** — You can't pull in calcium.
- **[04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KgNWFyd01g&t=257s)** — You can't make the bone strong.
- **[04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KgNWFyd01g&t=259s)** — 80% of the population has a vitamin D deficiency.
- **[04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KgNWFyd01g&t=262s)** — It's the most important vitamin because it's involved in so many different genes.
- **[04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KgNWFyd01g&t=267s)** — Like 2500 different genes.
- **[04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KgNWFyd01g&t=269s)** — When you take vitamin D as a maintenance dose, I highly recommend you take no less than 10,000 IUs every single day.
- **[04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KgNWFyd01g&t=277s)** — Unless you're getting sun.
- **[04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KgNWFyd01g&t=279s)** — That is definitely not a toxic amount.
- **[04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KgNWFyd01g&t=281s)** — But because there's so many different factors that block vitamin D and we have so much resistance to it,
- **[04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KgNWFyd01g&t=287s)** — we need a good amount of vitamin D3.
- **[04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KgNWFyd01g&t=290s)** — And for a healthy person, that's 10,000 IUs.
- **[04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KgNWFyd01g&t=294s)** — But you probably need even more than that.
- **[04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KgNWFyd01g&t=295s)** — Okay, next one is heavy menstrual bleeding.
- **[04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KgNWFyd01g&t=299s)** — This is usually high levels of estrogen.
- **[05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KgNWFyd01g&t=304s)** — But it can also be a deficiency in vitamin K1.
- **[05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KgNWFyd01g&t=309s)** — Because vitamin K1 is all about stopping the bleeding.
- **[05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KgNWFyd01g&t=314s)** — Making sure you have enough vitamin K can help you.
- **[05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KgNWFyd01g&t=316s)** — But typically vitamin K1 comes from dark, leafy green vegetables.
- **[05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KgNWFyd01g&t=321s)** — You can also get vitamin K1 from consuming liver.
- **[05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KgNWFyd01g&t=325s)** — Alright, number 8 is heavy menstrual cramping.
- **[05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KgNWFyd01g&t=328s)** — This is a magnesium deficiency.
- **[05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KgNWFyd01g&t=331s)** — But what's really causing the cramping is the uncontrolled calcium situation.
- **[05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KgNWFyd01g&t=335s)** — So magnesium is a remedy.
- **[05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KgNWFyd01g&t=337s)** — You need it to help you relax, help you sleep.
- **[05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KgNWFyd01g&t=339s)** — It's good for blood pressure, so many things.
- **[05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KgNWFyd01g&t=342s)** — And magnesium would be in anything green.
- **[05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KgNWFyd01g&t=345s)** — All the dark, leafy green vegetables.
- **[05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KgNWFyd01g&t=346s)** — Also it's in pumpkin seeds, sesame seeds.
- **[05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KgNWFyd01g&t=349s)** — Alright, number 9, fibroids.
- **[05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KgNWFyd01g&t=351s)** — This too can be a situation where you have too much estrogen.
- **[05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KgNWFyd01g&t=355s)** — A fibroid is a benign tumor that is growing from the uterus.
- **[06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KgNWFyd01g&t=360s)** — Vitamin D can keep it in check.
- **[06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KgNWFyd01g&t=362s)** — But the problem is we need a lot more vitamin D than you think.
- **[06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KgNWFyd01g&t=366s)** — Especially to shrink one of these things.
- **[06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KgNWFyd01g&t=368s)** — So you're going to need about 20,000 to 30,000 international units every single day to be able to shrink these.
- **[06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KgNWFyd01g&t=376s)** — So that's what I would recommend with a good amount of magnesium together with some zinc and vitamin K2.
- **[06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KgNWFyd01g&t=381s)** — Those are co-factors.
- **[06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KgNWFyd01g&t=383s)** — Also make sure you're not consuming any dairy because dairy can flare those up because dairy is a growth hormone.
- **[06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KgNWFyd01g&t=389s)** — And so is insulin.
- **[06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KgNWFyd01g&t=391s)** — So if you're doing a lot of carbs, that also can make those grow.
- **[06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KgNWFyd01g&t=394s)** — Take your vitamin D and watch what happens.
- **[06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KgNWFyd01g&t=396s)** — Alright, number 10 is twitch underneath the eye.
- **[06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KgNWFyd01g&t=399s)** — It's called tetany.
- **[06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KgNWFyd01g&t=400s)** — This is one of the first symptoms of a magnesium deficiency.
- **[06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KgNWFyd01g&t=404s)** — And I would take no less than 400 milligrams every single day.
- **[06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KgNWFyd01g&t=408s)** — It does take a while to correct it.
- **[06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KgNWFyd01g&t=411s)** — But leafy greens, pumpkin seeds, like I already mentioned, will eventually correct it.
- **[06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KgNWFyd01g&t=415s)** — Okay, number 11, heart pounding.
- **[06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KgNWFyd01g&t=417s)** — So you hear this pounding like your pulse in your ear.
- **[07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KgNWFyd01g&t=421s)** — Boom, boom, boom, boom.
- **[07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KgNWFyd01g&t=423s)** — This is a classic potassium deficiency.
- **[07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KgNWFyd01g&t=427s)** — I at one time had this and I didn't know what it was.
- **[07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KgNWFyd01g&t=430s)** — But it happened right after I consumed a massive amount of sugar and carbohydrates in one sitting.
- **[07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KgNWFyd01g&t=436s)** — Because what happens when you consume refined carbs of sugar,
- **[07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KgNWFyd01g&t=440s)** — it actually pulls potassium out of certain places and locks it up into the sugar,
- **[07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KgNWFyd01g&t=448s)** — creating a potassium deficiency.
- **[07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KgNWFyd01g&t=450s)** — What you need is you need potassium.
- **[07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KgNWFyd01g&t=452s)** — 4700 milligrams.
- **[07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KgNWFyd01g&t=453s)** — You can try to do it with salads, but you would have to have at least, minimally, 10 cups of salad.
- **[07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KgNWFyd01g&t=458s)** — Very rarely does anyone do that.
- **[07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KgNWFyd01g&t=460s)** — So what you have to do is you have to have a variety of foods and maybe sometimes an electrolyte powder to get what you need.
- **[07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KgNWFyd01g&t=465s)** — Potassium is really good for blood pressure, as well as the sensation of pounding in your ear.
- **[07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KgNWFyd01g&t=469s)** — Alright, this one over here. Chronic cough is a calcium deficiency.
- **[07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KgNWFyd01g&t=475s)** — I typically do not recommend taking calcium as a supplement unless you have a symptom like this.
- **[08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KgNWFyd01g&t=482s)** — But I think the best source of calcium is from food like dairy.
- **[08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KgNWFyd01g&t=486s)** — But some people can't do dairy.
- **[08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KgNWFyd01g&t=488s)** — So then I would recommend a supplement.
- **[08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KgNWFyd01g&t=490s)** — Not too much because our body doesn't get rid of calcium too easily.
- **[08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KgNWFyd01g&t=494s)** — So calcium lactate would be a good source for those people that need it.
- **[08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KgNWFyd01g&t=497s)** — But if you can do dairy like Greek yogurt or even kefir would be really good.
- **[08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KgNWFyd01g&t=501s)** — Alright, the craving for ice is an iron deficiency.
- **[08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KgNWFyd01g&t=505s)** — And sometimes people even crave dirt or chalk.
- **[08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KgNWFyd01g&t=508s)** — You might see this in someone who's pregnant.
- **[08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KgNWFyd01g&t=511s)** — They need iron.
- **[08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KgNWFyd01g&t=511s)** — The best source of iron is not from plants.
- **[08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KgNWFyd01g&t=514s)** — It's from red meat or liver.
- **[08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KgNWFyd01g&t=516s)** — But iron helps you carry oxygen in the blood.
- **[08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KgNWFyd01g&t=520s)** — Our bodies do not have a way to get rid of excess iron.
- **[08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KgNWFyd01g&t=524s)** — So don't load up on iron.
- **[08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KgNWFyd01g&t=526s)** — Take it if you need it.
- **[08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KgNWFyd01g&t=527s)** — Alright, next one. Low libido.
- **[08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KgNWFyd01g&t=529s)** — This is a deficiency of zinc.
- **[08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KgNWFyd01g&t=531s)** — All those hormones need zinc.
- **[08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KgNWFyd01g&t=534s)** — And also, zinc is involved in keeping your thymus gland,
- **[08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KgNWFyd01g&t=537s)** — the master immune gland which is on the top of the heart,
- **[09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KgNWFyd01g&t=540s)** — to keep it from atrophying.
- **[09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KgNWFyd01g&t=542s)** — Shellfish, especially oysters and red meat, are a good source of zinc.
- **[09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KgNWFyd01g&t=546s)** — Alright, next one is hearing loss.
- **[09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KgNWFyd01g&t=548s)** — This is a B12 deficiency.
- **[09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KgNWFyd01g&t=551s)** — B12 is important in supporting the nerves, especially the auditory nerve.
- **[09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KgNWFyd01g&t=556s)** — So once B12 is deficient, that nerve can suffer
- **[09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KgNWFyd01g&t=559s)** — and you can start having this gradual problem
- **[09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KgNWFyd01g&t=562s)** — with high pitches and low pitch vibration.
- **[09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KgNWFyd01g&t=566s)** — If you know someone that's getting older,
- **[09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KgNWFyd01g&t=569s)** — give them some good B12 and red meat are a good source of zinc.
- **[09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KgNWFyd01g&t=573s)** — Alright, next one is fibrocystic breast.
- **[09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KgNWFyd01g&t=575s)** — This is excess estrogen because you don't have enough iodine.
- **[09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KgNWFyd01g&t=580s)** — So really it's an iodine deficiency.
- **[09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KgNWFyd01g&t=582s)** — What that means is they need some sea kelp or some seaweed
- **[09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KgNWFyd01g&t=586s)** — or maybe shellfish.
- **[09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KgNWFyd01g&t=588s)** — Alright, next one is dry flaky skin.
- **[09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KgNWFyd01g&t=591s)** — Usually around the nose through here,
- **[09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KgNWFyd01g&t=592s)** — but also in the eyebrows right through in here.
- **[09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KgNWFyd01g&t=595s)** — That's a classic omega-3 fatty acid deficiency.
- **[09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KgNWFyd01g&t=599s)** — I mean, an average person consumes like eight gallons of sea oils a year.
- **[10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KgNWFyd01g&t=604s)** — That's crazy. That's going to create a lot of flaky skin
- **[10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KgNWFyd01g&t=608s)** — and a lot of other issues.
- **[10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KgNWFyd01g&t=610s)** — What that means is they need some cod liver oil or fish oil that's high quality.
- **[10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KgNWFyd01g&t=614s)** — Alright, next one is muscle weakness.
- **[10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KgNWFyd01g&t=616s)** — This is a classic vitamin E deficiency.
- **[10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KgNWFyd01g&t=619s)** — If you look at the top or the peak of any large mountain
- **[10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KgNWFyd01g&t=622s)** — that a lot of people climb,
- **[10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KgNWFyd01g&t=624s)** — you're going to see empty bottles of vitamin E
- **[10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KgNWFyd01g&t=626s)** — because vitamin E helps get oxygen in higher altitudes.
- **[10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KgNWFyd01g&t=630s)** — Vitamin E also prevents atrophy of the muscle.
- **[10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KgNWFyd01g&t=633s)** — The type of vitamin E I would recommend is called tocatrinals.
- **[10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KgNWFyd01g&t=636s)** — Next one is fatty liver.
- **[10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KgNWFyd01g&t=637s)** — You can develop a fatty liver from eating a lot of carbs, junk food, alcohol.
- **[10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KgNWFyd01g&t=642s)** — But also if you're choline deficient.
- **[10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KgNWFyd01g&t=645s)** — Where do you get choline?
- **[10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KgNWFyd01g&t=646s)** — You can get it from either the liver
- **[10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KgNWFyd01g&t=647s)** — or even a better source would be from egg yolks.
- **[10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KgNWFyd01g&t=651s)** — Alright, next one is cold source.
- **[10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KgNWFyd01g&t=652s)** — This is a lysine deficiency, but really it's a virus.
- **[10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KgNWFyd01g&t=655s)** — But lysine will put this virus back in remission.
- **[10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KgNWFyd01g&t=659s)** — You can get lysine from parmesan cheese,
- **[11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KgNWFyd01g&t=661s)** — turkey, chicken, and fish.
- **[11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KgNWFyd01g&t=664s)** — Lysine is also good for the immune system.
- **[11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KgNWFyd01g&t=666s)** — It's also good to build up collagen.
- **[11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KgNWFyd01g&t=668s)** — And then we get to the last one here called high lipids.
- **[11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KgNWFyd01g&t=671s)** — To help regulate these high lipids,
- **[11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KgNWFyd01g&t=673s)** — you want a good amount of niacin, which is vitamin B3.
- **[11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KgNWFyd01g&t=677s)** — Sometimes people don't realize that cholesterol can come from sugar and refined carbs.
- **[11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KgNWFyd01g&t=682s)** — So just by changing your diet, you can improve those profiles.
- **[11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KgNWFyd01g&t=685s)** — Now at this point, I think the most important thing for you to do
- **[11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KgNWFyd01g&t=688s)** — is to know what food or foods to eat or meals
- **[11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KgNWFyd01g&t=694s)** — that are nutrient dense to prevent all this right here.
- **[11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KgNWFyd01g&t=696s)** — And for that information, you should check out this video right here.

- **[00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2T2Vd9utcs&t=0s)** — I'd like to talk about some not commonly known symptoms of a zinc deficiency. And because zinc
- **[00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2T2Vd9utcs&t=8s)** — is so important in your body, it's a trace mineral, you don't need a lot of it. But if you're missing
- **[00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2T2Vd9utcs&t=13s)** — it, it can create a lot of problems. I think this video is valuable to identify all these kind of
- **[00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2T2Vd9utcs&t=19s)** — abstract symptoms that you may not connect with a zinc deficiency. Now typically people might know
- **[00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2T2Vd9utcs&t=27s)** — usually that a zinc deficiency can produce a loss of smell because of the concentration of zinc
- **[00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2T2Vd9utcs&t=33s)** — in the sinuses and also in the brain right behind it, which is called the olfactory bulb.
- **[00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2T2Vd9utcs&t=38s)** — And also if a child is deficient in zinc early on, they're not going to be as tall. Okay,
- **[00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2T2Vd9utcs&t=44s)** — so they can have a lack of development. And of course, most people know that zinc is so
- **[00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2T2Vd9utcs&t=49s)** — important for the immune system. So if you're deficient, you're going to be more susceptible
- **[00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2T2Vd9utcs&t=52s)** — to having infections, especially respiratory infections, and especially viruses. They may also
- **[00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2T2Vd9utcs&t=59s)** — know that if zinc is deficient, the thyroid might not be able to convert T4 to T3, the active
- **[01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2T2Vd9utcs&t=66s)** — version of the thyroid hormone. And they may also know that it's related to hair loss or
- **[01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2T2Vd9utcs&t=71s)** — thinning of the hair and diarrhea, as well as dermatitis because of the concentration in
- **[01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2T2Vd9utcs&t=78s)** — And they may also know that it can create some mental agitation or irritation or even fatigue.
- **[01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2T2Vd9utcs&t=84s)** — But I want to explain seven symptoms that not many people know about. So let's talk about
- **[01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2T2Vd9utcs&t=88s)** — number one. Okay, we talked about lack of smell, but let's talk about lack of taste. And
- **[01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2T2Vd9utcs&t=94s)** — I'm talking about when you eat food, you may find your food is just bland. It might taste
- **[01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2T2Vd9utcs&t=102s)** — more bitter. It might be more metallic. Number two is a lack of flavor, okay, which relates to
- **[01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2T2Vd9utcs&t=112s)** — something being bland. But with a zinc deficiency, you won't be able to perceive different
- **[01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2T2Vd9utcs&t=119s)** — flavors, which would really suck if you're trying to enjoy your food and everything is
- **[02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2T2Vd9utcs&t=124s)** — the same flavor. That would be devastating. So having enough zinc can help you perceive
- **[02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2T2Vd9utcs&t=133s)** — through your taste buds different flavors, which is very, very important in that perception
- **[02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2T2Vd9utcs&t=139s)** — that normally we're supposed to have. Number three, hypogonadism. Okay, so in other words,
- **[02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2T2Vd9utcs&t=146s)** — the testicle actually shrinks. It gets smaller, which is going to relate to a decreased
- **[02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2T2Vd9utcs&t=153s)** — testosterone. Okay, it's also going to relate to lower amounts of sperm because out of all the
- **[02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2T2Vd9utcs&t=160s)** — fluids in the body, a lot of the concentration of zinc is in the sperm for a survival mechanism
- **[02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2T2Vd9utcs&t=165s)** — and also to increase the quality of sperm. And so this could relate to infertility.
- **[02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2T2Vd9utcs&t=172s)** — And low testosterone is a big deal with men. And so having enough zinc is a real nice way to
- **[02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2T2Vd9utcs&t=177s)** — make sure that your testosterone is at the right level. Number four, if we take the brain
- **[03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2T2Vd9utcs&t=183s)** — and we look at the areas of the brain that has the most concentrated zinc, the hippocampus
- **[03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2T2Vd9utcs&t=190s)** — comes up as number one. There's other parts of the brain. The hippocampus normally should
- **[03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2T2Vd9utcs&t=195s)** — have a lot of zinc. So if you're deficient in zinc, what can happen? What kind of symptoms
- **[03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2T2Vd9utcs&t=201s)** — could happen if the hippocampus can't work? Well, let me remember... what was that?
- **[03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2T2Vd9utcs&t=208s)** — Memory problems. An inability to learn. A problem with spatial location. All right,
- **[03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2T2Vd9utcs&t=217s)** — number five, a higher susceptibility with an infection around your nail bed. So if you've
- **[03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2T2Vd9utcs&t=224s)** — had like this red swollen puffy tissue around your nails, that is a zinc deficiency. Since we're
- **[03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2T2Vd9utcs&t=233s)** — on the topic of nails, there are some other things too. Like you may have these little
- **[03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2T2Vd9utcs&t=237s)** — white dots. You may also have white lines that go horizontal. And they can actually
- **[04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2T2Vd9utcs&t=243s)** — have different shapes too. But if you see these little horizontal white streaks, that is
- **[04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2T2Vd9utcs&t=249s)** — All right, number six, a lack of repair. It takes forever for your body to repair
- **[04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2T2Vd9utcs&t=257s)** — after exercise, after an injury, any trauma. So zinc speeds up your body's ability to repair.
- **[04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2T2Vd9utcs&t=267s)** — And number seven, night blindness. Now typically night blindness is associated with a vitamin A
- **[04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2T2Vd9utcs&t=272s)** — deficiency, but also zinc. Now I mentioned the hypothalamus being concentrated with zinc,
- **[04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2T2Vd9utcs&t=279s)** — but the retina is also part of the brain. And it too has a very concentrated amount of zinc.
- **[04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2T2Vd9utcs&t=286s)** — So when you run out of that zinc, it can affect the retina, which is basically brain tissue
- **[04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2T2Vd9utcs&t=291s)** — that's extending out of your skull in your eyeball that allows you to see. And especially
- **[04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2T2Vd9utcs&t=298s)** — at night. Okay, so anyway, I wanted to cover these very important points. And I also want to
- **[05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2T2Vd9utcs&t=304s)** — mention why people are typically deficient in zinc. Usually it's because they're consuming
- **[05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2T2Vd9utcs&t=311s)** — too many refined carbohydrates in the form of sugar or pasta, or cereal especially, or bread.
- **[05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2T2Vd9utcs&t=319s)** — Because not only does this concentrated carb deplete zinc, the phytic acid in the so-called
- **[05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2T2Vd9utcs&t=326s)** — healthy whole grains also blocks your ability to absorb zinc. So when you see things on
- **[05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2T2Vd9utcs&t=333s)** — the internet, it says whole grain bread or whole grain cereal, whatever, that brand is where
- **[05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2T2Vd9utcs&t=339s)** — the phytic acid is and that can block zinc. So you might say, well, okay, well, I won't do
- **[05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2T2Vd9utcs&t=346s)** — the whole grain, I'll do the refined grain. Well, then all that sugar can also deplete zinc
- **[05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2T2Vd9utcs&t=351s)** — in another way. There's a really simple way to find out if you're zinc deficient. You can buy
- **[05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2T2Vd9utcs&t=356s)** — a zinc test, which basically is a little bottle with a dropper full and it has some zinc in
- **[06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2T2Vd9utcs&t=362s)** — it. And you put about two teaspoons, I think it's 10 milliliters, okay, in your mouth and you hold it
- **[06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2T2Vd9utcs&t=369s)** — for 10 seconds. Now if you are deficient in zinc, you won't taste anything. It'll just be bland.
- **[06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2T2Vd9utcs&t=377s)** — There'll be no taste. But if you have sufficient zinc, you'll start to notice it's
- **[06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2T2Vd9utcs&t=382s)** — going to taste metallic. There's a bitter taste to it. Now I've just talked about the symptoms
- **[06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2T2Vd9utcs&t=387s)** — of a zinc deficiency. Let's talk about the benefits of what could happen if you put the
- **[06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2T2Vd9utcs&t=393s)** — zinc back in. And for that information, I put it up right here. Check it out.

*Click any timestamp to jump to that moment in the video*

- **[00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZPuEvVuTaw&t=0s)** — Today we are going to talk about six main foods, well they are kind of categories of
- **[00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZPuEvVuTaw&t=4s)** — foods that can potentially cause cancer. There are some really key things you need to know.
- **[00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZPuEvVuTaw&t=10s)** — Number one, it's the dose that determines the poison. Okay? And so the key with cancer
- **[00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZPuEvVuTaw&t=17s)** — is chronic exposure to a certain thing that can create inflammation and or dysfunction
- **[00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZPuEvVuTaw&t=24s)** — in a certain part of your cell. And that certain part is called the mitochondria. The mitochondria
- **[00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZPuEvVuTaw&t=30s)** — is the energy factory of your cells that uses oxygen to help burn fuel. With cancer, that
- **[00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZPuEvVuTaw&t=39s)** — mechanism is destroyed. Then you have a backup system that is used to keep things alive. And
- **[00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZPuEvVuTaw&t=46s)** — that system is called fermentation. Okay? So it's a whole different pathway that's set up,
- **[00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZPuEvVuTaw&t=52s)** — that acts as a plan B for survival. And so when this shift happens, that cancer becomes out of
- **[01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZPuEvVuTaw&t=60s)** — control. It loses its mortality. It can live on forever. In this presentation, I'm not going to
- **[01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZPuEvVuTaw&t=66s)** — talk about all the different things that can feed cancer. I'm mainly going to focus in on
- **[01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZPuEvVuTaw&t=71s)** — the things that can trigger cancer. Let's talk about this chronic exposure. It can be chronic
- **[01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZPuEvVuTaw&t=75s)** — exposure to like pesticides, insecticides, herbicides, fungicides, things like that.
- **[01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZPuEvVuTaw&t=79s)** — I mean, just pesticides alone in the United States, we release 1.3 billion pounds of pesticides
- **[01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZPuEvVuTaw&t=86s)** — into our environment every single year. Let's say, for example, you do yard work and you're
- **[01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZPuEvVuTaw&t=90s)** — constantly involved with pesticides, you're doing farm work, you're definitely more
- **[01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZPuEvVuTaw&t=96s)** — susceptible to having more exposure and more chronic damage. But again, it's the dosage.
- **[01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZPuEvVuTaw&t=101s)** — It's the chronic exposure of that poison. You have something called radon, which is kind of
- **[01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZPuEvVuTaw&t=107s)** — invisible odorless gas that can leak in from the soil from your basement. This is why when
- **[01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZPuEvVuTaw&t=114s)** — you buy a house, they check for radon because that can potentially lead to lung cancer.
- **[01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZPuEvVuTaw&t=119s)** — You have cleaning chemicals. You have even old age is a risk factor. Why would old age be a
- **[02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZPuEvVuTaw&t=125s)** — risk factor? Well, over time, you kind of lose your mitochondria and become more damaged
- **[02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZPuEvVuTaw&t=130s)** — the time making you more susceptible to having this condition occur. Viruses like human papillomavirus
- **[02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZPuEvVuTaw&t=137s)** — and certain fungi, even parasites can do it. Even certain type of bacteria can trigger it.
- **[02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZPuEvVuTaw&t=144s)** — And then of course you get pollution. All right, so now let's start at the top of the list.
- **[02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZPuEvVuTaw&t=149s)** — Alcohol. Okay, no surprises there. Alcohol damages your mitochondria. But again, it's the
- **[02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZPuEvVuTaw&t=155s)** — chronic exposure of alcohol. Number two, trans fats. And a trans fat is something that's
- **[02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZPuEvVuTaw&t=161s)** — partially hydrogenated. Why would a hydrogenated oil, which is fully saturated, be any less
- **[02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZPuEvVuTaw&t=168s)** — damaging to a partially hydrogenated fat? So from my viewpoint, if you're getting
- **[02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZPuEvVuTaw&t=173s)** — hydrogenated fats, which is in a lot of junk foods, that can create a problem with
- **[02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZPuEvVuTaw&t=177s)** — your mitochondria. Number three, burnt or charred meat. There's two chemicals that are
- **[03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZPuEvVuTaw&t=184s)** — when you burn meat. HCA and PAH. Like on the charcoal grill. A couple of the things you can
- **[03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZPuEvVuTaw&t=191s)** — do to counter that. You can add garlic to your meats, rosemary, certain spices to help lower
- **[03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZPuEvVuTaw&t=199s)** — the risk factor. Then you have something else called AGEZ. What is AGEZ? It stands for Advanced
- **[03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZPuEvVuTaw&t=206s)** — Glycation and Products. What is that? That is a compound created when you combine a protein
- **[03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZPuEvVuTaw&t=213s)** — with a sugar under heat or a protein with a fat under heat. So a couple examples of that would
- **[03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZPuEvVuTaw&t=221s)** — be barbecued ribs. You're heating up these barbecued ribs and you're creating this advanced
- **[03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZPuEvVuTaw&t=226s)** — glycation and products. So there's kind of a situation where the protein fuses together
- **[03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZPuEvVuTaw&t=231s)** — and it can create all sorts of inflammatory processes, especially with your mitochondria.
- **[03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZPuEvVuTaw&t=237s)** — Now what about heated protein and fats? Well you have ice cream. You cook this protein with the
- **[04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZPuEvVuTaw&t=245s)** — fat and you create these AGEZ. And then you're consuming this ice cream on a regular basis
- **[04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZPuEvVuTaw&t=250s)** — like a lot of people do. Number five, processed meats. You have nitrates in processed meats
- **[04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZPuEvVuTaw&t=256s)** — that are potentially associated with cancer. Usually people consuming processed meat are also
- **[04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZPuEvVuTaw&t=262s)** — consuming a lot of other things that are probably not healthy. But what they've done
- **[04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZPuEvVuTaw&t=266s)** — with this meat is they've combined red meat with processed meat and they lumped it into one
- **[04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZPuEvVuTaw&t=273s)** — category of both of those causing cancer. Which I have a big disagreement just because
- **[04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZPuEvVuTaw&t=277s)** — the research is so weak. And there's a big difference between grass-fed, grass-finished
- **[04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZPuEvVuTaw&t=284s)** — meat and grain-fed. There's a big difference between red meat and processed meat. And what
- **[04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZPuEvVuTaw&t=291s)** — if you eat red meat without nitrates? So anytime you look at things that cause cancer,
- **[04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZPuEvVuTaw&t=295s)** — you'll see that red meat stuck in there. And so that's one factor that I disagree with.
- **[05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZPuEvVuTaw&t=300s)** — Especially since there's nothing in the healthy version of red meat that has been evaluated
- **[05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZPuEvVuTaw&t=307s)** — with any substantial scientific studies that show evidence of it being damaging at all. In
- **[05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZPuEvVuTaw&t=313s)** — fact, I know a lot of people heal their bodies by consuming red meat because there's
- **[05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZPuEvVuTaw&t=318s)** — a lot of things in there that are beneficial. All right, number six, ultra processed foods,
- **[05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZPuEvVuTaw&t=323s)** — aka junk foods. They rebranded junk foods as ultra processed foods. It sounds a lot better,
- **[05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZPuEvVuTaw&t=330s)** — but the actual foods are not a lot better. Now remember I talked about chronic exposure,
- **[05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZPuEvVuTaw&t=335s)** — right? Well, guess what? 50% of all of our calories are ultra processed foods.
- **[05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZPuEvVuTaw&t=342s)** — When we talk about ultra, we're talking about extreme. We're talking about processed.
- **[05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZPuEvVuTaw&t=347s)** — We're talking about turning something that started out natural into something that doesn't
- **[05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZPuEvVuTaw&t=352s)** — resemble what it started out to be. You're going through many, many alterations using
- **[05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZPuEvVuTaw&t=358s)** — chemicals, heat, pressure, deodorizing, decolorizing, and you're ending up with this
- **[06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZPuEvVuTaw&t=366s)** — end product that is so refined, so different, so altered, so dead, there's nothing alive in
- **[06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZPuEvVuTaw&t=375s)** — it. You know, people talk about, well, they're just empty calories. It's more than just
- **[06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZPuEvVuTaw&t=380s)** — And so when we consume it, we have to pull from our reserves vitamins and minerals to be able
- **[06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZPuEvVuTaw&t=387s)** — to metabolize it. And just think about how much inflammation is created when you're consuming
- **[06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZPuEvVuTaw&t=391s)** — synthetic starches. Not even saturated fats. They're unsaturated fats. They're seed oils,
- **[06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZPuEvVuTaw&t=398s)** — which go through industrial processing and a lot of refining, and they're very, very
- **[06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZPuEvVuTaw&t=402s)** — unstable. I can't think of anything more unhealthy to eat than ultra processed foods. It
- **[06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZPuEvVuTaw&t=407s)** — hits the bottom of the barrel. And what's really interesting about this is, let's start with
- **[06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZPuEvVuTaw&t=412s)** — maltodextrin. Maltodextrin is considered a starch, not a sugar, even though it reacts like
- **[06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZPuEvVuTaw&t=416s)** — a sugar, way more than actual sugar. On the glycemic index, it's way, way, way high.
- **[07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZPuEvVuTaw&t=422s)** — And maltodextrin is an alter process ingredient that is considered generally recognized as safe.
- **[07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZPuEvVuTaw&t=430s)** — It's called gross. Generally recognized as safe is something that a company can use. They can
- **[07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZPuEvVuTaw&t=436s)** — basically do their own studies and they can just tell the FDA, it's safe. There's no FDA
- **[07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZPuEvVuTaw&t=442s)** — testing on this. People think, oh yeah, it's been tested, but it's only tested by the
- **[07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZPuEvVuTaw&t=448s)** — manufacturing company. And there can be a lot of different shady loopholes with that. Maltodextrin
- **[07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZPuEvVuTaw&t=453s)** — is considered generally recognized as safe, gross. We have modified starches, which are
- **[07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZPuEvVuTaw&t=459s)** — gross. We even have high fructose corn syrup, which is gross. Corn oil, soy oil is considered
- **[07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZPuEvVuTaw&t=466s)** — gross. Canola oil is considered gross. Corn syrup is considered gross. And here we have the
- **[07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZPuEvVuTaw&t=472s)** — situation where manufacturers can kind of use this gross to give you the illusion that it's
- **[07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZPuEvVuTaw&t=478s)** — safe, when in fact, from my viewpoint, it's not too safe. Now, if you haven't seen my
- **[08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZPuEvVuTaw&t=483s)** — in-depth video on the most unhealthy food in the world, okay, you should check it out. I

## Full Transcript with Timestamps

*Click any timestamp to jump to that moment in the video*

- **[00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N2DGrgMIcsE&t=0s)** — You know, at one time I had zero awareness about the importance of vitamins and what they did on our bodies.
- **[00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N2DGrgMIcsE&t=9s)** — Especially vitamin D. I maybe heard about it, maybe you get it from the sun, from the foods.
- **[00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N2DGrgMIcsE&t=14s)** — I just had zero data on vitamin D and it just wasn't even on my radar. But over time,
- **[00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N2DGrgMIcsE&t=20s)** — when I gained more knowledge about vitamin D, it is the most important vitamin out of all the
- **[00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N2DGrgMIcsE&t=26s)** — because if you're deficient, boy, your immune system doesn't work, you're going to have inflammation,
- **[00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N2DGrgMIcsE&t=31s)** — you can have all sorts of issues with sleep and digestion, and the list goes on and on and on.
- **[00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N2DGrgMIcsE&t=36s)** — But they may know some of the common reasons why the majority of the population is deficient
- **[00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N2DGrgMIcsE&t=40s)** — in vitamin D. Gut inflammation, no gallbladder. As we age, our skin becomes thicker. We can't
- **[00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N2DGrgMIcsE&t=48s)** — absorb vitamin D from the sun. The darker the skin is, the less vitamin D absorption because
- **[00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N2DGrgMIcsE&t=53s)** — the melanin, the pigment in the skin, the more obese someone is, the more diabetic they are,
- **[01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N2DGrgMIcsE&t=60s)** — the more insulin resistance they have, the less vitamin D they're going to absorb.
- **[01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N2DGrgMIcsE&t=63s)** — And also where they live. If they live at a high latitude in the north, they're not going
- **[01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N2DGrgMIcsE&t=69s)** — to get much D. And it's virtually impossible to get vitamin D from your diet. People are
- **[01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N2DGrgMIcsE&t=74s)** — also more aware that their genetics have a big play in vitamin D too. There are many
- **[01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N2DGrgMIcsE&t=78s)** — different genes that a person can have a problem with that either makes it difficult to
- **[01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N2DGrgMIcsE&t=82s)** — convert into the active form of vitamin D or just absorb vitamin D. And I have that problem
- **[01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N2DGrgMIcsE&t=89s)** — myself. Then you have if a person has an infection, microbes can downgrade vitamin D
- **[01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N2DGrgMIcsE&t=95s)** — receptors and block the absorption of vitamin D as their strategy to overcome your immune
- **[01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N2DGrgMIcsE&t=99s)** — system. If someone has a fatty liver or they smoke or they consume sugar or they go through
- **[01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N2DGrgMIcsE&t=106s)** — stress, they're going to absorb less vitamin D. If they're on a statin or on a low-fat diet,
- **[01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N2DGrgMIcsE&t=112s)** — they're not going to get as much vitamin D. If there's pollution in the air, or even if
- **[01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N2DGrgMIcsE&t=117s)** — they're getting too many omega-6 fatty acids with the soy oil, the corn oil, the canola oil,
- **[02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N2DGrgMIcsE&t=121s)** — that will block vitamin D. But I want to talk about seven things that you probably have never
- **[02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N2DGrgMIcsE&t=126s)** — heard of before. And they're very interesting and they're very important to know. Number one,
- **[02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N2DGrgMIcsE&t=133s)** — the majority of side effects that may occur when you take vitamin D. Okay, and I'm going to list
- **[02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N2DGrgMIcsE&t=139s)** — them. Fatigue, insomnia, constipation, diarrhea, skin rash, nausea, headache, pain, all could
- **[02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N2DGrgMIcsE&t=149s)** — occur if you're low in magnesium. Magnesium is such an important mineral in relationship to
- **[02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N2DGrgMIcsE&t=156s)** — vitamin D. It helps it work better. And if you're deficient in magnesium, which a lot
- **[02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N2DGrgMIcsE&t=160s)** — people are, vitamin D may give you additional issues. So in other words, if you take more
- **[02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N2DGrgMIcsE&t=166s)** — vitamin D, it can exaggerate an already deficient situation with magnesium. Now, of
- **[02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N2DGrgMIcsE&t=173s)** — course, the side effect from very large amounts of vitamin D over many, many months,
- **[02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N2DGrgMIcsE&t=179s)** — potentially creating hypercalcemia, could give you kidney stones. But this is very, very rare.
- **[03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N2DGrgMIcsE&t=186s)** — And this, I think, is probably the biggest fear. They don't realize that you'd have to take a
- **[03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N2DGrgMIcsE&t=191s)** — lot more over a long period of time before you got kidney stones or hypercalcemia. And if you're
- **[03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N2DGrgMIcsE&t=196s)** — taking magnesium and other factors related to this vitamin D, like K2, the odds of you
- **[03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N2DGrgMIcsE&t=203s)** — getting hypercalcemia, too much calcium in the blood, even go even lower. But drinking
- **[03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N2DGrgMIcsE&t=209s)** — a little bit more water, like 2.5 liters of fluid per day, can really almost eliminate the
- **[03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N2DGrgMIcsE&t=214s)** — kidney stones. Because kidney stones form when there's a super concentrated amount of this
- **[03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N2DGrgMIcsE&t=220s)** — calcium in the urine. So if your urine is so diluted, it can never be super concentrated.
- **[03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N2DGrgMIcsE&t=226s)** — Number two, taking vitamin D infrequently works a little bit better than on a regular
- **[03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N2DGrgMIcsE&t=234s)** — basis. So if we compare taking 10,000 I use of vitamin D every day as a maintenance dose,
- **[03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N2DGrgMIcsE&t=239s)** — and you instead did 50,000 I use once a week or twice a week, that might work a little better
- **[04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N2DGrgMIcsE&t=247s)** — for you. And this is good because sometimes people forget to take vitamin D and they think,
- **[04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N2DGrgMIcsE&t=251s)** — is it going to do any good if I take it a few times a week? And the answer is yes. Remember,
- **[04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N2DGrgMIcsE&t=256s)** — vitamin D is a fat soluble vitamin. So when it goes in the body, it gets stored in the
- **[04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N2DGrgMIcsE&t=260s)** — fat cells and it can be released over time. It's not like a water soluble vitamin, like
- **[04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N2DGrgMIcsE&t=265s)** — the B vitamins and vitamin C, that you would want to take those on a daily basis.
- **[04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N2DGrgMIcsE&t=270s)** — The next thing that people don't realize is this. When you consume like farm raised fish,
- **[04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N2DGrgMIcsE&t=277s)** — which I mean, it's so, so common in restaurants and you just need to start reading the labels.
- **[04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N2DGrgMIcsE&t=284s)** — Farm raised fish has four times less vitamin D as well caught fish. Grain fed animals
- **[04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N2DGrgMIcsE&t=291s)** — compared to grass fed animals have much less vitamin D. And chickens and pigs that roam outside
- **[05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N2DGrgMIcsE&t=301s)** — and that are able to get out of the barn and they're exposed to the sun have much more
- **[05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N2DGrgMIcsE&t=306s)** — vitamin D than these pigs and chickens that are confined to a structure. In fact, when a
- **[05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N2DGrgMIcsE&t=313s)** — pig or a chicken doesn't get to see the daylight, they're like three times less vitamin
- **[05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N2DGrgMIcsE&t=317s)** — D. All right, number four, and this is really, really interesting.
- **[05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N2DGrgMIcsE&t=322s)** — Out of all the factors that can improve your health, okay, vitamin D is behind eating a
- **[05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N2DGrgMIcsE&t=328s)** — healthy diet and exercise. All right, number five, vitamin D2, which is mainly you have to
- **[05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N2DGrgMIcsE&t=336s)** — get a prescription for is very different than vitamin D3. In fact, vitamin D2 actually in
- **[05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N2DGrgMIcsE&t=343s)** — some studies have worsened MS, okay, versus vitamin D3 has greatly improved MS. Lupus,
- **[05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N2DGrgMIcsE&t=352s)** — another autoimmune disease, is not affected by D2, but it is with D3. The studies in vitamin D2
- **[06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N2DGrgMIcsE&t=360s)** — do not decrease mortality, but the studies with vitamin D3 do. And taking vitamin D2
- **[06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N2DGrgMIcsE&t=367s)** — can actually inhibit the absorption of vitamin D3. All right, next point, okay.
- **[06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N2DGrgMIcsE&t=373s)** — Some people when they go out and get exposed to the sun, they think that they're getting
- **[06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N2DGrgMIcsE&t=378s)** — a lot of vitamin D when they're getting exposed to the sun for like 10 minutes.
- **[06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N2DGrgMIcsE&t=383s)** — So let's say best care scenario, you're young, you don't have any of these other barriers
- **[06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N2DGrgMIcsE&t=387s)** — of absorption of vitamin D, and you're exposing a lot of your skin to the sun
- **[06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N2DGrgMIcsE&t=393s)** — for about 10 minutes, you're only going to get 400 IUs of vitamin D. That is very, very
- **[06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N2DGrgMIcsE&t=401s)** — low amounts. So just realize that it takes a bit more exposure to sun to get enough vitamin D.
- **[06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N2DGrgMIcsE&t=407s)** — All right, and last point that I think is very, very important because a lot of people
- **[06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N2DGrgMIcsE&t=411s)** — take vitamin D3 and they don't realize that manufacturing companies are adding corn syrup
- **[06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N2DGrgMIcsE&t=419s)** — to vitamin D. In fact, the manufacturing company that I work with in Europe basically told me with
- **[07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N2DGrgMIcsE&t=426s)** — a high level of certainty, I was the only one to ask or request a vitamin D product without
- **[07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N2DGrgMIcsE&t=434s)** — corn syrup. And I would suspect a similar thing is happening in the U.S. but I don't know for
- **[07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N2DGrgMIcsE&t=439s)** — sure. So when you get a vitamin D product, make sure they don't add the corn syrup or
- **[07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N2DGrgMIcsE&t=447s)** — maltodextrin. Now that you know those seven factors, I want to take your awareness even
- **[07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N2DGrgMIcsE&t=452s)** — higher. If you haven't seen this video on vitamin D, you should check it out. I put it up right here.

- **[00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJG0kYFUIyE&t=0s)** — Let's talk about the foods that you definitely need to avoid if you have a thyroid problem,
- **[00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJG0kYFUIyE&t=6s)** — specifically a hypothyroid condition. And so the biggest thing that you need to be aware of
- **[00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJG0kYFUIyE&t=11s)** — are these things called goitrogens. Now what is a goitrogen? It's things that cause a goiter.
- **[00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJG0kYFUIyE&t=19s)** — Okay, now what is a goiter? Basically a goiter is an enlarged thyroid gland and the thyroid
- **[00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJG0kYFUIyE&t=24s)** — gland is right at the bottom of your neck about two and a half inches wide. So when
- **[00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJG0kYFUIyE&t=28s)** — things start swelling up, that's called a goiter. And there are foods that cause that. And those are
- **[00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJG0kYFUIyE&t=34s)** — the foods that you need to avoid because what they do is they interfere with certain enzymes
- **[00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJG0kYFUIyE&t=39s)** — and they stimulate certain enzymes and they increase certain other hormones. Like they
- **[00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJG0kYFUIyE&t=45s)** — increase the thyroid stimulating hormone which comes down from the pituitary and then it makes
- **[00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJG0kYFUIyE&t=51s)** — the thyroid actually get bigger. So there are many different aspects to what a goiter can do
- **[00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJG0kYFUIyE&t=57s)** — for the thyroid. But I'm just going to make you aware of what these goiter foods are specifically.
- **[01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJG0kYFUIyE&t=63s)** — All right, number one, cassava. Cassava is a goitrogenic food. Number two, lima beans.
- **[01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJG0kYFUIyE&t=70s)** — Number three, sorghum, which is a type of grain. Number four, sweet potato. Number five,
- **[01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJG0kYFUIyE&t=78s)** — flax seed. Number six, cruciferous vegetables. And that would include broccoli, kale,
- **[01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJG0kYFUIyE&t=84s)** — brussels sprouts, cabbage, radish, watercress, bok choy, cauliflower,
- **[01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJG0kYFUIyE&t=93s)** — horseradish, and arugula. But you do want to avoid consuming a lot of cruciferous. But if
- **[01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJG0kYFUIyE&t=98s)** — you're consuming like small amounts like less than five ounces, you're not going to have a
- **[01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJG0kYFUIyE&t=104s)** — problem. Okay, I'm talking about large amounts. And even if you do have cruciferous, if you
- **[01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJG0kYFUIyE&t=109s)** — cook them or steam them or ferment them, as in sauerkraut, you're going to reduce the amount of
- **[01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJG0kYFUIyE&t=115s)** — this effect. And also if you have a little sea kelp, that will also help as well. I mean,
- **[02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJG0kYFUIyE&t=120s)** — if you look at the research, you would have to consume a good amount of this over a period of
- **[02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJG0kYFUIyE&t=123s)** — time to create a goiter. I'm just bringing up all the foods because you may be consuming
- **[02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJG0kYFUIyE&t=129s)** — a lot of these foods, maybe not individually in large amounts, but across the board.
- **[02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJG0kYFUIyE&t=133s)** — Another one is a grain called millet. The next big one is soy. Tofu, soy milk especially,
- **[02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJG0kYFUIyE&t=142s)** — soy protein, isolates, any soy. Now the next one might surprise you, but onions are the food
- **[02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJG0kYFUIyE&t=149s)** — that have the most quercetin. And quercetin can give you a goitrogenic effect. So if you
- **[02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJG0kYFUIyE&t=155s)** — have a goiter, you probably should be careful about consuming too many onions. Now this
- **[02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJG0kYFUIyE&t=160s)** — last thing I want to talk about isn't classically considered a goitrogen, but it definitely destroys
- **[02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJG0kYFUIyE&t=168s)** — the thyroid especially the autoimmune thyroid Hashimoto's. In fact, 90% of all hypothyroid
- **[02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJG0kYFUIyE&t=175s)** — cases are Hashimoto's. And the biggest culprit is this gluten in grains, a lot of different
- **[03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJG0kYFUIyE&t=183s)** — grains. So gluten is something you have to avoid. Now the question is why? This is related
- **[03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJG0kYFUIyE&t=189s)** — to an area called molecular mimicry. If you have antibodies to gluten, which a lot of people do,
- **[03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJG0kYFUIyE&t=196s)** — those antibodies can cross over and start to attack the thyroid because of this
- **[03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJG0kYFUIyE&t=203s)** — molecular similarity. Now when dealing with the thyroid, you would also want to avoid
- **[03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJG0kYFUIyE&t=208s)** — anything that depletes selenium, iodine, iron, and vitamin A. These are key nutrients
- **[03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJG0kYFUIyE&t=216s)** — that you want sufficient amounts. So to get enough iodine and selenium, that would be all the seafood,
- **[03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJG0kYFUIyE&t=222s)** — that would be also the sea kelp, Brazil nuts, and also you can get both of these if you do
- **[03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJG0kYFUIyE&t=226s)** — sea salt. Of course iron is pretty easy to get if you're doing like red meat or animal
- **[03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJG0kYFUIyE&t=232s)** — products. And vitamin A, you can get that from egg yolks, butter, cod liver oil, beef liver,
- **[04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJG0kYFUIyE&t=240s)** — things like that. Now that I talked about what foods to avoid,
- **[04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJG0kYFUIyE&t=244s)** — let's talk about what you should eat. And for that, check this video out.

- **[00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VJxmAvQX9s&t=0s)** — Today we're going to discuss the seven foods you should be eating after you reach the age of 50.
- **[00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VJxmAvQX9s&t=6s)** — And of course, I'm almost there. I'm 49. I'm being very sarcastic. I'm 59. And I eat a lot of
- **[00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VJxmAvQX9s&t=11s)** — these foods I'm going to share with you. But I really want to talk about why you should be
- **[00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VJxmAvQX9s&t=16s)** — eating these foods first. Obviously, you want to eat foods that will help to extend longevity,
- **[00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VJxmAvQX9s&t=21s)** — right? So we should probably use a longevity expert. We're going to talk about Dr. David
- **[00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VJxmAvQX9s&t=25s)** — He's one of the leading experts on longevity. He actually studies these genes called sirtuins.
- **[00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VJxmAvQX9s&t=31s)** — Sirtuins basically are longevity genes. One of the things that will increase sirtuins is called
- **[00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VJxmAvQX9s&t=38s)** — NAD. NAD is inside your mitochondria converting food to energy, then pushing it down the
- **[00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VJxmAvQX9s&t=46s)** — assembly line until eventually it helps recharge a certain battery. As we age,
- **[00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VJxmAvQX9s&t=51s)** — our NAD goes down. At midlife, they're down like 50%. A lot of the anti-agen experts out there
- **[00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VJxmAvQX9s&t=57s)** — are educating people about boosting this NAD. There's a lot of supplements out there that help
- **[01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VJxmAvQX9s&t=62s)** — boost the NAD. People are getting injections. I think even David Sinclair came up with his
- **[01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VJxmAvQX9s&t=67s)** — own supplement. There's a whole bunch of drama on that, which I'm not going to get into. But
- **[01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VJxmAvQX9s&t=71s)** — all of those compounds have this basic derivative of where they come from. And that
- **[01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VJxmAvQX9s&t=78s)** — is plain old simple niacin, which is B3. Then the question is why not just take more niacin?
- **[01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VJxmAvQX9s&t=83s)** — Niacin is so inexpensive. That's not the whole picture, but it's one piece of the puzzle.
- **[01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VJxmAvQX9s&t=89s)** — There are other reasons. And I'm going to get to those. But I first want to show you
- **[01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VJxmAvQX9s&t=93s)** — a very interesting book. Now, what does this book have to do with niacin? Well,
- **[01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VJxmAvQX9s&t=99s)** — let me explain. In the late 1800s and early 1900s, there was a disease that was rampant
- **[01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VJxmAvQX9s&t=106s)** — called plegra. For many years, they thought it was an infection. But to make a long story short,
- **[01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VJxmAvQX9s&t=110s)** — it wasn't an infection. It was a man-made thing. They isolated it. It comes from consuming
- **[01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VJxmAvQX9s&t=116s)** — a diet of just corn. So apparently in corn, niacin, B3, is locked up. And so when you just
- **[02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VJxmAvQX9s&t=124s)** — mash this corn up and live on a diet of corn, which a lot of people did, you end up with
- **[02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VJxmAvQX9s&t=129s)** — plegra. But wait a second. I thought corn has been around for a long time. Like the
- **[02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VJxmAvQX9s&t=136s)** — to our knowledge didn't get plegra. And that is because they use a special technique of adding
- **[02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VJxmAvQX9s&t=141s)** — lime, which is kind of a calcium carbonate. And they would soak their corn overnight. And this
- **[02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VJxmAvQX9s&t=147s)** — alkalized water allowed the niacin to be freed up. But of course, in the late 1800s
- **[02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VJxmAvQX9s&t=153s)** — and early 1900s, they omitted that little step of adding lime. I want to show you
- **[02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VJxmAvQX9s&t=158s)** — another book. It's called Niacin, The Real Story. Fascinating book by an author named
- **[02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VJxmAvQX9s&t=165s)** — Dr. Abram Hoffer. He was also a biochemist. I want to read you the first line of the first
- **[02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VJxmAvQX9s&t=170s)** — chapter. Many people have no idea how many illnesses are caused by too little niacin.
- **[02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VJxmAvQX9s&t=176s)** — And particularly no one realizes how many diseases can be cured with mega doses of niacin. Now,
- **[03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VJxmAvQX9s&t=182s)** — Dr. Hoffer was one of the doctors who started the Ortho Molecular Medicine Group,
- **[03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VJxmAvQX9s&t=188s)** — where they use high doses of nutrients to create therapeutic dosage to correct all sorts
- **[03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VJxmAvQX9s&t=193s)** — of body problems. But in this book, they talk about how niacin is the building block,
- **[03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VJxmAvQX9s&t=198s)** — the precursor for the NAD, which is everything to do with allowing the mitochondria to work.
- **[03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VJxmAvQX9s&t=204s)** — Now that we have the basics down, now we need to talk about why does NAD decrease as we age?
- **[03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VJxmAvQX9s&t=210s)** — I don't want to go into a lot of details on that, but I will just tell you one of the
- **[03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VJxmAvQX9s&t=215s)** — molecules is called C38 if you want to look it up. So as we get older, C38 increases,
- **[03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VJxmAvQX9s&t=221s)** — and then our NAD goes down. So today we're going to talk about all the foods that can increase
- **[03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VJxmAvQX9s&t=226s)** — the NAD. So let's start with number one. What will be the first one? Well, let's first talk
- **[03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VJxmAvQX9s&t=230s)** — about the food that has the most niacin. Okay, that would be very important as well, right?
- **[03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VJxmAvQX9s&t=235s)** — What food has the most niacin? If you look it up on ChatGPT, it will give you the
- **[04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VJxmAvQX9s&t=240s)** — incorrect answer. In fact, I had an argument with ChatGPT going back and forth because the
- **[04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VJxmAvQX9s&t=244s)** — first food that it gave me that has the most niacin was chicken. And I'm like, that's not
- **[04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VJxmAvQX9s&t=249s)** — the right answer would be beef liver. Okay, but number two is the food that they are telling you
- **[04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VJxmAvQX9s&t=256s)** — to avoid, which is really wild. And that would be grass fed red meat. It's loaded, not just with
- **[04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VJxmAvQX9s&t=265s)** — niacin B3, but so many other B vitamins and so many other nutrients that can help you live
- **[04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VJxmAvQX9s&t=271s)** — a long healthy life. Chicken is not at the top of the list. Okay, chicken is very high in
- **[04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VJxmAvQX9s&t=276s)** — omega-6 fatty acids. It's inflammatory. It's lower on the list, but it does have some niacin.
- **[04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VJxmAvQX9s&t=281s)** — But organ meats, red meat. Okay, if you've been watching my channel, you know I recommend red meat
- **[04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VJxmAvQX9s&t=288s)** — for a lot of people, a lot of conditions. I consume it as the main protein in my diet
- **[04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VJxmAvQX9s&t=293s)** — for many reasons. And now you know one is just niacin, getting enough niacin. Now,
- **[04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VJxmAvQX9s&t=299s)** — some people are not going to eat organ meats or red meat. Well, then have nutritional yeast.
- **[05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VJxmAvQX9s&t=304s)** — Number three, foods that have probiotics or microbes. And that would be sauerkraut.
- **[05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VJxmAvQX9s&t=310s)** — And the reason sauerkraut is at the top of the list. I'm talking about raw sauerkraut.
- **[05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VJxmAvQX9s&t=314s)** — Sauerkraut has a good amount of niacin. And if you can get the sauerkraut that is from the
- **[05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VJxmAvQX9s&t=319s)** — purple cabbage, you'll get even something better. And of course, certain types of yogurt. You
- **[05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VJxmAvQX9s&t=326s)** — really want to make sure you get a quality yogurt or better yet, just make your own.
- **[05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VJxmAvQX9s&t=329s)** — Number four, parsley. I personally don't like parsley. So I might have it as a spice,
- **[05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VJxmAvQX9s&t=334s)** — but also celery and even chamomile tea. And also as a side note, and this is not part of this,
- **[05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VJxmAvQX9s&t=341s)** — sulforaphane in cruciferous vegetables, especially broccoli sprouts and radish sprouts.
- **[05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VJxmAvQX9s&t=347s)** — So if you could put some of that on your salad or even consume any of the cruciferous
- **[05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VJxmAvQX9s&t=352s)** — vegetables, you are going to get a good amount of sulforaphane to increase your NAD.
- **[05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VJxmAvQX9s&t=356s)** — Of course, cruciferous also do a lot of other things too. They can help you detoxify chemicals
- **[06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VJxmAvQX9s&t=360s)** — and they do multiple additional things as well. Okay, next compound. And then we'll talk about
- **[06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VJxmAvQX9s&t=365s)** — the foods is anthocyanins. Those should be in anything kind of blue and purple. Okay,
- **[06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VJxmAvQX9s&t=373s)** — like blueberries, like blackberries and purple cabbage, which I mentioned is part of the
- **[06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VJxmAvQX9s&t=379s)** — sauerkraut. And of course you also have the grape as well, but they're a bit sweet. The
- **[06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VJxmAvQX9s&t=384s)** — blackberry and the blueberry are a little bit better. And the purple cabbage is also awesome.
- **[06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VJxmAvQX9s&t=388s)** — All right, next one in the list is curcumin from turmeric. Okay. And I think that one of the
- **[06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VJxmAvQX9s&t=394s)** — best ways to consume that is through curries. Okay, curries. Unfortunately, a lot of the
- **[06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VJxmAvQX9s&t=399s)** — curries had so much sugar. So if you made a curry with certain types of grass fed lamb,
- **[06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VJxmAvQX9s&t=405s)** — for example, that would be awesome. Or even grass fed beef, you would get exactly what you
- **[06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VJxmAvQX9s&t=409s)** — need. All right, number six, we need to boost quercetin. Okay. And the food that has the most
- **[06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VJxmAvQX9s&t=415s)** — quercetin is onions. I live on onions. I consume onions on a daily basis with my eggs,
- **[07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VJxmAvQX9s&t=422s)** — with my red meat. And so you're going to get a lot of quercetin when you have onions. All
- **[07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VJxmAvQX9s&t=426s)** — right. And number seven, omega-3 fatty acids, EPA and DHA. And this food would be wild caught
- **[07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VJxmAvQX9s&t=432s)** — salmon, but it's other things too. You can do any of the fatty fishes. You can also do
- **[07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VJxmAvQX9s&t=437s)** — what I like to do at least once a week or even twice a week is consume cod liver in a can.
- **[07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VJxmAvQX9s&t=444s)** — Wild caught cod liver. I love it, but I'll just have the cod liver itself. But also there's so
- **[07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VJxmAvQX9s&t=449s)** — many other benefits with omega-3 fatty acids. You're going to help reduce inflammation. And
- **[07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VJxmAvQX9s&t=453s)** — also the cod liver oil has not just this omega-3 fatty acid, but it also has vitamin A and
- **[07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VJxmAvQX9s&t=461s)** — vitamin D. So thanks for watching and I will see you in the next video.

*Click any timestamp to jump to that moment in the video*

- **[00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4zXbFp3djA&t=0s)** — There are seven very surprising signs that you're eating too much sugar.
- **[00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4zXbFp3djA&t=6s)** — I think most people know the classic signs of eating too much sugar, which is fatigue, brain fog, belly fat, cravings for carbs, cavities.
- **[00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4zXbFp3djA&t=15s)** — But I need to clarify exactly what sugar is and the difference between a sugar and a carbohydrate.
- **[00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4zXbFp3djA&t=20s)** — Because there's a lot of confusion in the area of like complex carbohydrates or simple carbohydrates or simple sugars.
- **[00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4zXbFp3djA&t=27s)** — It's a big blur for a lot of people. A carbohydrate consists of three things. Sugar, fiber, and starch.
- **[00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4zXbFp3djA&t=36s)** — But starch is the hidden sugar that no one's talking about.
- **[00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4zXbFp3djA&t=40s)** — Now, of course you have like starch in vegetables, but then you also have starch in this stuff right here, right? Or this stuff right here.
- **[00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4zXbFp3djA&t=47s)** — So what actually is starch? Starch is sugar, okay? It's just a bunch of sugar connected together.
- **[00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4zXbFp3djA&t=54s)** — And so the word that the user described it is poly, which means many saccharides, which means sugar.
- **[01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4zXbFp3djA&t=62s)** — So when you're eating starch, you're actually eating sugar, okay?
- **[01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4zXbFp3djA&t=64s)** — And when we talk about starch in the grocery store, we're talking about this stuff right here.
- **[01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4zXbFp3djA&t=69s)** — Powdered starch, we're not talking about potatoes or vegetables.
- **[01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4zXbFp3djA&t=73s)** — We're talking about ultra processed food, calorie starch.
- **[01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4zXbFp3djA&t=78s)** — And this starch will spike your blood sugars way, way, way higher than actual sugar will.
- **[01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4zXbFp3djA&t=85s)** — On the glycemic index, you have table sugar, which is 65. You have glucose, which is 100.
- **[01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4zXbFp3djA&t=92s)** — But there are starches like maltodextrin, which can go up to about 185.
- **[01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4zXbFp3djA&t=98s)** — That's like a massively high spike. And it's not just maltodextrin.
- **[01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4zXbFp3djA&t=101s)** — It's like modified food starch and modified corn starch.
- **[01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4zXbFp3djA&t=104s)** — And it's pretty well because you can make starch from corn.
- **[01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4zXbFp3djA&t=107s)** — You can make seed oils from corn.
- **[01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4zXbFp3djA&t=111s)** — And you could make sugar like in glucose syrup or corn syrup from corn.
- **[01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4zXbFp3djA&t=117s)** — You can buy one metric ton of corn for $198.
- **[02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4zXbFp3djA&t=123s)** — Now from that investment, how many boxes of corn flakes could you make?
- **[02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4zXbFp3djA&t=128s)** — Corn flakes are mostly made out of corn.
- **[02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4zXbFp3djA&t=131s)** — And you can buy those from Walmart for about $4 a box.
- **[02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4zXbFp3djA&t=135s)** — So $200 of corn will turn into 3636 boxes of corn flakes, giving you profits of $14,500.
- **[02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4zXbFp3djA&t=149s)** — That's a 7,150% profit margin.
- **[02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4zXbFp3djA&t=154s)** — Now what other investment can you get over 7,000% profit from a raw material to a finished product?
- **[02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4zXbFp3djA&t=162s)** — Can you do with meat? No. Meat has like a 30% margin.
- **[02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4zXbFp3djA&t=167s)** — So somehow corn flakes and Cheerios and even vegetable oils are not attacked for being unhealthy.
- **[02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4zXbFp3djA&t=175s)** — They're heart healthy. But meat, for example, is vilified. That'll cause cancer.
- **[03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4zXbFp3djA&t=180s)** — But anyway, I digressed from the topic, but I think it's important to know that the biggest reason for ultra processed food, aka junk food, is massive profitability.
- **[03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4zXbFp3djA&t=193s)** — All right, so now let's dive into the seven surprising signs that you're eating too much sugar.
- **[03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4zXbFp3djA&t=197s)** — Number seven is reduced collagen. When you consume too much sugar, you're going to produce less collagen.
- **[03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4zXbFp3djA&t=205s)** — And that's going to show up in loose skin, more wrinkled skin. People that eat more sugar are going to age prematurely.
- **[03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4zXbFp3djA&t=213s)** — Number six, a chronic white tongue. So you have a white tongue that just doesn't seem to go away.
- **[03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4zXbFp3djA&t=219s)** — That is a form of candida because you're eating too much sugar. You're feeding this fungus and it's continuing to grow.
- **[03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4zXbFp3djA&t=226s)** — I do not think you can get rid of this candida without eliminating sugar from the diet because it loves these simple sugars.
- **[03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4zXbFp3djA&t=232s)** — And number five, we get into chronic sinus problems. Most chronic sinus problems are a fungus called aspergillus.
- **[04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4zXbFp3djA&t=240s)** — It's the usual type and that microbe actually feeds off of sugar too.
- **[04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4zXbFp3djA&t=246s)** — So again, I don't think you're going to be able to get rid of a chronic sinus infection unless you completely get rid of sugar because it keeps living off the sugar that you consume.
- **[04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4zXbFp3djA&t=256s)** — Alright, number four, red or pink gums. You brush your teeth and you see a little pink in the toothbrush.
- **[04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4zXbFp3djA&t=264s)** — That is a very mild version of scurvy where you're having a vitamin C deficiency.
- **[04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4zXbFp3djA&t=267s)** — So when you eat sugar, you block vitamin C and one place that it shows up is in your gums.
- **[04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4zXbFp3djA&t=274s)** — Alright, number three is low testosterone. That's right. Sugar will lower testosterone.
- **[04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4zXbFp3djA&t=280s)** — That can lead to erectile dysfunction, decreased libido, and also difficulty building muscle as well because testosterone is involved in that.
- **[04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4zXbFp3djA&t=290s)** — Number two, susceptibility to infection. That's right. Having too much sugar will weaken your immune system to the point where you're more vulnerable to acquire an infection.
- **[05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4zXbFp3djA&t=300s)** — And the number one sign that you're eating too much sugar, and this is actually very surprising, high levels of adrenaline.
- **[05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4zXbFp3djA&t=306s)** — Too much sugar damages the cell's ability to make energy in the mitochondria.
- **[05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4zXbFp3djA&t=312s)** — And so the way that the body compensates for that is by increasing adrenaline, not just for energy, but to help mobilize glucose and to make new glucose for fuel.
- **[05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4zXbFp3djA&t=323s)** — That's called gluconeogenesis. High adrenaline doesn't come from mental stress.
- **[05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4zXbFp3djA&t=327s)** — It comes from physical stress or stress that happens in your cells because you're not able to make enough energy.
- **[05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4zXbFp3djA&t=335s)** — And so this is why you might notice when you're fatigued that you have a lot of nervous energy, restlessness.
- **[05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4zXbFp3djA&t=342s)** — That's the big symptom of a mitochondrial damage and a low vitamin B1 because the motor is broken.
- **[05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4zXbFp3djA&t=350s)** — And vitamin B1 is a spark plug to help activate it. And the more sugar or starch, the more requirement for B1, and then it kind of puts out the flame.
- **[06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4zXbFp3djA&t=361s)** — So now you get this nervous energy or this lactic acid buildup.
- **[06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4zXbFp3djA&t=366s)** — So this leads to insomnia, restless leg syndrome.
- **[06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4zXbFp3djA&t=370s)** — And also the adrenaline is going to affect your digestion and also increase clotting in the body's heart attack and stroke.
- **[06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4zXbFp3djA&t=378s)** — Now, since I did mention alter process food calories, if you have not seen this video on maltodextrin, you should check it out.
- **[06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4zXbFp3djA&t=386s)** — I put it up right here.

- **[00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k4gY6261jhM&t=0s)** — Out of all the healthy things that you could possibly eat, the egg is probably at the top of the list.
- **[00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k4gY6261jhM&t=7s)** — Today I want to share seven things that I would guarantee most people do not know about eggs.
- **[00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k4gY6261jhM&t=12s)** — And as I go through these items, comment down below on which one is most surprising to you.
- **[00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k4gY6261jhM&t=19s)** — Number one, 65.9% of all chickens in the United States are in cages.
- **[00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k4gY6261jhM&t=27s)** — They're not even outside the cage, even inside the barn. They live their whole life in a cage.
- **[00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k4gY6261jhM&t=32s)** — That's 65.9%. It's terrible. Now out of all the egg and chicken production,
- **[00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k4gY6261jhM&t=40s)** — only 5.8% are organic. That's less than 6%. And unfortunately, they have something called
- **[00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k4gY6261jhM&t=46s)** — industrial organic, which is still in very large barns. These poor chickens don't have
- **[00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k4gY6261jhM&t=54s)** — hardly any fresh air. They don't get the chance to go outside. And if they do go outside,
- **[00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k4gY6261jhM&t=59s)** — it's on some cement. They don't even get to touch grass. So just because something is organic
- **[01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k4gY6261jhM&t=63s)** — doesn't necessarily mean it's the ideal scene. You want organic and pasture raised. You really
- **[01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k4gY6261jhM&t=70s)** — want to know the history of that farm. In fact, there's a really good website. I'll put
- **[01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k4gY6261jhM&t=75s)** — the link down below. It's called Cornucopia. They have a rating system for eggs. So you can
- **[01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k4gY6261jhM&t=81s)** — find out which farms are the best. The next point is this. The egg yolk is the second best source
- **[01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k4gY6261jhM&t=90s)** — of vitamin A. And I'm talking about the active form of vitamin A called retinol. So the best
- **[01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k4gY6261jhM&t=95s)** — source is liver. And that also includes cow liver oil. Vitamin A is like the anti-dry eye
- **[01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k4gY6261jhM&t=102s)** — remedy. Vitamin A helps you differentiate in the dim light or the dark. So as you're driving
- **[01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k4gY6261jhM&t=107s)** — and it's dark out, you're able to differentiate and see things clearly. If you're deficient in
- **[01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k4gY6261jhM&t=113s)** — retinol, everything's going to be very, very blurry. Retinol is also the anti-infection
- **[01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k4gY6261jhM&t=119s)** — nutrient, especially for the outer part of your skin and the inner part of your skin. That
- **[02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k4gY6261jhM&t=125s)** — includes the inner part of the mouth, the esophagus, the lungs, as well as the entire
- **[02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k4gY6261jhM&t=131s)** — digestive system. Vitamin A is intimately involved in the immune system that lines
- **[02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k4gY6261jhM&t=136s)** — those surfaces. Vitamin A is important in the conversion of the inactive T4 thyroid hormone
- **[02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k4gY6261jhM&t=142s)** — to the active T3 thyroid hormone. Vitamin A can help decrease the risk of melanoma,
- **[02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k4gY6261jhM&t=149s)** — that's skin cancer, decrease wrinkles. And that probably has mostly to do with all the
- **[02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k4gY6261jhM&t=154s)** — incredibly concentrated fat-soluble nutrients in egg yolks. All right, next point. The egg
- **[02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k4gY6261jhM&t=166s)** — choline helps prevent a fatty liver. Choline supplies the brain to help make the neurotransmitter
- **[02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k4gY6261jhM&t=174s)** — acetylcholine. Choline helps support something called the parasympathetic nervous system,
- **[02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k4gY6261jhM&t=179s)** — which is responsible for rest and digest. Now, you probably think the egg white has
- **[03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k4gY6261jhM&t=185s)** — the most concentrated protein compared to the egg yolk. That's not actually true. If you look
- **[03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k4gY6261jhM&t=191s)** — at the protein per a hundred grams of that protein and we compare the egg white to the egg
- **[03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k4gY6261jhM&t=198s)** — yolk, the egg white has 11 grams of protein per hundred grams and the egg yolk has 17 grams
- **[03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k4gY6261jhM&t=206s)** — of protein per hundred grams. Now, the catch-22 about this is that there's obviously more white
- **[03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k4gY6261jhM&t=213s)** — than there is yolk, so you're going to have a little more protein. But that yolk is super
- **[03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k4gY6261jhM&t=218s)** — concentrated with actually more protein per volume. All right, next point. You may have known
- **[03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k4gY6261jhM&t=224s)** — this, but I just want to put it out there. The yolk contains the majority of nutrients,
- **[03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k4gY6261jhM&t=230s)** — okay? Except for two. And I'm talking about vitamins and minerals. The egg white does have
- **[03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k4gY6261jhM&t=236s)** — a little bit more B2 and B3, but if we look at all the other minerals and all the other
- **[04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k4gY6261jhM&t=242s)** — vitamins, it's in the egg yolk. And it's funny because sometimes people will, you know,
- **[04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k4gY6261jhM&t=247s)** — cook up egg whites and throw out the egg yolk. I mean, that's like you're throwing out the
- **[04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k4gY6261jhM&t=252s)** — nutrition. Well, that relates to the next point about this. They might throw away the
- **[04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k4gY6261jhM&t=256s)** — egg yolk because they don't want the cholesterol. Well, there is no research
- **[04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k4gY6261jhM&t=260s)** — that indicates that eating eggs are going to negatively affect your cholesterol in any way,
- **[04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k4gY6261jhM&t=267s)** — shape, or form. So now I want you to comment down below on the item that surprised you the
- **[04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k4gY6261jhM&t=272s)** — Now because of the censoring and the suppressing of the algorithms on YouTube, it's becoming
- **[04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k4gY6261jhM&t=278s)** — more difficult to find my content. And there's a lot of content that I cannot put on YouTube,

- **[00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jZqe7RJ73M&t=0s)** — I want to show you three simple but very important trace minerals that can hopefully reverse alopecia.
- **[00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jZqe7RJ73M&t=10s)** — Now, alopecia is an autoimmune disease that directly causes patches of hair loss throughout your scalp.
- **[00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jZqe7RJ73M&t=17s)** — And there are other autoimmune diseases like Hashimoto's and lupus that can also do the same thing.
- **[00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jZqe7RJ73M&t=24s)** — How can a trace mineral deficiency cause you to lose your hair?
- **[00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jZqe7RJ73M&t=28s)** — Well, trace minerals are minerals needed in very tiny amounts. But just because they're needed in
- **[00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jZqe7RJ73M&t=35s)** — tiny amounts doesn't mean they don't have a profound effect over your body. These trace
- **[00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jZqe7RJ73M&t=41s)** — minerals are essential for a lot of different things. Regarding hair, they're essential in
- **[00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jZqe7RJ73M&t=46s)** — preventing autoimmune diseases, also in treating autoimmune diseases, as well as their effect
- **[00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jZqe7RJ73M&t=52s)** — directly in building up the hair protein itself. You know, when we think about protein, people
- **[00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jZqe7RJ73M&t=59s)** — think about muscles, but there are a lot of other types of proteins in your body that people
- **[01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jZqe7RJ73M&t=64s)** — don't consider proteins. Enzymes, for example. And I'm not just talking about digestive enzymes.
- **[01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jZqe7RJ73M&t=70s)** — I'm talking about the enzymes that are involved in your biochemistry that help
- **[01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jZqe7RJ73M&t=74s)** — make hormones, that help do the work of the body. Relating to the thyroid, you actually have
- **[01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jZqe7RJ73M&t=80s)** — make body tissue. Regarding thyroid hormones, you have enzymes that actually can convert the
- **[01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jZqe7RJ73M&t=87s)** — inactive thyroid hormone, which is T4, to the active thyroid hormone, which is T3. And then
- **[01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jZqe7RJ73M&t=94s)** — you have proteins involved in your immune system that keep your immune system strong, that
- **[01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jZqe7RJ73M&t=99s)** — prevent you from a self-attack or the creation of antibodies against your own tissues. And out
- **[01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jZqe7RJ73M&t=106s)** — the minerals, there's three trace minerals that are very important to make sure that you get
- **[01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jZqe7RJ73M&t=112s)** — in your diet and understand other things that can create the deficiency. So let's first talk
- **[01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jZqe7RJ73M&t=118s)** — about iodine. You probably already know iodine is necessary to make thyroid hormones
- **[02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jZqe7RJ73M&t=123s)** — through enzymes. And as you're deficient in iodine, you can't make thyroid hormones. And
- **[02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jZqe7RJ73M&t=128s)** — when we're dealing with a thyroid autoimmune problem, there's some data out there that
- **[02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jZqe7RJ73M&t=134s)** — too much iodine can cause an autoimmune disease. But there's overwhelming evidence
- **[02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jZqe7RJ73M&t=139s)** — that that's actually not true. It's usually a deficiency of iodine that can create more of a
- **[02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jZqe7RJ73M&t=145s)** — problem than an excess. An average person is deficient iodine because it's hard to get
- **[02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jZqe7RJ73M&t=150s)** — from our food, because it's not in our soils. So unless they eat something from the sea,
- **[02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jZqe7RJ73M&t=155s)** — they're usually not going to get enough iodine unless they're taking something like
- **[02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jZqe7RJ73M&t=159s)** — sea kelp or seaweed, or in parts of the world where you eat a lot of seaweed,
- **[02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jZqe7RJ73M&t=165s)** — which is definitely not in America. We primarily get our iodine from sea salt. And even that,
- **[02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jZqe7RJ73M&t=170s)** — we probably don't get enough iodine to satisfy all the requirements that we need. When someone
- **[02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jZqe7RJ73M&t=175s)** — is deficient in iodine, they get an out of control estrogen level, because iodine helps
- **[03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jZqe7RJ73M&t=182s)** — buffer estrogen. And when they don't have enough iodine and they get too much estrogen,
- **[03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jZqe7RJ73M&t=187s)** — they can develop cysts on the ovaries, they can develop fibrocystic breasts, they can even
- **[03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jZqe7RJ73M&t=193s)** — develop nodules on the thyroid gland itself. Another interesting thing about iodine is that
- **[03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jZqe7RJ73M&t=198s)** — you can be deficient not from your diet, but from other things interfering with the
- **[03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jZqe7RJ73M&t=203s)** — absorption of iodine, like fluoride. Whether you're getting some type of dental whitening
- **[03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jZqe7RJ73M&t=211s)** — type therapy, or you're drinking tap water with fluoride, as well as chlorine. Chlorine
- **[03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jZqe7RJ73M&t=217s)** — also interferes with iodine. So there's three big things that can interfere with iodine.
- **[03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jZqe7RJ73M&t=223s)** — Fluoride, chloride, and bromine, which is in a lot of enriched flour products, as in the
- **[03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jZqe7RJ73M&t=229s)** — bread, pasta, cereal, crackers, biscuits, things like that, which you're probably not
- **[03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jZqe7RJ73M&t=234s)** — eating because you've been watching my channel. But there's another source of fluoride that you
- **[03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jZqe7RJ73M&t=239s)** — may not suspect. In fact, 20% of all medications out there are fluoride based, including Prozac,
- **[04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jZqe7RJ73M&t=250s)** — statin drugs, other antidepressants, certain antibiotics, certain antacid medications,
- **[04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jZqe7RJ73M&t=257s)** — as well as certain anti-inflammatories all contain fluoride, which can interfere with iodine.
- **[04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jZqe7RJ73M&t=264s)** — And by the way, as far as the amount of iodine you need on a daily basis, I would
- **[04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jZqe7RJ73M&t=269s)** — recommend about 200 micrograms, okay? Not milligrams, micrograms. Iodine is very, very
- **[04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jZqe7RJ73M&t=275s)** — important in a growing child. If a child or an infant is deficient, they can develop all
- **[04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jZqe7RJ73M&t=281s)** — sorts of cognitive deficiencies. But sea kelp, seafood, sea salt, is all good to take if you
- **[04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jZqe7RJ73M&t=289s)** — want to build up your iodine. Now the next trace mineral is called zinc, okay? Zinc, as
- **[04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jZqe7RJ73M&t=293s)** — you know, is very, very important in your immune system. And when people get autoimmune diseases,
- **[05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jZqe7RJ73M&t=300s)** — they're usually deficient in zinc. And this zinc deficiency allows a condition where your
- **[05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jZqe7RJ73M&t=306s)** — immune system can get out of control. But the best bioavailable sources of zinc is from meat,
- **[05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jZqe7RJ73M&t=312s)** — fish, and eggs, not plant-based sources. Plant-based sources are not good sources of zinc.
- **[05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jZqe7RJ73M&t=318s)** — One of the most common causes of a zinc deficiency is by consuming too much cereal, okay? Cereal has
- **[05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jZqe7RJ73M&t=325s)** — phytates, just like any grains, and these phytates block minerals, especially zinc. Zinc is
- **[05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jZqe7RJ73M&t=332s)** — one of the most important minerals for your immune system. And without it, you're very,
- **[05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jZqe7RJ73M&t=335s)** — very susceptible to infections and other problems, including inflammation. But zinc directly
- **[05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jZqe7RJ73M&t=341s)** — is involved in certain enzymes, which are proteins, that actually build up your hair.
- **[05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jZqe7RJ73M&t=349s)** — And as far as the amount of zinc, if you were going to take it as a supplement,
- **[05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jZqe7RJ73M&t=352s)** — I would recommend about 50 milligrams. But if you're consuming things like red meat,
- **[05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jZqe7RJ73M&t=358s)** — or even beef liver, or even oysters, or seafood, chances are you're getting enough zinc.
- **[06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jZqe7RJ73M&t=364s)** — But if you're exposed to mercury, that can increase the need for more zinc. If you consume
- **[06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jZqe7RJ73M&t=371s)** — a lot of sugar, or you're exposed to a lot of stress, your requirement for zinc goes
- **[06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jZqe7RJ73M&t=377s)** — dramatically up. Okay, the next mineral is selenium. Selenium is involved in 35 different
- **[06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jZqe7RJ73M&t=383s)** — proteins, okay? And again, I'm talking about those protein enzymes that do most the work
- **[06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jZqe7RJ73M&t=390s)** — in the body. If you're deficient in selenium, you can start getting graying of the hair.
- **[06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jZqe7RJ73M&t=395s)** — You can start developing alopecia directly. Or a deficiency of selenium can lead to
- **[06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jZqe7RJ73M&t=401s)** — selenium is a catch-22 because deficiency can create a problem with alopecia, and an excess or a
- **[06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jZqe7RJ73M&t=408s)** — toxicity can create alopecia. So it's one of those trace minerals that you just need just the
- **[06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jZqe7RJ73M&t=413s)** — right amount. You don't want to take more. More is not better. Mercury can also interfere
- **[06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jZqe7RJ73M&t=417s)** — with selenium. A lot of women who are pregnant are deficient in selenium, not to mention
- **[07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jZqe7RJ73M&t=424s)** — zinc and even iodine. So this is just another reason why if someone is going through pregnancy,
- **[07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jZqe7RJ73M&t=429s)** — it's so important to take these trace minerals. Now there are also genes that help you absorb
- **[07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jZqe7RJ73M&t=436s)** — selenium. And there also could be a genetic mutation that causes difficulty in getting enough
- **[07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jZqe7RJ73M&t=444s)** — selenium. So in this case, if you're just getting the minimum amount, you may have
- **[07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jZqe7RJ73M&t=449s)** — deficiency symptoms. And you can get a genetic test to determine this. And I've been doing a
- **[07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jZqe7RJ73M&t=459s)** — genetic problems with minerals and vitamins. And this especially relates to like B12,
- **[07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jZqe7RJ73M&t=467s)** — folate, vitamin D, and even vitamin C. The other interesting thing about selenium is that it seems to
- **[07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jZqe7RJ73M&t=474s)** — control vitamin E levels. It protects a person from becoming deficient in vitamin E.
- **[08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jZqe7RJ73M&t=481s)** — Maybe because selenium is a precursor for glutathione, which is a powerful antioxidant,
- **[08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jZqe7RJ73M&t=486s)** — and other antioxidants as well. The amount of selenium a person needs would be between 50
- **[08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jZqe7RJ73M&t=493s)** — micrograms to 200 micrograms, which really is a tiny amount. One Brazil nut is enough to
- **[08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jZqe7RJ73M&t=502s)** — satisfy what you would need. Don't eat the whole bag. Okay, just one at a time per day,
- **[08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jZqe7RJ73M&t=507s)** — because you can actually get a toxic amount fairly quick. There are other nutrients as
- **[08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jZqe7RJ73M&t=513s)** — that greatly influence the hair. And I'm just going to quickly run down the list.
- **[08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jZqe7RJ73M&t=517s)** — Iron, okay, and B12, primarily because of the function of what they can do to increase your
- **[08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jZqe7RJ73M&t=523s)** — oxygen levels and your blood levels, your red blood cell levels, to your scalp. Without
- **[08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jZqe7RJ73M&t=529s)** — this blood and oxygen to the scalp, the roots of the hair can't survive. And probably
- **[08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jZqe7RJ73M&t=534s)** — the biggest reason why women are deficient in iron is because of menstruation. And if
- **[08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jZqe7RJ73M&t=539s)** — that's your problem, I put a link down below of how to correct that specific issue.
- **[09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jZqe7RJ73M&t=543s)** — Regarding B12, it could be that you're a vegan, or it could also be that you have genetic issue
- **[09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jZqe7RJ73M&t=549s)** — with a problem called methylation. For more information, I put a link down below with that
- **[09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jZqe7RJ73M&t=554s)** — too. Now, vitamin D, very, very important with any autoimmune disease because it reduces
- **[09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jZqe7RJ73M&t=561s)** — inflammation. And even though a vitamin D deficiency doesn't cause alopecia directly,
- **[09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jZqe7RJ73M&t=568s)** — it can cause a loss of body hair, which is more of an alopecia for the entire body,
- **[09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jZqe7RJ73M&t=574s)** — but not necessarily just on the scalp. But if you have any type of autoimmune problem,
- **[09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jZqe7RJ73M&t=578s)** — you should be taking vitamin D on a daily basis, roughly about 20,000 IUs. Now let's
- **[09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jZqe7RJ73M&t=584s)** — talk about biotin for a second. A lot of people take biotin in very large amounts.
- **[09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jZqe7RJ73M&t=591s)** — Biotin is vitamin B7, and it's involved in protein synthesis, especially the hair and the
- **[09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jZqe7RJ73M&t=597s)** — nails. But if you're deficient in biotin, your hair is going to be very dry and frizzy. You
- **[10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jZqe7RJ73M&t=602s)** — might experience shedding of the hair. You may have just general hair loss. A couple reasons why
- **[10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jZqe7RJ73M&t=607s)** — people are deficient in biotin, because your gut flora makes it. It could be you have taken
- **[10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jZqe7RJ73M&t=614s)** — antibiotics. It could be you consume a lot of raw eggs, which by the way, the egg yolk
- **[10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jZqe7RJ73M&t=620s)** — is the thing that has the most biotin. But if you have raw eggs, there's a certain
- **[10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jZqe7RJ73M&t=625s)** — compound in there that locks up your biotin. So you could become deficient. Another cause would
- **[10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jZqe7RJ73M&t=630s)** — be pregnancy, which increases the demand for biotin. Or you may have a genetic problem
- **[10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jZqe7RJ73M&t=637s)** — with a certain protein that helps you absorb biotin. And you have a problem with that,
- **[10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jZqe7RJ73M&t=644s)** — which means you just need a little bit more. And lastly, folate. This is interesting because
- **[10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jZqe7RJ73M&t=648s)** — a folate deficiency is a very common deficiency. Even though folate comes from dark, leafy green
- **[10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jZqe7RJ73M&t=654s)** — vegetables, a lot of people have a problem with a certain gene called MTHFR, which requires
- **[11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jZqe7RJ73M&t=661s)** — them to consume more folate, not folic acid, but folate, so they can start to build up some
- **[11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jZqe7RJ73M&t=669s)** — of these proteins, including hair. Now I talked about one problem with hair loss. If you
- **[11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jZqe7RJ73M&t=674s)** — haven't seen this video on hair loss, which covers other things, you should check it out. I

- **[00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-2CheWxDlY&t=0s)** — Today I'm going to talk about anxiety and stress.
- **[00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-2CheWxDlY&t=5s)** — And I'm going to use one of my favorite books, a dictionary.
- **[00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-2CheWxDlY&t=10s)** — This is it right here. Look at this.
- **[00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-2CheWxDlY&t=12s)** — Oxford Advanced Learners English to Chinese Dictionary, 7th edition.
- **[00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-2CheWxDlY&t=18s)** — I have like five of these.
- **[00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-2CheWxDlY&t=19s)** — Now, why do I have this? Is this about me learning Chinese?
- **[00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-2CheWxDlY&t=24s)** — No, no, no. I love words.
- **[00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-2CheWxDlY&t=27s)** — And you can discover all sorts of things about the derivation of words and the meanings of words.
- **[00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-2CheWxDlY&t=32s)** — Now, what's cool about this dictionary is that it's for Chinese students learning English.
- **[00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-2CheWxDlY&t=37s)** — So the definitions are really good. They're very simple.
- **[00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-2CheWxDlY&t=41s)** — Versus other dictionaries that you have to literally look up words within definitions and then more words within those definitions.
- **[00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-2CheWxDlY&t=49s)** — So this is a really good dictionary just to give you the meaning of the word.
- **[00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-2CheWxDlY&t=54s)** — And so what we want to do today is kind of take you through various definitions of words, OK, in relationship to anxiety and stress.
- **[01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-2CheWxDlY&t=63s)** — And I'm going to show you something that's really interesting about this because we can learn a lot about this.
- **[01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-2CheWxDlY&t=68s)** — The first word we're going to look up is this definition of anxiety. What does anxiety mean?
- **[01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-2CheWxDlY&t=75s)** — OK, anxiety is the state of feeling nervous or worried about something bad is going to happen.
- **[01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-2CheWxDlY&t=81s)** — So basically anxiety is you're worried about something. We better look up the word worry.
- **[01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-2CheWxDlY&t=86s)** — OK, worry. To keep thinking about unpleasant things that might happen or about problems that you have.
- **[01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-2CheWxDlY&t=96s)** — So when you're worrying, you're really thinking about things that may or may not happen.
- **[01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-2CheWxDlY&t=102s)** — And usually you're not worried about good things. They're unpleasant things and they're usually related to a problem.
- **[01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-2CheWxDlY&t=108s)** — So when you're in this anxiety state, you are thinking about if something is going to happen or maybe not happen, usually related to something unpleasant, about some problem.
- **[02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-2CheWxDlY&t=121s)** — So let's just look at this word thinking for a moment. To use your mind to consider something, to form connected ideas, to try to solve problems.
- **[02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-2CheWxDlY&t=133s)** — So the one that actually fits this is to solve problems, right?
- **[02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-2CheWxDlY&t=137s)** — So what a person is really doing when they have anxiety and they're worrying is they're thinking about problems.
- **[02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-2CheWxDlY&t=144s)** — OK, problem. A thing that is difficult to deal with or to understand.
- **[02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-2CheWxDlY&t=152s)** — So in theory, the more you understand about something, the less of a problem it is, right?
- **[02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-2CheWxDlY&t=157s)** — Especially as this relates to worrying because when you're worrying, you probably are left without understanding about something.
- **[02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-2CheWxDlY&t=165s)** — I'll give you an example. Let's say someone calls you up and leaves a message and you listen to the message and it says,
- **[02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-2CheWxDlY&t=173s)** — Call me back. I have some bad news, but you can't get a hold of them.
- **[02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-2CheWxDlY&t=178s)** — What's going to happen all night? You're going to be worrying about something. You're going to be thinking about this problem because you don't understand it.
- **[03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-2CheWxDlY&t=186s)** — So without understanding the problem continues on and on and on.
- **[03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-2CheWxDlY&t=189s)** — OK, there's a second definition. A question that can be answered by using logical thought or mathematics.
- **[03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-2CheWxDlY&t=199s)** — So of course, this relates to probably a math problem, but also it can relate to what you're doing when you're thinking about problems.
- **[03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-2CheWxDlY&t=206s)** — You're trying to solve them, right? And they're on your mind and you're going through them and try to come up with a solution.
- **[03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-2CheWxDlY&t=213s)** — All right, so let's look up this word speculation. What does it say here?
- **[03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-2CheWxDlY&t=216s)** — The act of forming opinions about what has happened or what might happen without knowing all the facts.
- **[03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-2CheWxDlY&t=225s)** — The news is famous for this, right? Thousands of people might die from the storm coming in.
- **[03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-2CheWxDlY&t=232s)** — Well, that's not really the facts. That's just an opinion about something, right?
- **[03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-2CheWxDlY&t=237s)** — The storm is coming in, but we don't know if a thousand people are going to die. But that's a great way to give you a problem.
- **[04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-2CheWxDlY&t=245s)** — And of course, the news does it to get attention because facts don't really sell, but speculation does.
- **[04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-2CheWxDlY&t=254s)** — There are certain things that I can control and there are certain things that I can't.
- **[04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-2CheWxDlY&t=257s)** — But I like to solve problems based on actual facts, right? Because there's another thing that the news gives people.
- **[04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-2CheWxDlY&t=263s)** — That word is called sensationalism, okay? A way of getting people's interest by using shocking words or by presenting facts and events
- **[04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-2CheWxDlY&t=273s)** — as worse or more shocking than they really are. And of course they do it because it sells and it can actually rob your attention.
- **[04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-2CheWxDlY&t=283s)** — And so when you read headlines, what do you open up? The ones that are most shocking.
- **[04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-2CheWxDlY&t=287s)** — And then of course we have the last word, which is conjecture. Conjecture is opinions not based on knowledge. You're basically just guessing.
- **[04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-2CheWxDlY&t=296s)** — A lot of times they're worrying about stuff that is just completely utterly manufactured and made up.
- **[05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-2CheWxDlY&t=301s)** — A large percentage of it is based on opinion, speculation, exaggeration.
- **[05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-2CheWxDlY&t=307s)** — When you have perceived threat, danger, negativity, problems, guess what happens to your adrenal glands?
- **[05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-2CheWxDlY&t=317s)** — You start pumping out adrenaline and cortisol. What do you think that does to your immune system? You're going to age prematurely.
- **[05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-2CheWxDlY&t=324s)** — The reason I'm doing this video is just to bring up some interesting observations on how much time an average person spends worrying about things that maybe they shouldn't be worrying about.
- **[05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-2CheWxDlY&t=337s)** — Just try to get more facts about the thing, to get more understanding about something.
- **[05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-2CheWxDlY&t=343s)** — And take vitamin B1, and that can greatly help your physical body and pull you out of this nervous tension.
- **[05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-2CheWxDlY&t=350s)** — Taking adaptogens like ashwagandha is something that is really helpful.
- **[05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-2CheWxDlY&t=355s)** — Because if you think about it, what do adaptogens actually do? They strengthen your ability to adapt to stress.
- **[06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-2CheWxDlY&t=362s)** — Go for long walks, continue to exercise, get out in nature, and limit the amount of exposure that you have to speculation, to the news in general.
- **[06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-2CheWxDlY&t=374s)** — Now I did another interesting video on this that I think relates to it. And I put that up right here. I think you'll enjoy it.

- **[00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rsl0Gsqgf94&t=0s)** — A lot of people are concerned about heart attacks and strokes. What about an aneurysm? An aneurysm
- **[00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rsl0Gsqgf94&t=5s)** — can cause a stroke and it can definitely cause you to die. So today I'm going to teach you a
- **[00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rsl0Gsqgf94&t=10s)** — little bit about aneurysms, what's involved, and what you need to do to prevent aneurysms.
- **[00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rsl0Gsqgf94&t=16s)** — The first symptom or early signs of an aneurysm is there is no symptom. Why? Because an
- **[00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rsl0Gsqgf94&t=22s)** — aneurysm is just like this bulging dilation of your vascular system. And unless it presses
- **[00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rsl0Gsqgf94&t=28s)** — on something, you're not going to feel really any major symptoms at all until it ruptures.
- **[00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rsl0Gsqgf94&t=35s)** — And when it ruptures, you have a hole in your artery. So the blood's going to come out.
- **[00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rsl0Gsqgf94&t=40s)** — And if this happens in your brain, you get a stroke. And potentially you might have a limited
- **[00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rsl0Gsqgf94&t=44s)** — time to get to the emergency room to do something about it, but not always. So I
- **[00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rsl0Gsqgf94&t=50s)** — think it's important to talk about aneurysms and what it is and what you can do to prevent
- **[00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rsl0Gsqgf94&t=54s)** — You can have an aneurysm in the brain, around the heart, in the aorta, or in the kidneys,
- **[01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rsl0Gsqgf94&t=60s)** — many different places. And there's also a simple test that's highly correlated to if a person
- **[01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rsl0Gsqgf94&t=66s)** — has an aneurysm. And that is called the thumb to palm test. So if you just take your
- **[01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rsl0Gsqgf94&t=70s)** — hand right now, and you take your thumb across your hand like this, and if your thumb can
- **[01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rsl0Gsqgf94&t=77s)** — extend to the outer part of your hand, that can mean that you have extra loose collagen,
- **[01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rsl0Gsqgf94&t=82s)** — and there's a high correlation between people that have this loose collagen and aneurysms.
- **[01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rsl0Gsqgf94&t=90s)** — Now it doesn't mean that you have an aneurysm. And if you can't move this over here, that
- **[01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rsl0Gsqgf94&t=93s)** — doesn't mean you don't have an aneurysm. It's just something to look at. In fact, do this
- **[01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rsl0Gsqgf94&t=98s)** — test right now and comment down below if you can extend your thumb past your hand right here.
- **[01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rsl0Gsqgf94&t=104s)** — I'm really curious to know. So let's say, for example, you don't have loose ligament
- **[01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rsl0Gsqgf94&t=109s)** — structure, and that's not the cause. What are some of the causes? Well, we have smoking. Now
- **[01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rsl0Gsqgf94&t=115s)** — you're probably wondering like, wait a second, smoking goes into the lungs, not the blood,
- **[01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rsl0Gsqgf94&t=119s)** — right? Well, where do you think the oxygen and CO2 is being exchanged when you breathe?
- **[02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rsl0Gsqgf94&t=124s)** — Your lungs directly connect with your capillaries, which go right into your blood.
- **[02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rsl0Gsqgf94&t=128s)** — And if that thing is smoke, you're going to get carbon dioxide, you're going to get a lot
- **[02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rsl0Gsqgf94&t=132s)** — of different chemicals that can start to irritate the lining of the artery. In fact,
- **[02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rsl0Gsqgf94&t=138s)** — smokers have a 4x greater risk of getting an aneurysm than those non-smokers. And then,
- **[02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rsl0Gsqgf94&t=145s)** — of course, we have alcohol because there are certain byproducts and chemicals that can
- **[02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rsl0Gsqgf94&t=149s)** — irritate the lining of the arteries. And I'm talking about like a chronic drinker, not
- **[02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rsl0Gsqgf94&t=154s)** — occasionally. And then, of course, we have diabetics and people who consume a lot of
- **[02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rsl0Gsqgf94&t=158s)** — sugar. So if we expose this layer of the inside of the artery to sugar and hidden sugars,
- **[02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rsl0Gsqgf94&t=165s)** — like in starches, right? Modified food starch, maltodextrin, which is in a lot of different
- **[02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rsl0Gsqgf94&t=170s)** — foods, that can create oxidation and damage to the inside of the arteries if you're
- **[02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rsl0Gsqgf94&t=175s)** — consuming it on a regular basis. And then you have seed oils. And that's another thing
- **[03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rsl0Gsqgf94&t=181s)** — that can create chronic inflammation. And this next one is very interesting. Dental
- **[03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rsl0Gsqgf94&t=186s)** — bacteria. Like bacteria and anapses in your gums. They found that in the aneurysm. And
- **[03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rsl0Gsqgf94&t=193s)** — they also find it in plaque. So apparently that can leak out into your vascular system
- **[03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rsl0Gsqgf94&t=197s)** — and end up creating inflammation because there's an infection going on. So that's another
- **[03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rsl0Gsqgf94&t=203s)** — cause of inflammation in this layer in the heart. Anything that creates chronic
- **[03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rsl0Gsqgf94&t=209s)** — oxidation or inflammation can start to weaken this arterial system. And then on top of that,
- **[03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rsl0Gsqgf94&t=215s)** — if you have high blood pressure, now we get all this pressure with all this inflammation.
- **[03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rsl0Gsqgf94&t=221s)** — Now it starts to break down your arteries to the point where it's starting to bulge out. And so
- **[03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rsl0Gsqgf94&t=225s)** — you really have to kind of just look at potentially what it could be for you. If you
- **[03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rsl0Gsqgf94&t=231s)** — have high blood pressure, for example, you want to take more potassium, magnesium,
- **[03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rsl0Gsqgf94&t=236s)** — vitamin D. Those are the three things that will help bring the pressure down,
- **[04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rsl0Gsqgf94&t=241s)** — including going on a low carb diet. There's something else that can cause an aneurysm. It's
- **[04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rsl0Gsqgf94&t=246s)** — common, but it's a copper deficiency. Copper is necessary in helping you build collagen.
- **[04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rsl0Gsqgf94&t=253s)** — If you're deficient in copper, you can't make the connective tissue to make everything nice and
- **[04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rsl0Gsqgf94&t=259s)** — strong and firm. Copper does a lot of other things too. It actually acts as an anti-fungal,
- **[04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rsl0Gsqgf94&t=263s)** — antibacterial. And one way to create a copper deficiency is to take a lot of zinc for a long
- **[04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rsl0Gsqgf94&t=272s)** — time without the copper. So you need that ratio of zinc to copper. So what are all the things
- **[04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rsl0Gsqgf94&t=278s)** — that you can do to prevent an aneurysm? Well, of course, avoiding those things that create
- **[04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rsl0Gsqgf94&t=283s)** — inflammation, start to consume antioxidants. That can be in the form of herbs or vitamin D,
- **[04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rsl0Gsqgf94&t=291s)** — or vitamin B, vitamin C, or foods with those nutrients, vegetables. And then to counteract a
- **[04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rsl0Gsqgf94&t=298s)** — the seed oils, we need the omega-3 fatty acids. And out of all the foods that are very high in
- **[05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rsl0Gsqgf94&t=303s)** — omega-3, you have the carnivore oil, you also have fish, as in salmon. Vitamin D is also very,
- **[05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rsl0Gsqgf94&t=310s)** — very important. Vitamin D helps to prevent leaky arteries. You can also have a leaky
- **[05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rsl0Gsqgf94&t=318s)** — blood-brain barrier. And vitamin D prevents that, which is interesting. It's a very powerful
- **[05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rsl0Gsqgf94&t=324s)** — anti-inflammatory. So getting a lot of sun is very important without getting burned. And in the
- **[05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rsl0Gsqgf94&t=330s)** — wintertime, you take your vitamin D3. Minimally 10,000 I use. And probably one of the most
- **[05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rsl0Gsqgf94&t=336s)** — important things to do regular exercise, because this way you can keep strengthening the arterial
- **[05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rsl0Gsqgf94&t=344s)** — system over time. So it lasts a long time. So it becomes elastic. So it doesn't become weak.
- **[05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rsl0Gsqgf94&t=350s)** — And exercise in general increases antioxidants that you make yourself.

## Video 19: Are Expensive Eggs Really Worth It?

- **[00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XDIC59gPeo&t=0s)** — Which one of these would you buy? The $2 per dozen version or the $7 a dozen version? Well,
- **[00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XDIC59gPeo&t=8s)** — I have an excellent presentation for you because I am an egg-spert at this topic. Of course, it's not
- **[00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XDIC59gPeo&t=16s)** — an exact science, but I want to share with you some data on eggs that I think will help you
- **[00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XDIC59gPeo&t=22s)** — choose the right type of egg. So when evaluating eggs, there's a lot of these different terms
- **[00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XDIC59gPeo&t=27s)** — that are confusing. I'm going to make it extremely simple. The first part of this is just going to be
- **[00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XDIC59gPeo&t=31s)** — mainly talking about space. How much space the chicken gets. Okay. Unfortunately, 65% of all
- **[00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XDIC59gPeo&t=39s)** — chickens are in cages. Caged chickens, which is the great majority of all the chickens, are
- **[00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XDIC59gPeo&t=46s)** — required to get at least 67 square inches. So that's a little bit over 8 inches by 8 inches
- **[00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XDIC59gPeo&t=54s)** — of space. Then you get something else called New California Caged Chickens. They get another
- **[01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XDIC59gPeo&t=60s)** — couple inches. So that's like a space of 10 and a half inches by 10 and a half inches.
- **[01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XDIC59gPeo&t=64s)** — And again, not even a square foot of space. Then you graduate into something called cage-free.
- **[01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XDIC59gPeo&t=70s)** — Right? They're out of the cage. But the question is, how much space do they usually get?
- **[01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XDIC59gPeo&t=75s)** — They're in a barn with a lot of other chickens. Cage-free chickens get 12 inches by
- **[01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XDIC59gPeo&t=80s)** — 12 inches. So they get a square foot. Then we get something called free range or something
- **[01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XDIC59gPeo&t=85s)** — called free roaming. So they get to go around the barn and they get actually two feet by two
- **[01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XDIC59gPeo&t=91s)** — feet. So it's 24 inches by 24 inches. A little more space. And I think they're also allowed to
- **[01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XDIC59gPeo&t=98s)** — go outside the barn. There's some hole outside the barn. I don't know when they have access
- **[01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XDIC59gPeo&t=102s)** — to that. I think when they're laying. And I also don't know if they have the option of
- **[01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XDIC59gPeo&t=106s)** — stepping on actual grass or just cement. Then we get something called pasture-raised.
- **[01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XDIC59gPeo&t=110s)** — Not pasteurized. These chickens get a little bit more than 10 feet by 10 feet. So that's
- **[01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XDIC59gPeo&t=115s)** — a lot better. Now, if you could find a farmer close to you, maybe at the farmer's market,
- **[02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XDIC59gPeo&t=121s)** — they're going to probably get a lot more space. I think that's the chickens that you
- **[02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XDIC59gPeo&t=124s)** — really want to get their eggs from. Because when we're dealing with space,
- **[02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XDIC59gPeo&t=128s)** — as you collapse the space in on these chickens, you raise up cortisol, adrenaline.
- **[02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XDIC59gPeo&t=135s)** — It's not healthy. It's not going to contribute to the health of that chicken or the health of the
- **[02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XDIC59gPeo&t=140s)** — egg. Chickens were not designed to live without space. Just like you're not designed to live
- **[02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XDIC59gPeo&t=146s)** — in a small area of space. Now, when somebody says natural, right? These eggs are fresh and
- **[02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XDIC59gPeo&t=153s)** — natural. That does not mean anything. You can pretty much ignore that. And also ignore the
- **[02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XDIC59gPeo&t=159s)** — different grades. It doesn't tell you how healthy that chicken is either. What you want
- **[02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XDIC59gPeo&t=163s)** — is pasture raised. Now, as far as the feed goes, you have conventional feeds. Sometimes they'll say
- **[02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XDIC59gPeo&t=172s)** — it's vegetarian feed versus what else are you going to feed them? Chicken. Conventional
- **[02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XDIC59gPeo&t=178s)** — chickens are fed corn and soy. GMO. That means they're sprayed with chemicals. And
- **[03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XDIC59gPeo&t=184s)** — that also means that they're getting a tremendous amount of omega-6 fatty acids.
- **[03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XDIC59gPeo&t=188s)** — An average egg is not low in this omega-6 fatty acid. Now, you have this ratio. You have the
- **[03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XDIC59gPeo&t=195s)** — ratios of omega-3 fats to omega-6 fatty acids. And sometimes companies will spike the omega-3
- **[03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XDIC59gPeo&t=203s)** — by adding fish feed or fish meal and things like that. And that's fine. But at the same
- **[03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XDIC59gPeo&t=209s)** — time, they don't lower the omega-6 fatty acids. Now, why is it so important to not
- **[03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XDIC59gPeo&t=214s)** — so much omega-6 fatty acid? Because at least between 25% and 30% of our overall calories
- **[03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XDIC59gPeo&t=223s)** — in the U.S. is omega-6 seed oils. So adding more omega-6 is not a good thing. These foods
- **[03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XDIC59gPeo&t=232s)** — high in omega-6 fatty acids really mess with your mitochondria, your energy factory. They
- **[03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XDIC59gPeo&t=237s)** — leach into the nervous system. They affect the heart. They create inflammation. Now,
- **[04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XDIC59gPeo&t=242s)** — I personally raise chickens for their eggs. And we get a lot of eggs from those chickens. I mean,
- **[04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XDIC59gPeo&t=247s)** — we probably get maybe nine eggs a day. We can't even eat that much. In nature, these chickens
- **[04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XDIC59gPeo&t=253s)** — are meant to consume worms, bugs, things like that. And if you're raising chickens,
- **[04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XDIC59gPeo&t=258s)** — it's very difficult to have enough worms or bugs for them. So what I was using is an organic
- **[04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XDIC59gPeo&t=263s)** — grain mix for quite some time until I had my eggs tested. And I was kind of shocked to
- **[04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XDIC59gPeo&t=270s)** — find out that the eggs were pretty high in omega-6 fatty acids. So what did I do? I found a type
- **[04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XDIC59gPeo&t=277s)** — of feed that's still organic, but it's no soy, no corn, organic peas, organic barley, oats,
- **[04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XDIC59gPeo&t=285s)** — wheat, fish mail, calcium, vitamins, minerals. And then I also enhance it with some freeze-dried
- **[04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XDIC59gPeo&t=292s)** — insects, as well as allowing the chickens to roam around and get some space. And so now
- **[04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XDIC59gPeo&t=297s)** — omega-6 fats are much, much lower. Now, of course, you might not have the space where you can
- **[05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XDIC59gPeo&t=302s)** — actually have chickens. You might not be close to a farmer's market. So what you want to do,
- **[05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XDIC59gPeo&t=307s)** — you want to find a store that sells pasture-raised organic eggs. And I'll tell you,
- **[05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XDIC59gPeo&t=312s)** — it's a little bit more money. It's a few more dollars per dozen, but it's really worth it
- **[05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XDIC59gPeo&t=317s)** — because you're going to invest in your health. You're also going to support the farmer who

- **[05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XDIC59gPeo&t=329s)** — actually investing. It's kind of like an insurance in your own health. So many people,
- **[05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XDIC59gPeo&t=333s)** — when they actually live on junk food, because they're trying to save money, they end up
- **[05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XDIC59gPeo&t=337s)** — paying a lot more in health cost and the cost of lack of energy, the cost of not having the
- **[05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XDIC59gPeo&t=344s)** — quality of well-being. And there's also a company called Angel Acres. I've never spoken
- **[05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XDIC59gPeo&t=350s)** — with them, but what they do is they raise chickens in a super healthy way without doing
- **[05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XDIC59gPeo&t=356s)** — the soy and the corn. And they've tested their eggs and they're much lower with their omega-6
- **[06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XDIC59gPeo&t=362s)** — fatty acids. And yes, they're more expensive, but it's really worth it because you're getting

- **[00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3kTm3Ac1PI&t=0s)** — Now there are six mistakes you can make when you develop a viral infection and you're going to
- **[00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3kTm3Ac1PI&t=5s)** — actually address it or treat it that I want to talk about. Because when you start getting sick,
- **[00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3kTm3Ac1PI&t=10s)** — especially a viral infection, you want to make sure that you can maybe fight it off initially so it
- **[00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3kTm3Ac1PI&t=16s)** — doesn't develop into a full-blown infection. And if you have the infection you want a very
- **[00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3kTm3Ac1PI&t=22s)** — quick recovery. You don't want something that's going to last a very long time. So this video
- **[00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3kTm3Ac1PI&t=26s)** — is going to be very important. All right, number one. Stopping a fever too quickly. There's this
- **[00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3kTm3Ac1PI&t=32s)** — impulse to want to get rid of your fever, especially if a child has fever. Well, did you
- **[00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3kTm3Ac1PI&t=38s)** — realize that by getting rid of the fever you're going to prolong the duration of the infection?
- **[00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3kTm3Ac1PI&t=44s)** — You have to realize what that fever is there for. Very, very important. It is there to help
- **[00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3kTm3Ac1PI&t=49s)** — reduce the spreading of the virus. That's right. Like if it's in your sinuses down into the
- **[00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3kTm3Ac1PI&t=55s)** — lungs. It can actually inhibit the spreading from the lungs throughout the rest of the body.
- **[01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3kTm3Ac1PI&t=61s)** — It can reduce the reproduction of the virus. It helps inhibit the virus going into the cell.
- **[01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3kTm3Ac1PI&t=68s)** — It reduces something called IL-6, which is a requirement for the virus to survive. And on top
- **[01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3kTm3Ac1PI&t=74s)** — of that, the fever increases your T-killer cells, which is everything to do with killing
- **[01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3kTm3Ac1PI&t=81s)** — off viruses as well as killing off cancer. In fact, when you start getting a fever,
- **[01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3kTm3Ac1PI&t=87s)** — I would recommend do things to keep really, really warm to help enhance that fever. You know,
- **[01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3kTm3Ac1PI&t=93s)** — when you're actually sleeping, just wear more clothes, have more blankets, take a hot bath,
- **[01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3kTm3Ac1PI&t=98s)** — take a hot shower, stay really, really warm. Viruses hate heat. All right, number two.
- **[01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3kTm3Ac1PI&t=104s)** — Taking an antibiotic for a virus. It doesn't work. Antibiotics only work for bacterial
- **[01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3kTm3Ac1PI&t=110s)** — infections, not viruses, not fungal infections, not Candida, only for bacterial infections.
- **[01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3kTm3Ac1PI&t=118s)** — And the problem when you take an antibiotic, there's some slight minor complications. And I'm
- **[02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3kTm3Ac1PI&t=122s)** — being very sarcastic because there are a lot of side effects. The big one being, you know,
- **[02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3kTm3Ac1PI&t=127s)** — when you take an antibiotic, you're not going to fully kill off everything, right? Those
- **[02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3kTm3Ac1PI&t=140s)** — from that stress. And now the next time you use an antibiotic, it doesn't work anymore. And then
- **[02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3kTm3Ac1PI&t=147s)** — you get sick and you have another infection, another infection. So over time, these antibiotics
- **[02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3kTm3Ac1PI&t=152s)** — become less and less effective. Not to mention all the other side effects. So when you have a
- **[02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3kTm3Ac1PI&t=157s)** — virus infection, antibiotics don't work. And if for some reason you have to take an antibiotic,
- **[02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3kTm3Ac1PI&t=162s)** — make sure you also take a probiotic at the exact same time so you can actually kind of
- **[02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3kTm3Ac1PI&t=169s)** — preserve your own microbes to some extent. I mean, the reason I'm even bringing this up is
- **[02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3kTm3Ac1PI&t=173s)** — because literally like 50% of all antibiotics are prescribed unnecessarily. Also, if you
- **[03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3kTm3Ac1PI&t=182s)** — take antibiotics, you end up with a severe B1 deficiency, which creates all sorts of issues.
- **[03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3kTm3Ac1PI&t=187s)** — Now the next one is just a kind of concept of avoiding over-sanitation. And this has to do
- **[03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3kTm3Ac1PI&t=194s)** — something called the hygiene hypothesis, mainly for kids that are living in a very super clean
- **[03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3kTm3Ac1PI&t=202s)** — environment. They tend to get more allergies. They tend to get sick more often simply because
- **[03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3kTm3Ac1PI&t=208s)** — they don't develop an immune system. You have to realize that especially early on when
- **[03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3kTm3Ac1PI&t=212s)** — you get an infection as a child, that's the training of your immune system. So sometimes we
- **[03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3kTm3Ac1PI&t=217s)** — have this obsession to keep everything so sterile and clean and sanitized. Well, that
- **[03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3kTm3Ac1PI&t=222s)** — inhibits your immune system as well. Especially if you are sanitizing your hands or your
- **[03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3kTm3Ac1PI&t=229s)** — skin, you actually are wiping off all the good bacteria that live on your skin as well.
- **[03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3kTm3Ac1PI&t=235s)** — I mean, this also can relate to facial cleansing creams and scrubs and all this
- **[04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3kTm3Ac1PI&t=242s)** — work to kind of clean your skin, whether you have acne or whatever, you're just stripping off
- **[04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3kTm3Ac1PI&t=247s)** — all these friendly bacteria and you end up with rashes on your skin and the skin is not
- **[04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3kTm3Ac1PI&t=252s)** — healthy. Alright, number four, detoxifying when you run down or you're getting sick.
- **[04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3kTm3Ac1PI&t=257s)** — You don't want to do a detox. You don't want to take things that detoxify you because that's
- **[04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3kTm3Ac1PI&t=262s)** — going to weaken your system. You're going to actually probably even get sick just from that.
- **[04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3kTm3Ac1PI&t=267s)** — I've been completely without symptoms. I had no infections and then I took some remedy
- **[04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3kTm3Ac1PI&t=273s)** — to detoxify myself and I ended up with a full-blown infection. Now, what is going on
- **[04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3kTm3Ac1PI&t=278s)** — with that? When you detox sometimes incorrectly, you release a lot of crud and stuff and it
- **[04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3kTm3Ac1PI&t=284s)** — creates an immune reaction and you can even be sick just from that. Not to mention, you can
- **[04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3kTm3Ac1PI&t=290s)** — weaken the immune system and activate latent viruses that are dormant. So the point is when
- **[04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3kTm3Ac1PI&t=295s)** — you're sick, you want to nurture that situation. You don't want to start doing any type of
- **[05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3kTm3Ac1PI&t=301s)** — detoxification and even doing a detox in general. I have videos on that. There's the
- **[05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3kTm3Ac1PI&t=305s)** — but you want to do it so you don't get sick. So you want to learn from the mistakes of others,
- **[05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3kTm3Ac1PI&t=311s)** — including me. I was sick in bed for two weeks unnecessarily by just doing a detox.
- **[05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3kTm3Ac1PI&t=319s)** — And this also relates to the next one. Number five, doing a shotgun effect
- **[05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3kTm3Ac1PI&t=325s)** — on your immune system. Taking every single known remedy demand for an infection,
- **[05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3kTm3Ac1PI&t=331s)** — just tons of stuff. You're going to overdo it. You don't need to do that.
- **[05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3kTm3Ac1PI&t=335s)** — Yeah, even sometimes when they have like a sinus infection, they'll start doing
- **[05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3kTm3Ac1PI&t=340s)** — colloidal silver as a nasal rinse and then they'll add hydrogen peroxide and then they'll add
- **[05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3kTm3Ac1PI&t=345s)** — other things like garlic. It's going to irritate your tissues. So you got to really
- **[05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3kTm3Ac1PI&t=350s)** — be careful not to overdo it. I have videos on this of what to do. Probably the three
- **[05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3kTm3Ac1PI&t=355s)** — would be zinc, a natural form of vitamin C and vitamin D. And also apple cider vinegar is a
- **[06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3kTm3Ac1PI&t=363s)** — nice one as well because apple cider vinegar stimulates the phagocytes. So it can stimulate
- **[06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3kTm3Ac1PI&t=368s)** — the immune system to kind of clean things up. And number six, and I've seen this
- **[06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3kTm3Ac1PI&t=373s)** — mistake quite frequently, is just trying to suppress the immune system when it's trying
- **[06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3kTm3Ac1PI&t=378s)** — to work right away. So there's a lot of medications that suppress a cough or suppress
- **[06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3kTm3Ac1PI&t=383s)** — mucus, right? The cough and the mucus is there to get rid of the virus. So you start suppressing
- **[06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3kTm3Ac1PI&t=391s)** — things. You push them deeper into the tissues and now you have the infection longer. So
- **[06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3kTm3Ac1PI&t=398s)** — anything that can actually help get rid of mucus and help it drain or even improve a
- **[06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3kTm3Ac1PI&t=403s)** — productive cough would be a good thing. There's another point about cortisol and
- **[06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3kTm3Ac1PI&t=409s)** — even sometimes people have to take prednisone when they're sick. Prednisone is a synthetic
- **[06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3kTm3Ac1PI&t=414s)** — cortisol and cortisol, which is a stress hormone, suppresses the immune system big time. It
- **[07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3kTm3Ac1PI&t=421s)** — basically makes your immune system paralyzed. It lowers white blood cells. What am I talking
- **[07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3kTm3Ac1PI&t=427s)** — about? I'm talking about anything that stresses you out when you're going through a viral
- **[07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3kTm3Ac1PI&t=433s)** — infection or even a bacterial infection. Boy, that is a big problem. That's probably the biggest
- **[07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3kTm3Ac1PI&t=439s)** — problem. In fact, there probably wasn't a time that you got sick that you didn't have some
- **[07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3kTm3Ac1PI&t=445s)** — stress event that occurred just before that. So it's very, very important to keep your
- **[07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3kTm3Ac1PI&t=450s)** — stress to a minimum, get plenty of rest, take hot baths, nurture your body. But I just wanted
- **[07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3kTm3Ac1PI&t=456s)** — to create this video to increase your awareness on these key factors. Now there's a lot of
- **[07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3kTm3Ac1PI&t=460s)** — things that you need to know about the immune system. And if you haven't seen this very
- **[07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3kTm3Ac1PI&t=464s)** — important immune video, I put it up right here. Check it out.

- **[00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rDeLISqGgfs&t=0s)** — What I'm about to tell you, you are probably going to reject it and click off.
- **[00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rDeLISqGgfs&t=4s)** — Before you do that, just hear me out.
- **[00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rDeLISqGgfs&t=7s)** — Avoiding the sun may be just as dangerous as smoking cigarettes.
- **[00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rDeLISqGgfs&t=15s)** — Now, I know you probably think I'm exaggerating, but just hear me out.
- **[00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rDeLISqGgfs&t=19s)** — There's an association between at least 17 different cancers and a vitamin D insufficiency
- **[00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rDeLISqGgfs&t=27s)** — and autoimmune diseases and cardiovascular disease.
- **[00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rDeLISqGgfs&t=32s)** — Vitamin D is intimately involved in over 2,000 different genes.
- **[00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rDeLISqGgfs&t=38s)** — Our immune system absolutely cannot work without vitamin D.
- **[00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rDeLISqGgfs&t=42s)** — And check this out. It's virtually impossible to get your required vitamin D from your diet.
- **[00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rDeLISqGgfs&t=47s)** — You're going to get between 5 to 10 percent.
- **[00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rDeLISqGgfs&t=50s)** — And that's if you're consuming fatty fish, organ meats, egg yolks,
- **[00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rDeLISqGgfs&t=54s)** — which a lot of people don't even do that. 90 to 95 percent of vitamin D comes from the sun.
- **[01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rDeLISqGgfs&t=61s)** — Now check out these statistics. There are over 5,000 deaths per year
- **[01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rDeLISqGgfs&t=67s)** — worldwide from too much sun. But look at how many people die from a lack of sun.
- **[01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rDeLISqGgfs&t=74s)** — 1,684,677 people every single year.
- **[01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rDeLISqGgfs&t=79s)** — So there's 329 times more people that are negatively affected by a lack of sun versus
- **[01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rDeLISqGgfs&t=87s)** — the actual exposure to sun.
- **[01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rDeLISqGgfs&t=89s)** — This is based on a fascinating book called Embrace the Sun by Mark Sorensen,
- **[01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rDeLISqGgfs&t=95s)** — who looked at and evaluated 1,300 different studies on the topic.
- **[01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rDeLISqGgfs&t=100s)** — So they concluded that for every one person who dies from sun exposure,
- **[01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rDeLISqGgfs&t=104s)** — there's 329 people who die of a lack of sun exposure.
- **[01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rDeLISqGgfs&t=109s)** — Just think about the mainstream recommendation for sun by the American Dermatology Association.
- **[01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rDeLISqGgfs&t=116s)** — You must stay out of the sun. And if you're out in the sun,
- **[01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rDeLISqGgfs&t=119s)** — use sunblock because the sun is dangerous.
- **[02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rDeLISqGgfs&t=122s)** — Even in the early 1900s, they had sanitariums that you can go to to bathe in the sun
- **[02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rDeLISqGgfs&t=130s)** — as a cure for TB and asthma and many different illnesses.
- **[02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rDeLISqGgfs&t=137s)** — Well, what about melanoma, the deadly form of skin cancer?
- **[02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rDeLISqGgfs&t=142s)** — In 1935, one out of 1,500 people developed melanoma.
- **[02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rDeLISqGgfs&t=147s)** — In 2014, one in 50 people developed melanoma.
- **[02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rDeLISqGgfs&t=153s)** — And if we compare these two time periods, in the past, we got a lot more sun.
- **[02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rDeLISqGgfs&t=157s)** — We were on the farm.
- **[02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rDeLISqGgfs&t=159s)** — Nowadays, we're inside.
- **[02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rDeLISqGgfs&t=161s)** — 75% of all melanomas are located in areas where we don't expose our skin to sun.
- **[02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rDeLISqGgfs&t=169s)** — It's a lack of sun that puts someone at risk for melanoma.
- **[02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rDeLISqGgfs&t=174s)** — And I'm not talking about being out in the sun and cooking yourself to the point
- **[02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rDeLISqGgfs&t=177s)** — where you're burned. You should never do that.
- **[02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rDeLISqGgfs&t=179s)** — I'm talking about a moderate amount of sun so you'd never burn.
- **[03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rDeLISqGgfs&t=182s)** — But there's something else the sun gives us for protection against cancer.
- **[03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rDeLISqGgfs&t=188s)** — 7% of the sun is UV rays, 39% is visible spectrum of light,
- **[03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rDeLISqGgfs&t=196s)** — and 54% of all the sun's rays are infrared potent stimulus of melatonin.
- **[03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rDeLISqGgfs&t=205s)** — And 90% to 95% of all the melatonin is produced by this interaction between infrared
- **[03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rDeLISqGgfs&t=214s)** — and your skin.
- **[03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rDeLISqGgfs&t=216s)** — And it increases the production of subcellular melatonin.
- **[03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rDeLISqGgfs&t=220s)** — It's the melatonin that also enhances ATP.
- **[03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rDeLISqGgfs&t=222s)** — So there's two things that protect the mitochondria, vitamin D and melatonin.
- **[03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rDeLISqGgfs&t=227s)** — And both of them are triggered by the exposure to sun.
- **[03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rDeLISqGgfs&t=230s)** — I do know there's going to be people that will disagree because we've been so indoctrinated
- **[03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rDeLISqGgfs&t=235s)** — into thinking that sun all of a sudden is really bad for us.
- **[03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rDeLISqGgfs&t=238s)** — But I hope you could at least take a different viewpoint and just take a look at
- **[04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rDeLISqGgfs&t=243s)** — the information. I'm going to put the references down below.
- **[04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rDeLISqGgfs&t=245s)** — Check it out.
- **[04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rDeLISqGgfs&t=247s)** — I think your next step should be to start to get more sun exposure.
- **[04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rDeLISqGgfs&t=250s)** — Be outside more often.
- **[04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rDeLISqGgfs&t=252s)** — And on that note, if you have not seen my video on vitamin D,
- **[04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rDeLISqGgfs&t=256s)** — you might want to watch it. I put it up right here.

- **[00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83sOzga-i0I&t=0s)** — I'm sure you heard about this benfotamine vitamin.
- **[00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83sOzga-i0I&t=3s)** — So what's all the hype in? Do we really need it?
- **[00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83sOzga-i0I&t=6s)** — And what is it good for?
- **[00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83sOzga-i0I&t=8s)** — Benfotamine is a fat-siable B1.
- **[00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83sOzga-i0I&t=12s)** — Normally B1, called thiamine, is water-siable.
- **[00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83sOzga-i0I&t=16s)** — And so there's several advantages of having this vitamin in a fat-siable form.
- **[00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83sOzga-i0I&t=20s)** — Number one, it can penetrate membranes that are made out of fat much easier,
- **[00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83sOzga-i0I&t=24s)** — like by a factor of 360% more penetration.
- **[00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83sOzga-i0I&t=28s)** — So benfotamine is really good for anything neurological, anything brain,
- **[00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83sOzga-i0I&t=34s)** — especially peripheral neuropathy, where you have the bottom of your feet tingling, numbness, burning,
- **[00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83sOzga-i0I&t=39s)** — or that could be on the hands as well.
- **[00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83sOzga-i0I&t=41s)** — So what is it actually doing?
- **[00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83sOzga-i0I&t=43s)** — One of the big things it's doing, it's inhibiting the formation of something called AGEs.
- **[00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83sOzga-i0I&t=50s)** — That stands for Advanced Glycation and Products.
- **[00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83sOzga-i0I&t=54s)** — Now, what is that?
- **[00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83sOzga-i0I&t=55s)** — Well, that's basically this formation of sugar with a protein or sugar with fat
- **[01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83sOzga-i0I&t=62s)** — that's morphed into this unusable protein.
- **[01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83sOzga-i0I&t=65s)** — So for example, when you are a diabetic and you test for blood glucose levels,
- **[01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83sOzga-i0I&t=70s)** — a lot of times they'll do what's called A1C.
- **[01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83sOzga-i0I&t=73s)** — And that test measures for this term glycation,
- **[01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83sOzga-i0I&t=77s)** — which basically means how much damage to your proteins in your blood is occurring.
- **[01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83sOzga-i0I&t=83s)** — Like the hemoglobin is protein, right?
- **[01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83sOzga-i0I&t=86s)** — So they can measure how much of that protein is unusable because it's glycated,
- **[01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83sOzga-i0I&t=91s)** — because all the sugar interacts with the protein and kind of fuses it to make it unavailable.
- **[01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83sOzga-i0I&t=98s)** — And so as the red blood cells are unavailable, guess what you get?
- **[01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83sOzga-i0I&t=101s)** — You get a lot of complications from that.
- **[01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83sOzga-i0I&t=103s)** — One being just lowered amount of the ability to carry oxygen.
- **[01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83sOzga-i0I&t=107s)** — And think about the cascade of effects that that can create.
- **[01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83sOzga-i0I&t=110s)** — Also, this glycation starts to accumulate in the mitochondria
- **[01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83sOzga-i0I&t=114s)** — and it plugs up the machinery for your cells.
- **[01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83sOzga-i0I&t=118s)** — So benfotamine is a very potent antioxidant type nutrient
- **[02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83sOzga-i0I&t=124s)** — that inhibits the formation of this glycation.
- **[02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83sOzga-i0I&t=128s)** — It also supports the myelin sheath, that outer covering of the nerve
- **[02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83sOzga-i0I&t=132s)** — that allows the nerve to actually work.
- **[02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83sOzga-i0I&t=134s)** — And in a deeper level, we need B1 desperately for several enzymes in our mitochondria
- **[02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83sOzga-i0I&t=140s)** — involved in metabolism.
- **[02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83sOzga-i0I&t=142s)** — Certain enzymes are dependent on B1.
- **[02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83sOzga-i0I&t=145s)** — And if your cells don't have B1, boy, all sorts of issues start occurring.
- **[02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83sOzga-i0I&t=150s)** — So a lot of the complications, especially from diabetes,
- **[02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83sOzga-i0I&t=155s)** — occur because of this lack of this B1,
- **[02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83sOzga-i0I&t=158s)** — because the more glucose you have flowing through your bloodstream,
- **[02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83sOzga-i0I&t=162s)** — the more B1 you need.
- **[02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83sOzga-i0I&t=164s)** — So by being a diabetic, you're basically sucking up all that residual B1 that you had,
- **[02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83sOzga-i0I&t=169s)** — leaving you high and dry.
- **[02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83sOzga-i0I&t=171s)** — Now, there are four main tissues in the body that are affected by diabetes
- **[02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83sOzga-i0I&t=176s)** — more than any other tissues in the body.
- **[02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83sOzga-i0I&t=178s)** — Okay, we have the nerve and the brain, kind of the same tissue.
- **[03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83sOzga-i0I&t=182s)** — We have the arteries, we have the eye, and we have the kidney.
- **[03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83sOzga-i0I&t=187s)** — Now, what's so unique about these four tissues?
- **[03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83sOzga-i0I&t=190s)** — Well, number one, they're the most metabolically demanding tissues of your body,
- **[03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83sOzga-i0I&t=195s)** — which means they hog a lot of fuel
- **[03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83sOzga-i0I&t=198s)** — and they also require a lot of oxygen.
- **[03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83sOzga-i0I&t=200s)** — And then as a byproduct, they put out a lot of oxidation.
- **[03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83sOzga-i0I&t=205s)** — So that means these four tissues are very susceptible to problems with too much oxidation.
- **[03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83sOzga-i0I&t=213s)** — And basically, that means that your balance of antioxidants versus your oxidants are out of balance.
- **[03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83sOzga-i0I&t=219s)** — You don't have enough antioxidants to handle the amount of oxidation occurring.
- **[03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83sOzga-i0I&t=223s)** — And you can kind of think about oxidation as kind of something rusting out in the body.
- **[03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83sOzga-i0I&t=228s)** — And so the term for that is called oxidative stress.
- **[03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83sOzga-i0I&t=231s)** — So these four tissues are very susceptible to becoming damaged with high levels of sugar
- **[03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83sOzga-i0I&t=237s)** — because of the oxidation and the inability to repair.
- **[04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83sOzga-i0I&t=242s)** — And so B1 can come in there to the rescue and lower this oxidation
- **[04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83sOzga-i0I&t=246s)** — because it's kind of a very potent antioxidant.
- **[04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83sOzga-i0I&t=249s)** — Another thing that happens in diabetes is you have damage to the microcirculation.
- **[04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83sOzga-i0I&t=255s)** — The tiny capillaries that feed these tissues.
- **[04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83sOzga-i0I&t=259s)** — These capillary walls start to leak and you get bleeding.
- **[04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83sOzga-i0I&t=262s)** — And you especially see this in the arteries. You see this in the eyes. It happens in the kidney.
- **[04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83sOzga-i0I&t=267s)** — And so in a deeper level, we're getting all this glycated protein junk
- **[04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83sOzga-i0I&t=270s)** — that's accumulating in the mitochondria, plugging everything up,
- **[04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83sOzga-i0I&t=273s)** — and literally starving the cells of fuel and oxygen.
- **[04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83sOzga-i0I&t=279s)** — That's why you see peripheral neuropathy showing up as a kind of a...
- **[04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83sOzga-i0I&t=282s)** — One of the first things, because it affects the extremities at the farthest distance from the heart.
- **[04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83sOzga-i0I&t=288s)** — This advanced glycation end product compound that's plugging everything up can come from several things.
- **[04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83sOzga-i0I&t=295s)** — It comes from eating sugar with protein when it's cooked.
- **[04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83sOzga-i0I&t=298s)** — It comes from eating sugar and fat when it's cooked.
- **[05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83sOzga-i0I&t=301s)** — That would be like ice cream would be a perfect example.
- **[05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83sOzga-i0I&t=304s)** — It comes from cooking in high heats, like you're deep frying something
- **[05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83sOzga-i0I&t=307s)** — or you're grilling something where something is very crispy.
- **[05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83sOzga-i0I&t=310s)** — You do get a certain amount of glycation.
- **[05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83sOzga-i0I&t=312s)** — But just being a diabetic causes high levels of glycation.
- **[05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83sOzga-i0I&t=316s)** — As you get older, you have more glycation.
- **[05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83sOzga-i0I&t=318s)** — So age is a big factor.
- **[05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83sOzga-i0I&t=320s)** — If you smoke, if you drink alcohol,
- **[05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83sOzga-i0I&t=322s)** — and the more inflammation you have, the more glycation you're going to have.
- **[05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83sOzga-i0I&t=325s)** — This is why Benfotamine for diabetics is so vitally important
- **[05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83sOzga-i0I&t=330s)** — because it basically just starts slowing down this glycation process
- **[05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83sOzga-i0I&t=335s)** — and getting rid of the complications from diabetes.
- **[05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83sOzga-i0I&t=338s)** — And of course, hopefully that person is getting rid of the real cause
- **[05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83sOzga-i0I&t=341s)** — of diabetes, which is the diet.
- **[05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83sOzga-i0I&t=344s)** — But sometimes the doctors don't really emphasize that.
- **[05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83sOzga-i0I&t=346s)** — They're all about managing your blood sugars.
- **[05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83sOzga-i0I&t=349s)** — Well, eventually need to fix the cause.
- **[05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83sOzga-i0I&t=351s)** — But also Benfotamine can help you with the symptoms along the way.
- **[05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83sOzga-i0I&t=355s)** — And also many times people combine alpha-lipoic acid with Benfotamine
- **[05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83sOzga-i0I&t=359s)** — because they're a bit synergistic.
- **[06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83sOzga-i0I&t=361s)** — Alpha-lipoic acid directly targets inflammation,
- **[06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83sOzga-i0I&t=366s)** — as well as that oxidative stress.
- **[06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83sOzga-i0I&t=369s)** — Whereas Benfotamine does that as well.
- **[06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83sOzga-i0I&t=371s)** — But it also supplies you with the necessary B1 for the enzymes
- **[06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83sOzga-i0I&t=376s)** — and the mitochondria, as well as directly inhibiting
- **[06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83sOzga-i0I&t=379s)** — the formation of that glycation.
- **[06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83sOzga-i0I&t=382s)** — Now, inside your arteries, you have this inside layer of the artery.
- **[06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83sOzga-i0I&t=389s)** — And it's called the tunica intima, which means innermost layer.
- **[06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83sOzga-i0I&t=394s)** — And in that layer, there's a superficial layer of cells.
- **[06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83sOzga-i0I&t=398s)** — And they're just like one cell thick.
- **[06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83sOzga-i0I&t=400s)** — They're exposed to blood going through the arteries.
- **[06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83sOzga-i0I&t=405s)** — And that's called the endothelial layer.
- **[06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83sOzga-i0I&t=408s)** — That layer of cells, boy, that controls blood pressure.
- **[06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83sOzga-i0I&t=413s)** — It controls all sorts of hormonal interactions.
- **[06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83sOzga-i0I&t=416s)** — It gets hammered with this oxidative stress.
- **[06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83sOzga-i0I&t=419s)** — And then you start getting inflammation and you start getting scar tissue.
- **[07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83sOzga-i0I&t=423s)** — And then you start getting more clots.
- **[07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83sOzga-i0I&t=425s)** — One of the things that it does is it helps to prevent clots.
- **[07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83sOzga-i0I&t=428s)** — But if it becomes damaged, you start getting clots.
- **[07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83sOzga-i0I&t=431s)** — And there's also micro blood vessels that are supplying the artery walls.
- **[07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83sOzga-i0I&t=437s)** — Those are called vasovesorum, which means the vessels of the vessels.
- **[07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83sOzga-i0I&t=444s)** — So the blood vessels also need blood to survive.
- **[07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83sOzga-i0I&t=448s)** — And so all this high level of concentrated sugar in that area
- **[07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83sOzga-i0I&t=451s)** — starts to create inflammation in those vessels, which are a little bit deeper.
- **[07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83sOzga-i0I&t=456s)** — And then you start getting thickening of the arteries and stiffness of the arteries,
- **[07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83sOzga-i0I&t=461s)** — which is not just going to lead to blood pressure problems,
- **[07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83sOzga-i0I&t=464s)** — but a constriction of blood that's flowing through the arteries.
- **[07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83sOzga-i0I&t=468s)** — In other words, insulin is anti-athrosclerosis.
- **[07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83sOzga-i0I&t=473s)** — In other words, it prevents this whole cascaded problem.
- **[07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83sOzga-i0I&t=476s)** — Wait a second, I thought that too much insulin is bad.
- **[07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83sOzga-i0I&t=479s)** — Well, it is, but you have this other factor involved.
- **[08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83sOzga-i0I&t=483s)** — It's called insulin resistance.
- **[08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83sOzga-i0I&t=485s)** — So a lot of these complications that are occurring from high glucose and high insulin
- **[08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83sOzga-i0I&t=490s)** — are occurring because you actually have a deficiency of insulin because of the resistance,
- **[08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83sOzga-i0I&t=496s)** — because the body makes more, but it never actually gets to the right target
- **[08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83sOzga-i0I&t=500s)** — to allow things to occur.
- **[08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83sOzga-i0I&t=502s)** — And so by doing things to get rid of insulin resistance,
- **[08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83sOzga-i0I&t=504s)** — you actually get more insulin to heal this whole area.
- **[08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83sOzga-i0I&t=508s)** — So by eating things that increase insulin, it never is a good solution.
- **[08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83sOzga-i0I&t=512s)** — We have the arteries that are involved.
- **[08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83sOzga-i0I&t=514s)** — We also have the kidneys that get destroyed.
- **[08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83sOzga-i0I&t=516s)** — And so when you have this kidney filter that gets destroyed,
- **[08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83sOzga-i0I&t=518s)** — you start getting this leakiness in the filter.
- **[08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83sOzga-i0I&t=521s)** — So the holes become bigger and then protein kind of goes out
- **[08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83sOzga-i0I&t=525s)** — and then sugar kind of goes out and then you can no longer recycle this.
- **[08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83sOzga-i0I&t=528s)** — And so the kidneys start losing their filtration.
- **[08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83sOzga-i0I&t=531s)** — Now in the eyes, you have this effect, especially from the retina,
- **[08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83sOzga-i0I&t=534s)** — which is nerve tissue that's extending from the brain.
- **[08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83sOzga-i0I&t=536s)** — And it's actually out in the open.
- **[08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83sOzga-i0I&t=539s)** — And so it's very susceptible to this oxidation.
- **[09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83sOzga-i0I&t=542s)** — And so this is why a diabetic could eventually lose their eyesight and go blind.
- **[09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83sOzga-i0I&t=547s)** — But guess what? Benfotimine can come in there
- **[09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83sOzga-i0I&t=549s)** — and slow this process down from happening
- **[09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83sOzga-i0I&t=552s)** — and hopefully even reverse it in certain circumstances.
- **[09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83sOzga-i0I&t=555s)** — Now, when we get nerve damage from this process,
- **[09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83sOzga-i0I&t=557s)** — it's not just the nerves in our feet.
- **[09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83sOzga-i0I&t=560s)** — It's not just the neurons in our brain,
- **[09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83sOzga-i0I&t=562s)** — which is also considered type 3 diabetes.
- **[09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83sOzga-i0I&t=565s)** — But you also get destruction of the autonomic nervous system.
- **[09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83sOzga-i0I&t=569s)** — There's something called diabetic autonomic neuropathy.
- **[09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83sOzga-i0I&t=573s)** — It can exist in any part of your autonomic nervous system.
- **[09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83sOzga-i0I&t=576s)** — So in summary, benfotimine can greatly help a diabetic in many different ways.
- **[09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83sOzga-i0I&t=580s)** — It can actually help reduce this filling up of the mitochondria
- **[09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83sOzga-i0I&t=583s)** — with this glycation end products.
- **[09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83sOzga-i0I&t=586s)** — It can increase the number of mitochondria,
- **[09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83sOzga-i0I&t=588s)** — which can increase the ATP, the fuel to these tissues.
- **[09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83sOzga-i0I&t=593s)** — But remember, you also want to get on the correct eating plan at the same time.
- **[09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83sOzga-i0I&t=598s)** — And if you have any questions on that, you need to watch this video right here.

- **[00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZeB31exaNA&t=0s)** — Let's talk about the best nutrients to remove plaque from your arteries. When I talk about
- **[00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZeB31exaNA&t=6s)** — plaque, I'm talking about three things. The combination of cholesterol, a certain type of
- **[00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZeB31exaNA&t=11s)** — protein that creates the fibrosis, and we'll talk about calcium. These are the three ingredients
- **[00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZeB31exaNA&t=16s)** — to form a band-aid when you have inflammation or some type of problem in the inside of your
- **[00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZeB31exaNA&t=21s)** — artery. The first thing to know is there's two types of plaque. There's soft plaque,
- **[00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZeB31exaNA&t=28s)** — and then there's hard plaque or calcified plaque. They're both very, very different. The soft plaque
- **[00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZeB31exaNA&t=34s)** — is very unstable. It's more dangerous. The hard plaque, the more dense plaque, the more stable,
- **[00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZeB31exaNA&t=43s)** — the less dangerous. The soft plaque is four times as common as the calcified plaque. When you
- **[00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZeB31exaNA&t=50s)** — get a CAC test, they give you a score. And this score really represents how much plaque
- **[00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZeB31exaNA&t=56s)** — you have in your arteries, mainly the calcified plaque. Because a lot of the soft plaque is
- **[01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZeB31exaNA&t=61s)** — involved in the turning into calcified plaque, that does not show up on a CAC score. Now,
- **[01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZeB31exaNA&t=69s)** — there's something called a CAC paradox in which you might find that your CAC score
- **[01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZeB31exaNA&t=75s)** — goes up after changing your diet, cleaning up the bad stuff, and starting to get healthy.
- **[01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZeB31exaNA&t=82s)** — The score might go up. Well, what's happening is not getting worse. You're just converting more of
- **[01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZeB31exaNA&t=87s)** — that soft plaque to hard plaque where it becomes more stable. And there's some other tests that
- **[01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZeB31exaNA&t=93s)** — you can do, which I'm going to explain at the end, that will help you identify more of
- **[01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZeB31exaNA&t=98s)** — the soft plaque. Because that CAC test really is not the best test to pick up this soft,
- **[01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZeB31exaNA&t=105s)** — dangerous, unstable plaque. But I will talk about what tests you should do about this to
- **[01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZeB31exaNA&t=110s)** — assess this problem in a moment. You usually have something called glycation connected to it.
- **[01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZeB31exaNA&t=116s)** — What is glycation? It's where you have a sugar and a protein that gets stuck together. And so
- **[02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZeB31exaNA&t=122s)** — that's involved in a certain protein that kind of locks up and creates problems and inflammation
- **[02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZeB31exaNA&t=126s)** — in your body. This soft plaque is usually involved with more oxidation, okay, especially
- **[02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZeB31exaNA&t=133s)** — of the LDL. And I'm not talking about LDL in general. I'm talking about the one that's more
- **[02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZeB31exaNA&t=138s)** — pathogenic. There's two types of LDL. There's the LDL that's much smaller. It's called the small
- **[02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZeB31exaNA&t=145s)** — dense LDL. Okay, that's the more dangerous type, the more pathogenic type versus the other LDL,
- **[02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZeB31exaNA&t=152s)** — which is very different. It's the large buoyant type, and it's not the pathogenic type. You
- **[02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZeB31exaNA&t=157s)** — just have to realize there's two types. I'm going to show you a very simple way to
- **[02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZeB31exaNA&t=163s)** — use what they give you on your blood test to determine what type of LDL you have.
- **[02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZeB31exaNA&t=168s)** — The first one, it's a long name, myeloperoxidase. The next one is Lp-PLA2.
- **[02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZeB31exaNA&t=177s)** — So those are the two biomarkers that help pick up if you have this soft plaque. Now,
- **[03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZeB31exaNA&t=183s)** — another test that probably would be even better if you can do this. And it's a relatively
- **[03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZeB31exaNA&t=189s)** — inexpensive, quick, non-invasive test. It's an ultrasound of your carotids. And that gives like
- **[03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZeB31exaNA&t=195s)** — a 98.6% prediction of having the problem. There's some other really important values to look at,
- **[03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZeB31exaNA&t=202s)** — too, is your HDL. Okay, you want that to go up. HDL tends to clean up that pathogenic bad
- **[03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZeB31exaNA&t=210s)** — LDL. The next thing you want to see on the low side is triglycerides, because if the
- **[03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZeB31exaNA&t=216s)** — triglycerides are high, then you can pretty much know the person's consuming too many carbs.
- **[03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZeB31exaNA&t=222s)** — Now, there's another test that if you can get this, it's a really good way of assessing what's
- **[03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZeB31exaNA&t=228s)** — really going on with these lipids. Okay, and it's called lipoprotein insulin resistance.
- **[03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZeB31exaNA&t=235s)** — If you happen to get a blood test and you can request this, it'd be very, very important
- **[03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZeB31exaNA&t=239s)** — to know where your number is at. Because out of all of the factors, that's the one that's
- **[04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZeB31exaNA&t=244s)** — associated with cardiovascular atherosclerosis. All right, so now let's discuss how one can figure
- **[04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZeB31exaNA&t=252s)** — out if they have the small dense particles for the LDL versus the large buoyant, okay,
- **[04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZeB31exaNA&t=259s)** — without even doing that test. What you do is you divide the LDL by something else
- **[04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZeB31exaNA&t=266s)** — called APO-B. It's part of the lipoprotein that indicates the number of particles.
- **[04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZeB31exaNA&t=274s)** — Ideally, we want it to be greater than 1.2, which will indicate large buoyant LDL, which is
- **[04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZeB31exaNA&t=283s)** — the non-pathogenic version. Now, all of that is very interesting and a bit complex. So I'm going
- **[04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZeB31exaNA&t=289s)** — to jump into what nutrients can help remove this plaque. Okay, well, the first two nutrients
- **[04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZeB31exaNA&t=295s)** — are number one, pycnogonal. That's pine bark. You'd want to take 150 milligrams. Pycnogonal helps
- **[05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZeB31exaNA&t=302s)** — convert the soft plaque to the calcified plaque where it becomes more stable. And also it
- **[05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZeB31exaNA&t=309s)** — prevents the formation of plaque. And the next one is called gotecola. You'd want to take 450
- **[05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZeB31exaNA&t=315s)** — milligrams of gotecola. Gotecola helps enhance the function of pycnogonal. So it's going to
- **[05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZeB31exaNA&t=322s)** — this conversion to more stable plaque. It will also prevent the formation of plaque.
- **[05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZeB31exaNA&t=327s)** — Number three remedy is vitamin K2, which is the most potent inhibitor of vascular
- **[05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZeB31exaNA&t=338s)** — calcification. It basically stops the calcification from occurring in your arteries.
- **[05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZeB31exaNA&t=345s)** — I would not recommend taking vitamin K2 in micrograms. I would recommend taking it in
- **[05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZeB31exaNA&t=351s)** — milligrams. And I've looked around to find a supplement that will give you the amounts in
- **[05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZeB31exaNA&t=357s)** — milligrams. There's not many. And I personally don't have a product like that. And I don't
- **[06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZeB31exaNA&t=361s)** — have any affiliations or associations with any other companies that do. Except I did find one
- **[06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZeB31exaNA&t=366s)** — company that does have it, does provide it. It's life extension. It's called mega K2. I'll
- **[06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZeB31exaNA&t=371s)** — put that link down below. So the next remedy is natokinase. Natokinase can help decrease
- **[06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZeB31exaNA&t=377s)** — the thickness of the carotid wall. And the last remedy is called niacin. Don't get the
- **[06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZeB31exaNA&t=384s)** — sustained release one. Get the one that creates the flush. I know some people don't like that.
- **[06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZeB31exaNA&t=389s)** — But as far as cholesterol goes, it is what you need. Now I'm not advocating that you take
- **[06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZeB31exaNA&t=394s)** — just a lot of nutrition. I'm giving you the ones that are the most potent. I'm also
- **[06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZeB31exaNA&t=398s)** — going to talk about some other ones next that also create some amazing effects for
- **[06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZeB31exaNA&t=404s)** — I just want to mention them because I don't want to leave them out. Toquatrinols helps decrease
- **[06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZeB31exaNA&t=409s)** — inflammation of the arteries. It's a type of vitamin E. Berberine is a really good one.
- **[06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZeB31exaNA&t=414s)** — You have also aged garlic. You have magnesium and potassium that helps to soften up the
- **[07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZeB31exaNA&t=422s)** — arteries if they're stiff and rigid. And then you have vitamin D, which is a very potent
- **[07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZeB31exaNA&t=427s)** — anti-inflammatory. Really good for the arteries. Really good as an anti-placking
- **[07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZeB31exaNA&t=432s)** — And so I put a lot of the references that I talked about down below. Check them out.
- **[07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZeB31exaNA&t=437s)** — But if you would like to know the best meal or foods to help you avoid placking,
- **[07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZeB31exaNA&t=441s)** — I put that video up right here. Check it out.

- **[00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KyRjO29yHBQ&t=0s)** — I'm going to share the best remedy that you can use for hyperpigmentation.
- **[00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KyRjO29yHBQ&t=4s)** — Dark spots on the face. There are bleaching agents that people are using on their skin
- **[00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KyRjO29yHBQ&t=9s)** — that do get rid of these dark spots but they end up destroying the cells that make the pigment.
- **[00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KyRjO29yHBQ&t=15s)** — The other big problem is we're blaming these dark spots or aging spots on the sun.
- **[00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KyRjO29yHBQ&t=20s)** — This is why they tell you to completely avoid the sun to prevent this hyperpigmentation.
- **[00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KyRjO29yHBQ&t=24s)** — Right now they actually put sun blocker SPF chemicals in literally all the moisturizers,
- **[00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KyRjO29yHBQ&t=31s)** — facial creams to block this UV radiation. They'll tell you that you can get all your
- **[00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KyRjO29yHBQ&t=35s)** — vitamin D from food or a few minutes in the sun. This is a complete lie. If you actually have
- **[00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KyRjO29yHBQ&t=40s)** — a skin cream or a face cream that has this sunscreen in it, I wouldn't use it on your
- **[00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KyRjO29yHBQ&t=45s)** — face. If you take a younger person and you compare them with an older person and you're
- **[00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KyRjO29yHBQ&t=49s)** — looking at this hyperpigment issue, you basically don't even see it in younger people. You only
- **[00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KyRjO29yHBQ&t=55s)** — see it in people over the age of maybe 35, 40, 50, 60. As we get older, it becomes more of
- **[01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KyRjO29yHBQ&t=60s)** — a problem. In our skin, we have a pigment and it's called melanin. Melanin is made by cells
- **[01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KyRjO29yHBQ&t=66s)** — called melanocytes. If you compare someone who's like 18 or 20 years old to someone that's 60,
- **[01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KyRjO29yHBQ&t=72s)** — the concentration of these little melanocytes is much different. When we're younger,
- **[01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KyRjO29yHBQ&t=77s)** — we have a lot more concentration. When we're older, we don't. What causes the melanocytes
- **[01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KyRjO29yHBQ&t=84s)** — to produce melanin? Vitamin D. What's the primary trigger to make vitamin D? The sun.
- **[01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KyRjO29yHBQ&t=89s)** — We're going to talk about what vitamin D does to melanin in a second, but I just wanted to
- **[01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KyRjO29yHBQ&t=94s)** — show you this apple right here. You can see this apple on the left versus the apple on
- **[01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KyRjO29yHBQ&t=99s)** — the right. Slightly different colored. Both of these apples are being oxidized by oxygen,
- **[01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KyRjO29yHBQ&t=105s)** — but this one has protection. I put some lemon juice on it. It's an antioxidant. This one had
- **[01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KyRjO29yHBQ&t=109s)** — no protection against oxidation, oxygen, so it's going brown. Same thing happens with the skin.
- **[01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KyRjO29yHBQ&t=115s)** — The oxidation triggers melanin. There's other things too. There's environmental pollution,
- **[02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KyRjO29yHBQ&t=121s)** — there's stress. The key factor that you need to know about is this word oxidation,
- **[02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KyRjO29yHBQ&t=125s)** — because that gives you a clue on how to correct this problem. What's the opposite of oxidation?
- **[02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KyRjO29yHBQ&t=129s)** — Anti-oxidation from antioxidants. What's interesting about antioxidants is that
- **[02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KyRjO29yHBQ&t=136s)** — melanin is like the ultimate antioxidant to protect against DNA damage. What happens
- **[02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KyRjO29yHBQ&t=142s)** — is you naturally expose yourself to the sun, you get a slight tan. The darker the skin,
- **[02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KyRjO29yHBQ&t=147s)** — the more the filtering effect of the UV radiation. Also, we get more filtering of
- **[02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KyRjO29yHBQ&t=153s)** — the production of vitamin D, because the way that you make vitamin D is from this UV
- **[02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KyRjO29yHBQ&t=158s)** — radiation interaction on your skin with cholesterol. That's all interesting information,
- **[02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KyRjO29yHBQ&t=163s)** — but what's really important about this topic is what vitamin D does to your melanocytes.
- **[02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KyRjO29yHBQ&t=169s)** — Vitamin D helps protect against the oxidation factor. It's a very potent antioxidant. Is
- **[02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KyRjO29yHBQ&t=177s)** — there research on this? Yes, there is, but it's mixed. But if you look at the research,
- **[03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KyRjO29yHBQ&t=182s)** — I think the reason why it's mixed is because the dosage of vitamin D that they're using is
- **[03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KyRjO29yHBQ&t=188s)** — way too low and way too infrequent because they're basing it on an outdated RDA for vitamin D.
- **[03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KyRjO29yHBQ&t=195s)** — A lot of the confusion with vitamin D revolve around this RDA, what our bodies require each day
- **[03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KyRjO29yHBQ&t=202s)** — to survive, right? And they have it at 600 IUs, which is a crazy low number. If we're
- **[03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KyRjO29yHBQ&t=207s)** — basing our research on that number, and if we do a research project with low amounts of
- **[03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KyRjO29yHBQ&t=211s)** — vitamin D, we're probably not going to see much result because the creative therapeutic
- **[03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KyRjO29yHBQ&t=215s)** — need more than 600 IUs. I did a video recently on autoimmune diseases. One that pertains to this
- **[03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KyRjO29yHBQ&t=222s)** — topic is on vitiligo. That is like the opposite condition that we're talking about. It's not
- **[03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KyRjO29yHBQ&t=227s)** — a hyperpigmentation. It's a loss of pigment. You have areas around your skin that are kind
- **[03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KyRjO29yHBQ&t=234s)** — of like bleached or white targeting the melanocytes. So we get these little areas of
- **[03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KyRjO29yHBQ&t=239s)** — lack of pigment. Remember I talked about vitamin D helps modulate the melanocytes. It
- **[04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KyRjO29yHBQ&t=244s)** — increases or decreases melanin. Well guess what? There's some fascinating information to show that
- **[04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KyRjO29yHBQ&t=251s)** — you can actually greatly improve vitiligo by taking 20 to 30 thousand IUs of vitamin D3
- **[04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KyRjO29yHBQ&t=257s)** — every single day. The bottom line is vitamin D greatly influences the cells that make melanin.
- **[04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KyRjO29yHBQ&t=263s)** — If you have enough vitamin D in the skin, you will have protection against this over
- **[04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KyRjO29yHBQ&t=269s)** — production of melanin. The problem is if you're following the main recommendation of avoiding
- **[04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KyRjO29yHBQ&t=275s)** — the sun and using these sun blockers, you are going to be severely low in vitamin D. There's
- **[04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KyRjO29yHBQ&t=281s)** — two things I'm going to recommend. Number one is kind of a quick fix and it's a very safe
- **[04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KyRjO29yHBQ&t=286s)** — thing to do and it's a home remedy and it's very effective for many reasons which I'll get
- **[04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KyRjO29yHBQ&t=291s)** — into. But number two, I would start working on building up your vitamin D levels consuming
- **[04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KyRjO29yHBQ&t=297s)** — at least 10,000 maybe 20,000 IUs of vitamin D3 each day. In addition to that, I would start
- **[05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KyRjO29yHBQ&t=303s)** — to build up antioxidant networks in the body. To make them you need high quality protein,
- **[05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KyRjO29yHBQ&t=309s)** — high quality amino acids, fish, eggs, meat. These antioxidants also are made from trace
- **[05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KyRjO29yHBQ&t=314s)** — minerals, zinc, copper, iodine. You can get that from shellfish as well as sea salt. Of
- **[05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KyRjO29yHBQ&t=320s)** — course you need other nutrition too like the B vitamins, vitamin C, vitamin E. All of these
- **[05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KyRjO29yHBQ&t=326s)** — will start building up your antioxidant networks. What would be a good remedy to use as kind of a
- **[05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KyRjO29yHBQ&t=333s)** — quick fix to see change in the tone of our skin? The remedy is plain unsweetened yogurt. Of
- **[05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KyRjO29yHBQ&t=341s)** — course I would get the grass-fed organic yogurt rubbing it all over the skin, leaving it on
- **[05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KyRjO29yHBQ&t=346s)** — the face for five minutes, washing it off and just doing that once a week. Some people do it
- **[05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KyRjO29yHBQ&t=351s)** — three times a week. It really depends on how bad your problem is. The first thing it has
- **[05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KyRjO29yHBQ&t=355s)** — is a key ingredient called lactic acid. Lactic acid in yogurt is a lot more gentle than putting
- **[06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KyRjO29yHBQ&t=363s)** — pure lactic acid on your skin. Lactic acid dissolves the bonds between dead skin cells that
- **[06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KyRjO29yHBQ&t=370s)** — have this darkened pigment on them. The yogurt also adds another cool effect. It gives the
- **[06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KyRjO29yHBQ&t=376s)** — skin more probiotics. You have this living ecosystem of this microbiome on your skin. Not
- **[06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KyRjO29yHBQ&t=383s)** — just for this hyperpigmentation, but just to keep the skin healthy. If there's excess inflammation
- **[06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KyRjO29yHBQ&t=389s)** — or redness, that will go away. If you have a real serious problem with this, you can always
- **[06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KyRjO29yHBQ&t=394s)** — make it stronger by adding in just a pinch of turmeric to the yogurt. Mix it up, apply it on
- **[06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KyRjO29yHBQ&t=402s)** — the face. Now we have the extra benefit of adding a more powerful antioxidant to this to
- **[06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KyRjO29yHBQ&t=407s)** — speed it up. But it's not necessary. The yogurt is going to create a really nice effect
- **[06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KyRjO29yHBQ&t=412s)** — over time. It's going to be safe, gradual, and it's going to make your skin feel really soft
- **[06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KyRjO29yHBQ&t=418s)** — and very healthy. I know some people are saying, well, should we be putting acids on our face?
- **[07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KyRjO29yHBQ&t=423s)** — And the answer is yes, because the pH of the skin is acidic. You don't want to alkalize it.
- **[07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KyRjO29yHBQ&t=429s)** — You don't want to put a sunblocker on your face. You don't want to avoid the sun. You can
- **[07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KyRjO29yHBQ&t=436s)** — be on the sun, just don't get burned. Regular exposure to the sun is extremely healthy,
- **[07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KyRjO29yHBQ&t=441s)** — and our bodies were designed for that. Taking more vitamin D and building up the reserve of
- **[07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KyRjO29yHBQ&t=446s)** — vitamin D is going to help modulate that little melanocyte so your body can get the
- **[07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KyRjO29yHBQ&t=450s)** — right amount of melanin. Thanks for watching, and I will see you in the next video.

## Video 25: Bizarre Mind-Blowing Health Tricks

**Watch on YouTube:** [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g44aTI7qiws](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g44aTI7qiws)

## Full Transcript with Timestamps

*Click any timestamp to jump to that moment in the video*

- **[00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g44aTI7qiws&t=0s)** — Bizarre, mind-blowing health tricks that are backed by science.
- **[00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g44aTI7qiws&t=5s)** — The first one is dark chocolate. When you start eating dark chocolate at 80% cacao,
- **[00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g44aTI7qiws&t=9s)** — there's going to be a lot less sweeteners. It borders on kind of bitter chocolate.
- **[00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g44aTI7qiws&t=14s)** — This is from a study, 2017, a meta-analysis who showed that it can significantly decrease the systolic blood pressure
- **[00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g44aTI7qiws&t=21s)** — and diastolic blood pressure comparable to certain medications.
- **[00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g44aTI7qiws&t=25s)** — Dark chocolate decreases cortisol by 14%. That's the stress hormone.
- **[00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g44aTI7qiws&t=29s)** — It's the flavonoids in the chocolate. It actually increases nitric oxide.
- **[00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g44aTI7qiws&t=34s)** — So that's going to lower blood pressure.
- **[00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g44aTI7qiws&t=36s)** — Just realize that you don't want to take this too late in the day
- **[00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g44aTI7qiws&t=39s)** — because it has something similar to caffeine which can keep you up at night.
- **[00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g44aTI7qiws&t=43s)** — So I wouldn't have any past lunchtime.
- **[00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g44aTI7qiws&t=45s)** — The next one is from the American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine.
- **[00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g44aTI7qiws&t=51s)** — This trick significantly improves your sinuses.
- **[00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g44aTI7qiws&t=54s)** — Increasing nitric oxide by 15 times. Nitric oxide gives you more oxygen.
- **[01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g44aTI7qiws&t=60s)** — This activates the parasympathetic nervous system which will help relax you, lower your blood pressure,
- **[01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g44aTI7qiws&t=65s)** — and it's basically the action of humming while you're exhaling.
- **[01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g44aTI7qiws&t=69s)** — So you sit or lie down somewhere, maybe on your bed.
- **[01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g44aTI7qiws&t=72s)** — You inhale through your nose very, very gradually.
- **[01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g44aTI7qiws&t=75s)** — And then you exhale while you are humming.
- **[01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g44aTI7qiws&t=79s)** — So you can feel the vibration in your face and your chest.
- **[01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g44aTI7qiws&t=83s)** — And you want to do this for several minutes, a few times a day.
- **[01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g44aTI7qiws&t=86s)** — I mean, this is pretty wild.
- **[01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g44aTI7qiws&t=87s)** — Humming could actually help your sinuses by basically restricting the airflow in your sinuses,
- **[01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g44aTI7qiws&t=93s)** — which increases nitric oxide.
- **[01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g44aTI7qiws&t=94s)** — The third one is pretty wild because it just involves standing on one leg for 30 seconds.
- **[01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g44aTI7qiws&t=101s)** — And then you're going to stand on the other leg for 30 seconds.
- **[01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g44aTI7qiws&t=103s)** — You're practicing your balance.
- **[01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g44aTI7qiws&t=105s)** — And this is from a 2014 study in the journal, Stroke.
- **[01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g44aTI7qiws&t=109s)** — And maybe you want to do this while you're brushing your teeth or shaving or something like that.
- **[01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g44aTI7qiws&t=112s)** — But what they found is it actually increases your gray matter volume,
- **[01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g44aTI7qiws&t=118s)** — which includes hippocampus, which is all about memory,
- **[02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g44aTI7qiws&t=122s)** — increasing your cognitive score by 13%.
- **[02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g44aTI7qiws&t=125s)** — So I guess the way that it works is you're basically forcing your body to balance on one leg,
- **[02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g44aTI7qiws&t=130s)** — which sends information up to your brain,
- **[02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g44aTI7qiws&t=132s)** — exercising that part of the brain, and improving that part of the brain.
- **[02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g44aTI7qiws&t=136s)** — The next one is also very interesting.
- **[02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g44aTI7qiws&t=139s)** — And this is sniffing something.
- **[02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g44aTI7qiws&t=141s)** — In a research paper in 2013, there was a study that showed that
- **[02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g44aTI7qiws&t=146s)** — you can increase your cognitive function memory by just under 8% by sniffing rosemary oil.
- **[02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g44aTI7qiws&t=153s)** — Wow. And apparently there's something in that oil that increases acetylcholine,
- **[02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g44aTI7qiws&t=158s)** — which is a neurotransmitter in your brain.
- **[02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g44aTI7qiws&t=160s)** — I also found three more papers, 2013, 2021, and 2017,
- **[02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g44aTI7qiws&t=167s)** — showing that sniffing lavender oil can significantly lower your anxiety and increase your mood,
- **[02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g44aTI7qiws&t=175s)** — as well as increasing your sleep quality, decreasing daytime sleepiness,
- **[02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g44aTI7qiws&t=179s)** — and even reducing post-surgical pain.
- **[03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g44aTI7qiws&t=182s)** — But when you sniff peppermint oil, you may find an increase in sustained attention,
- **[03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g44aTI7qiws&t=188s)** — better reaction time, better respiratory efficiency, and less tension headaches.
- **[03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g44aTI7qiws&t=193s)** — And then you have eucalyptus oil.
- **[03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g44aTI7qiws&t=194s)** — When you sniff that, apparently you have the most potent effect on your respiratory centers,
- **[03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g44aTI7qiws&t=200s)** — significantly decreasing coughing, improving COPD, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease,
- **[03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g44aTI7qiws&t=206s)** — as well as decreasing mucus in the respiratory areas.
- **[03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g44aTI7qiws&t=210s)** — And then lastly, with frankincense oil, they found that it can actually decrease neuroinflammation,
- **[03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g44aTI7qiws&t=215s)** — inflammation in your brain, which can directly improve your memory scores,
- **[03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g44aTI7qiws&t=220s)** — as well as decreasing anxiety.
- **[03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g44aTI7qiws&t=222s)** — I mean, you don't need to consume it. You can just smell it.
- **[03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g44aTI7qiws&t=224s)** — It probably lasts longer.
- **[03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g44aTI7qiws&t=225s)** — This next one is actually interesting. You might want to try it.
- **[03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g44aTI7qiws&t=228s)** — This was a study in 2018 in the Journal of Physiological Anthropology.
- **[03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g44aTI7qiws&t=234s)** — By wearing dry, warm socks to bed, you can actually increase your sleep 32 minutes longer
- **[04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g44aTI7qiws&t=241s)** — and improve the quality of sleep just by dry, warm socks.
- **[04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g44aTI7qiws&t=247s)** — And I'm sure that would really even work better with someone with cold feet.
- **[04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g44aTI7qiws&t=250s)** — Then we come into something else called forest bathing.
- **[04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g44aTI7qiws&t=253s)** — I did a video on this a long time ago.
- **[04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g44aTI7qiws&t=255s)** — So just by being out in the forest, 20 to 30 minutes, smelling the trees, touching the leaves,
- **[04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g44aTI7qiws&t=261s)** — listening to the birds, significant improvement, 26% increase in natural killer cells in your immune system.
- **[04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g44aTI7qiws&t=269s)** — Those are the cells that not only kill cancer, but they kill viruses.
- **[04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g44aTI7qiws&t=274s)** — Your mood gets elevated. The blood pressure comes down significantly.
- **[04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g44aTI7qiws&t=278s)** — Your cortisol can decrease by 27%.
- **[04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g44aTI7qiws&t=280s)** — I think the results are based on certain volatile vapor chemicals that come off of trees,
- **[04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g44aTI7qiws&t=287s)** — as well as just being in that environment.
- **[04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g44aTI7qiws&t=290s)** — You're kind of extracting all this stress when you put your attention in this new environment.
- **[04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g44aTI7qiws&t=295s)** — The next one is actually singing in the shower.
- **[04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g44aTI7qiws&t=299s)** — Now, a lot of people sing in the shower, but they don't realize the health benefits of singing in the shower.
- **[05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g44aTI7qiws&t=304s)** — By singing loudly in the shower for 5 to 10 minutes,
- **[05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g44aTI7qiws&t=307s)** — and this is from a paper in 2018, European Journal of Applied Physiology.
- **[05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g44aTI7qiws&t=312s)** — You can actually increase a certain immune cell by 37%.
- **[05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g44aTI7qiws&t=315s)** — I'm not going to get into the tactical name of that immune cell,
- **[05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g44aTI7qiws&t=318s)** — but I will say it strengthens your immune system and it's comparable to taking vitamin C.
- **[05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g44aTI7qiws&t=322s)** — And at the same time, it shows that it can decrease your cortisol by 19%.
- **[05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g44aTI7qiws&t=325s)** — That's the stress hormone and increase your lung function by 14%.
- **[05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g44aTI7qiws&t=329s)** — So the next time you're singing in the shower, realize you're improving your immune system and you're reducing your stress.
- **[05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g44aTI7qiws&t=334s)** — If you found that interesting, I have more health hacks in this video right here. Check them out.

- **[00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1SIEftYSvY&t=0s)** — Cancer thrives in a low vitamin D environment. Let me explain. There are so many different mechanisms on how vitamin D can reduce someone's risk for cancer.
- **[00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1SIEftYSvY&t=11s)** — So this is really a cause 22 because on one hand the great importance of vitamin D to help keep you from getting cancer, but on the other hand if you get cancer, now what?
- **[00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1SIEftYSvY&t=21s)** — That cancer is going to drive your vitamin D right down to the bottom. Somehow it knows that if you have enough vitamin D it's very hard for cancer to exist.
- **[00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1SIEftYSvY&t=29s)** — Number one, vitamin D has the ability to trigger a cell to commit suicide if there's damage to that cell. Because if you think about it, what's cancer?
- **[00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1SIEftYSvY&t=39s)** — Cancer is a normal cell that converts to a cancer cell because there's some damage to it.
- **[00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1SIEftYSvY&t=44s)** — Normally what's supposed to happen if that cell is damaged is that it's supposed to commit suicide and get rid of itself.
- **[00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1SIEftYSvY&t=51s)** — Vitamin D is intimately involved doing the job so it doesn't go into cancer.
- **[00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1SIEftYSvY&t=55s)** — Number two, vitamin D helps regulate excess out of control cell growth. The tumor cell cannot get any nutrition at all or resources. It can die.
- **[01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1SIEftYSvY&t=66s)** — Next one, vitamin D is anti-inflammatory. One of the hallmarks for cancer is inflammation. Vitamin D normally is supposed to get rid of that inflammation.
- **[01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1SIEftYSvY&t=75s)** — So several of the things that occur with tumors or cancer is number one, inflammation.
- **[01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1SIEftYSvY&t=81s)** — Number two, a lack of oxygen. And number three, an alteration in the pH. In other words, the environment where tumors thrive is acid.
- **[01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1SIEftYSvY&t=91s)** — Well guess what? Vitamin D enhances almost every part of your immune system. Vitamin D also enhances chemotherapy.
- **[01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1SIEftYSvY&t=99s)** — And vitamin D also helps to make insulin more sensitive. When people have insulin resistance, they're also greater at risk for getting cancer.
- **[01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1SIEftYSvY&t=106s)** — Vitamin D actually downgrades genes that cause cancer. And vitamin D greatly supports the gut microbiome that also is like 80% of your immune system.
- **[01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1SIEftYSvY&t=114s)** — That's what vitamin D can do. Now let's talk about what cancer does. In a cancer cell, you have inflammation, that lack of oxygen called hypoxia, and you also have an environment where it's very very acidic.
- **[02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1SIEftYSvY&t=127s)** — All three of those things block the absorption of vitamin D. They don't allow vitamin D to work. Cancer also blocks the enzymes that help you convert the inactive vitamin D to the active form of vitamin D directly.
- **[02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1SIEftYSvY&t=142s)** — When you get cancer, there's a lot of damage that occurs to the liver and the kidney. The two very important sites where you have vitamin D metabolism.
- **[02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1SIEftYSvY&t=152s)** — Then there's one more important piece of the puzzle before I get into the solution. And this involves four little tiny glands around your thyroid called the parathyroid gland. Let me explain what that is.
- **[02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1SIEftYSvY&t=163s)** — So I want to show you something very interesting about tumors and cancer. 80% of tumors make this specific hormone, which is very similar to the one that we have in the parathyroid gland.
- **[02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1SIEftYSvY&t=175s)** — Let me just make this really simple. Para means next to thyroid. You have four of them. So the thyroid is right here and you got four little glands are called the parathyroid.
- **[03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1SIEftYSvY&t=184s)** — The reason why this cancer makes this hormone right here is mainly to extract calcium from the bone because the purpose of the parathyroid gland is to make sure you have enough calcium in your blood.
- **[03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1SIEftYSvY&t=198s)** — Cancer somehow is able to make this specific hormone to extract calcium from our bone. This is one of the factors that you'll see in cancer is high levels of calcium in the blood. They call it hypercalcemia.
- **[03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1SIEftYSvY&t=210s)** — And now you know why. Because that darn cancer is making this hormone, it's extracting it from our bones as well as other resources from the bones as a survival mechanism.
- **[03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1SIEftYSvY&t=220s)** — But here's the problem. This hormone, when it goes up, actually lowers and inhibits your vitamin D. Too much calcium in the blood will also inhibit vitamin D. So now we got two other additional things that suppress this vitamin D.
- **[03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1SIEftYSvY&t=234s)** — As you can see, on top of all the other barriers, having genetic problems, having vitamin D resistance from a microbe or an infection, when we get cancer, the need for vitamin D goes straight up and vertical.
- **[04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1SIEftYSvY&t=245s)** — Let's talk about a solution. There are two systems of vitamin D. Vitamin D affecting your bone and calcium. But there's another system that doesn't involve calcium. It doesn't involve your bone. It involves supporting your immune system.
- **[04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1SIEftYSvY&t=262s)** — The bone system can get by with a small amount of vitamin D once every two weeks. The other system needs higher amounts in daily amounts. For cancer, you want to go way up from 10,000. You want to do 50,000 I use every single day.
- **[04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1SIEftYSvY&t=276s)** — With the magnesium, with the K2, with the zinc. And I want to make a disclaimer. I am not telling you that this is going to cure your cancer. I am just giving you some additional information.
- **[04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1SIEftYSvY&t=284s)** — Especially since the World Health Organization even acknowledges that vitamin D has anti-carcinogenic properties. It's also interesting to other inflammatory conditions like autoimmune diseases. You have this lowered amount of vitamin D3 because vitamin D3 doesn't work when you have a lot of inflammation. You need to take more.
- **[05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1SIEftYSvY&t=303s)** — There's quite a few other diseases that you nearly always have low amounts of vitamin D3 in. Autoimmune diseases, osteoarthritis, which is not a...

- **[00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJDDb9EvKr8&t=0s)** — I want to talk about castor oil and what it can do for your face.
- **[00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJDDb9EvKr8&t=3s)** — It's definitely nature's natural botox. It's really stood the test of time.
- **[00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJDDb9EvKr8&t=8s)** — It's been around for thousands of years. Egyptians used it. The Romans used it.
- **[00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJDDb9EvKr8&t=12s)** — Many other civilizations used it for certain healing properties.
- **[00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJDDb9EvKr8&t=16s)** — Most importantly, should we be concerned about the toxin, ricin, and castor oil?
- **[00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJDDb9EvKr8&t=21s)** — It's actually 6,000 times more poisonous than cyanide.
- **[00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJDDb9EvKr8&t=25s)** — This compound is 12,000 times more poisonous than rattlesnake venom.
- **[00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJDDb9EvKr8&t=31s)** — Let's dive right in and talk about castor oil. It can give your skin that soft, glowing, elastic, and firm look.
- **[00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJDDb9EvKr8&t=37s)** — Whether you have these little fine wrinkles or bigger wrinkles or dry skin, you need to use castor oil.
- **[00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJDDb9EvKr8&t=43s)** — The main phytochemical that's behind all these amazing effects is called ricinoleic acid.
- **[00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJDDb9EvKr8&t=47s)** — It's a deep penetrating moisturizer. It kind of traps the water in there and it keeps you super hydrated.
- **[00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJDDb9EvKr8&t=54s)** — This is why a lot of people actually put this oil on their face at night and then when they wake up in the morning, they're like,
- **[00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJDDb9EvKr8&t=59s)** — wow, my skin looks significantly different. You can also put this on your hair.
- **[01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJDDb9EvKr8&t=64s)** — And I'm going to show you how to apply it on the hair in a little bit, as well as on your scalp.
- **[01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJDDb9EvKr8&t=68s)** — If you have split ends or you have dried out hair, you can definitely see a huge change very quick.
- **[01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJDDb9EvKr8&t=73s)** — This plant-based chemical also has very powerful anti-inflammatory effects.
- **[01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJDDb9EvKr8&t=79s)** — Applying castor oil onto a face that's inflamed, it's a very effective remedy.
- **[01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJDDb9EvKr8&t=84s)** — Castor oil also has an anti-microbial effect too. You have to understand that there is an entire microbial life on the surface of all of your skin.
- **[01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJDDb9EvKr8&t=94s)** — Those microbes are there to protect you against all sorts of bad things.
- **[01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJDDb9EvKr8&t=97s)** — You have to realize that there's a lot of skin related problems that are an overgrowth of either bacteria or yeast or even a fungus.
- **[01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJDDb9EvKr8&t=106s)** — Castor oil is the perfect antidote to that. There's also a bacterial component to acne.
- **[01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJDDb9EvKr8&t=111s)** — Castor oil also has a good amount of vitamin E. Vitamin E can give you protection against things like UV radiation and pollution.
- **[02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJDDb9EvKr8&t=120s)** — Some of the properties in castor oil you can put on a wound to heal it.
- **[02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJDDb9EvKr8&t=125s)** — It also has other properties of fading the darker spots on the skin as well.
- **[02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJDDb9EvKr8&t=130s)** — This can overall give you a nice even complexion.
- **[02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJDDb9EvKr8&t=132s)** — In castor oil, there's a vitamin A precursor, beta carotene, which can help support the skin.
- **[02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJDDb9EvKr8&t=138s)** — You also have a good amount of magnesium and potassium, which the skin can benefit from as well.
- **[02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJDDb9EvKr8&t=143s)** — And there's even some evidence that castor oil can help stimulate collagen synthesis, which is actually very important in the anti-aging process to keep that collagen as full as possible.
- **[02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJDDb9EvKr8&t=155s)** — You would definitely want to apply castor oil to any scars that you have.
- **[02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJDDb9EvKr8&t=159s)** — Acne scars, scars from stretch marks which happen to be in your abdomen, any scars in the body.
- **[02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJDDb9EvKr8&t=163s)** — If you want to routinely rub a few drops into a scar for a period of maybe 30 seconds, as far as the potency of this anti-inflammatory effect, it can be comparable to something like ibuprofen.
- **[02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJDDb9EvKr8&t=175s)** — How do we apply it? A lot of people cut it with other oils. Coconut oil, olive oil, and there's hundreds of different types of oils you can also cut it with.
- **[03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJDDb9EvKr8&t=185s)** — Other people don't cut it. They use it as is. Because one of the challenges with this oil, it's thick and a little bit sticky.
- **[03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJDDb9EvKr8&t=191s)** — You simply take a couple drops, put it on your fingertips, and rub it into your face in areas that are dry, wrinkled, or reddened, or irritated.
- **[03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJDDb9EvKr8&t=201s)** — You just apply a little bit more of that into those areas. If we're talking about a couple drops, we're talking about like three cents a day it's going to cost you to create these effects.
- **[03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJDDb9EvKr8&t=210s)** — I recommend applying this before you go to bed. When you wake up, it has a chance to really penetrate and soak into the tissues.
- **[03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJDDb9EvKr8&t=217s)** — I would be careful putting it around your abdomen or pelvis area if you are pregnant and you're not ready to deliver because it could induce labor.
- **[03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJDDb9EvKr8&t=227s)** — Another application is some women use it to take off makeup from their face. They might mix it in with other types of lotions as a makeup remover as well because it gives you some additional benefits.
- **[03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJDDb9EvKr8&t=238s)** — If you're going to put it in your hair, what I would recommend, especially if you have hair loss, is to rub it deep into the scalp.
- **[04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJDDb9EvKr8&t=245s)** — What it could potentially do is stimulate the growth of hair, especially if you have alopecia.
- **[04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJDDb9EvKr8&t=251s)** — You really want to rub it deeply and really scrub into the scalp any areas where you want to grow hair.
- **[04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJDDb9EvKr8&t=256s)** — I'd also put like four drops into your fingertips and run it through your entire hair as well before you go to bed.
- **[04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJDDb9EvKr8&t=262s)** — That way when you wake up, you're going to notice that your hair is just so hydrated.
- **[04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJDDb9EvKr8&t=266s)** — As far as the type of castor oil I would recommend, I would definitely spend the extra money for something cold pressed, something without hexane.
- **[04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJDDb9EvKr8&t=274s)** — That's a solvent. You want organic, they use hexane and a lot of the seed oils to extract certain things as well.
- **[04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJDDb9EvKr8&t=280s)** — So if you're consuming soy oil, canola, cottonseed, corn oil, you're getting potentially some hexane.
- **[04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJDDb9EvKr8&t=288s)** — And a lot of people use the Jamaican black castor oil. It seems to have some amazing properties that are even better than the regular castor oil and other parts of the world.
- **[04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJDDb9EvKr8&t=297s)** — If you want to grow your eyelashes, castor oil is a great remedy.
- **[05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJDDb9EvKr8&t=302s)** — Just on a daily basis, rub just a little bit into the roots of the eyelashes and watch things start to change in a positive way.
- **[05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJDDb9EvKr8&t=311s)** — Lastly, what about this toxin in castor oil? You don't have to worry about it.
- **[05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJDDb9EvKr8&t=316s)** — That specific toxin is eliminated in the production of creating this oil.
- **[05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJDDb9EvKr8&t=322s)** — The manufacturer companies that make this know about this poison and so it's tested to make sure there's no poison in there.
- **[05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJDDb9EvKr8&t=329s)** — Of course, if anyone is exposed to this, unfortunately, there's not a simple antidote.
- **[05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJDDb9EvKr8&t=335s)** — You just need to go to the hospital to see what they can do.
- **[05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJDDb9EvKr8&t=337s)** — And if you have certain amounts, which is not a lot, you have like 36 to 72 hours before you die.
- **[05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJDDb9EvKr8&t=342s)** — It can be very dangerous. But of course, you do not have to worry about that if you're using the oil.
- **[05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJDDb9EvKr8&t=346s)** — It's quite a paradox to have something so poisonous to be also be so therapeutic to so many parts of your body.
- **[05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJDDb9EvKr8&t=354s)** — It's quite fascinating. Thanks for watching.
- **[05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJDDb9EvKr8&t=356s)** — And if you haven't seen my video on the number one nutrient deficiency behind all types of skin disorders,
- **[06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJDDb9EvKr8&t=363s)** — we're talking about dermatitis and a lot of other skin problems.
- **[06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJDDb9EvKr8&t=367s)** — If you haven't seen the video, you might want to watch it. I'll put it up right here. Check it out.

## Video 28: Do Chia Seeds Have ANY Benefits?

- **[00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDHqTnjBM0Y&t=0s)** — Let's talk about the real benefit of chia seeds. I mean, if we talk about the omega-3s, okay,
- **[00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDHqTnjBM0Y&t=6s)** — omega-3s are good for the heart, they're good for thinning the blood, and of course, salmon and
- **[00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDHqTnjBM0Y&t=11s)** — sardines are always recommended because they have high amounts of omega-3. Then what's this deal
- **[00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDHqTnjBM0Y&t=17s)** — with chia seeds having more omega-3 if you look gram for gram? But what they don't tell you
- **[00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDHqTnjBM0Y&t=24s)** — is the type of omega-3 is not the active omega-3 that people think about as an anti-inflammatory.
- **[00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDHqTnjBM0Y&t=30s)** — That's called DHA. The type of omega-3 that chia is known for, and by the way,
- **[00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDHqTnjBM0Y&t=35s)** — chia has the most of this, is called ALA. It's the thing that comes before the conversion
- **[00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDHqTnjBM0Y&t=42s)** — into this active form of this omega-3. So the question is how much of that ALA converts to DHA?
- **[00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDHqTnjBM0Y&t=50s)** — And the answer is not very much. It's like 0.5%. The next point is about eggs. Now,
- **[00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDHqTnjBM0Y&t=58s)** — whereas an egg, like a medium-sized egg might have seven grams of protein, chia seed has
- **[01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDHqTnjBM0Y&t=64s)** — four grams of protein. The question is, is it the same? And the answer is no, because the egg
- **[01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDHqTnjBM0Y&t=71s)** — is the most bioavailable protein that you can consume. Actually, I lied. Breast
- **[01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDHqTnjBM0Y&t=80s)** — but chia seed and other plant proteins are pretty low on the list, and I've searched everywhere for
- **[01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDHqTnjBM0Y&t=86s)** — a long period of time to try to find out how bioavailable it is, and I couldn't find that data.
- **[01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDHqTnjBM0Y&t=91s)** — Now, chia seed also has some vitamin E, some vitamin C. It has some of the B vitamins. It
- **[01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDHqTnjBM0Y&t=98s)** — has calcium, phosphorus, potassium, magnesium. And if you look at the research on chia seed,
- **[01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDHqTnjBM0Y&t=103s)** — you'll see cardio-protective benefits, benefits to help lower your blood pressure,
- **[01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDHqTnjBM0Y&t=109s)** — benefits for your brain, and can even thin your blood. But the biggest benefit from consuming chia
- **[01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDHqTnjBM0Y&t=115s)** — seeds has to do with this soluble fiber. Okay, so, and what I normally do is take two
- **[02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDHqTnjBM0Y&t=122s)** — tablespoons of chia seed and I'll put it in about a half a cup of either milk or almond
- **[02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDHqTnjBM0Y&t=129s)** — milk, okay, unsweetened. And then I'll kind of mix it around until it swells up into this
- **[02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDHqTnjBM0Y&t=135s)** — and then I'll add some berries or some kefir, which is a little better than yogurt.
- **[02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDHqTnjBM0Y&t=141s)** — But if you're going to use yogurt, I would use Greek yogurt, some coconut cream, and maybe some
- **[02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDHqTnjBM0Y&t=147s)** — nuts, and it makes a great pudding. Okay, but the benefit is in this gel. This gel is a
- **[02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDHqTnjBM0Y&t=154s)** — soluble fiber that is a wonderful food for your microbiome. Your microbiome love this gel,
- **[02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDHqTnjBM0Y&t=163s)** — and they can eat it up and turn it into food for the colon cells. And they can use it as energy.
- **[02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDHqTnjBM0Y&t=171s)** — If you have inflammation in your gut, this would be a good thing to take.
- **[02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDHqTnjBM0Y&t=175s)** — And also if you have constipation, it can help you with that as well. Some people are
- **[02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDHqTnjBM0Y&t=179s)** — concerned about these things called lactins, which can actually irritate the colon if there's
- **[03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDHqTnjBM0Y&t=184s)** — inflammation. Well, chia seeds have very low amounts of lactins, so you don't have to worry
- **[03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDHqTnjBM0Y&t=189s)** — lactins with chia seed. Also in that gel, you have other nutrients like polyphenols. These are
- **[03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDHqTnjBM0Y&t=195s)** — certain plant-based chemicals that your microbes love and they can eat as well. But the real
- **[03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDHqTnjBM0Y&t=200s)** — benefit is feeding microbes that benefit you indirectly. There's a huge connection between
- **[03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDHqTnjBM0Y&t=206s)** — your mood and your energy and how your overall health is and the health of the gut microbiome.
- **[03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDHqTnjBM0Y&t=213s)** — So I would recommend consuming things like chia seed and other things that can feed the
- **[03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDHqTnjBM0Y&t=218s)** — microbes, including fermented vegetables like sauerkraut, pickles, kimchi, things like that,
- **[03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDHqTnjBM0Y&t=224s)** — on a regular basis. A couple little last points. You don't want to grind the seeds.
- **[03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDHqTnjBM0Y&t=229s)** — You can soak them whole. The Aztecs used to consume chia seeds. So it's been around for
- **[03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDHqTnjBM0Y&t=235s)** — a long time. Now if you have not seen my other video on chia seeds, check it out. I put
- **[03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDHqTnjBM0Y&t=239s)** — it up right here.

- **[00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCNNDojIDto&t=2s)** — Did you realize that one in four people over the age of 65 has a cataract?
- **[00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCNNDojIDto&t=7s)** — And by the time they reach 80 years old, one in two people will have a cataract.
- **[00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCNNDojIDto&t=12s)** — 28,000 people a day worldwide develop cataracts.
- **[00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCNNDojIDto&t=15s)** — Many people actually go blind because of it.
- **[00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCNNDojIDto&t=17s)** — All it takes is a little bit of oxidative stress to the lens of the eye to start developing cataracts.
- **[00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCNNDojIDto&t=24s)** — Oxidative stress is kind of like a rusting out of a tissue.
- **[00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCNNDojIDto&t=27s)** — Normally in the lens of the eye you have this organized protein.
- **[00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCNNDojIDto&t=31s)** — This protein is called crystalline.
- **[00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCNNDojIDto&t=33s)** — It's one of the oldest proteins you have in your body because you developed it when you were in an embryo before you were actually born.
- **[00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCNNDojIDto&t=40s)** — The problem with this protein is it never gets replaced like other tissues.
- **[00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCNNDojIDto&t=43s)** — It's not like your liver that can regenerate.
- **[00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCNNDojIDto&t=46s)** — Because once you start getting damage in the lens, that tissue does not replace.
- **[00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCNNDojIDto&t=50s)** — So over time you have a lot of things that can damage the lens.
- **[00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCNNDojIDto&t=53s)** — Something called glycation.
- **[00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCNNDojIDto&t=54s)** — Glycation is where you have a sugar that connects with a protein and it gets stuck.
- **[01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCNNDojIDto&t=60s)** — And now it becomes unusable to the body.
- **[01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCNNDojIDto&t=63s)** — That protein becomes damaged.
- **[01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCNNDojIDto&t=65s)** — This is why a lot of diabetics develop cataracts earlier than they should.
- **[01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCNNDojIDto&t=70s)** — Of course as we age we also develop them.
- **[01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCNNDojIDto&t=72s)** — Also steroids can really affect the eye.
- **[01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCNNDojIDto&t=73s)** — If you're on prednisone for example.
- **[01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCNNDojIDto&t=75s)** — Glycation for too much sugar or oxidation without having enough antioxidants built up in the lens of the eye.
- **[01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCNNDojIDto&t=82s)** — The problem is the lens of the eye becomes kind of frosted.
- **[01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCNNDojIDto&t=86s)** — Looking through a dirty lens where you can't quite see out of it.
- **[01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCNNDojIDto&t=90s)** — Then people get surgery.
- **[01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCNNDojIDto&t=91s)** — Not all surgeries can cure it and there are definitely complications.
- **[01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCNNDojIDto&t=94s)** — There's a remedy or an antidote to cataracts that is very effective and it's very safe.
- **[01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCNNDojIDto&t=100s)** — This video is on this book right here by a British medical doctor.
- **[01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCNNDojIDto&t=104s)** — I'm going to summarize the book and then I'll put a link down below of the book.
- **[01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCNNDojIDto&t=107s)** — So you can check it out if you want to get it.
- **[01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCNNDojIDto&t=109s)** — In this book the doctor talks about several remedies or antidotes.
- **[01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCNNDojIDto&t=113s)** — Some drug approaches like metformin and other diabetic medication which they have side effects.
- **[02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCNNDojIDto&t=120s)** — But he also talks about some natural things that also work very well.
- **[02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCNNDojIDto&t=124s)** — And one is a very specific form of carnosine.
- **[02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCNNDojIDto&t=128s)** — Carnosine is a very unique compound that can be combined in a certain form.
- **[02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCNNDojIDto&t=134s)** — That allows it to be transported through the eye and penetrate the lens.
- **[02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCNNDojIDto&t=139s)** — It's a super potent antioxidant.
- **[02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCNNDojIDto&t=142s)** — It has the potential to dissolve these damaged proteins in the eye.
- **[02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCNNDojIDto&t=146s)** — Not to mention it actually activates your own antioxidants.
- **[02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCNNDojIDto&t=150s)** — The solution is not to take it as a supplement but to take it in a drop form but not as carnosine.
- **[02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCNNDojIDto&t=156s)** — Because if you just take straight carnosine in a drop and you put it in the eyes it won't work.
- **[02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCNNDojIDto&t=161s)** — What you have to do is you have to combine it with a few things to allow it to be carried through the eye into the lens.
- **[02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCNNDojIDto&t=169s)** — Because the lens is a little bit deeper into the eye.
- **[02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCNNDojIDto&t=171s)** — You need carnosine in this form. N-acetyl-carnosine. N-A-C.
- **[02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCNNDojIDto&t=176s)** — It can be transported through the eye and once it gets in the eye into the fluid around the lens
- **[03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCNNDojIDto&t=182s)** — then it breaks apart and allows the carnosine to do its magic.
- **[03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCNNDojIDto&t=186s)** — During an experiment performed at the Moscow Hemholtz Research Institute of Eye Diseases
- **[03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCNNDojIDto&t=193s)** — scientists have used N-A-C eye drops 1% concentration on rabbits in the laboratory.
- **[03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCNNDojIDto&t=200s)** — They compared this treatment with inactive eye drops.
- **[03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCNNDojIDto&t=202s)** — N-A-C was able to reach the inner parts of the eye after about 15 to 30 minutes.
- **[03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCNNDojIDto&t=207s)** — During this process N-A-C was broken down which is then free to work against glycation in the lens of the eye.
- **[03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCNNDojIDto&t=213s)** — You also have a lot of membranes in there.
- **[03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCNNDojIDto&t=215s)** — Carnosine can penetrate and navigate through the fat membranes and so it reaches deep into the cell.
- **[03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCNNDojIDto&t=221s)** — During this experiment no side effects were reported.
- **[03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCNNDojIDto&t=224s)** — The authors concluded that N-A-C is proposed as a treatment for eye disorders including
- **[03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCNNDojIDto&t=230s)** — cataracts, glaucoma, corneal disorders, inflammation and complications from diabetes.
- **[03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCNNDojIDto&t=236s)** — Why would it improve complications of diabetes?
- **[03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCNNDojIDto&t=238s)** — Well, because diabetes increases your risk for cataracts.
- **[04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCNNDojIDto&t=242s)** — The eye is one of the big targets for diabetes.
- **[04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCNNDojIDto&t=245s)** — A group of scientists who performed in earlier rabbit experiments studied the effects of N-A-C drops on humans.
- **[04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCNNDojIDto&t=251s)** — The scientists selected 49 volunteers with an average age of 65 years who had established age-related cataracts.
- **[04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCNNDojIDto&t=258s)** — They then divided the patients into three groups.
- **[04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCNNDojIDto&t=261s)** — Group 1 they treated with a 1% solution of N-A-C eye drops.
- **[04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCNNDojIDto&t=265s)** — Group 2 was only treated with the placebo eye drops and group 3 was left untreated.
- **[04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCNNDojIDto&t=269s)** — The patients were examined at 2 to 6 months intervals.
- **[04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCNNDojIDto&t=273s)** — After 6 months approximately 41% of eyes treated with N-A-C presented a significant reduction in the clouding of the lens.
- **[04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCNNDojIDto&t=284s)** — 90% of the treated eyes showed a gradual improvement of vision.
- **[04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCNNDojIDto&t=288s)** — 89% of the eyes showed up to a 100% improvement of sensitivity to glare.
- **[04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCNNDojIDto&t=295s)** — I mean just think about what they did.
- **[04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCNNDojIDto&t=297s)** — They used a natural remedy with very little side effects if any
- **[05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCNNDojIDto&t=301s)** — to help get rid of cataracts.
- **[05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCNNDojIDto&t=304s)** — Let me also answer two questions out of the book.
- **[05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCNNDojIDto&t=306s)** — How long do I need to use the drops for a cataract?
- **[05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCNNDojIDto&t=309s)** — At least 3 to 5 months.
- **[05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCNNDojIDto&t=311s)** — Because it's not an overnight thing. It's going to be a while before it actually corrects everything.
- **[05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCNNDojIDto&t=316s)** — You're not using a toxic drug.
- **[05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCNNDojIDto&t=317s)** — You're using something that's more natural and it's slowly dissolve some of these proteins that are damaging or clouding the eye.
- **[05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCNNDojIDto&t=325s)** — In this video I'm not claiming that this natural remedy can cure anything.
- **[05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCNNDojIDto&t=329s)** — I'm just giving you information to maybe take a look at it.
- **[05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCNNDojIDto&t=333s)** — Another interesting thing about these NAC drops is that when you search for them on Amazon, you can't find them.
- **[05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCNNDojIDto&t=339s)** — I mean it's weird because I did see it a long time ago, but now you can't find it.
- **[05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCNNDojIDto&t=343s)** — You see a different type of NAC drops, but not the N-acetyl-carnosine drops.
- **[05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCNNDojIDto&t=348s)** — However, I did find a couple sources where you can find these drops online, but not necessarily on Amazon.
- **[05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCNNDojIDto&t=354s)** — And I will put those links down below.
- **[05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCNNDojIDto&t=356s)** — What lessons can we learn from this video?
- **[05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCNNDojIDto&t=358s)** — The risk factors. Diabetes, consuming junk foods, steroids are all things that speed up the process of cataracts.
- **[06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCNNDojIDto&t=366s)** — Cetols are the worst of the worst. I would avoid those.
- **[06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCNNDojIDto&t=370s)** — Antioxidants can protect you against cataracts.
- **[06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCNNDojIDto&t=373s)** — And I'm talking about onion, for example, is a good antioxidant.
- **[06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCNNDojIDto&t=376s)** — Egg yolks, leafy green vegetables, grass-fed red meat also can help you build up antioxidants to help fight these things.
- **[06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCNNDojIDto&t=384s)** — Vitamin A is also really important in the eyes.
- **[06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCNNDojIDto&t=386s)** — This is why how the oil is a good source of vitamin A.
- **[06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCNNDojIDto&t=390s)** — And so is grass-fed liver.
- **[06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCNNDojIDto&t=392s)** — And lastly, the B vitamins, specifically B6 and B2 and folate.
- **[06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCNNDojIDto&t=398s)** — Very important for the eyes.
- **[06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCNNDojIDto&t=399s)** — My goal is to give people alternative solutions that don't give you a lot of side effects that can work on a natural level,
- **[06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCNNDojIDto&t=408s)** — yet also tell you how to get to the root cause.
- **[06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCNNDojIDto&t=411s)** — Thanks for watching and I will see you in the next video.

## Full Transcript with Timestamps

*Click any timestamp to jump to that moment in the video*

- **[00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4-HmU8O5_EQ&t=0s)** — Today we are going to talk... excuse me... Today we are going to talk about how to get
- **[00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4-HmU8O5_EQ&t=8s)** — rid of phlegm that is stuck in your lungs. Now, far too often people reach for over-the-counter
- **[00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4-HmU8O5_EQ&t=16s)** — medications and they wonder why those treatments don't work and sometimes even have side
- **[00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4-HmU8O5_EQ&t=22s)** — effects. Now, there are two categories that these medications fit into. You have medications
- **[00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4-HmU8O5_EQ&t=26s)** — that suppress this mucus and then you have medications that pull mucus out. That's called
- **[00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4-HmU8O5_EQ&t=32s)** — an expectrant. And of course, anytime you suppress mucus or a cough, you may end up
- **[00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4-HmU8O5_EQ&t=39s)** — having that infection a lot longer and then you may also weaken your immune system.
- **[00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4-HmU8O5_EQ&t=45s)** — Plus, you might have some slight minor complications or side effects like vomiting, nausea,
- **[00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4-HmU8O5_EQ&t=52s)** — diarrhea, constipation, and kidney stones. Now, other than that, totally fine. And I'm
- **[00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4-HmU8O5_EQ&t=58s)** — describing the one medication that is an FDA approved expectrant. All the other ones
- **[01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4-HmU8O5_EQ&t=63s)** — are things that suppress mucus. So, of course, I think the best thing to do is to look
- **[01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4-HmU8O5_EQ&t=68s)** — for a natural remedy which I'm going to talk about right now. But I do want to
- **[01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4-HmU8O5_EQ&t=72s)** — mention it's important to exercise your lungs if you have this mucus that's trapped
- **[01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4-HmU8O5_EQ&t=77s)** — down into the lower part of your lungs. In other words, you might want to try alternating
- **[01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4-HmU8O5_EQ&t=82s)** — breathing through your chest, deep breaths through the nose, and also then stomach breathing
- **[01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4-HmU8O5_EQ&t=90s)** — where you're pumping the diaphragm up and down so you can mobilize some of this
- **[01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4-HmU8O5_EQ&t=94s)** — mucus. Another important thing to eat a lot of if you can do this is radishes.
- **[01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4-HmU8O5_EQ&t=101s)** — Radishes tend to pull mucus from the deeper tissues in your body. Also, as a
- **[01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4-HmU8O5_EQ&t=107s)** — mucus, but you have this dry cough, the usual remedy for that that usually works
- **[01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4-HmU8O5_EQ&t=111s)** — like almost 100% of the time is calcium. Any type of calcium. You just take it and
- **[01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4-HmU8O5_EQ&t=117s)** — it will tend to help get rid of that dry cough. Great for kids as well as adults.
- **[02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4-HmU8O5_EQ&t=123s)** — In fact, one of the medications out there for blood pressure called a calcium channel
- **[02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4-HmU8O5_EQ&t=129s)** — blocker works by blocking calcium and the side effect from that is coughing.
- **[02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4-HmU8O5_EQ&t=135s)** — Okay, so in this combination remedy, it just involves three simple ingredients in
- **[02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4-HmU8O5_EQ&t=140s)** — water. Onion, honey, and lemon. Let's start off with onions. Onions are
- **[02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4-HmU8O5_EQ&t=149s)** — basically a natural thinner of mucus. They're a natural, a very effective
- **[02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4-HmU8O5_EQ&t=155s)** — mucus expectant. They will help suppress a cough. They, especially if
- **[02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4-HmU8O5_EQ&t=164s)** — mucus, just like a radishes. Yes, you can eat onions, but you also can juice onions.
- **[02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4-HmU8O5_EQ&t=169s)** — If you don't have a juicer, what you do is you get a grater and you grate the onions
- **[02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4-HmU8O5_EQ&t=174s)** — in a little bowl. You put that then in a strainer with some maybe paper towel and you
- **[03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4-HmU8O5_EQ&t=180s)** — push the juice out of it. And all you really need is one tablespoon of this onion juice.
- **[03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4-HmU8O5_EQ&t=186s)** — And that's basically 14.7 milliliters for those people in Europe. Onions are also one
- **[03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4-HmU8O5_EQ&t=192s)** — of the highest sources of quercetin. Now quercetin is a natural antihistamine and it has
- **[03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4-HmU8O5_EQ&t=199s)** — no side effects. So it's really good for allergies and mucus production and inflammation.
- **[03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4-HmU8O5_EQ&t=207s)** — And it calms down an overactive immune system. So we're going to combine this onion juice
- **[03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4-HmU8O5_EQ&t=212s)** — with the next thing on the list, which is honey. Now, if you can get the manuka honey,
- **[03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4-HmU8O5_EQ&t=217s)** — a little bit better, but any of the raw honeys will work. Honey has been a known great remedy
- **[03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4-HmU8O5_EQ&t=223s)** — to suppress coughing, to help as a natural expectant, to help with mucus as an anti-microbial,
- **[03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4-HmU8O5_EQ&t=231s)** — anti-inflammatory. I mean, think about what these bees do. They go around to all of these
- **[03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4-HmU8O5_EQ&t=235s)** — flowering trees and plants and they pull out the nectar. And with that comes a lot of
- **[04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4-HmU8O5_EQ&t=243s)** — pollen. So we have all these factors that can help your own immune system. It's even considered
- **[04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4-HmU8O5_EQ&t=249s)** — like a natural antibiotic of your respiratory system. I mean, they use the manuka honey on
- **[04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4-HmU8O5_EQ&t=255s)** — open wounds to help heal like bed sores. And manuka honey, if you can get it, has this
- **[04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4-HmU8O5_EQ&t=261s)** — additional X factor. It's called MgO. And this is a chemical that is a very powerful
- **[04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4-HmU8O5_EQ&t=267s)** — anti-microbial. But like I said before, you can use any raw honey. It will work. Honey
- **[04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4-HmU8O5_EQ&t=271s)** — also has naturally hydrogen peroxide, which is good to kill pathogens. But for upper respiratory
- **[04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4-HmU8O5_EQ&t=277s)** — infections like the sinus and lower respiratory infections, it's an effective remedy. And we're
- **[04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4-HmU8O5_EQ&t=283s)** — going to use one tablespoon. That is 14.7 milliliters. So we take these first two
- **[04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4-HmU8O5_EQ&t=290s)** — ingredients. We mix it with the third ingredient, which is lemon juice. So with the lemon juice,
- **[04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4-HmU8O5_EQ&t=294s)** — you want to use two tablespoons, which is 29.4 milliliters. And the citric acid in the lemon
- **[05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4-HmU8O5_EQ&t=301s)** — juice will actually break up mucus. The vitamin C will help the immune system. And lemon is like
- **[05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4-HmU8O5_EQ&t=307s)** — this sour, somewhat bitter substance, which is great to kind of thin the mucus and also cause
- **[05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4-HmU8O5_EQ&t=314s)** — the mucus to kind of come up so you can get it out of the body. Now you want to add these
- **[05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4-HmU8O5_EQ&t=318s)** — three ingredients to a cup of water and you want to drink this three times a day. Now if
- **[05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4-HmU8O5_EQ&t=323s)** — you want to add a couple additional things, I would add a tablespoon of apple cider vinegar
- **[05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4-HmU8O5_EQ&t=328s)** — and you can even add some ginger. But this is actually a no-brainer, very simple,
- **[05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4-HmU8O5_EQ&t=333s)** — virtually no side effect type remedy for getting rid of mucus. Now there are other causes of
- **[05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4-HmU8O5_EQ&t=339s)** — mucus that need different solutions. Like if you have GERD, where you're having acid
- **[05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4-HmU8O5_EQ&t=347s)** — reflux coming up through this your valve on the top of the stomach. If you haven't seen my
- **[05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4-HmU8O5_EQ&t=352s)** — video on that, which actually got over, I think, five million views, I put that up right here. Check it out.

- **[00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zXd86RvNzZA&t=0s)** — Now, out of all the nuts, walnuts have something called ALA. That stands for alpha-linoleic
- **[00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zXd86RvNzZA&t=6s)** — acid, which is a precursor to EPA and DHA, which are the omega-3 fatty acids.
- **[00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zXd86RvNzZA&t=14s)** — But ALA itself has some unique benefits. For your skin, it can actually help prevent scaly
- **[00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zXd86RvNzZA&t=21s)** — skin, dermatitis, hyperpigmentation of the skin, where you have dark blotches through the skin.
- **[00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zXd86RvNzZA&t=27s)** — It's also been known to prevent skin atrophy. And of course, if it converts to the more powerful
- **[00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zXd86RvNzZA&t=33s)** — forms of omega-3, it can help a lot of things like your heart, inflammation, brain health,
- **[00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zXd86RvNzZA&t=39s)** — and the list goes on and on and on. But you have to realize that only a percentage of ALA
- **[00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zXd86RvNzZA&t=44s)** — converts to EPA and DHA. So to convert to EPA, it's roughly about between 10 to 21 percent.
- **[00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zXd86RvNzZA&t=51s)** — And then converting to DHA, we're only getting between five to nine percent. Also,
- **[00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zXd86RvNzZA&t=56s)** — some interesting studies that show benefits for your cardiovascular system. Yeah, seven out of
- **[01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zXd86RvNzZA&t=62s)** — eight of the studies showed benefits to the endothelial wall of the inside of your arteries.
- **[01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zXd86RvNzZA&t=69s)** — Now realize these studies were not on a lot of people. So, you know, it's a correlation,
- **[01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zXd86RvNzZA&t=74s)** — but it's not proof that it can actually help your heart. Also, it was shown that there was
- **[01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zXd86RvNzZA&t=78s)** — shift from small particle size LDL to large particle size LDL. And walnuts have folate,
- **[01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zXd86RvNzZA&t=88s)** — vitamin E, polyphenols, and they're low in lysine and high in arginine. Now,
- **[01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zXd86RvNzZA&t=95s)** — arginine can help increase growth hormone. It can help rid excess ammonia. So it's involved
- **[01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zXd86RvNzZA&t=101s)** — in the urea cycle. Also, arginine can increase nitric oxide, which is good for blood pressure
- **[01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zXd86RvNzZA&t=108s)** — and cardiovascular health. Here's the problem with walnuts. Most people eat them raw, and they
- **[01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zXd86RvNzZA&t=114s)** — have phytates, sometimes even more than grains, and they have enzyme inhibitors. So they can
- **[02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zXd86RvNzZA&t=121s)** — create bloating. However, the solution is to germinate the walnuts. So you'd soak them in
- **[02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zXd86RvNzZA&t=128s)** — between 24 and 48 hours, and that will remove the phytates as well as the enzyme inhibitors.
- **[02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zXd86RvNzZA&t=134s)** — Of course, you're going to have to dry them out in the oven under low heats or a dehydrator.
- **[02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zXd86RvNzZA&t=139s)** — But the problem with phytates is that phytates block certain minerals like zinc, iron,
- **[02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zXd86RvNzZA&t=145s)** — magnesium. So our bodies can tolerate a certain amount of phytates, but if we're
- **[02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zXd86RvNzZA&t=149s)** — consuming too much, that can create a problem with the mineral absorption, as well as our
- **[02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zXd86RvNzZA&t=154s)** — Now, as far as the enzyme inhibitors, it can inhibit pepsin, which is involved in protein
- **[02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zXd86RvNzZA&t=160s)** — digestion in your stomach. It can also inhibit amylase, which has to do with
- **[02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zXd86RvNzZA&t=165s)** — carbohydrate metabolism, as well as inhibiting trypsin in your small intestine. And this
- **[02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zXd86RvNzZA&t=171s)** — is why if you eat too many nuts, you're going to feel kind of bloated, and you might
- **[02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zXd86RvNzZA&t=175s)** — have constipation. However, if you germinate the nuts, you'll have much less problem. Now,
- **[03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zXd86RvNzZA&t=184s)** — organic walnuts, and it's a really good brand, but I consume these after a meal,
- **[03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zXd86RvNzZA&t=189s)** — and they're quite delicious. And they don't create the bloating that normal walnuts can
- **[03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zXd86RvNzZA&t=194s)** — create. But apparently they germinate these for about 48 hours. And I'm going to I'll
- **[03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zXd86RvNzZA&t=199s)** — put a link down below because when I find a good quality product that people work hard
- **[03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zXd86RvNzZA&t=204s)** — at creating, I promote it. Now one little point, I would only recommend the plain,
- **[03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zXd86RvNzZA&t=209s)** — not the other ones, because the other ones have, I think, some honey, which I don't recommend.
- **[03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zXd86RvNzZA&t=215s)** — Now, if you haven't seen my other video I did on pistachios,

- **[00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iARMPdrblY&t=0s)** — Would you be willing to consume two of these each day to help prepare your thyroid?
- **[00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iARMPdrblY&t=6s)** — And I'm talking about Brazil nuts for a very specific reason.
- **[00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iARMPdrblY&t=12s)** — Most hypo low thyroid condition problems is Hashimoto's. This is an autoimmune problem.
- **[00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iARMPdrblY&t=20s)** — It's not usually related to lacking iodine, but Hashimoto's is the most common type of autoimmune
- **[00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iARMPdrblY&t=26s)** — disease of all the autoimmune diseases. 14 million people a year get it just in the U.S. alone.
- **[00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iARMPdrblY&t=32s)** — And when you have Hashimoto's, you're more at risk of developing other types of autoimmune diseases
- **[00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iARMPdrblY&t=37s)** — as well. Hashimoto's thyroiditis, which is inflammation of the thyroid, doesn't always
- **[00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iARMPdrblY&t=43s)** — cause hypothyroidism, but usually it does. And so what's fascinating about these Brazil nuts
- **[00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iARMPdrblY&t=49s)** — is their selenium content and what selenium can do for Hashimoto's. I mean, it's
- **[00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iARMPdrblY&t=55s)** — First of all, selenium is a trace mineral needed in very tiny amounts. Selenium is involved in
- **[01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iARMPdrblY&t=61s)** — over 25 different genes involving antioxidants, giving anti-inflammatory effects. Selenium also is
- **[01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iARMPdrblY&t=69s)** — in shellfish and seafood and organ meats, but it's the highest in Brazil nuts. And so if you
- **[01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iARMPdrblY&t=76s)** — had two of these nuts, you would get close to like 200 micrograms of selenium every single day.
- **[01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iARMPdrblY&t=81s)** — In 17 randomized control trials, it has been shown that selenium reduces the antibodies
- **[01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iARMPdrblY&t=90s)** — that are attacking your thyroid and selenium can slow down that attack. Even the way they
- **[01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iARMPdrblY&t=96s)** — diagnose thyroid conditions like hypothyroidism, they look at the hormone that's released from
- **[01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iARMPdrblY&t=101s)** — the pituitary that goes down to the thyroid. It's called the thyroid stimulating hormone. And
- **[01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iARMPdrblY&t=106s)** — that hormone goes up. That means it's not connecting with the thyroid. And chances are you have a
- **[01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iARMPdrblY&t=112s)** — hypothyroid condition. Well, it just so happens that selenium also helps that condition too.
- **[01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iARMPdrblY&t=119s)** — With an Hashimoto's situation, you have a lot of hydrogen peroxide being generated. So by
- **[02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iARMPdrblY&t=125s)** — taking selenium, you can help neutralize the effect of hydrogen peroxide. And even too much
- **[02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iARMPdrblY&t=132s)** — hydrogen peroxide itself can trigger an autoimmune disease. Selenium also controls the T helper
- **[02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iARMPdrblY&t=140s)** — cells that orchestrate the entire immune response. And it also feeds the T reg cells,
- **[02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iARMPdrblY&t=148s)** — preventing autoimmune diseases. And because our brain and our immune system and our reproductive
- **[02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iARMPdrblY&t=155s)** — system are so heavily dependent on selenium, there's probably not a lot left for the
- **[02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iARMPdrblY&t=161s)** — to have enough to function correctly. And so the person starts developing this Hashimoto's and
- **[02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iARMPdrblY&t=168s)** — they start getting tired, cold, they gain weight, hair loss, the hair becomes brittle.
- **[02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iARMPdrblY&t=173s)** — So here's what I would recommend. Start consuming two Brazil nuts per day. I mean, you could
- **[02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iARMPdrblY&t=177s)** — take a little bit more, maybe up to four, but I wouldn't take more than that. Because
- **[03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iARMPdrblY&t=181s)** — you can have problems with the deficiency of selenium and also a problem if you have too
- **[03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iARMPdrblY&t=185s)** — much selenium too. So you just need the right amount. In addition to Brazil nuts, I would
- **[03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iARMPdrblY&t=190s)** — also recommend either getting enough sun or taking high doses of vitamin D3. Why? Because
- **[03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iARMPdrblY&t=197s)** — vitamin D3 also helps to regulate an overactive immune system. Now, since I mentioned a little
- **[03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iARMPdrblY&t=204s)** — bit about vitamin D, I think there's some more to know about vitamin D in relationship
- **[03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iARMPdrblY&t=208s)** — to autoimmune diseases. So for that information, I put it up right here. Check it out.

- **[00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OKg8Ik04WpM&t=0s)** — I have a quiz for you today and I want to see which one of these do you think is healthier.
- **[00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OKg8Ik04WpM&t=5s)** — We're mainly only looking at the nutritional facts. So we have product A and product B.
- **[00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OKg8Ik04WpM&t=10s)** — On the left there's 29 grams of total fat. On the right there's 8 grams of total fat.
- **[00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OKg8Ik04WpM&t=15s)** — On the left there's 4 grams of saturated fat. On the right there's only 1 gram of saturated fat.
- **[00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OKg8Ik04WpM&t=24s)** — On the left there is 17 grams of carbohydrate. On the right there's 16 grams of carbohydrate.
- **[00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OKg8Ik04WpM&t=31s)** — On the left there's 1 gram of sugar. And on the right there's 0 grams of sugar. So based on that
- **[00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OKg8Ik04WpM&t=38s)** — data, which one is healthier? Now you're probably going to pick B, right? Well let's take a look
- **[00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OKg8Ik04WpM&t=45s)** — at what A is. A is avocados. Let's be Doritos. That's right, Doritos. Tip number one, you cannot
- **[00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OKg8Ik04WpM&t=53s)** — determine the health of a product by the nutritional facts. You must look at the
- **[01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OKg8Ik04WpM&t=61s)** — ingredients. Let's take a look at these ingredients. The first one is corn and then
- **[01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OKg8Ik04WpM&t=66s)** — we have vegetable oil. Corn, canola, and or sunflower oil. And then we have maltodextrin.
- **[01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OKg8Ik04WpM&t=72s)** — Then we have a bunch of other things. And then we have monosodium glutamate. And then dextrose.
- **[01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OKg8Ik04WpM&t=77s)** — And in a minute I'm going to simplify this whole thing for you. So really there's only
- **[01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OKg8Ik04WpM&t=81s)** — three ingredients you have to watch out for. Everything else is a side note. But let's just
- **[01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OKg8Ik04WpM&t=86s)** — do one more test. Okay, we have label A and label B. On the left we have 0 grams of total
- **[01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OKg8Ik04WpM&t=93s)** — fat. On the right we have 0 grams of total fat. Of course there's going to be no
- **[01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OKg8Ik04WpM&t=98s)** — on either one of those. So now we're at the total carbohydrates. A is 25 grams of total
- **[01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OKg8Ik04WpM&t=104s)** — carbohydrates. B is only 13 grams of total carbohydrates. A is 19 grams of sugar. And B
- **[01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OKg8Ik04WpM&t=112s)** — is 11 grams of sugar. Based on the data, which one is healthier? If you said B, okay,
- **[02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OKg8Ik04WpM&t=120s)** — let's take a look at A. Hmm, A is an apple. Let's take a look at what B is. Oh, what's
- **[02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OKg8Ik04WpM&t=127s)** — that? That is something called Sunny D. It's like an orange drink. But let's take a look at the
- **[02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OKg8Ik04WpM&t=134s)** — actual ingredients in this orange drink. Oh, we have the first ingredients, which is water.
- **[02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OKg8Ik04WpM&t=140s)** — And then we have high fructose corn syrup. And then we have like 2% or less of all these
- **[02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OKg8Ik04WpM&t=147s)** — concentrated juices, right? And then we roll right into the modified cornstarch and canola
- **[02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OKg8Ik04WpM&t=154s)** — oil. If you just depend on the traditional facts, that would be healthier than an apple.
- **[02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OKg8Ik04WpM&t=159s)** — All right, so what are we dealing with? We're just dealing with what is called
- **[02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OKg8Ik04WpM&t=163s)** — ultra-processed foods, aka junk foods. Processed means removal. So you're taking away the fiber,
- **[02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OKg8Ik04WpM&t=172s)** — the vitamins, the minerals, the trace minerals, the phytonutrients, the enzymes. We're taking
- **[02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OKg8Ik04WpM&t=179s)** — everything out of it and we're leaving some basic material. And then we get the word ultra.
- **[03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OKg8Ik04WpM&t=185s)** — Ultra means severe. So when we're severely taking away things, we're going through
- **[03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OKg8Ik04WpM&t=191s)** — many different industrial processes or chemical reactions, including grinding something down,
- **[03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OKg8Ik04WpM&t=197s)** — pulverizing it, high pressure, high heats, adding chemicals like solvents to extract certain
- **[03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OKg8Ik04WpM&t=205s)** — things, taking out the colors with chemicals, taking out the flavoring or odors from it. And
- **[03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OKg8Ik04WpM&t=212s)** — then you're ending up with this something that doesn't even resemble the original
- **[03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OKg8Ik04WpM&t=216s)** — food. And so this is why they have to add flavoring. They have to add coloring. They
- **[03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OKg8Ik04WpM&t=222s)** — have to add textures. They have to add preservatives. They have to add some synthetic
- **[03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OKg8Ik04WpM&t=226s)** — vitamins to prevent certain diseases. And then they have to package it and make it look
- **[03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OKg8Ik04WpM&t=231s)** — amazing for you to eat. So the big question is if we compare ultra processed food to the
- **[03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OKg8Ik04WpM&t=238s)** — definition of food, which is this. Food is that which is eaten to sustain life, provide energy
- **[04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OKg8Ik04WpM&t=247s)** — and promote the growth and repair of tissues. So it has to keep you alive, give you energy,
- **[04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OKg8Ik04WpM&t=254s)** — help you grow and help you repair. So can ultra processed calories actually do that?
- **[04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OKg8Ik04WpM&t=262s)** — No, it can't. In reality, ultra processed food is not food. Now out of all the things that
- **[04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OKg8Ik04WpM&t=269s)** — cause disease that destroy your health, I would venture to say that ultra processed foods
- **[04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OKg8Ik04WpM&t=274s)** — are the most significant factor in causing health problems. If you disagree, please make
- **[04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OKg8Ik04WpM&t=281s)** — down below and tell me what you think. Is it infection? Is it old age? Is it lack of activity?
- **[04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OKg8Ik04WpM&t=288s)** — Or is it more junk food? Simply because 80% of the calories in the grocery store are ultra
- **[04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OKg8Ik04WpM&t=295s)** — processed food. So the countries that consume the most ultra processed foods have the most
- **[05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OKg8Ik04WpM&t=300s)** — health problems. And the United States is right up there at the top. So how can we make this
- **[05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OKg8Ik04WpM&t=304s)** — really simple? Number one, ignore the nutritional facts. Okay, go right to the
- **[05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OKg8Ik04WpM&t=309s)** — ingredients. And there's three things that you want to avoid. Seed oils, all the forms of sugar,
- **[05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OKg8Ik04WpM&t=316s)** — and you want to avoid the starches. A lot of times when people define junk foods, they throw
- **[05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OKg8Ik04WpM&t=322s)** — in the saturated fats. But when I went to the store last week and I was looking at all
- **[05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OKg8Ik04WpM&t=327s)** — these junk foods, I didn't see a lot of saturated fat. I saw a lot of unsaturated fat,
- **[05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OKg8Ik04WpM&t=333s)** — seed oils. Our diet is about almost 30% seed oils. That's creating a lot of damage, inflammation,
- **[05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OKg8Ik04WpM&t=342s)** — insulin resistance, neurodegenerative problems. And by the way, I have a link down below
- **[05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OKg8Ik04WpM&t=348s)** — that you can download a little cutout for your wallet that basically describe in detail the
- **[05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OKg8Ik04WpM&t=354s)** — three things you should avoid and all the other kind of names for the sugar, starches,
- **[06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OKg8Ik04WpM&t=360s)** — seed oils that you might not recognize. So you can pull this out of your wallet
- **[06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OKg8Ik04WpM&t=363s)** — and just have it right there when you go shopping. All right, let's move to sugar.
- **[06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OKg8Ik04WpM&t=367s)** — And a lot of times when you see sugar, it doesn't tell you if it's beet sugar or
- **[06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OKg8Ik04WpM&t=371s)** — cane sugar or other types of sugar. But sugar is also in other forms. Glucose syrup,
- **[06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OKg8Ik04WpM&t=378s)** — high fructose corn syrup, dextrose, and just straight glucose. Now let's move to the
- **[06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OKg8Ik04WpM&t=384s)** — starches. Corn, corn starch, modified corn starch, modified food starch, maltodextrin,
- **[06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OKg8Ik04WpM&t=395s)** — dextrin, corn flour, wheat flour, modified wheat starch. Now there's two more things that are
- **[06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OKg8Ik04WpM&t=403s)** — kind of on the side that I would also recommend not consuming as well. Soy protein
- **[06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OKg8Ik04WpM&t=409s)** — isolate. This is kind of an ingredient that fits into the definition of ultra-processed food
- **[06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OKg8Ik04WpM&t=416s)** — because it's so altered and so refined. And then model sodium glutamate because that's a
- **[07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OKg8Ik04WpM&t=421s)** — flavor enhancer. So go ahead and click the link down below and download the little card
- **[07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OKg8Ik04WpM&t=428s)** — cutout so you can put it in your wallet and start reading labels and start getting
- **[07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OKg8Ik04WpM&t=433s)** — the stuff out of your diet.

- **[00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqGowurcVPs&t=0s)** — There are nine things I'm going to talk about today about fascia that will literally blow your
- **[00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqGowurcVPs&t=6s)** — mind. Now I went through a lot of training on the body anatomy physiology. When we talked about fascia
- **[00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqGowurcVPs&t=13s)** — it was this extra passive tissue you know like bubble wrap that just packs certain things.
- **[00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqGowurcVPs&t=19s)** — Fascia is the matrix or the material that surrounds every muscle in the body.
- **[00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqGowurcVPs&t=24s)** — Like let me just give you an example. If we take this weight for example and I start lifting it
- **[00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqGowurcVPs&t=29s)** — like this right for about I don't know 20 times. I'm going to get tired right. I'm using a lot of
- **[00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqGowurcVPs&t=38s)** — energy when I'm doing this. Now if we attach some fascial tissue to the weight okay and do
- **[00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqGowurcVPs&t=46s)** — that. I'm still lifting the weight but I'm using a lot less energy because I'm using
- **[00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqGowurcVPs&t=52s)** — the free energy from the elastic band that gives you a lot of transfer of energy. Running,
- **[00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqGowurcVPs&t=59s)** — jumping etc is not just about contraction and relaxation of muscles. It's about the
- **[01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqGowurcVPs&t=65s)** — loading of the tendons and ligaments in fascia and then releasing it. Fascia gives you your
- **[01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqGowurcVPs&t=71s)** — posture. I mean you ever see people when they get older like some people literally are
- **[01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqGowurcVPs&t=76s)** — looking straight down when they're walking and that could have been totally prevented if they
- **[01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqGowurcVPs&t=80s)** — understood how to keep the fascia healthy and repair it. Which I'm going to tell you at the
- **[01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqGowurcVPs&t=86s)** — end of this video. Fascia also gives you your body shape. Fascia also has similar properties
- **[01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqGowurcVPs&t=92s)** — to liquid crystals in those like digital TVs. It has these repeating patterns of similar
- **[01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqGowurcVPs&t=100s)** — type shapes that have the ability to change and adapt to the environment. The little cells
- **[01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqGowurcVPs&t=107s)** — that make fascia or collagen are called fibroblasts. And these little cells are like
- **[01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqGowurcVPs&t=115s)** — little spiders that can migrate. They can move through your body and you have billions of
- **[02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqGowurcVPs&t=120s)** — them all over the place. And they're basically laying down this it's called ground substance
- **[02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqGowurcVPs&t=126s)** — to allow for lubrication and movement. And the next one is they are highly involved with
- **[02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqGowurcVPs&t=131s)** — This is why our fascia can be sore as in fibromyalgia and plantar fasciitis. And over time that injury becomes an
- **[02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqGowurcVPs&t=142s)** — adhesion. So this is why myofascial release and other techniques in massage and trigger
- **[02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqGowurcVPs&t=148s)** — point therapy are all really important especially if you had injuries. Now when you stop moving
- **[02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqGowurcVPs&t=155s)** — the collagen is going to get sticky. It's going to get stiff and the fascia is going to fuse
- **[02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqGowurcVPs&t=160s)** — together and stiffen. And when you start moving that tissue it's not going to let you move. It's
- **[02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqGowurcVPs&t=166s)** — going to be very restricted. And maybe in your mind you might think, oh wow I have a tight
- **[02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqGowurcVPs&t=171s)** — muscle. No you don't. You have tight fascia. And fascia is also connected from head to toe.
- **[02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqGowurcVPs&t=179s)** — And so knowing this really helped me understand why certain techniques worked when I was in practice.
- **[03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqGowurcVPs&t=186s)** — For example, when people would come in and have injuries on their tailbone, I found the best
- **[03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqGowurcVPs&t=192s)** — relief I can give them is by working on the back of the neck. The occiput. Releasing the
- **[03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqGowurcVPs&t=198s)** — occiput seems to help tailbone injuries. Now why would that work? Because of fascia. It's all
- **[03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqGowurcVPs&t=204s)** — connected. I'm basically taking this fascia and making it longer so there's more space.
- **[03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqGowurcVPs&t=211s)** — Another example would be people that had problems with their shoulder. They couldn't
- **[03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqGowurcVPs&t=214s)** — elevate the shoulder. I would have them lay face down and if they had a restriction on the left
- **[03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqGowurcVPs&t=219s)** — shoulder, I would work on the right calf and Achilles tendon. And that always seemed to open
- **[03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqGowurcVPs&t=226s)** — up the shoulder. Why is that? Because the fascia on the right lower part of your body is
- **[03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqGowurcVPs&t=232s)** — connected to the left shoulder. Another example would be people that had right shoulder pain
- **[03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqGowurcVPs&t=237s)** — through here. I would work on the gallbladder area. Now in the past I would talk about the
- **[04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqGowurcVPs&t=243s)** — nerve being involved which is probably true. But I think also all the fascia that surround that
- **[04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqGowurcVPs&t=250s)** — phrenic nerve that go all the way up into the third cervical vertebra through here with all the
- **[04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqGowurcVPs&t=254s)** — different fascia attachments. So as I loosened this part up, it freed up this part. Fascia is
- **[04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqGowurcVPs&t=262s)** — extremely innervated by little tiny nerves that allows the body to know where it is in space.
- **[04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqGowurcVPs&t=267s)** — And this is why the fascia is very important for balance, coordination, and it has this amazing
- **[04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqGowurcVPs&t=275s)** — ability to be able to change its material properties. It can go from being very rigid
- **[04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqGowurcVPs&t=283s)** — to very elastic. If you sit all day and don't move at all, the environmental message is
- **[04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqGowurcVPs&t=290s)** — don't adapt. Just get tight and hold the person in that position. So you see this in
- **[04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqGowurcVPs&t=295s)** — nursing homes a lot with people in this one position like all day sitting, their body just
- **[05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqGowurcVPs&t=300s)** — grows like that. It's in communication with your environment unless you get an injury.
- **[05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqGowurcVPs&t=308s)** — In other words, when you start walking or moving, now things have changed because we had
- **[05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqGowurcVPs&t=313s)** — that injury and now you're guarding a little bit on one side of your body. So the secret to
- **[05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqGowurcVPs&t=320s)** — fascia has to do with adding dynamic motions from different directions. So it's not just
- **[05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqGowurcVPs&t=328s)** — the same motion over and over and over again. I remember in my 30s, the only exercise that I
- **[05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqGowurcVPs&t=334s)** — did... I mean it was just biking over and over and over and over. My psoas muscles,
- **[05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqGowurcVPs&t=339s)** — which are the hip flexors, became so tight because I was doing that same motion over and
- **[05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqGowurcVPs&t=344s)** — over again. I'm going to put the videos that I'm personally doing down below but there's many more
- **[05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqGowurcVPs&t=350s)** — that you can find. I want to give you the general principles of what to do. Another thing
- **[05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqGowurcVPs&t=355s)** — that I'm adding to this program is high doses of vitamin D3. I'm doing 50,000 I use every
- **[06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqGowurcVPs&t=362s)** — single day. If you're ever going to do a similar thing with vitamin D, you want to make
- **[06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqGowurcVPs&t=366s)** — sure you take the cofactors, vitamin K2 and magnesium and zinc and B6. And that way you
- **[06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqGowurcVPs&t=373s)** — prevent any problems that may come up from taking high doses of vitamin D. And if you
- **[06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqGowurcVPs&t=379s)** — want more information about vitamin D and the cofactors, you should watch this video right here.

- **[00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJ2jCDQMQ00&t=0s)** — So I've gotten this question a lot.
- **[00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJ2jCDQMQ00&t=2s)** — What remedy
- **[00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJ2jCDQMQ00&t=3s)** — can help with my brittle nails?
- **[00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJ2jCDQMQ00&t=6s)** — Now that's a good question because there's a lot of different remedies that can work,
- **[00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJ2jCDQMQ00&t=9s)** — but I always like to use the nail as an indicator
- **[00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJ2jCDQMQ00&t=13s)** — to look deeper inside the body. And the nail is a really good place to start
- **[00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJ2jCDQMQ00&t=17s)** — because it gives you a lot of clues
- **[00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJ2jCDQMQ00&t=19s)** — on what's going on in the body. But brittle nails is very similar to like
- **[00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJ2jCDQMQ00&t=23s)** — a symptom of fatigue.
- **[00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJ2jCDQMQ00&t=25s)** — There could be many different reasons for that problem.
- **[00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJ2jCDQMQ00&t=28s)** — So you have several options. You can actually take a remedy to strengthen your nails
- **[00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJ2jCDQMQ00&t=32s)** — or better yet you can try to understand what the nail is doing
- **[00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJ2jCDQMQ00&t=37s)** — so you can actually fix the problem once and for all. Unfortunately in medicine
- **[00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJ2jCDQMQ00&t=41s)** — they don't do that.
- **[00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJ2jCDQMQ00&t=43s)** — Everything is based on
- **[00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJ2jCDQMQ00&t=45s)** — a certain symptom and a treatment. So today let's do this differently. Let's take a
- **[00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJ2jCDQMQ00&t=49s)** — look at the nail
- **[00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJ2jCDQMQ00&t=50s)** — and look at all the potential reasons why you might have
- **[00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJ2jCDQMQ00&t=54s)** — slow growing nails or brittle nails or lines to your nails
- **[00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJ2jCDQMQ00&t=59s)** — or a problem with the nail. And when I go through this I think what's going to
- **[01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJ2jCDQMQ00&t=63s)** — happen is one or two things that I talk about
- **[01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJ2jCDQMQ00&t=66s)** — will become more real to you and it will pop out as a potential problem.
- **[01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJ2jCDQMQ00&t=71s)** — Let's say for example something that's missing in your diet or maybe
- **[01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJ2jCDQMQ00&t=74s)** — something that you're eating that you shouldn't be eating. So let's start out
- **[01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJ2jCDQMQ00&t=77s)** — with
- **[01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJ2jCDQMQ00&t=78s)** — protein. Your nail is protein. It's a very specific type of protein called
- **[01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJ2jCDQMQ00&t=83s)** — and the thing that you need to know about
- **[01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJ2jCDQMQ00&t=85s)** — is that it's
- **[01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJ2jCDQMQ00&t=87s)** — very high in
- **[01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJ2jCDQMQ00&t=90s)** — and also amino acids because protein is just a combination of
- **[01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJ2jCDQMQ00&t=95s)** — amino acids. So doing a deep dive and understanding kind of what's making up
- **[01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJ2jCDQMQ00&t=99s)** — this specific body tissue
- **[01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJ2jCDQMQ00&t=100s)** — can give you clues on what you may need to eat more of. So the two main
- **[01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJ2jCDQMQ00&t=105s)** — sulfur amino acids
- **[01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJ2jCDQMQ00&t=107s)** — are cysteine
- **[01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJ2jCDQMQ00&t=109s)** — and
- **[01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJ2jCDQMQ00&t=109s)** — methionine.
- **[01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJ2jCDQMQ00&t=111s)** — And so for example if you're
- **[01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJ2jCDQMQ00&t=112s)** — eating foods that don't have
- **[01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJ2jCDQMQ00&t=115s)** — those two amino acids
- **[01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJ2jCDQMQ00&t=116s)** — or are incomplete
- **[01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJ2jCDQMQ00&t=118s)** — that could be the reason why you are missing those amino acids and
- **[02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJ2jCDQMQ00&t=121s)** — developing problems with your nail.
- **[02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJ2jCDQMQ00&t=123s)** — And realize if you have a problem with your nails it's not just
- **[02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJ2jCDQMQ00&t=125s)** — happening with your nails
- **[02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJ2jCDQMQ00&t=127s)** — it's happening all over the place.
- **[02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJ2jCDQMQ00&t=129s)** — So you could either be deficient in sulfur
- **[02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJ2jCDQMQ00&t=132s)** — which by the way the number one symptom
- **[02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJ2jCDQMQ00&t=134s)** — of a sulfur deficiency
- **[02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJ2jCDQMQ00&t=136s)** — is brittle nails
- **[02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJ2jCDQMQ00&t=137s)** — or it can be very specific amino acids that you're deficient in
- **[02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJ2jCDQMQ00&t=140s)** — because you're eating foods that are not complete with the amino acids.
- **[02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJ2jCDQMQ00&t=145s)** — Now rather than
- **[02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJ2jCDQMQ00&t=146s)** — bore you and complicate things
- **[02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJ2jCDQMQ00&t=148s)** — tell you all the foods that don't have that
- **[02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJ2jCDQMQ00&t=150s)** — I'm just going to recommend
- **[02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJ2jCDQMQ00&t=152s)** — eating foods that contain
- **[02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJ2jCDQMQ00&t=154s)** — plenty of all of the amino acids. That way you don't have to worry about
- **[02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJ2jCDQMQ00&t=159s)** — trying to focus on
- **[02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJ2jCDQMQ00&t=160s)** — just increasing very specific amino acids. You've got to realize that amino acids is not just about
- **[02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJ2jCDQMQ00&t=165s)** — making your
- **[02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJ2jCDQMQ00&t=167s)** — nails, your hair, your muscle, your skin.
- **[02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJ2jCDQMQ00&t=169s)** — It's about making all these other proteins involved with
- **[02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJ2jCDQMQ00&t=173s)** — biochemistry, energy production, digestion,
- **[02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJ2jCDQMQ00&t=176s)** — everything. Your body has millions of different enzymes
- **[02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJ2jCDQMQ00&t=179s)** — and they need these amino acids.
- **[03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJ2jCDQMQ00&t=181s)** — So what kind of foods can you eat to get a complete
- **[03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJ2jCDQMQ00&t=184s)** — amino acid profile?
- **[03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJ2jCDQMQ00&t=187s)** — Well the best foods you can eat would be animal products, specifically
- **[03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJ2jCDQMQ00&t=191s)** — things like eggs, fish,
- **[03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJ2jCDQMQ00&t=194s)** — meats,
- **[03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJ2jCDQMQ00&t=195s)** — versus
- **[03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJ2jCDQMQ00&t=196s)** — legumes
- **[03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJ2jCDQMQ00&t=197s)** — or grain type proteins.
- **[03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJ2jCDQMQ00&t=199s)** — With those you're always going to be missing
- **[03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJ2jCDQMQ00&t=202s)** — one or two amino acids or
- **[03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJ2jCDQMQ00&t=204s)** — those amino acids are going to be very very low
- **[03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJ2jCDQMQ00&t=206s)** — and you're going to have to do
- **[03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJ2jCDQMQ00&t=209s)** — food combining
- **[03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJ2jCDQMQ00&t=210s)** — to fix this problem.
- **[03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJ2jCDQMQ00&t=212s)** — You also have the factor of the hydrochloric acid in your stomach. If you don't have
- **[03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJ2jCDQMQ00&t=215s)** — enough hydrochloric acid you can't
- **[03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJ2jCDQMQ00&t=217s)** — digest these
- **[03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJ2jCDQMQ00&t=219s)** — proteins to extract amino acids from the protein.
- **[03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJ2jCDQMQ00&t=222s)** — And so how do you know if you have
- **[03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJ2jCDQMQ00&t=224s)** — a lack of hydrochloric acid? Well you have indigestion, you have gas, you have bloating,
- **[03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJ2jCDQMQ00&t=229s)** — heartburn. If you have intestinal inflammation
- **[03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJ2jCDQMQ00&t=233s)** — you could also have a problem with amino acid absorption. Now the other
- **[03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJ2jCDQMQ00&t=238s)** — thing that's interesting about protein is that
- **[04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJ2jCDQMQ00&t=241s)** — you may tend to
- **[04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJ2jCDQMQ00&t=244s)** — not be satisfied when you eat unless you have
- **[04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJ2jCDQMQ00&t=247s)** — sufficient amount of
- **[04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJ2jCDQMQ00&t=250s)** — that balanced
- **[04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJ2jCDQMQ00&t=251s)** — amino acids as your requirement.
- **[04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJ2jCDQMQ00&t=253s)** — Because out of all the macronutrients like carbs, protein, and fats,
- **[04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJ2jCDQMQ00&t=257s)** — proteins are probably needed as the most important survival
- **[04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJ2jCDQMQ00&t=261s)** — raw material. And so in other words, let's say you're eating a lot of food
- **[04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJ2jCDQMQ00&t=266s)** — but you're not
- **[04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJ2jCDQMQ00&t=268s)** — hitting that requirement for amino acids.
- **[04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJ2jCDQMQ00&t=272s)** — The hunger won't turn off. You'll just stay hungry. You'll never be satisfied.
- **[04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJ2jCDQMQ00&t=276s)** — So this is one problem with vegans.
- **[04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJ2jCDQMQ00&t=278s)** — Is that they'll tend to try to get their amino acids
- **[04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJ2jCDQMQ00&t=281s)** — from plant type things and grains and legumes. But since they need to consume
- **[04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJ2jCDQMQ00&t=286s)** — so much of those foods to get the required amount of amino acids
- **[04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJ2jCDQMQ00&t=291s)** — they end up overdoing it on the carbohydrates. Now if you want a general
- **[04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJ2jCDQMQ00&t=296s)** — pretty good estimate of how much protein a person would need on average.
- **[05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJ2jCDQMQ00&t=300s)** — Now
- **[05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJ2jCDQMQ00&t=301s)** — this is on average. It could go up, it could go down.
- **[05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJ2jCDQMQ00&t=304s)** — I would do this. I would take
- **[05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJ2jCDQMQ00&t=306s)** — .64
- **[05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJ2jCDQMQ00&t=308s)** — grams times your body weight in pounds
- **[05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJ2jCDQMQ00&t=311s)** — that you weigh and you get a good estimate of roughly how much protein
- **[05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJ2jCDQMQ00&t=315s)** — that your body requires. You know when you're deficient in amino acids, boy,
- **[05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJ2jCDQMQ00&t=319s)** — all sorts of things will happen. Not just the
- **[05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJ2jCDQMQ00&t=322s)** — increase in appetite without being satisfied
- **[05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJ2jCDQMQ00&t=325s)** — but you could even develop edema in your legs,
- **[05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJ2jCDQMQ00&t=329s)** — a swollen belly. You can be chronically fatigued.
- **[05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJ2jCDQMQ00&t=332s)** — But again, I'm just emphasizing out of all the macro nutrients
- **[05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJ2jCDQMQ00&t=336s)** — protein is the most important. And if you're deficient in amino acids and
- **[05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJ2jCDQMQ00&t=340s)** — it's showing up in your nail,
- **[05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJ2jCDQMQ00&t=342s)** — realize it's also going to be affecting your immune system,
- **[05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJ2jCDQMQ00&t=346s)** — your endocrine system, your reproductive system.
- **[05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJ2jCDQMQ00&t=349s)** — The next topic is trace minerals and minerals.
- **[05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJ2jCDQMQ00&t=353s)** — Trace minerals act as helper
- **[05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJ2jCDQMQ00&t=355s)** — called cofactors or coenzymes for
- **[05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJ2jCDQMQ00&t=359s)** — proteins. So we just talked about amino acids which are proteins.
- **[06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJ2jCDQMQ00&t=362s)** — Now to activate these proteins that
- **[06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJ2jCDQMQ00&t=366s)** — help you grow nails, you need certain
- **[06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJ2jCDQMQ00&t=370s)** — helper minerals or trace minerals which are
- **[06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJ2jCDQMQ00&t=373s)** — just kind of minerals needed in smaller amounts. So the most important
- **[06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJ2jCDQMQ00&t=377s)** — mineral would be sulfur. You can get it in cruciferous
- **[06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJ2jCDQMQ00&t=381s)** — vegetables. You can get it in eggs.
- **[06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJ2jCDQMQ00&t=385s)** — You can get it in meats and fish.
- **[06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJ2jCDQMQ00&t=388s)** — You can also get it in garlic and onion.
- **[06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJ2jCDQMQ00&t=391s)** — There's also a product that can help brittle nails called
- **[06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJ2jCDQMQ00&t=394s)** — MSM. But I would recommend try to get it from the food.
- **[06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJ2jCDQMQ00&t=398s)** — Then you have zinc, another very very important
- **[06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJ2jCDQMQ00&t=401s)** — cofactor. Where do you get zinc? Red meat,
- **[06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJ2jCDQMQ00&t=404s)** — animal products, shellfish, seafood.
- **[06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJ2jCDQMQ00&t=408s)** — Selenium is another one. Copper is another one.
- **[06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJ2jCDQMQ00&t=411s)** — Magnesium is a factor. It's not very common but
- **[06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJ2jCDQMQ00&t=413s)** — it can show up in the nails if you're deficient in magnesium and that
- **[06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJ2jCDQMQ00&t=417s)** — would be more of the leafy greens.
- **[06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJ2jCDQMQ00&t=418s)** — But the amount of calcium that's in the nail is
- **[07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJ2jCDQMQ00&t=422s)** — very very very tiny. So if you have a calcium
- **[07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJ2jCDQMQ00&t=425s)** — deficiency it's probably not going to show up necessarily in brittle nails.
- **[07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJ2jCDQMQ00&t=428s)** — I mean potentially it could but it's more likely these other elements.
- **[07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJ2jCDQMQ00&t=432s)** — Silicon also. A lot of people take silicon to
- **[07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJ2jCDQMQ00&t=435s)** — improve their nails because silicon is involved in the formation of
- **[07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJ2jCDQMQ00&t=438s)** — collagen. Now another important vitamin
- **[07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJ2jCDQMQ00&t=441s)** — to strengthen the nails is vitamin C.
- **[07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJ2jCDQMQ00&t=445s)** — Now typically you're going to get enough C if you're doing leafy green.
- **[07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJ2jCDQMQ00&t=448s)** — Or sauerkraut.
- **[07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJ2jCDQMQ00&t=451s)** — Or peppers. Or lemons.
- **[07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJ2jCDQMQ00&t=454s)** — But if you're consuming a lot of sugar that is definitely going to block
- **[07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJ2jCDQMQ00&t=458s)** — your vitamin C. Biotin is another
- **[07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJ2jCDQMQ00&t=462s)** — B vitamin that people take
- **[07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJ2jCDQMQ00&t=464s)** — in very high levels to help their nails.
- **[07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJ2jCDQMQ00&t=468s)** — And yes that will work but what you have to realize is that
- **[07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJ2jCDQMQ00&t=471s)** — you produce just as much
- **[07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJ2jCDQMQ00&t=474s)** — Biotin as you get from your diet.
- **[07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJ2jCDQMQ00&t=477s)** — And chances are
- **[07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJ2jCDQMQ00&t=478s)** — the real reason why you might be deficient in Biotin has to do with
- **[08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJ2jCDQMQ00&t=481s)** — your gut microflora
- **[08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJ2jCDQMQ00&t=484s)** — more than your diet. Maybe you had an antibiotic.
- **[08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJ2jCDQMQ00&t=488s)** — Maybe you have some type of gut issue. Maybe you're
- **[08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJ2jCDQMQ00&t=490s)** — not eating right. Maybe you don't eat enough probiotic
- **[08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJ2jCDQMQ00&t=493s)** — foods or prebiotic foods. And that's
- **[08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJ2jCDQMQ00&t=496s)** — why you're low in Biotin. But Biotin is very high in
- **[08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJ2jCDQMQ00&t=499s)** — chicken liver, beef liver,
- **[08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJ2jCDQMQ00&t=502s)** — eggs, salmon, and pork. And
- **[08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJ2jCDQMQ00&t=505s)** — a couple other reasons why you might be deficient in Biotin.
- **[08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJ2jCDQMQ00&t=508s)** — You drink a good amount of alcohol. You're on some type of
- **[08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJ2jCDQMQ00&t=511s)** — medication. You have low hydrochloric acid.
- **[08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJ2jCDQMQ00&t=514s)** — You are an athlete. You exercise
- **[08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJ2jCDQMQ00&t=517s)** — a lot. That can create a major deficiency in Biotin.
- **[08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJ2jCDQMQ00&t=520s)** — Or you're getting older. And so the
- **[08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJ2jCDQMQ00&t=523s)** — requirements for Biotin go up. B6 is another vitamin
- **[08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJ2jCDQMQ00&t=526s)** — that is involved in the production of protein.
- **[08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJ2jCDQMQ00&t=529s)** — But typically it's not going to be very common for you
- **[08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJ2jCDQMQ00&t=532s)** — to have brittle nails if you have a B6 deficiency.
- **[08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJ2jCDQMQ00&t=536s)** — B12 is another factor that can
- **[08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJ2jCDQMQ00&t=538s)** — affect the blood flow to the nail. Any type of anemia,
- **[09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJ2jCDQMQ00&t=541s)** — whether it's B12 or iron, can
- **[09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJ2jCDQMQ00&t=544s)** — show up in the nail as a brittle nail.
- **[09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJ2jCDQMQ00&t=547s)** — Choline is another...they classify it as
- **[09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJ2jCDQMQ00&t=550s)** — a B vitamin. If you're deficient in choline,
- **[09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJ2jCDQMQ00&t=553s)** — maybe you have a genetic factor that doesn't allow you to absorb
- **[09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJ2jCDQMQ00&t=555s)** — choline like myself. And that puts you at risk
- **[09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJ2jCDQMQ00&t=559s)** — for a fatty liver. And if you want to eat foods
- **[09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJ2jCDQMQ00&t=562s)** — high in choline, eat more egg yolks.
- **[09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJ2jCDQMQ00&t=565s)** — Now to keep the keratin strong, there are two
- **[09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJ2jCDQMQ00&t=568s)** — fat soluble vitamins that are also very important.
- **[09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJ2jCDQMQ00&t=570s)** — Vitamin A and vitamin D.
- **[09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJ2jCDQMQ00&t=573s)** — Where do you get vitamin A from? I'm not talking about like
- **[09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJ2jCDQMQ00&t=576s)** — spinach. That's beta keratin, which turns into
- **[09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJ2jCDQMQ00&t=579s)** — vitamin A, but just a small amount.
- **[09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJ2jCDQMQ00&t=582s)** — You want to get your vitamin A from egg yolk,
- **[09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJ2jCDQMQ00&t=586s)** — fish, or animal organs,
- **[09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJ2jCDQMQ00&t=588s)** — like liver and things like that, or even cod liver
- **[09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJ2jCDQMQ00&t=590s)** — oil. And of course vitamin D is difficult to get from the
- **[09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJ2jCDQMQ00&t=593s)** — food, but cod liver oil has it. You can get it
- **[09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJ2jCDQMQ00&t=596s)** — from the sun. And other types of fatty fish or seafood
- **[09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJ2jCDQMQ00&t=599s)** — has some vitamin D in it.
- **[10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJ2jCDQMQ00&t=602s)** — Now, I created another video on nails that's actually
- **[10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJ2jCDQMQ00&t=605s)** — quite interesting that goes beyond just the brittle
- **[10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJ2jCDQMQ00&t=608s)** — nail. And if you haven't seen that video, I put it up right here.
- **[10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJ2jCDQMQ00&t=611s)** — Check it out.

- **[00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UtSvAyRs5OA&t=0s)** — I want to give you my two cents on RFK Jr.'s new potential role in being the HHS secretary.
- **[00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UtSvAyRs5OA&t=6s)** — The target is to clean up the corruption. Number two, get back to science-based evidence.
- **[00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UtSvAyRs5OA&t=12s)** — And number three, end chronic disease, which is a pretty big goal.
- **[00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UtSvAyRs5OA&t=16s)** — And I'm sure you're seeing this all of the news, all of the pushback that he's getting.
- **[00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UtSvAyRs5OA&t=20s)** — You have the big food companies, big chemical companies, big pharma.
- **[00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UtSvAyRs5OA&t=23s)** — They really don't like him very much.
- **[00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UtSvAyRs5OA&t=25s)** — And I just want to make a comment on this one little thing that is quite interesting.
- **[00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UtSvAyRs5OA&t=28s)** — It was said as a counter-argument,
- **[00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UtSvAyRs5OA&t=30s)** — There is no clear evidence yet that disease is caused by processed food.
- **[00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UtSvAyRs5OA&t=37s)** — Do you know how ridiculous that sounds? This, this.
- **[00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UtSvAyRs5OA&t=40s)** — It's not linked to chronic disease. What does cause disease?
- **[00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UtSvAyRs5OA&t=43s)** — And their response is, we don't know.
- **[00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UtSvAyRs5OA&t=45s)** — We need to do more research. As big food, big pharma, big chemicals get super wealthy, right?
- **[00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UtSvAyRs5OA&t=51s)** — What is the product of health care? It's a healthy body.
- **[00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UtSvAyRs5OA&t=54s)** — If we take the U.S. population and compare it to the world,
- **[00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UtSvAyRs5OA&t=57s)** — we're at the very bottom when it comes to health.
- **[00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UtSvAyRs5OA&t=59s)** — Yet we spend the most for health care.
- **[01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UtSvAyRs5OA&t=62s)** — Over 4.1 trillion dollars every single year.
- **[01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UtSvAyRs5OA&t=68s)** — You can say RFK Jr. is a quack, anti-vaxxer.
- **[01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UtSvAyRs5OA&t=71s)** — He's going to take science into the dark ages.
- **[01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UtSvAyRs5OA&t=74s)** — You can pretty much just ignore that.
- **[01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UtSvAyRs5OA&t=76s)** — There is many things that need to be changed.
- **[01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UtSvAyRs5OA&t=78s)** — I want to give my two cents on what I think would make a huge difference.
- **[01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UtSvAyRs5OA&t=82s)** — Alright, number one. Institutional foods.
- **[01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UtSvAyRs5OA&t=84s)** — And what they do is they make prepackaged food that is given to patients in nursing homes,
- **[01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UtSvAyRs5OA&t=91s)** — prisons, the school systems, hospitals.
- **[01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UtSvAyRs5OA&t=94s)** — This is the absolute lowest quality food on the planet.
- **[01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UtSvAyRs5OA&t=98s)** — And even going into the hospital, I had two surgeries and I had to be in the hospital for a couple days.
- **[01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UtSvAyRs5OA&t=102s)** — I mean, I just told them I wanted some protein and they're like,
- **[01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UtSvAyRs5OA&t=104s)** — yeah, we don't have much protein. It's like, well, I can give you a protein bar.
- **[01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UtSvAyRs5OA&t=107s)** — I interviewed a gentleman. He actually owns and runs several very unique assisted living homes.
- **[01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UtSvAyRs5OA&t=114s)** — You would want to send your parents or your grandparents there if they needed that type of service
- **[01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UtSvAyRs5OA&t=118s)** — because they do things completely different.
- **[02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UtSvAyRs5OA&t=121s)** — And I asked him, what is the barriers of putting your system in nursing homes?
- **[02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UtSvAyRs5OA&t=125s)** — And he said, there's just too much red tape. It's highly regulated as far as what they eat.
- **[02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UtSvAyRs5OA&t=129s)** — And if you want to change the diet, you have to get the doctor to write a prescription.
- **[02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UtSvAyRs5OA&t=133s)** — Typically, institutional foods have desserts. They have a lot of starches.
- **[02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UtSvAyRs5OA&t=137s)** — It's highly processed. It's overcooked.
- **[02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UtSvAyRs5OA&t=139s)** — The number one thing I would do is I would change the institutional foods
- **[02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UtSvAyRs5OA&t=142s)** — because that's going to change the health of these people in the nursing homes, the assisted living.
- **[02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UtSvAyRs5OA&t=146s)** — All these people would quickly improve of their health just by removing the refined sugars,
- **[02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UtSvAyRs5OA&t=152s)** — the refined starches and the refined oils, the seed oils.
- **[02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UtSvAyRs5OA&t=156s)** — The next thing I would do, and this is really, really big.
- **[02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UtSvAyRs5OA&t=158s)** — A lot of the food that we consume in the grocery store is subsidized.
- **[02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UtSvAyRs5OA&t=162s)** — In other words, the taxpayers are paying for it upfront or paying certain large farms to grow certain things.
- **[02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UtSvAyRs5OA&t=170s)** — Corn, soy, wheat, sugar, rice.
- **[02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UtSvAyRs5OA&t=175s)** — The amount that some of these companies are paid is up there around $600 billion.
- **[03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UtSvAyRs5OA&t=180s)** — The largest subsidy is with corn.
- **[03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UtSvAyRs5OA&t=183s)** — You can buy a cubic ton of corn for about $198.
- **[03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UtSvAyRs5OA&t=188s)** — And we're talking about not sweet corn. We're talking about dent corn, which is not even edible.
- **[03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UtSvAyRs5OA&t=192s)** — We also use it in the feedlots to fatten cattle.
- **[03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UtSvAyRs5OA&t=195s)** — We started this whole subsidy thing right after the depression
- **[03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UtSvAyRs5OA&t=199s)** — to kind of help the farmer, but somehow it stayed in law.
- **[03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UtSvAyRs5OA&t=203s)** — So now the small farmer has a heck of a time making a profit.
- **[03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UtSvAyRs5OA&t=206s)** — They're lucky if they get 1 to 3 percent profit.
- **[03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UtSvAyRs5OA&t=209s)** — And they have to work really hard at creating healthier food.
- **[03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UtSvAyRs5OA&t=213s)** — And they don't get subsidies.
- **[03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UtSvAyRs5OA&t=214s)** — I think one really good idea, if we could just switch what is subsidized
- **[03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UtSvAyRs5OA&t=218s)** — and invest in the small farmer, pay these small farmers to grow grass-fed, grass-finished animals.
- **[03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UtSvAyRs5OA&t=223s)** — I mean, that would be incredible.
- **[03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UtSvAyRs5OA&t=225s)** — Because right now the incentive is to grow the raw material for junk food.
- **[03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UtSvAyRs5OA&t=229s)** — You pay for it at the store, and then you pay for it when you go to the hospital.
- **[03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UtSvAyRs5OA&t=234s)** — I wanted to take a pause to ask you for a little favor.
- **[03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UtSvAyRs5OA&t=236s)** — With this new administration, there's some new opportunities for health care practitioners to be leaders in the health reform.
- **[04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UtSvAyRs5OA&t=242s)** — And I would love for you to vote for me as one of the leaders.
- **[04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UtSvAyRs5OA&t=245s)** — And I am super aware of the broken system that we need to fix.
- **[04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UtSvAyRs5OA&t=248s)** — Here's what you do. Click the link, which is down below.
- **[04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UtSvAyRs5OA&t=251s)** — You'll have to create your own account to vote.
- **[04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UtSvAyRs5OA&t=253s)** — You want to click sign up. And as soon as you have activated your account, go to the America's Health option.
- **[04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UtSvAyRs5OA&t=258s)** — Click on the hot tab. Find my name, Dr. Eric Berg, and click to vote and even leave a comment down below.
- **[04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UtSvAyRs5OA&t=263s)** — Thank you in advance. And let's go back to the video.
- **[04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UtSvAyRs5OA&t=265s)** — The next thing I would definitely want to change is this thing called gross.
- **[04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UtSvAyRs5OA&t=270s)** — Generally recognized as safe.
- **[04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UtSvAyRs5OA&t=272s)** — You would think that would be a third party, independent study to show that that ingredient was safe.
- **[04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UtSvAyRs5OA&t=278s)** — And the answer is no.
- **[04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UtSvAyRs5OA&t=279s)** — This is a loophole that manufacturers use to self-certify their own products.
- **[04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UtSvAyRs5OA&t=285s)** — It's a bit of a conflict of interest.
- **[04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UtSvAyRs5OA&t=287s)** — I can do my own studies to tell you that my ingredients are safe.
- **[04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UtSvAyRs5OA&t=290s)** — A lot of things that are banned now were generally recognized as safe.
- **[04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UtSvAyRs5OA&t=294s)** — Like lead, DDT, mercury, stuff that they made your fillings with.
- **[04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UtSvAyRs5OA&t=298s)** — Most of these junk food ingredients are gross.
- **[05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UtSvAyRs5OA&t=301s)** — The other thing I would do is I would change how they're fortifying our food.
- **[05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UtSvAyRs5OA&t=305s)** — Instead of fortifying with synthetic folic acid, which actually creates a big problem for about 30 to 40% of the population
- **[05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UtSvAyRs5OA&t=314s)** — because they have a genetic issue dealing with folic acid, I would change that to folate.
- **[05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UtSvAyRs5OA&t=318s)** — The type of iron they put in fortified food is disgusting.
- **[05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UtSvAyRs5OA&t=322s)** — It creates so many problems. Our body does not have a good mechanism to get rid of iron.
- **[05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UtSvAyRs5OA&t=328s)** — And all this iron accumulates in our body.
- **[05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UtSvAyRs5OA&t=330s)** — Too much iron can actually cause dysfunctional iron that leads to anemia.
- **[05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UtSvAyRs5OA&t=336s)** — The next thing. $40 billion a year of your taxes are paid to medical research for new drugs.
- **[05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UtSvAyRs5OA&t=343s)** — The universities are allowed to get patents on those drugs.
- **[05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UtSvAyRs5OA&t=348s)** — And then they're allowed to give exclusive rights to drug companies.
- **[05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UtSvAyRs5OA&t=352s)** — And then the drug companies and the universities negotiate for a royalty.
- **[06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UtSvAyRs5OA&t=360s)** — And this license agreement is very confidential.
- **[06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UtSvAyRs5OA&t=364s)** — And certain researchers within the universities also get a cut of that money.
- **[06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UtSvAyRs5OA&t=369s)** — That brings up the next point. The FDA has a revolving door with Big Pharma.
- **[06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UtSvAyRs5OA&t=374s)** — They should make it a law that if you work for the FDA or any type of regulatory business,
- **[06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UtSvAyRs5OA&t=378s)** — you can never go work for a drug company or a chemical company or a big food company.
- **[06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UtSvAyRs5OA&t=384s)** — Nine out of the 20 members that set up the dietary guidelines had conflicts of interest.
- **[06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UtSvAyRs5OA&t=390s)** — There's a great website on this. It's called U.S. Right to Know.
- **[06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UtSvAyRs5OA&t=393s)** — Through the Freedom of Information Act, they got 80,000 pages between Coca-Cola and the dietician organizations.
- **[06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UtSvAyRs5OA&t=400s)** — And what they found out is there's a really cozy relationship between the two.
- **[06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UtSvAyRs5OA&t=404s)** — Between $30 to $50 million given to the dieticians from Big Food.
- **[06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UtSvAyRs5OA&t=409s)** — The junk food industry sponsors dieticians' education, their conventions.
- **[06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UtSvAyRs5OA&t=414s)** — They pay their speakers. The next thing that I would want changed is this thing called the rounding rule.
- **[07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UtSvAyRs5OA&t=420s)** — If a certain ingredient is less than .5 grams, it can be rounded down to zero.
- **[07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UtSvAyRs5OA&t=428s)** — The same thing with carbohydrates. Also sodium. If you have less than 5 milligrams of sodium, you can round it down to zero.
- **[07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UtSvAyRs5OA&t=434s)** — Out of all the ingredients that I would hyper-focus on, there are three ingredients that make up 99% of all junk food.
- **[07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UtSvAyRs5OA&t=443s)** — Refined sugars, refined starches, and refined oils. As in seed oils.
- **[07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UtSvAyRs5OA&t=449s)** — I would put huge warning labels on infant formula, pet food, which is also filled with junk food.
- **[07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UtSvAyRs5OA&t=454s)** — And I would force those companies to upgrade the quality of those ingredients.
- **[07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UtSvAyRs5OA&t=459s)** — The worst time to give someone junk food is when they're a baby.
- **[07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UtSvAyRs5OA&t=462s)** — Because you're setting up that person's life for all sorts of deficiencies and health problems.
- **[07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UtSvAyRs5OA&t=467s)** — And lastly, I want to talk about a very important change, sun phobia.
- **[07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UtSvAyRs5OA&t=471s)** — Parallel with that, RDAs for vitamin D are just ridiculous.
- **[07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UtSvAyRs5OA&t=475s)** — 600 IUs might be okay to prevent bone problems, possibly, but not to feed the other systems of the body.
- **[08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UtSvAyRs5OA&t=482s)** — The immune system, the muscles, the organs. They misinterpreted the results of a whole bunch of studies.
- **[08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UtSvAyRs5OA&t=487s)** — And then they used the 600 IUs. When in fact, it should have been over 8,000 IUs every single day.
- **[08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UtSvAyRs5OA&t=493s)** — A vitamin D deficiency puts someone at a very severe risk of virtually every disease.
- **[08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UtSvAyRs5OA&t=500s)** — Pick a disease and I'll show you research on it. Cancer, autoimmune issues, your ability to sleep is dependent on vitamin D.
- **[08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UtSvAyRs5OA&t=507s)** — If every person in the US took just 8,000 IUs every single day of vitamin D3, disease rates would go way down and it would not be that expensive.
- **[08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UtSvAyRs5OA&t=515s)** — That's my two cents. Please tell me what you think should be done about this country to make a difference for healthcare.

## Video 37: How to Detoxify Your Lungs

**Watch on YouTube:** [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2kJQ4ufzXc](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2kJQ4ufzXc)

## Full Transcript with Timestamps

*Click any timestamp to jump to that moment in the video*

- **[00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2kJQ4ufzXc&t=0s)** — Let's talk about how to detoxify your lungs. What is the best way? Okay, we're talking about
- **[00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2kJQ4ufzXc&t=4s)** — detoxifying pollution, the chemicals from smoking. And by the way, since you probably already know
- **[00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2kJQ4ufzXc&t=10s)** — this, but there's 7,000 chemicals in cigarette smoke. 250 are harmful and 69 actually are
- **[00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2kJQ4ufzXc&t=19s)** — carcinogenic. I mean there's even a radioactive element in smoking. You have ammonia, you have
- **[00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2kJQ4ufzXc&t=26s)** — formaldehyde, hydrogen cyanide, and even cadmium which is a heavy metal. And you have first-hand
- **[00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2kJQ4ufzXc&t=31s)** — smoking and then you have second-hand smoking, right? But there's also third-hand smoking.
- **[00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2kJQ4ufzXc&t=36s)** — All the chemical particles that end up like on furniture, clothing that you come in contact
- **[00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2kJQ4ufzXc&t=43s)** — with as well. And of course, the goal of you probably watching this is to reduce your risk of
- **[00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2kJQ4ufzXc&t=48s)** — cancer and things like that. But there's another big problem that is associated with smoking
- **[00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2kJQ4ufzXc&t=53s)** — and that is COPD, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. 12 million people in the United States
- **[01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2kJQ4ufzXc&t=61s)** — have COPD. So I'm going to share some information on how to prevent that and if you have it,
- **[01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2kJQ4ufzXc&t=67s)** — what to do to improve it. But smoking is not the only issue here. You have pollution in the
- **[01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2kJQ4ufzXc&t=73s)** — air, you have cleaning supply chemicals, you have mold and mildew in your house. You even
- **[01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2kJQ4ufzXc&t=79s)** — have something called radon gas that can actually affect your lungs. And then also if we compound
- **[01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2kJQ4ufzXc&t=86s)** — that with pre-existing infections to the lung, it can lead to some major problems. And just so
- **[01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2kJQ4ufzXc&t=92s)** — you know, lung cancer doesn't always come from smoking. It can be referred or they call it
- **[01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2kJQ4ufzXc&t=99s)** — spread from other organs. And so if your lung has inflammation in it, it becomes a target
- **[01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2kJQ4ufzXc&t=106s)** — for cancer because cancer tends to spread in areas of inflammation. So the key thing with
- **[01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2kJQ4ufzXc&t=113s)** — this video is all about inflammation in the lung and how to reduce it because anytime you have
- **[01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2kJQ4ufzXc&t=119s)** — inflammation you then get scar tissue, fibrosis, and then it gets to a point where it becomes
- **[02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2kJQ4ufzXc&t=126s)** — irreversible. So when a toxin comes in contact with your lung tissue, it irritates it.
- **[02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2kJQ4ufzXc&t=132s)** — It's going to start creating inflammation. And then over time if there's a chronic exposure
- **[02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2kJQ4ufzXc&t=138s)** — to that toxin, you start developing fibrosis. And you also at the same time get a lowered amount
- **[02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2kJQ4ufzXc&t=144s)** — of your own antioxidants that are there to protect the lung. So you have this insult or
- **[02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2kJQ4ufzXc&t=151s)** — free radical damage situation and a lowering of the protective mechanism of your own body's
- **[02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2kJQ4ufzXc&t=156s)** — antioxidants goes down. But what a lot of people don't realize is that these chemicals
- **[02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2kJQ4ufzXc&t=161s)** — that go into the lung go systemic. They don't stop at the lung and a lot of them end up in
- **[02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2kJQ4ufzXc&t=168s)** — the liver. So the liver is at the heart of the detoxification system. So it's going to take
- **[02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2kJQ4ufzXc&t=175s)** — those poisons that are in cigarettes or pollution and it's going to dismantle them hopefully.
- **[03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2kJQ4ufzXc&t=180s)** — And it does this through a series of enzyme interactions called phase one, phase two,
- **[03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2kJQ4ufzXc&t=186s)** — phase three, detoxification enzymes. But it gets to a point where it becomes overloaded,
- **[03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2kJQ4ufzXc&t=192s)** — where the liver cannot keep up with this, especially if it's a chronic exposure to these
- **[03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2kJQ4ufzXc&t=197s)** — chemicals. The liver starts to develop inflammation. It can even develop fat from
- **[03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2kJQ4ufzXc&t=204s)** — inflammation and then it leads to scar tissue. So as you filled up the lungs with chemicals
- **[03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2kJQ4ufzXc&t=208s)** — and pollution, it can end up in the arteries and create a lot of heart problems. But I think the
- **[03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2kJQ4ufzXc&t=213s)** — key note here is chronic exposure. Not exposure here and there that your liver can easily deal
- **[03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2kJQ4ufzXc&t=221s)** — with this, but it's just a routine chronic exposure over a long period of time. That's
- **[03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2kJQ4ufzXc&t=226s)** — where we have a problem. Let's jump right into what to do about it. There's some really
- **[03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2kJQ4ufzXc&t=230s)** — interesting data on probably one of the best protective remedies for your lung,
- **[03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2kJQ4ufzXc&t=239s)** — as well as the liver. And it's very different than what you're going to find when you do
- **[04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2kJQ4ufzXc&t=243s)** — searches on detoxifying your lungs, because normally they're going to talk about herbs
- **[04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2kJQ4ufzXc&t=250s)** — that help you stop coughing, might decrease swelling. But this other herb that I'm going to
- **[04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2kJQ4ufzXc&t=256s)** — probably the most potent, not just because what it can do for your lung, but what it can do for
- **[04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2kJQ4ufzXc&t=262s)** — your liver. And that herb is milk thistle. Milk thistle is one of the best antidotes
- **[04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2kJQ4ufzXc&t=269s)** — to poison. So if you poison yourself from either a snake bite or a poisonous mushroom
- **[04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2kJQ4ufzXc&t=275s)** — or toxins, or you're just taking medications, you should be taking milk thistle to protect
- **[04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2kJQ4ufzXc&t=278s)** — the liver. Well, it just so happens that that same protection occurs in your lungs as well.
- **[04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2kJQ4ufzXc&t=284s)** — So if you have COPD or you're a smoker, or you're trying to repair your lungs,
- **[04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2kJQ4ufzXc&t=290s)** — milk thistle is what you want to start taking. Because milk thistle is one of the best
- **[04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2kJQ4ufzXc&t=294s)** — anti-inflammatories. It's the best protector against toxins. And it's a really good remedy
- **[05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2kJQ4ufzXc&t=302s)** — if you have COPD and also any type of liver problem. Number two, tokatrinols. This is a
- **[05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2kJQ4ufzXc&t=314s)** — vitamin E called the tocopherols. So tokatrinols are all about getting rid of free radical damage.
- **[05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2kJQ4ufzXc&t=322s)** — It's a very powerful antioxidant. It's a very powerful anti-inflammatory. And it's especially
- **[05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2kJQ4ufzXc&t=328s)** — good to prevent fibrosis. So that stage where you go from inflammation to scar tissue. There's
- **[05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2kJQ4ufzXc&t=336s)** — a lot of data that talks about tokatrinol helping prevent scar tissue in your arteries.
- **[05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2kJQ4ufzXc&t=341s)** — And then the liver, but also in your lungs. So tokatrinols are a number two remedy,
- **[05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2kJQ4ufzXc&t=349s)** — especially to reduce inflammation. And number three, vitamin D. You want to take this probably
- **[05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2kJQ4ufzXc&t=355s)** — in 20,000 I use. But vitamin D is a very powerful anti-inflammatory. And it's really good
- **[06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2kJQ4ufzXc&t=362s)** — for COPD, any type of lung inflammation, as well as any autoimmune diseases. Now there are
- **[06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2kJQ4ufzXc&t=370s)** — some interesting links between COPD and autoimmune. You may have antibodies against your own lung
- **[06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2kJQ4ufzXc&t=377s)** — tissue if you have COPD. And this is something you'd have to have tested, but I want to bring
- **[06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2kJQ4ufzXc&t=381s)** — it up because it is an issue. And if you have antibodies that are creating this inflammation
- **[06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2kJQ4ufzXc&t=387s)** — in your lungs, this goes beyond just being exposed to toxins. This is your immune system
- **[06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2kJQ4ufzXc&t=393s)** — that's misidentifying your lungs as a pathogen. Vitamin D is going to be very important.
- **[06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2kJQ4ufzXc&t=400s)** — In this additional remedy, so if you have antibodies against your own lung tissue,
- **[06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2kJQ4ufzXc&t=404s)** — I'm going to recommend a product from another company that I'm not affiliated with. It's
- **[06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2kJQ4ufzXc&t=408s)** — called Standard Process and the product is called Pneumotrophin PMG. You just take one
- **[06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2kJQ4ufzXc&t=413s)** — of those before bed. And that can potentially act as a decoy. So these antibodies can then
- **[06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2kJQ4ufzXc&t=419s)** — attack it and not your lungs, giving your lungs a chance to heal and regenerate. Now
- **[07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2kJQ4ufzXc&t=430s)** — I think it would probably be appropriate to learn a little bit more about this
- **[07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2kJQ4ufzXc&t=434s)** — milk thistle. And for that, you should check this video right here.

- **[00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TBf7uK7Urb0&t=0s)** — Today we are going to show you how to make thick and shiny hair.
- **[00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TBf7uK7Urb0&t=2s)** — And as you know, with my videos I like to tell you what's behind things,
- **[00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TBf7uK7Urb0&t=6s)** — what's the root cause of certain things. And when we talk about hair,
- **[00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TBf7uK7Urb0&t=9s)** — realize that anything going on with your hair is the tip of the iceberg.
- **[00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TBf7uK7Urb0&t=13s)** — And I'm not interested in having you take more supplements. We're going to relate a lot of this to your diet and food,
- **[00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TBf7uK7Urb0&t=19s)** — because ultimately that's the best source. But let's start with biotin.
- **[00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TBf7uK7Urb0&t=22s)** — This is a B vitamin. A lot of people take biotin.
- **[00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TBf7uK7Urb0&t=25s)** — And it does help the thickness of your hair. It helps your nails. It helps your skin.
- **[00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TBf7uK7Urb0&t=30s)** — But why do you need to take biotin? Are we deficient in biotin?
- **[00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TBf7uK7Urb0&t=33s)** — Biotin can come from the diet, but it can also come from your own gut microbiome.
- **[00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TBf7uK7Urb0&t=39s)** — Your good bacteria make biotin. And one side effect of antibiotics is a problem with your hair.
- **[00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TBf7uK7Urb0&t=47s)** — And that's because certain microbes are no longer there or they're in smaller amounts and they're just not making enough biotin.
- **[00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TBf7uK7Urb0&t=54s)** — There's a huge connection between some alteration in your gut and problems with your hair because of a biotin deficiency.
- **[01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TBf7uK7Urb0&t=60s)** — This is why people that start taking biotin might see a change, but then when they stop taking biotin, the hair problem comes right back.
- **[01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TBf7uK7Urb0&t=67s)** — A couple other reasons why people might be deficient in biotin is that they eat raw eggs.
- **[01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TBf7uK7Urb0&t=72s)** — There's a certain chemical in the egg that if you don't cook it, can combine with biotin, lock it up and prevent the absorption.
- **[01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TBf7uK7Urb0&t=79s)** — If you cook the whites of the egg, not the yolk, you don't have to worry about it. You're not going to become deficient in biotin.
- **[01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TBf7uK7Urb0&t=85s)** — Alcohol is another reason why people are deficient in biotin. Alcohol messes with your liver. It also messes with the absorption of biotin.
- **[01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TBf7uK7Urb0&t=92s)** — What are the best sources of biotin? Liver, egg, yolks.
- **[01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TBf7uK7Urb0&t=95s)** — Here you have this great biotin that's in the yolk that won't be absorbed because of some other chemical in the white of the egg.
- **[01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TBf7uK7Urb0&t=103s)** — So this is why you need to cook your eggs, but just make sure the yolk is a bit runny.
- **[01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TBf7uK7Urb0&t=107s)** — Nutritional yeast has biotin and salmon has biotin.
- **[01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TBf7uK7Urb0&t=111s)** — Another little side note is that if you're magnesium deficient, which a lot of people are, that could be the reason why you're not absorbing biotin.
- **[01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TBf7uK7Urb0&t=118s)** — I've done a ton of videos on magnesium. Very, very important.
- **[02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TBf7uK7Urb0&t=122s)** — Also, zinc is a helper to biotin as well. And so is copper.
- **[02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TBf7uK7Urb0&t=127s)** — Let's move over to vitamin A. I'm talking about the active form of vitamin A called retinol, which is only in animal products.
- **[02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TBf7uK7Urb0&t=135s)** — Of course, the best source of vitamin A is in liver and egg yolks.
- **[02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TBf7uK7Urb0&t=140s)** — But you can also get it in shellfish and caliber oil.
- **[02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TBf7uK7Urb0&t=143s)** — What's so important about vitamin A in relationship to your hair?
- **[02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TBf7uK7Urb0&t=145s)** — Vitamin A helps control sebum and makes your hair very, very shiny.
- **[02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TBf7uK7Urb0&t=150s)** — Let's go to omega-3 fatty acids. You have omega-3 fatty acids and then you have omega-6 fatty acids.
- **[02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TBf7uK7Urb0&t=156s)** — So when people are consuming a lot of seed oils, corn oil, vegetable oil, those oils are very, very bad for a lot of problems in your body, including your hair.
- **[02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TBf7uK7Urb0&t=164s)** — So both the omega-3 and omega-6 kind of compete.
- **[02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TBf7uK7Urb0&t=167s)** — So what we want to do is we want to eliminate the omega-6 fats and increase omega-3 fatty acids because omega-3 is so important in making the hair thick and making your hair shiny.
- **[02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TBf7uK7Urb0&t=179s)** — And you can get omega-3 fatty acids from fish oils.
- **[03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TBf7uK7Urb0&t=182s)** — But if you get it from cod liver oil, you also get some additional benefits.
- **[03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TBf7uK7Urb0&t=187s)** — Vitamin A, also vitamin D. Let's move on to this right here.
- **[03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TBf7uK7Urb0&t=191s)** — What is this L-ruderi thing?
- **[03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TBf7uK7Urb0&t=193s)** — Well, it stands for lactobacillus ruderi. This is a microbe.
- **[03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TBf7uK7Urb0&t=196s)** — And there's a lot of research on this microbe.
- **[03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TBf7uK7Urb0&t=199s)** — This microbe is missing in 96% of the population because we've all had antibiotics in our past.
- **[03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TBf7uK7Urb0&t=207s)** — And L-ruderi does a lot for our bodies.
- **[03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TBf7uK7Urb0&t=210s)** — But one of the things that it does very specifically is it increases sebum, that oil that helps the hair become very, very shiny.
- **[03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TBf7uK7Urb0&t=217s)** — And it also stimulates hair growth.
- **[03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TBf7uK7Urb0&t=219s)** — There's a lot to talk about this microbe.
- **[03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TBf7uK7Urb0&t=221s)** — I'm going to put a video down below. If you haven't seen my video on this, you should watch it.
- **[03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TBf7uK7Urb0&t=225s)** — It's something that's fascinating.
- **[03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TBf7uK7Urb0&t=227s)** — Now I want to get to this really important topic of copper.
- **[03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TBf7uK7Urb0&t=230s)** — Copper does a lot. It's involved in a lot of different enzymes.
- **[03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TBf7uK7Urb0&t=234s)** — This is an enzyme that's using copper to help regulate iron, preventing the accumulation of iron in your tissues.
- **[04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TBf7uK7Urb0&t=243s)** — Iron is really important in hair growth because it helps oxygen feed the roots of the hair.
- **[04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TBf7uK7Urb0&t=249s)** — It helps the growth of the hair. It helps your hair become thicker.
- **[04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TBf7uK7Urb0&t=252s)** — And it helps with the collagen formation.
- **[04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TBf7uK7Urb0&t=254s)** — What I didn't know back then that I now know is that iron is controlled by copper.
- **[04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TBf7uK7Urb0&t=261s)** — If you fix your copper situation, you can actually fix your iron situation.
- **[04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TBf7uK7Urb0&t=265s)** — But it's not necessarily to take another copper supplement because you need to understand how you became deficient in copper in the first place.
- **[04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TBf7uK7Urb0&t=272s)** — And one of the ways that we're deficient in copper is that a lot of farmers use NPK, nitrogen phosphorus and potassium fertilizers.
- **[04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TBf7uK7Urb0&t=281s)** — When you use a lot of nitrogen, you get a lot of growth of grass and other vegetation.
- **[04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TBf7uK7Urb0&t=287s)** — But at the same time, you're creating micronutrient deficiencies, especially copper.
- **[04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TBf7uK7Urb0&t=293s)** — If the grass and vegetation are deficient in copper, the animals will become deficient in copper.
- **[04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TBf7uK7Urb0&t=298s)** — There's a fascinating book right here called Soil, Grass and Cancer. A very thick book.
- **[05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TBf7uK7Urb0&t=304s)** — It's actually a very expensive book. It was like $250.
- **[05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TBf7uK7Urb0&t=306s)** — But I want to just give you a very quick summary.
- **[05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TBf7uK7Urb0&t=310s)** — Copper deficiency caused by nitrogen fertilizers.
- **[05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TBf7uK7Urb0&t=313s)** — They talk about the details of how many farmers use this fertilizer for the grass of grazing animals, but also to make the hay that they feed the animals in the winter.
- **[05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TBf7uK7Urb0&t=321s)** — And they're showing statistics on trace minerals and coppers tanked down to zero.
- **[05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TBf7uK7Urb0&t=325s)** — But what's really interesting in the book, it talks about how that shows up in sheep and cattle as far as their hair.
- **[05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TBf7uK7Urb0&t=332s)** — The hair on cows becomes very, very dull. It loses its luster. It loses its shine.
- **[05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TBf7uK7Urb0&t=337s)** — If this is happening with sheep and cows, is it possible it can happen to our bodies? The answer is yes.
- **[05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TBf7uK7Urb0&t=344s)** — So NPK is one of the causes of a deficiency of copper.
- **[05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TBf7uK7Urb0&t=348s)** — Also, when we consume too much iron, all the wheat products and grain products are fortified with iron.
- **[05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TBf7uK7Urb0&t=354s)** — And taking too much iron locks up your copper as well.
- **[05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TBf7uK7Urb0&t=357s)** — We lose like 0.5 milligrams to 1 milligram a day.
- **[06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TBf7uK7Urb0&t=361s)** — Yet the RDAs or the recommended iron per day is like 8 to 18 milligrams.
- **[06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TBf7uK7Urb0&t=368s)** — So there's a big problem with iron.
- **[06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TBf7uK7Urb0&t=369s)** — Vitamin A and copper work together. They need each other to work.
- **[06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TBf7uK7Urb0&t=373s)** — You go on a low-fat diet, you end up with a low retinol or vitamin A situation and that's going to affect copper as well.
- **[06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TBf7uK7Urb0&t=379s)** — High-fructose corn syrup depletes copper.
- **[06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TBf7uK7Urb0&t=382s)** — If you're consuming a lot of junk food, this could be why you have a problem.
- **[06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TBf7uK7Urb0&t=386s)** — If you're taking a lot of zinc for a long period of time, that can deplete copper.
- **[06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TBf7uK7Urb0&t=390s)** — So I always recommend taking your zinc in a blend of other trace minerals.
- **[06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TBf7uK7Urb0&t=396s)** — And also, if you're taking magnesium, I'd recommend taking it in a form as magnesium glycinate.
- **[06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TBf7uK7Urb0&t=401s)** — I know I gave you a lot of information. I'm going to summarize it right now.
- **[06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TBf7uK7Urb0&t=404s)** — You want to start taking probiotic foods.
- **[06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TBf7uK7Urb0&t=407s)** — Heifer, sauerkraut, kimchi.
- **[06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TBf7uK7Urb0&t=409s)** — Because you want to start building up your gut microbiome.
- **[06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TBf7uK7Urb0&t=413s)** — Liver has copper.
- **[06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TBf7uK7Urb0&t=418s)** — Egg yolks, good source of biotin and vitamin A.
- **[07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TBf7uK7Urb0&t=422s)** — And of course, cod liver oil for your omega-3 fatty acids.
- **[07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TBf7uK7Urb0&t=426s)** — I personally like cod liver in cans.
- **[07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TBf7uK7Urb0&t=429s)** — That will give you the omega-3 fatty acids, the vitamin D, the vitamin A,
- **[07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TBf7uK7Urb0&t=433s)** — and there's some copper in there as well.
- **[07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TBf7uK7Urb0&t=436s)** — Because it's a liver and that's where a lot of nutrition is concentrated.
- **[07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TBf7uK7Urb0&t=439s)** — Number five, organic foods. Why?
- **[07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TBf7uK7Urb0&t=441s)** — Because glyphosate in the Roundup Ready is very, very damaging
- **[07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TBf7uK7Urb0&t=445s)** — and it creates deficiency in the soil and also in your body if you are consuming it.
- **[07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TBf7uK7Urb0&t=452s)** — Now you might say, well, I only eat non-GMO food.
- **[07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TBf7uK7Urb0&t=454s)** — Well, did you know that wheat is sprayed with this glyphosate as something to dry it out?
- **[07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TBf7uK7Urb0&t=460s)** — If you eat organic, you're not going to get this glyphosate.
- **[07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TBf7uK7Urb0&t=463s)** — And then trace minerals are really important to get copper, to get zinc,
- **[07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TBf7uK7Urb0&t=467s)** — to get everything in the right ratios.
- **[07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TBf7uK7Urb0&t=469s)** — And if you haven't seen my video on this one right here, I put it up here. Check it out.

- **[00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CCI1vz1bAc&t=0s)** — The number one super food for your hair. There's going to be four foods we're going to cover.
- **[00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CCI1vz1bAc&t=4s)** — The fourth one is going to be the most important one if you want to get your hair back.
- **[00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CCI1vz1bAc&t=7s)** — Let's start with number one first.
- **[00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CCI1vz1bAc&t=9s)** — Bamboo shoots. Now you're probably saying bamboo shoots, like you can eat that?
- **[00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CCI1vz1bAc&t=14s)** — Yes, they have different forms. You can get it canned. You can buy it online.
- **[00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CCI1vz1bAc&t=17s)** — Bamboo shoots not only are very high in potassium and trace minerals,
- **[00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CCI1vz1bAc&t=22s)** — they are very high in something called silica. Silica is essential to build up the hair protein.
- **[00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CCI1vz1bAc&t=28s)** — Silica can make your hair strong, elastic. It can prevent it from breaking.
- **[00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CCI1vz1bAc&t=33s)** — It gets rid of the brittleness in hair, but also it helps your skin too.
- **[00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CCI1vz1bAc&t=37s)** — It's great for wrinkles. It's even good for your joints.
- **[00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CCI1vz1bAc&t=40s)** — It can help strengthen your bones as well.
- **[00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CCI1vz1bAc&t=42s)** — Number two, wild-caught salmon.
- **[00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CCI1vz1bAc&t=45s)** — Now, of course, salmon is loaded with nutrition, great protein,
- **[00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CCI1vz1bAc&t=48s)** — but salmon is known for its high levels of omega-3 fatty acids.
- **[00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CCI1vz1bAc&t=51s)** — The other cool thing about wild-caught salmon is that it's loaded with vitamin D3.
- **[00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CCI1vz1bAc&t=55s)** — Nearly every single problem with hair loss can be improved with vitamin D3.
- **[01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CCI1vz1bAc&t=60s)** — Especially part of the root of the hair where you have this follicle,
- **[01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CCI1vz1bAc&t=63s)** — vitamin D controls that whole environment.
- **[01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CCI1vz1bAc&t=65s)** — It actually can activate dormant hair follicle stem cells.
- **[01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CCI1vz1bAc&t=70s)** — This will increase the density of your hair.
- **[01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CCI1vz1bAc&t=72s)** — So sometimes people will have thinning of the hair.
- **[01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CCI1vz1bAc&t=74s)** — This is what they need to consume more of.
- **[01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CCI1vz1bAc&t=76s)** — Let's move to number three, egg yolks.
- **[01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CCI1vz1bAc&t=79s)** — What's in an egg yolk? Egg yolks are loaded with something called biotin
- **[01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CCI1vz1bAc&t=82s)** — and people take biotin to help their hair.
- **[01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CCI1vz1bAc&t=84s)** — It's a necessary thing.
- **[01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CCI1vz1bAc&t=86s)** — So if you don't have enough biotin, you can't even make keratin.
- **[01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CCI1vz1bAc&t=89s)** — Keratin makes up the hair, improving the shaft of the hair
- **[01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CCI1vz1bAc&t=92s)** — and make sure that it's strong so you don't have this thinning hair
- **[01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CCI1vz1bAc&t=96s)** — that is falling out that's fragile and weak and it can break easily.
- **[01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CCI1vz1bAc&t=100s)** — On top of that, egg yolks have all the fat soluble nutrients,
- **[01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CCI1vz1bAc&t=103s)** — which are really important to support hair growth
- **[01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CCI1vz1bAc&t=105s)** — and the structure of the hair itself.
- **[01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CCI1vz1bAc&t=108s)** — The other important thing about the egg yolk is it's loaded with cholesterol.
- **[01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CCI1vz1bAc&t=111s)** — Now you might think, oh, that's a bad thing.
- **[01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CCI1vz1bAc&t=113s)** — No. Cholesterol is the precursor for all of the key hormones
- **[01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CCI1vz1bAc&t=117s)** — that you need for your hair.
- **[01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CCI1vz1bAc&t=118s)** — If those are not correctly produced or regulated in the right amounts
- **[02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CCI1vz1bAc&t=123s)** — because you don't have enough cholesterol, that can affect the hair.
- **[02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CCI1vz1bAc&t=126s)** — Also, it'll make it shiny, give it that luster,
- **[02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CCI1vz1bAc&t=128s)** — help strengthen the actual shaft of the hair as well.
- **[02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CCI1vz1bAc&t=131s)** — Plus, eggs are loaded with sulfur.
- **[02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CCI1vz1bAc&t=134s)** — Sulfur can also help the scalp of the hair
- **[02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CCI1vz1bAc&t=137s)** — and that is kind of like the soil for the hair to grow into.
- **[02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CCI1vz1bAc&t=140s)** — And then of course, egg yolks also have vitamin D,
- **[02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CCI1vz1bAc&t=143s)** — which I've already talked about.
- **[02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CCI1vz1bAc&t=144s)** — Now let's get to number four,
- **[02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CCI1vz1bAc&t=146s)** — which is the most important food that you could possibly eat
- **[02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CCI1vz1bAc&t=149s)** — for hair growth and other benefits of your hair.
- **[02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CCI1vz1bAc&t=152s)** — And this is grass-fed liver.
- **[02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CCI1vz1bAc&t=155s)** — Now you can do beef liver, lamb liver,
- **[02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CCI1vz1bAc&t=158s)** — but if you don't like liver, you can get these in capsules.
- **[02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CCI1vz1bAc&t=161s)** — Or if you can find a good recipe, cook it with onions.
- **[02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CCI1vz1bAc&t=163s)** — The absolute most concentrated nutrient-dense food
- **[02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CCI1vz1bAc&t=167s)** — that you could possibly consume.
- **[02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CCI1vz1bAc&t=169s)** — It has virtually every single nutrient in very high amounts,
- **[02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CCI1vz1bAc&t=173s)** — super high amounts of iron.
- **[02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CCI1vz1bAc&t=176s)** — Iron is necessary to help transport oxygen to your scalp.
- **[03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CCI1vz1bAc&t=180s)** — The most common cause of hair shedding is an iron deficiency.
- **[03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CCI1vz1bAc&t=186s)** — There's two ways to get an iron deficiency in your blood.
- **[03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CCI1vz1bAc&t=189s)** — Number one is to be deficient in iron,
- **[03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CCI1vz1bAc&t=192s)** — which beef liver can satisfy really quickly.
- **[03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CCI1vz1bAc&t=195s)** — But also if you're deficient in copper,
- **[03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CCI1vz1bAc&t=198s)** — that won't allow the iron to work correctly in the red blood cell
- **[03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CCI1vz1bAc&t=203s)** — to feed the hair oxygen.
- **[03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CCI1vz1bAc&t=206s)** — Well, guess what?
- **[03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CCI1vz1bAc&t=207s)** — Beef liver is loaded with copper as well.
- **[03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CCI1vz1bAc&t=210s)** — And not just copper, zinc in the right ratios.
- **[03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CCI1vz1bAc&t=214s)** — And zinc is very, very important in preventing
- **[03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CCI1vz1bAc&t=217s)** — the more powerful form of testosterone called DHT
- **[03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CCI1vz1bAc&t=221s)** — that has a tendency to burn out your hair and cause hair loss.
- **[03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CCI1vz1bAc&t=224s)** — Zinc can help prevent that.
- **[03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CCI1vz1bAc&t=225s)** — Zinc also is necessary in the formation of creating hair
- **[03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CCI1vz1bAc&t=230s)** — and protein synthesis, especially for your hair.
- **[03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CCI1vz1bAc&t=234s)** — Beef liver is loaded with folate.
- **[03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CCI1vz1bAc&t=236s)** — And B12 and copper help reduce the graying effect of your hair
- **[04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CCI1vz1bAc&t=242s)** — just as an FYI.
- **[04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CCI1vz1bAc&t=243s)** — Of course, the folate and the B12 are in the best form available.
- **[04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CCI1vz1bAc&t=247s)** — The iron in beef liver is a heme type iron.
- **[04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CCI1vz1bAc&t=250s)** — It's so much more bioavailable than any iron you can get from plants
- **[04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CCI1vz1bAc&t=255s)** — or supplements.
- **[04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CCI1vz1bAc&t=257s)** — And on top of that, beef liver is loaded with the most bioavailable
- **[04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CCI1vz1bAc&t=262s)** — form of vitamin A.
- **[04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CCI1vz1bAc&t=264s)** — Not the pre-chris or beta-carotene,
- **[04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CCI1vz1bAc&t=266s)** — but the active form of vitamin A called retinol.
- **[04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CCI1vz1bAc&t=269s)** — And vitamin A is essential for allowing vitamin D to work
- **[04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CCI1vz1bAc&t=273s)** — because vitamin D is also in liver.
- **[04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CCI1vz1bAc&t=276s)** — And we know the importance of vitamin D in hair growth
- **[04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CCI1vz1bAc&t=278s)** — through helping regulate sebum, which is the oil on the gland
- **[04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CCI1vz1bAc&t=281s)** — to make your hair look very, very healthy
- **[04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CCI1vz1bAc&t=283s)** — and to prevent this drying out effect of your hair.
- **[04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CCI1vz1bAc&t=286s)** — And we also have another thing in liver called biotin.
- **[04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CCI1vz1bAc&t=289s)** — I've already talked about that.
- **[04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CCI1vz1bAc&t=291s)** — Biotin will help increase the structure of the hair, the shaft.
- **[04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CCI1vz1bAc&t=294s)** — So your hair becomes thicker, stronger, more elastic, fuller look,
- **[04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CCI1vz1bAc&t=299s)** — as well as the growth of hair itself.
- **[05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CCI1vz1bAc&t=301s)** — And getting biotin from grass-fed liver is way better
- **[05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CCI1vz1bAc&t=305s)** — than getting it from a supplement.
- **[05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CCI1vz1bAc&t=307s)** — If you had an antibiotic and all of a sudden your hair starts
- **[05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CCI1vz1bAc&t=311s)** — becoming a problem, then you need more biotin
- **[05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CCI1vz1bAc&t=314s)** — or actually you need more grass-fed liver.
- **[05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CCI1vz1bAc&t=316s)** — Anyway, I wanted to keep this video real short,
- **[05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CCI1vz1bAc&t=318s)** — but I wanted to give you some really important foods for the hair.
- **[05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CCI1vz1bAc&t=321s)** — And now, you know, the most important one.
- **[05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CCI1vz1bAc&t=323s)** — Thanks for watching and I will see you in the next video.

## Video 40: How to INSTANTLY Relieve Painful Periods (Menstrual Cramps)

**Watch on YouTube:** [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21HEr110HKg](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21HEr110HKg)

## Full Transcript with Timestamps

*Click any timestamp to jump to that moment in the video*

- **[00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21HEr110HKg&t=0s)** — I wanted to do this quick video on how to get rid of painful periods, which are also called
- **[00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21HEr110HKg&t=6s)** — menstrual cramps, or known as period pain. They're all really the same thing. You have a
- **[00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21HEr110HKg&t=12s)** — cramping going on in the lower part of your body. Now the question is, what is cramping? Well,
- **[00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21HEr110HKg&t=19s)** — it's the uterus. Yes, the uterus can cramp. Because when you think about like even pregnancy,
- **[00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21HEr110HKg&t=23s)** — it's the uterus that contracts. Well, during your menstrual cycle, the uterus also contracts
- **[00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21HEr110HKg&t=29s)** — as well. And so we're dealing with a spasm of a muscle. There's a really quick thing that you can
- **[00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21HEr110HKg&t=35s)** — do to give relief to yourself. So what you do is just lay on your stomach. That's called a prone
- **[00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21HEr110HKg&t=39s)** — position. And then you put your arms up and you stretch backwards, hyper extending your lower back,
- **[00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21HEr110HKg&t=47s)** — which will stretch out the uterus in front of your back. So that's the quick thing to give
- **[00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21HEr110HKg&t=52s)** — you immediate relief. And it will help if you can do it. Sometimes it's so painful that you
- **[00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21HEr110HKg&t=56s)** — can't even do that. But at least that's something I would attempt as a first thing.
- **[01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21HEr110HKg&t=61s)** — All right, so now you can't keep stretching all day long. So what can you do to really get to
- **[01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21HEr110HKg&t=66s)** — the root of the problem? If you look up painful periods or menstrual cramps, you will
- **[01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21HEr110HKg&t=72s)** — always see this word prostaglandins. Well, it's a chemical that signals certain parts of
- **[01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21HEr110HKg&t=81s)** — do certain things like create inflammation. And this is why prostaglandins are behind inflammation
- **[01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21HEr110HKg&t=88s)** — in the brain. And when people take medication like ibuprofen for pain or a headache, it is
- **[01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21HEr110HKg&t=95s)** — blocking these prostaglandins. But there's different types of prostaglandins. And the
- **[01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21HEr110HKg&t=98s)** — one that we're going to talk about has a very specific purpose of causing a vasoconstriction
- **[01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21HEr110HKg&t=104s)** — in the uterus if it's too high. And I will get into why it's too high in a minute. But
- **[01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21HEr110HKg&t=110s)** — let's talk about what you can do to inhibit or lower prostaglandins. Most people take
- **[01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21HEr110HKg&t=117s)** — ibuprofen. Okay, and it does work. The problem is there's side effects. There's a lot of side
- **[02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21HEr110HKg&t=121s)** — effects that can affect your stomach and create other issues, which I don't want to get into.
- **[02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21HEr110HKg&t=126s)** — But what I do want to get into is an alternative similar to ibuprofen that has virtually
- **[02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21HEr110HKg&t=131s)** — no side effects. There is one study and I'll put the link down below that showed the
- **[02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21HEr110HKg&t=135s)** — of ibuprofen to this remedy. Okay, and it was very, very close. Ibuprofen did win out in
- **[02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21HEr110HKg&t=143s)** — being more effective. But initially, both of those proved to be very, very similar or compatible
- **[02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21HEr110HKg&t=148s)** — in effectiveness. And the remedy is cinnamon. That's right. So just sprinkle a little cinnamon
- **[02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21HEr110HKg&t=153s)** — and sugar on your toast and you'll be good to go. And I'm being very sarcastic. The type
- **[02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21HEr110HKg&t=158s)** — of cinnamon that you want, is it going to be in a capsule? Okay, because you need to get
- **[02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21HEr110HKg&t=162s)** — a gram or 1000 milligrams and you're going to take that three times a day. But cinnamon has
- **[02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21HEr110HKg&t=168s)** — a lot of different properties for regulating blood sugars. But in this situation, it gives an
- **[02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21HEr110HKg&t=173s)** — anti-spasmodic effect. Okay, it gets rid of spasms and it could help you reduce inflammation.
- **[03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21HEr110HKg&t=180s)** — Why? Because it lowers prostaglandins, the specific ones that are affecting the uterus.
- **[03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21HEr110HKg&t=186s)** — Now, the question you're probably asking right now is why are these prostaglandins
- **[03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21HEr110HKg&t=189s)** — too high in the first place? It's really in a balance with two hormones. We have an excessively
- **[03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21HEr110HKg&t=197s)** — lowered amount of progesterone and we have too much estrogen. That is the combination
- **[03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21HEr110HKg&t=203s)** — that creates this problem. And it just so happens that cinnamon lowers estrogen and it
- **[03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21HEr110HKg&t=212s)** — increases progesterone. So it not only affects that prostaglandin, but it helps to go deeper.
- **[03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21HEr110HKg&t=219s)** — A couple other things that I recommend that also will directly inhibit prostaglandins. Vitamin D3
- **[03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21HEr110HKg&t=225s)** — and I would take about 10,000 IUs three times a day throughout the day. At the same time,
- **[03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21HEr110HKg&t=231s)** — you're taking the cinnamon as well as calcium and magnesium together. And the vitamin D helps
- **[03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21HEr110HKg&t=237s)** — the absorption of the calcium and the magnesium go into the tissues, helping to relax the spasm.
- **[04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21HEr110HKg&t=245s)** — Vitamin D is also a potent anti-inflammatory as well. And the third thing that might be very
- **[04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21HEr110HKg&t=250s)** — beneficial is Omega 3 fatty acids in the form of cod liver oil. Omega 3 is a natural
- **[04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21HEr110HKg&t=258s)** — pain reliever, a natural anti-inflammatory. So now you have a very potent solution
- **[04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21HEr110HKg&t=263s)** — for menstrual cramps or period pain. Now because of the censoring and the suppressing
- **[04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21HEr110HKg&t=269s)** — of the algorithms on YouTube, it's becoming more difficult to find my content. And there's
- **[04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21HEr110HKg&t=274s)** — a lot of content that I cannot put on YouTube unfortunately. So to make sure you have full

- **[04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21HEr110HKg&t=290s)** — that, the question is what actually is behind this imbalance of too much estrogen and not

- **[00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FA2nGFPbAM&t=1s)** — Sarca is a problem with the sciatic nerve. The sciatic nerve is the longest and largest nerve in the body.
- **[00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FA2nGFPbAM&t=8s)** — If you look at the width of your thumb, okay, that's usually the width of that nerve where it comes out.
- **[00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FA2nGFPbAM&t=13s)** — And it comes out of the lower back and the sacrum, okay?
- **[00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FA2nGFPbAM&t=17s)** — And there's five nerves that form this one sciatic nerve.
- **[00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FA2nGFPbAM&t=22s)** — And when we have a problem with that nerve, that's called sciatica.
- **[00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FA2nGFPbAM&t=26s)** — Now there are some great wonderful stretches that you can find on the internet.
- **[00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FA2nGFPbAM&t=29s)** — I've done videos on that which are great for sciatica.
- **[00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FA2nGFPbAM&t=32s)** — But the problem is what happens later in the day or the next day when it comes right back.
- **[00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FA2nGFPbAM&t=36s)** — So today we're going to talk about what we can do to actually correct this problem without having to use medication.
- **[00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FA2nGFPbAM&t=43s)** — But you still want to do the stretches as well.
- **[00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FA2nGFPbAM&t=44s)** — All right, so what do we know about sciatica?
- **[00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FA2nGFPbAM&t=48s)** — Well, we know 90% of the time it involves the disc.
- **[00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FA2nGFPbAM&t=52s)** — And the disc is basically... it has an outside and it has an inside.
- **[00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FA2nGFPbAM&t=56s)** — The inside is like a little jelly donut.
- **[00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FA2nGFPbAM&t=59s)** — And what happens when the outer part of that disc gets weakened, some of that jelly can kind of squeeze out.
- **[01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FA2nGFPbAM&t=66s)** — And that can put pressure on part of the nerve roots that make up the sciatic nerve.
- **[01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FA2nGFPbAM&t=70s)** — And then you have pain either in your butt or travels down the back of the leg all the way down to the foot or the outer part of the leg.
- **[01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FA2nGFPbAM&t=77s)** — And sometimes it's not just like severe pain.
- **[01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FA2nGFPbAM&t=79s)** — It could be a numbness. It could be a burning. It could be a gnawing.
- **[01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FA2nGFPbAM&t=82s)** — Like a deep kind of irritating type sensation.
- **[01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FA2nGFPbAM&t=85s)** — The reason I'm even doing this video is that I found this condition that was interesting to me because I haven't really heard about it before.
- **[01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FA2nGFPbAM&t=93s)** — And that condition is called myeloneuropathy. Myeloneuropathy. What does that mean?
- **[01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FA2nGFPbAM&t=99s)** — That's M-Y-E-L-O. Myel.
- **[01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FA2nGFPbAM&t=102s)** — Well, that word means the marrow of your spinal column.
- **[01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FA2nGFPbAM&t=106s)** — And that's composed of like a lot of different nerves that come up and down the spinal column and then they come out.
- **[01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FA2nGFPbAM&t=111s)** — And neuropathy means some type of damage to the nerve.
- **[01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FA2nGFPbAM&t=115s)** — So this condition, myeloneuropathy, is really a combination of a problem in the spinal column and the nerves that come out called the peripheral nerves.
- **[02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FA2nGFPbAM&t=126s)** — And this can give you a lot of different nerve problems including a lot of sensory nerve problems like I just mentioned.
- **[02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FA2nGFPbAM&t=131s)** — Like the burning, the gnawing, the numbness, severe pain and even weakness in the muscle because these nerves connect with muscles.
- **[02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FA2nGFPbAM&t=137s)** — But what really interests me about this condition that I never heard before is that it's a copper deficiency most of the time.
- **[02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FA2nGFPbAM&t=144s)** — Or a vitamin E or full-late deficiency. But the majority of the time it's a copper deficiency.
- **[02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FA2nGFPbAM&t=150s)** — So I started looking at copper in relationship to the sciatic nerve and I found some fascinating information.
- **[02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FA2nGFPbAM&t=155s)** — Number one, there's all sorts of different types of therapy that use copper for inflammation and pain like copper bracelets, copper patches, copper cream,
- **[02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FA2nGFPbAM&t=166s)** — and even a brace that you could wrap around your upper hip area that can cover the sciatic nerve or at least the origin of the sciatic nerve.
- **[02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FA2nGFPbAM&t=177s)** — And it's laced with copper. And a lot of people are reporting amazing results with that.
- **[03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FA2nGFPbAM&t=182s)** — And we don't really know exactly why copper can help pain and inflammation. And I'm talking about just topically putting it on the body.
- **[03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FA2nGFPbAM&t=189s)** — I mean, something could be actually potentially kind of being absorbed maybe, but maybe not. But I know copper is a very conductive metal.
- **[03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FA2nGFPbAM&t=198s)** — And so maybe it does something with the electrical fields that are out of balance in the area of pain. I don't know.
- **[03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FA2nGFPbAM&t=207s)** — And there's not hardly any research on this at all. But that doesn't mean it doesn't work.
- **[03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FA2nGFPbAM&t=212s)** — I mean, the amount of people that are reporting great relief from this, I mean, I'm talking about skeptical people, is quite large.
- **[03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FA2nGFPbAM&t=219s)** — So I'm not just going to wait for the next study or someone to invest in the study to prove that it might work.
- **[03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FA2nGFPbAM&t=225s)** — Because it's a very low risk, non-toxic, relatively inexpensive thing that anyone can do.
- **[03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FA2nGFPbAM&t=233s)** — And even in ancient Egyptian times, they used copper, copper bracelets, copper jewelry for their pain inflammation and arthritis.
- **[04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FA2nGFPbAM&t=243s)** — And since we're on the topic of arthritis, the Arthritis Foundation said that there's no validity to using these copper bracelets or even magnetic bracelets.
- **[04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FA2nGFPbAM&t=254s)** — So, you know, you want to try it because whatever they say not to do usually is going to work very well.
- **[04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FA2nGFPbAM&t=259s)** — Simply because of who funds these organizations, right? Drug companies. I don't know. For all I know, they probably started some of these foundations.
- **[04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FA2nGFPbAM&t=267s)** — Now that's using copper externally. But what about this copper deficiency? What does that have to do with anything?
- **[04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FA2nGFPbAM&t=273s)** — Well, it has to do with a lot because it's involved with quite a few different enzymes.
- **[04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FA2nGFPbAM&t=279s)** — And one of the enzymes that create a big impact on cytokine is the enzyme that uses copper as an essential cofactor for building collagen and connective tissue.
- **[04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FA2nGFPbAM&t=291s)** — And guess what? Is your disc made of collagen? Well, yeah, 75% of the outer part of that disc is made from collagen.
- **[05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FA2nGFPbAM&t=300s)** — So if you're deficient in collagen, could it be possible that you can have a weakness within the disc?
- **[05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FA2nGFPbAM&t=305s)** — Now copper is also used in enzymes that involve nerves, the nervous system, nerve transmission, and even myelin that protects the nerve.
- **[05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FA2nGFPbAM&t=317s)** — So a lot of things start lining up in relationship to looking at a copper deficiency and potentially having a sciatic type problem.
- **[05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FA2nGFPbAM&t=325s)** — I know other people might develop like carpal tunnel syndrome when they have a copper deficiency as well.
- **[05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FA2nGFPbAM&t=330s)** — So copper is essential for collagen. And I've done other videos on collagen before and talking about how important vitamin C is in making collagen.
- **[05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FA2nGFPbAM&t=340s)** — But guess what? If you look at nature, copper makes up part of that vitamin C complex.
- **[05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FA2nGFPbAM&t=347s)** — So we have copper for collagen and connective tissue. We also have copper for the nervous system.
- **[05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FA2nGFPbAM&t=353s)** — Certain parts of your brain have very high levels of copper.
- **[05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FA2nGFPbAM&t=356s)** — Dopamine. This is why there's usually a copper deficiency when a person has Parkinson's involving dopamine.
- **[06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FA2nGFPbAM&t=364s)** — And we know dopamine involves the nerve muscle connection and issues with that.
- **[06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FA2nGFPbAM&t=369s)** — Copper is also involved in making energy, helping you sleep. Also in making melanin, which helps prevent graying of the hair.
- **[06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FA2nGFPbAM&t=378s)** — It's also involved with red blood cells. And we're going to come back to that in a second.
- **[06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FA2nGFPbAM&t=382s)** — It's involved in the formation of bone and is an antioxidant.
- **[06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FA2nGFPbAM&t=387s)** — So how would someone become deficient in copper? Well, a lot of people are deficient in copper from various reasons.
- **[06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FA2nGFPbAM&t=394s)** — One is they don't have enough copper in the diet, which I will get into like what foods are high in that.
- **[06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FA2nGFPbAM&t=399s)** — But it's really high in the shellfish and organ meats, which two things that people don't consume a lot of.
- **[06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FA2nGFPbAM&t=406s)** — Also, athletes are usually low in copper because they're doing a lot of physical exercise that use up a lot of energy that require an increased demand of copper.
- **[06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FA2nGFPbAM&t=419s)** — And especially if they're doing exercise at higher altitudes because that involves strain on the red blood cell.
- **[07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FA2nGFPbAM&t=427s)** — But the more exercise you do, the more copper you're going to need.
- **[07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FA2nGFPbAM&t=430s)** — And you can imagine if an athlete is really working out and they're not eating right, they can end up with a copper deficiency and then have a weakness within the connective tissue or collagen and create a problem with the tendons, ligaments, muscles and discs.
- **[07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FA2nGFPbAM&t=446s)** — Now also, if you take a lot of zinc, without the opposing mineral copper, you can create a copper deficiency as well.
- **[07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FA2nGFPbAM&t=454s)** — Also, if you take a lot of iron, you can deplete your copper.
- **[07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FA2nGFPbAM&t=458s)** — There's many different reasons why enriched flour products, as in the breads, pasta type foods, can deplete copper.
- **[07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FA2nGFPbAM&t=466s)** — Fluoride from your tap water definitely depletes copper.
- **[07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FA2nGFPbAM&t=470s)** — Too much vitamin C, but mainly in the form of ascorbic acid.
- **[07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FA2nGFPbAM&t=474s)** — Sometimes people do certain remedies where they're taking like certain like maybe two or three or four grams of ascorbic acid.
- **[08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FA2nGFPbAM&t=482s)** — That's going to deplete your copper as well.
- **[08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FA2nGFPbAM&t=484s)** — A lot of sweating can deplete your copper because copper can come out through the sweat.
- **[08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FA2nGFPbAM&t=489s)** — Too much sun tanning can actually deplete your copper because of the connection with melanin.
- **[08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FA2nGFPbAM&t=495s)** — Melanin requires copper.
- **[08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FA2nGFPbAM&t=497s)** — And then you also have stress.
- **[08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FA2nGFPbAM&t=498s)** — And even too much of the precursor DHEA, which actually is the raw material to make cortisol, too much of that or too much cortisol can deplete your copper.
- **[08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FA2nGFPbAM&t=507s)** — Even when you have a lot of potassium without these trace minerals like copper, that can worsen the deficiency.
- **[08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FA2nGFPbAM&t=513s)** — And of course you have distilled water as well.
- **[08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FA2nGFPbAM&t=515s)** — You're going to create a deficiency of all the minerals with distilled water.
- **[08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FA2nGFPbAM&t=518s)** — You have to put those back in.
- **[08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FA2nGFPbAM&t=520s)** — Also, we have high levels of niacin can deplete copper to a certain degree.
- **[08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FA2nGFPbAM&t=525s)** — So as I'm going through these, it's just an important thing to remember.
- **[08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FA2nGFPbAM&t=530s)** — Anytime you take a lot of one nutrient without the others in the complexes, especially if you're not getting food sources, you can create imbalances.
- **[08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FA2nGFPbAM&t=539s)** — Gastric bypass. You're going to have a tendency to be deficient in not just copper, but other trace minerals.
- **[09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FA2nGFPbAM&t=545s)** — If you eat too much sugar, you can actually have deficiency.
- **[09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FA2nGFPbAM&t=548s)** — Or even too much coffee and alcohol can do it.
- **[09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FA2nGFPbAM&t=552s)** — And even aspartame as an artificial sweetener can deplete your copper.
- **[09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FA2nGFPbAM&t=556s)** — But I think there's one additional thing that's very, very important.
- **[09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FA2nGFPbAM&t=561s)** — And I looked at this as well.
- **[09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FA2nGFPbAM&t=564s)** — Probably people that have cytokine also have a genetic issue with copper being absorbed, creating a deficiency, even though you're taking normal amounts.
- **[09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FA2nGFPbAM&t=576s)** — And that's related to kind of a topic I've been deeply studying on DNA.
- **[09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FA2nGFPbAM&t=581s)** — It's called polymorphism.
- **[09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FA2nGFPbAM&t=584s)** — That's a mutation or an error in the gene that can leave you deficient in certain things.
- **[09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FA2nGFPbAM&t=590s)** — Well, I found two different genes that if you have a problem with that, you most likely will have a copper deficiency.
- **[09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FA2nGFPbAM&t=595s)** — And then that can relate to other issues as well.
- **[09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FA2nGFPbAM&t=598s)** — And the study that talks about that associates a higher level of getting carpal tunnel syndrome, which is pain in the wrist, as well as compression fractures,
- **[10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FA2nGFPbAM&t=606s)** — and then because copper is involved in the bone because a certain part of your bone is made out of collagen.
- **[10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FA2nGFPbAM&t=612s)** — All right, so all this is very interesting. But what can you do about it?
- **[10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FA2nGFPbAM&t=615s)** — Well, you have options.
- **[10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FA2nGFPbAM&t=617s)** — One really good remedy might be to do a search on Amazon to find one of those copper braces.
- **[10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FA2nGFPbAM&t=625s)** — And when you see the copper braces, it looks like it supports the hip, but it wraps around the buttocks right where that cytokine comes out.
- **[10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FA2nGFPbAM&t=631s)** — And it's in the upper thigh.
- **[10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FA2nGFPbAM&t=633s)** — And it's lined with copper.
- **[10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FA2nGFPbAM&t=634s)** — That might be a really good solution to give you temporary relief, as well as these other products that have copper patches or even a copper cream.
- **[10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FA2nGFPbAM&t=645s)** — But it's also important, number two, to make sure you're getting enough copper from the food.
- **[10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FA2nGFPbAM&t=650s)** — And so the food that has the most copper would be beef liver.
- **[10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FA2nGFPbAM&t=654s)** — It could be any liver, but liver in general.
- **[10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FA2nGFPbAM&t=657s)** — Number two, oysters.
- **[10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FA2nGFPbAM&t=658s)** — Number three, shellfish.
- **[11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FA2nGFPbAM&t=660s)** — Number four, dark chocolate.
- **[11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FA2nGFPbAM&t=662s)** — Of course, get the sugar free.
- **[11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FA2nGFPbAM&t=664s)** — Number five, cashews.
- **[11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FA2nGFPbAM&t=666s)** — And number six, meat in general, like grass-fed beef.
- **[11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FA2nGFPbAM&t=670s)** — Now, number three, if you're going to do a copper supplement, which is not a bad idea, because that way you can actually correct it.
- **[11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FA2nGFPbAM&t=678s)** — And by chance, if you have this genetic weakness, you're going to have to take a little more than just the bare bones amount.
- **[11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FA2nGFPbAM&t=686s)** — So what I would recommend is I would start with two milligrams of copper per day
- **[11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FA2nGFPbAM&t=694s)** — and slowly increase that over a period of one month to 20 milligrams.
- **[11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FA2nGFPbAM&t=700s)** — And you can do the math on that, but every several days you take a little bit more and more and more until you achieve 20 milligrams.
- **[11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FA2nGFPbAM&t=707s)** — So you might need these higher amounts to make the change necessary for your disc to start healing up and your nervous system to start healing up.
- **[11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FA2nGFPbAM&t=714s)** — And then after a month, you can play around with it, reduce the dosage, see how you feel.
- **[12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FA2nGFPbAM&t=720s)** — If you do good, then stay at a lower amount. If it gets worse, take a little bit more.
- **[12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FA2nGFPbAM&t=725s)** — And then over a period of maybe three or four months, maybe kind of wean it down to like two milligrams a day and see if that's all you need.
- **[12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FA2nGFPbAM&t=732s)** — But the point is I wanted to put this focus on this connection between copper and cytica.
- **[12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FA2nGFPbAM&t=738s)** — It's very interesting, but it doesn't invalidate the necessity to do these stretches.
- **[12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FA2nGFPbAM&t=744s)** — Now, because of the censoring and the suppressing of the algorithms on YouTube, it's becoming more difficult to find my content.
- **[12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FA2nGFPbAM&t=751s)** — And there's a lot of content that I cannot put on YouTube, unfortunately.

- **[00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KSi-yCa4hE&t=0s)** — By now, I should have had Lyme disease over and over again. I get roughly about 20 ticks per week.
- **[00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KSi-yCa4hE&t=7s)** — I'll be in the shower and I'm like scratching in my head. I'm like, what the heck is this? And then
- **[00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KSi-yCa4hE&t=11s)** — I'll pull out a tick in the back of my scalp. I'll have them hiding in different places. I'll
- **[00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KSi-yCa4hE&t=16s)** — be looking in the mirror and thinking that it's a mole, but actually it's a tick. It's really
- **[00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KSi-yCa4hE&t=21s)** — weird. And the problem I have with the treatment is I don't like antibiotics. They're not
- **[00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KSi-yCa4hE&t=25s)** — telling you not to take an antibiotic or the conventional treatment or to take it. I just want
- **[00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KSi-yCa4hE&t=29s)** — to give you another viewpoint. Antibiotics don't just kill the bad bacteria. They also kill the
- **[00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KSi-yCa4hE&t=33s)** — good bacteria. So they lower your immune system. And there's a percentage of people that develop
- **[00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KSi-yCa4hE&t=38s)** — resistance to antibiotics. So now they have things like chronic fatigue syndrome, fibromyalgia.
- **[00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KSi-yCa4hE&t=45s)** — They developed an autoimmune disease after their treatment of Lyme. So what I'm going
- **[00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KSi-yCa4hE&t=50s)** — to reveal today is what I think is the reason I'm not getting this Lyme disease.
- **[00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KSi-yCa4hE&t=55s)** — A couple points about ticks. Number one, there is over 900 different species of ticks. A certain
- **[01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KSi-yCa4hE&t=61s)** — percentage can create a Lyme, which is a kind of a corkscrew bacteria. They can penetrate
- **[01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KSi-yCa4hE&t=66s)** — into tissues that no other bacteria can get into. And this is one way they evade your immune
- **[01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KSi-yCa4hE&t=73s)** — system by going into certain tissues that don't have any immune cells. But there's other
- **[01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KSi-yCa4hE&t=80s)** — types of spiral chite infections that create other diseases like syphilis and something called
- **[01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KSi-yCa4hE&t=85s)** — Rocky Mountain spotted fever, which is a bit rare. And so you have this concept of not all
- **[01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KSi-yCa4hE&t=90s)** — ticks will carry this bacteria. And also this other point, not all of these corkscrew bacteria
- **[01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KSi-yCa4hE&t=97s)** — can create disease. And understanding that is very, very important in preventing these diseases.
- **[01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KSi-yCa4hE&t=105s)** — So here's what happens. A tick attaches itself in your body and the tick's saliva has this
- **[01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KSi-yCa4hE&t=110s)** — numbing agent. So it's really hard to know that it's on your body. This is why it is so
- **[01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KSi-yCa4hE&t=115s)** — important to check your body front and back sideways, your hair every single day. And on a
- **[02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KSi-yCa4hE&t=122s)** — positive note, it takes a bit of time between 36 and 48 hours, which is a really good thing
- **[02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KSi-yCa4hE&t=128s)** — because you have a little time to check your body and make sure that there's no ticks that
- **[02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KSi-yCa4hE&t=133s)** — are creating this effect. Or else it would be very bad if they can create an instant
- **[02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KSi-yCa4hE&t=138s)** — infection. First, you might have a little immune reaction, a little redness, but then it
- **[02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KSi-yCa4hE&t=142s)** — develops into something called a bullseye rash. That doesn't mean 100% of the time you have Lyme
- **[02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KSi-yCa4hE&t=149s)** — disease, but it's a good indicator that you might have it. And I had a bullseye rash two
- **[02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KSi-yCa4hE&t=154s)** — times in my life. And I will explain exactly what I did for both. But I think it's really
- **[02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KSi-yCa4hE&t=159s)** — important to understand more about this corkscrew bacteria. And also these corkscrew
- **[02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KSi-yCa4hE&t=165s)** — bacteria can also invade the heart, creating palpitations, arrhythmias, things like that.
- **[02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KSi-yCa4hE&t=170s)** — Another way that this Spirochite evades or avoids your immune system or immune system detection
- **[02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KSi-yCa4hE&t=178s)** — is by putting up certain defense mechanisms to keep them alive once your immune cells have
- **[03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KSi-yCa4hE&t=186s)** — actually engulfed them and are eating them by what's called a monocyte, which is a self that
- **[03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KSi-yCa4hE&t=194s)** — eats bacteria and viruses and fungus. They have an incredible ability to adapt
- **[03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KSi-yCa4hE&t=200s)** — to different environments. But the problem with these little bacteria is they create this
- **[03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KSi-yCa4hE&t=205s)** — immune reaction. And there's a lot of collateral damage that occurs from your
- **[03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KSi-yCa4hE&t=210s)** — immune system trying to kill them. And this is why you have a lot of inflammatory conditions
- **[03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KSi-yCa4hE&t=216s)** — when you have this condition called Lyme. When I initially got Lyme's disease long ago,
- **[03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KSi-yCa4hE&t=221s)** — I had severe inflammation in the back of my head. I had a severe headache. My whole body was like
- **[03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KSi-yCa4hE&t=231s)** — aching like I had the flu. And I was extremely tired. But that's the only time I ever reacted
- **[03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KSi-yCa4hE&t=237s)** — to a tick bite. And from that point on, I never had those reactions. And I'm going to
- **[04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KSi-yCa4hE&t=242s)** — tell you why I think I haven't. Apparently, that specific bacteria has the capacity to
- **[04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KSi-yCa4hE&t=251s)** — affect your receptors for vitamin D. Because vitamin D is the most important vitamin of the
- **[04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KSi-yCa4hE&t=260s)** — entire immune system, including the monocytes. Vitamin D helps the monocyte become very strong
- **[04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KSi-yCa4hE&t=266s)** — and efficient. Vitamin D also increases these anti-microbial, they're called peptides
- **[04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KSi-yCa4hE&t=273s)** — or compounds that help kill spirochetes. This microbe now is going to be in the driver's seat.
- **[04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KSi-yCa4hE&t=279s)** — It's going to be in control. And your immune cells are going to be in the back seat. Like
- **[04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KSi-yCa4hE&t=284s)** — even the Epstein-Barr virus or the cytomegalovirus has the ability to downgrade the vitamin D
- **[04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KSi-yCa4hE&t=290s)** — receptor because somehow it knows how important this vitamin D is, especially with enhancing
- **[04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KSi-yCa4hE&t=297s)** — your immune system's ability to fight. But there's another detail about this that I just
- **[05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KSi-yCa4hE&t=302s)** — thought was very interesting I want to share with you. The monocyte, when it comes in contact
- **[05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KSi-yCa4hE&t=307s)** — with the spirochete, triggers this other chemical called interferon. Now, what is interferon?
- **[05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KSi-yCa4hE&t=314s)** — Interferon is a compound that interferes with viruses. When a monocyte comes in contact with
- **[05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KSi-yCa4hE&t=319s)** — this bacteria, interferon goes up. So it must have some of the functions that we don't know
- **[05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KSi-yCa4hE&t=325s)** — about. Now, the other thing I was going to mention about this is something called the post
- **[05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KSi-yCa4hE&t=329s)** — treatment Lyme disease. This is very common. You see people that had Lyme, they had the treatment,
- **[05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KSi-yCa4hE&t=336s)** — but now they still have symptoms. They develop autoimmune diseases because the immune system is
- **[05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KSi-yCa4hE&t=341s)** — greatly suppressed because they can no longer absorb vitamin D. And this is where it gets
- **[05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KSi-yCa4hE&t=348s)** — really interesting because I take a tremendous amount of vitamin D on a regular basis.
- **[05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KSi-yCa4hE&t=353s)** — I think it's the vitamin D that keeps my immune system strengthened. It literally bulletproofs
- **[05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KSi-yCa4hE&t=359s)** — against problems like Lyme. And this next part I want to share with you. It's so important,
- **[06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KSi-yCa4hE&t=364s)** — but it's not really well known by even doctors. There's two different main systems of
- **[06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KSi-yCa4hE&t=370s)** — vitamin D. You have one system that controls all the calcium, okay? And then another system
- **[06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KSi-yCa4hE&t=376s)** — of vitamin D that is non-calcium benefits, like the supporting of the immune cells,
- **[06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KSi-yCa4hE&t=383s)** — like the support of your central nervous system, all your nerves, and then the heart,
- **[06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KSi-yCa4hE&t=388s)** — and the muscles, and the intestines, and the anti-inflammatory effect. That's all over here.
- **[06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KSi-yCa4hE&t=395s)** — This is a completely different system. This system that controls calcium in bone, that vitamin
- **[06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KSi-yCa4hE&t=401s)** — D is received from the blood. This system over here, like your immune system, is unable to
- **[06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KSi-yCa4hE&t=409s)** — get very much of this vitamin D from the blood. But this vitamin D is very locked up,
- **[06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KSi-yCa4hE&t=415s)** — mostly unavailable to this system right here, especially your immune cells. The immune system
- **[07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KSi-yCa4hE&t=422s)** — depends on its vitamin D from the sun, from your food, which is impossible because we don't
- **[07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KSi-yCa4hE&t=429s)** — get much vitamin D from our food, or supplements. Now, most of the research on vitamin D
- **[07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KSi-yCa4hE&t=436s)** — on skeletal system found that you only need a very small amount, like 600 IUs of vitamin D
- **[07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KSi-yCa4hE&t=442s)** — to maintain this calcium support for your skeletal system. But this system over here needs
- **[07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KSi-yCa4hE&t=449s)** — a lot more, like 10,000 IUs. Now, what's even more wild is that this type of vitamin D in the
- **[07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KSi-yCa4hE&t=457s)** — blood can last for three weeks. This vitamin D that comes from sun, food, or supplements
- **[07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KSi-yCa4hE&t=462s)** — only lasts 24 hours. In other words, if you're taking your vitamin D once a week,
- **[07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KSi-yCa4hE&t=467s)** — and not every day, you're not going to be able to feed the immune cells. And on top of that,
- **[07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KSi-yCa4hE&t=473s)** — that spiral kite has the ability to downgrade the vitamin D receptor by 50x. If I personally
- **[08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KSi-yCa4hE&t=481s)** — suspected that I had Lyme, I would be taking 30, 40, 50,000 IUs of vitamin D without any
- **[08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KSi-yCa4hE&t=488s)** — question at all. That's probably why I did not develop Lyme because really the strategy
- **[08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KSi-yCa4hE&t=493s)** — is going to be supporting your immune system versus trying to kill off this infection,
- **[08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KSi-yCa4hE&t=499s)** — because you end up killing off the immune system, the very thing that keeps you strong and keeps
- **[08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KSi-yCa4hE&t=505s)** — you protected. One additional thing I want to mention is that they have found these spiral
- **[08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KSi-yCa4hE&t=512s)** — kites in your tissue underneath your teeth. That's right. So if you have an abscess,
- **[08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KSi-yCa4hE&t=519s)** — an infection underneath the tooth, there's a possibility that you could have this spiral
- **[08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KSi-yCa4hE&t=524s)** — kite as well. And the reason I'm bringing that up is there's so many problems connected with
- **[08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KSi-yCa4hE&t=529s)** — teeth infections, especially after root canals, because this bacteria is hidden, it's protected
- **[08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KSi-yCa4hE&t=535s)** — underneath into the jaw, and it can leak out and create all sorts of problems with your heart,
- **[09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KSi-yCa4hE&t=541s)** — all sorts of problems with the immune system. It can keep you inflamed. And this is why I
- **[09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KSi-yCa4hE&t=545s)** — recommend a biological dentist or a holistic dentist to make sure you don't have these
- **[09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KSi-yCa4hE&t=550s)** — hidden infections underneath your teeth, which can create a lot of problems. This is the protocol
- **[09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KSi-yCa4hE&t=555s)** — that I think would be a good idea. Whether you're going to do an antibiotic or not,
- **[09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KSi-yCa4hE&t=560s)** — I would recommend taking high doses of vitamin D3. At least 30,000 I use. Anytime you take
- **[09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KSi-yCa4hE&t=566s)** — vitamin D3, you also need magnesium, and you need K2, and you need zinc. Those are all
- **[09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KSi-yCa4hE&t=571s)** — factors to allow vitamin D to work. And if you're taking high doses of vitamin D without those,
- **[09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KSi-yCa4hE&t=576s)** — you can actually even create a deficiency of the cofactors. Two other things I think would be
- **[09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KSi-yCa4hE&t=581s)** — really good to take. Japanese Nakweed for supporting your immune system, and then a lot
- **[09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KSi-yCa4hE&t=586s)** — of garlic. Now, if you wanted to learn more about a protocol that I used when I had Lyme,

- **[00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_C3RIudfFw&t=0s)** — Now this video might get me banned or in trouble.
- **[00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_C3RIudfFw&t=3s)** — And I think you're going to question everything that you thought you knew about modern medicine.
- **[00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_C3RIudfFw&t=9s)** — I'm going to share just the highlights from this book right here, which I'll put a link down below.
- **[00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_C3RIudfFw&t=14s)** — There's a lot more details on this topic, but I'm going to cover the highlights.
- **[00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_C3RIudfFw&t=17s)** — Typically the RDAs for vitamin D are about 600 IUs.
- **[00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_C3RIudfFw&t=22s)** — They stand for International Units.
- **[00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_C3RIudfFw&t=24s)** — It's an arbitrary number, which basically a group of people in a committee voted on it.
- **[00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_C3RIudfFw&t=28s)** — And I really believe it was originally designed to scare people from taking too much of certain things.
- **[00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_C3RIudfFw&t=35s)** — But at the end of this video, I'm going to share with you who really started this whole thing and it will all make sense.
- **[00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_C3RIudfFw&t=40s)** — And if we just take a look at 600 IUs, International Units, how many milligrams is that?
- **[00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_C3RIudfFw&t=46s)** — That's just a little bit more than one-tenth of one milligram.
- **[00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_C3RIudfFw&t=51s)** — That's a very small amount.
- **[00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_C3RIudfFw&t=52s)** — For the last 100 years, vitamin D has been a very controversial topic because I believe it helps so many people in so many ways.
- **[01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_C3RIudfFw&t=62s)** — We use sunbathing called heliotherapy back in the early 1900s.
- **[01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_C3RIudfFw&t=67s)** — This is before vaccines and this is before antibiotics.
- **[01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_C3RIudfFw&t=71s)** — And they would heal up their TB and their asthma, osteoporosis, tooth decay, psoriasis, mood issues, diabetes,
- **[01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_C3RIudfFw&t=81s)** — heart disease and even cancer.
- **[01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_C3RIudfFw&t=84s)** — And then what happened? We're told to stay out of the sun.
- **[01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_C3RIudfFw&t=87s)** — Here, take your sunblock. Vitamin D can be toxic.
- **[01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_C3RIudfFw&t=90s)** — What you need to know is 600 IUs is basically standing out in the sun in the summer 1.8 minutes.
- **[01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_C3RIudfFw&t=98s)** — Less than two minutes.
- **[01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_C3RIudfFw&t=99s)** — 10,000 IUs is standing out in the summer sun for about 30 minutes.
- **[01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_C3RIudfFw&t=105s)** — But in the last 100 years, this number 600 IUs has been pushed on people.
- **[01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_C3RIudfFw&t=110s)** — That's what you need. And because of some vitamin D toxicity issues,
- **[01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_C3RIudfFw&t=114s)** — the government commissioned the University of Illinois Chicago to do a study on the toxicity of vitamin D.
- **[02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_C3RIudfFw&t=121s)** — The previous reports of vitamin D toxicity was related to improper production techniques.
- **[02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_C3RIudfFw&t=127s)** — So it really wasn't about the vitamin D itself.
- **[02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_C3RIudfFw&t=129s)** — It was in the manufacturing of vitamin D.
- **[02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_C3RIudfFw&t=131s)** — Now this study that they did went on for nine years, involved hundreds of doctors,
- **[02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_C3RIudfFw&t=138s)** — 773 patients, 63 dogs.
- **[02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_C3RIudfFw&t=141s)** — Take a wild guess what type of dosage they used for vitamin D.
- **[02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_C3RIudfFw&t=144s)** — 200,000 to 1 million IUs.
- **[02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_C3RIudfFw&t=148s)** — Well guess what? They did not find any toxicity.
- **[02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_C3RIudfFw&t=152s)** — Now what you have to realize is that vitamin D3 is very special in that it's an immune modulator.
- **[02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_C3RIudfFw&t=158s)** — The Institute of Health is kind of a governing body,
- **[02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_C3RIudfFw&t=161s)** — and they're the ones who recommend 600 IUs of vitamin D3.
- **[02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_C3RIudfFw&t=164s)** — Here's the problem with those numbers and their evaluation.
- **[02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_C3RIudfFw&t=168s)** — There was two other organizations who reevaluated their data and found that they made some mistakes.
- **[02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_C3RIudfFw&t=175s)** — What was 600 IUs should have been 8,895 IUs.
- **[03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_C3RIudfFw&t=182s)** — Let's take a look at one of the major vitamin D researchers.
- **[03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_C3RIudfFw&t=185s)** — And he invited me to talk.
- **[03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_C3RIudfFw&t=187s)** — I got up and presented this data to, you know, these were the top vitamin D researchers in the world, all assembled there.
- **[03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_C3RIudfFw&t=194s)** — It was vicious. The attacks of how vitamin D doesn't do this.
- **[03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_C3RIudfFw&t=199s)** — How could you say this? I said I'm just presenting the data that we have assembled.
- **[03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_C3RIudfFw&t=204s)** — You're walking on guys careers that have spent their whole career doing this stuff.
- **[03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_C3RIudfFw&t=208s)** — They never conceived that this could be true.
- **[03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_C3RIudfFw&t=211s)** — You know, you don't know what you're doing.
- **[03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_C3RIudfFw&t=213s)** — Well, the government wasted a whole lot of money here for you to conduct these worthless studies.
- **[03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_C3RIudfFw&t=217s)** — The same type of thing happened to the professor who discovered folates.
- **[03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_C3RIudfFw&t=222s)** — Was chastised and not believed for decades.
- **[03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_C3RIudfFw&t=226s)** — But how could a nutrient have this kind of an effect?
- **[03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_C3RIudfFw&t=229s)** — Of course, he turned out to be true, but it was the same sort of attacks.
- **[03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_C3RIudfFw&t=233s)** — Take a look at these interesting graphs.
- **[03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_C3RIudfFw&t=235s)** — Zero is right in the center of these graphs by the equator where you have the most sun and the most vitamin D.
- **[04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_C3RIudfFw&t=243s)** — So MS, breast cancer, colorectal cancer, and diabetes lowest risk at the equator.
- **[04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_C3RIudfFw&t=250s)** — So this just gives an interesting correlation between latitude and certain diseases.
- **[04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_C3RIudfFw&t=257s)** — Now I want to share some additional things.
- **[04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_C3RIudfFw&t=258s)** — In 1900 to 1910, a lot of people got rickets.
- **[04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_C3RIudfFw&t=263s)** — It was common back then. 1918 to 1920, they use sun therapy and cod liver oil for rickets.
- **[04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_C3RIudfFw&t=272s)** — 1922, they discovered vitamin D.
- **[04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_C3RIudfFw&t=275s)** — 1946, the number 400 I use was recommended to prevent rickets.
- **[04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_C3RIudfFw&t=280s)** — 1950 to 1970, despite the increased awareness that vitamin D goes beyond just bone health,
- **[04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_C3RIudfFw&t=288s)** — they kept the numbers for vitamin D at 400 I use.
- **[04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_C3RIudfFw&t=292s)** — 1980, there were more benefits for vitamin D for your immune system, for other chronic diseases,
- **[04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_C3RIudfFw&t=296s)** — but they kept the same 400 I use for vitamin D3.
- **[05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_C3RIudfFw&t=301s)** — Then in 1997, the Institute of Medicine updated the RDAs.
- **[05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_C3RIudfFw&t=306s)** — They wanted to introduce something new called the adequate intake
- **[05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_C3RIudfFw&t=309s)** — because they said the RDAs weren't very scientific.
- **[05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_C3RIudfFw&t=312s)** — So take a guess what they recommended at this point.
- **[05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_C3RIudfFw&t=316s)** — 200 I use for adults, 400 I use if you're 51 to 70, and 600 I use for over 70.
- **[05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_C3RIudfFw&t=323s)** — Finally in 2010, they went up to 600 I use for adults under 70 and 800 if you're over 70.
- **[05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_C3RIudfFw&t=332s)** — Now this whole time they're recommending 400 I use.
- **[05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_C3RIudfFw&t=334s)** — There are three medications that were used on a regular basis and take a wild guess what they were.
- **[05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_C3RIudfFw&t=342s)** — Vitamin D at 50,000 I use.
- **[05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_C3RIudfFw&t=345s)** — So you can take it if it's prescribed through a medication,
- **[05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_C3RIudfFw&t=349s)** — but everyone else, you know, take 400 because of the toxicity of anything more.
- **[05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_C3RIudfFw&t=355s)** — I mean, think about in the 80s, this huge campaign to stay out of the sun, take sunblock.
- **[06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_C3RIudfFw&t=360s)** — The sun will kill you. You're going to get skin cancer.
- **[06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_C3RIudfFw&t=362s)** — Melanoma, which is the number one skin cancer, it develops in areas where you're not exposed to sun.
- **[06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_C3RIudfFw&t=368s)** — Personally, my viewpoint on melanomas, it's really a vitamin D deficiency.
- **[06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_C3RIudfFw&t=372s)** — Vitamin D is needed in 2700 different genes.
- **[06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_C3RIudfFw&t=377s)** — There are so many barriers for absorbing vitamin D3.
- **[06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_C3RIudfFw&t=380s)** — You have the difficulty getting vitamin D in food.
- **[06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_C3RIudfFw&t=382s)** — You have this thing called vitamin D resistance, which a lot of people have genetically,
- **[06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_C3RIudfFw&t=387s)** — where the vitamin D receptor won't receive the vitamin D.
- **[06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_C3RIudfFw&t=390s)** — The darker the skin, the less absorption of vitamin D you get.
- **[06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_C3RIudfFw&t=394s)** — The older the skin, the less vitamin D you create.
- **[06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_C3RIudfFw&t=397s)** — The more you weigh, the less vitamin D you're going to absorb because vitamin D gets diluted into the fat cells.
- **[06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_C3RIudfFw&t=402s)** — But it's very obvious to me that big pharma, modern medicine,
- **[06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_C3RIudfFw&t=406s)** — want you to take extremely low doses of vitamin D, if any vitamin D at all.
- **[06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_C3RIudfFw&t=413s)** — So this is just scratching the surface.
- **[06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_C3RIudfFw&t=414s)** — If you want the complete data on this history, check out this book right here.
- **[06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_C3RIudfFw&t=418s)** — I'll put a link down below in the description.

- **[00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aj0UTxmmv4&t=0s)** — What would happen if you consume fish oils, Omega 3 fatty acids, for about a month, 30 days?
- **[00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aj0UTxmmv4&t=5s)** — Very interesting things. So let's do a deep dive into this topic. Many people get their Omega 3
- **[00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aj0UTxmmv4&t=9s)** — fatty acids from fish oils. Other people get them from cod liver oil. The difference is that cod
- **[00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aj0UTxmmv4&t=16s)** — liver oil has some additional things, vitamin A and vitamin D. But both of them have Omega 3
- **[00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aj0UTxmmv4&t=22s)** — fatty acids. So let's dive right in, starting with the brain. 25% of all the fat in your brain
- **[00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aj0UTxmmv4&t=27s)** — is that specific DHA type of fat. And most of it is in the frontal cortex, the part of the brain
- **[00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aj0UTxmmv4&t=35s)** — that supports memory, focus, concentration, attention. So specifically DHA supports the
- **[00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aj0UTxmmv4&t=43s)** — integrity of the membrane around the neurons. So what does that mean, integrity of the
- **[00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aj0UTxmmv4&t=49s)** — membranes? Well, in the membrane around the neurons, you have a lot of things happening. You
- **[00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aj0UTxmmv4&t=53s)** — have these little pumps that allow communication to go back and forth. You have protection against
- **[00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aj0UTxmmv4&t=58s)** — that neuron from various things. And one thing about the brain is you do not want inflammation
- **[01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aj0UTxmmv4&t=62s)** — in the brain. Now I will point out that your body can make DHA. It can make some, not much.
- **[01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aj0UTxmmv4&t=69s)** — And it gets it from other foods that actually can be converted into DHA. And that precursor
- **[01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aj0UTxmmv4&t=75s)** — or substance is called ALA. And that's in walnuts, that's in chia seed, flax seed. But
- **[01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aj0UTxmmv4&t=81s)** — conversion is very, very small. So unless a person consumes something from the sea,
- **[01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aj0UTxmmv4&t=85s)** — chances are they're not going to get a lot of DHA. DHA supports the retina. The retina is
- **[01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aj0UTxmmv4&t=92s)** — neurological tissue in the back part of the eye that picks up information from the environment
- **[01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aj0UTxmmv4&t=96s)** — and it pulls it into the brain. It has little photoreceptors and 60% of all the fat in that
- **[01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aj0UTxmmv4&t=102s)** — retina is DHA. So it's very, very important. It's important to protect you against inflammation.
- **[01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aj0UTxmmv4&t=107s)** — It's important to UV radiation and protect against macular degeneration. Then you have these omega
- **[01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aj0UTxmmv4&t=113s)** — 3 fatty acids in your skin. It makes the skin real smooth. It protects the skin against things
- **[01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aj0UTxmmv4&t=118s)** — like acne, psoriasis, eczema, dry skin, red skin, as well as ultraviolet light. Now we need
- **[02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aj0UTxmmv4&t=126s)** — a certain amount of ultraviolet light to help make vitamin D. But really only one tenth of
- **[02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aj0UTxmmv4&t=131s)** — spectrum of UV light is designated for making vitamin D. The rest of the UV can create problems
- **[02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aj0UTxmmv4&t=138s)** — for our body, but omega 3 can protect our skin from UV radiation. There's even association
- **[02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aj0UTxmmv4&t=143s)** — between DHA omega 3 fatty acids and your bones helping to mineralize bone, decrease the risk
- **[02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aj0UTxmmv4&t=151s)** — of osteoporosis. A lot of people take omega 3 fatty acids to help with arthritis in the
- **[02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aj0UTxmmv4&t=160s)** — liver, which can then turn into scar tissue. So it helps all three problems with the liver.
- **[02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aj0UTxmmv4&t=167s)** — Scar tissue, inflammation, and fat in the liver. Another benefit of fish oil is to help balance
- **[02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aj0UTxmmv4&t=172s)** — out your blood sugars, specifically making insulin more sensitive. Because so many people
- **[02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aj0UTxmmv4&t=177s)** — have insulin resistance and they have pre-diabetes and diabetes, omega 3 fatty acids
- **[03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aj0UTxmmv4&t=181s)** — can help turn that around. Now there's also another interesting connection between insulin
- **[03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aj0UTxmmv4&t=186s)** — and omega 3 fatty acids. You need insulin to allow these fatty acids to go in the body.
- **[03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aj0UTxmmv4&t=191s)** — But when you have insulin resistance, the cells actually have a deficiency of insulin and that
- **[03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aj0UTxmmv4&t=196s)** — alone can actually inhibit the amount of omega 3 going into the cell. That's all the problems
- **[03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aj0UTxmmv4&t=200s)** — that people have when they have insulin resistance with inflammation. Because if you're
- **[03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aj0UTxmmv4&t=204s)** — not able to absorb omega 3 fatty acids, your inflammatory markers will go higher. And then
- **[03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aj0UTxmmv4&t=210s)** — we have the very important purpose of supporting the inside of the arteries, keeping the
- **[03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aj0UTxmmv4&t=215s)** — inflammation very, very low. So you don't develop calcium deposits or cholesterol
- **[03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aj0UTxmmv4&t=220s)** — formation in the arteries. People that have asthma and allergies can benefit from fish oils
- **[03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aj0UTxmmv4&t=225s)** — as well. It's been known to help reduce those symptoms. And then of course we have all the
- **[03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aj0UTxmmv4&t=229s)** — reproductive benefits. Supporting the survival of sperm. Also supporting the egg that's
- **[03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aj0UTxmmv4&t=234s)** — released from the ovary. So omega 3s are very important in increasing fertility
- **[03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aj0UTxmmv4&t=238s)** — and also supplying some really important raw material for this baby that's growing inside the
- **[04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aj0UTxmmv4&t=245s)** — mother. And even if you're sore after exercise, omega 3 fish oils can help you get rid of that
- **[04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aj0UTxmmv4&t=250s)** — inflammation and speed up the repair process. Now a couple problems with fish oils. Number one,
- **[04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aj0UTxmmv4&t=256s)** — don't go on price. You're going to get something that's probably rancid, something
- **[04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aj0UTxmmv4&t=259s)** — that's already oxidized. Much of the fish oil that's sold ends up going through China
- **[04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aj0UTxmmv4&t=265s)** — in the processing of these fish oils. So you really lose control of the supply chain and don't
- **[04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aj0UTxmmv4&t=270s)** — really know what's happening at that level. And of course manufacturing companies use China
- **[04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aj0UTxmmv4&t=275s)** — because you can get a much cheaper product. The other thing to worry about with fish oils is
- **[04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aj0UTxmmv4&t=280s)** — contamination with heavy metals. Lead, arsenic, mercury. So it's really important to know the
- **[04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aj0UTxmmv4&t=286s)** — source of where your omega 3 fatty acids come from. Is that part of the ocean clean? Is it
- **[04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aj0UTxmmv4&t=292s)** — healthy? You'd be surprised. Some of the top brands, I mean it's like it's the worst quality
- **[04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aj0UTxmmv4&t=297s)** — you could possibly get. You end up burping and belching and you can just taste the
- **[05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aj0UTxmmv4&t=302s)** — acidity of that oil. Now I will say that fish oil or cod liver oil is going to taste a little
- **[05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aj0UTxmmv4&t=307s)** — bit like fish. But there's a huge difference between rancid fish oil and just fish oil.
- **[05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aj0UTxmmv4&t=313s)** — And also on the flip side, if it has absolutely no fish smell or taste at all,
- **[05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aj0UTxmmv4&t=317s)** — you might not even be getting actual fish oil. But I think the best way to take it is in a

- **[05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aj0UTxmmv4&t=327s)** — acids from consuming fatty fish. Wild caught salmon, herring, mackerel, sardines, shellfish.
- **[05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aj0UTxmmv4&t=334s)** — There's even omega 3 fatty acids in grass-fed animal products, grass-fed cheese, grass-fed
- **[05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aj0UTxmmv4&t=341s)** — yogurt. But personally I get my omega 3s from cod liver oil because it has additional vitamin D
- **[05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aj0UTxmmv4&t=346s)** — and vitamin A. And for more information about cod liver oil, I put this video up right here.

- **[00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiU1B6VNDvQ&t=0s)** — You've been lied to by medicine. I was recently invited to speak at the Low Carb Conference.
- **[00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiU1B6VNDvQ&t=6s)** — Okay, there was a bunch of doctors in the room and what was amazing was that all the doctors in
- **[00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiU1B6VNDvQ&t=12s)** — the room practiced a completely different type of medicine. They practiced the philosophy that
- **[00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiU1B6VNDvQ&t=17s)** — food is the best medicine. Using drugs were not their mode of treatment and I really think that's
- **[00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiU1B6VNDvQ&t=23s)** — going to be the wave of the future. But unfortunately the great majority of doctors
- **[00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiU1B6VNDvQ&t=26s)** — use drugs to heal people. And today we're going to dissect this and talk about quite a few lies
- **[00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiU1B6VNDvQ&t=31s)** — that you probably have been told by your doc. And the problem is not even doctors, it's the
- **[00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiU1B6VNDvQ&t=37s)** — system behind doctors. If you were just to ask someone in the medical profession,
- **[00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiU1B6VNDvQ&t=41s)** — what creates health? What would they say? Does a drug actually create health or does it numb or
- **[00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiU1B6VNDvQ&t=48s)** — alter a symptom? And unfortunately our current health care system is highly influenced by
- **[00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiU1B6VNDvQ&t=53s)** — big pharma and big food, aka the junk food industry. Another problem with the medical
- **[00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiU1B6VNDvQ&t=58s)** — profession is it's over specialized. We have a bunch of specialists that are not necessarily
- **[01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiU1B6VNDvQ&t=63s)** — connecting the dots and looking at the whole body. Doctors just focusing on the ears,
- **[01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiU1B6VNDvQ&t=67s)** — nose and throat. Other doctors just focus on the digestive system or the endocrine system
- **[01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiU1B6VNDvQ&t=73s)** — or the brain. I think that's a problem because it kind of keeps everything separated.
- **[01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiU1B6VNDvQ&t=77s)** — And very unfortunately the training in nutrition and food therapy is virtually absent in medical
- **[01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiU1B6VNDvQ&t=83s)** — schools. They get I think 12 to 20 hours. Well here's one of their biochemistry textbooks,
- **[01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiU1B6VNDvQ&t=88s)** — this one right here. And what's missing in this book are the key co-factors,
- **[01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiU1B6VNDvQ&t=93s)** — aka nutrients, that are involved in biochemistry. Nutrition is not emphasized
- **[01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiU1B6VNDvQ&t=99s)** — in biochemistry. Doctors do not look into this diet, this food angle. Yet many doctors have
- **[01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiU1B6VNDvQ&t=105s)** — opinions on nutrition which is not very favorable. So let's dive into the nine lies
- **[01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiU1B6VNDvQ&t=110s)** — that your doctor told you. Number one, you don't need a gallbladder. So if you're missing it,
- **[01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiU1B6VNDvQ&t=115s)** — it is not a big deal. Well first of all the gallbladder is a sack that is underneath your
- **[02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiU1B6VNDvQ&t=120s)** — right rib cage. It's a storage place for something called bile salts. And bile salts are a
- **[02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiU1B6VNDvQ&t=125s)** — detergent that helps you extract certain fats from your digestive system. So without a
- **[02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiU1B6VNDvQ&t=132s)** — gallbladder you're not going to be able to concentrate this bile. So if you don't have a
- **[02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiU1B6VNDvQ&t=136s)** — gallbladder, bile salts after a meal would be a good idea. Number two, statins have minimal
- **[02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiU1B6VNDvQ&t=141s)** — side effects. That is completely not true. They have major side effects. Not just a little
- **[02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiU1B6VNDvQ&t=148s)** — problem with muscles, but a major problem with muscles. Your risk for type 2 diabetes goes up
- **[02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiU1B6VNDvQ&t=152s)** — and you're at risk for liver damage. Some doctors even recommend statins for everyone
- **[02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiU1B6VNDvQ&t=157s)** — over the age of 40 and 50 whether you have a problem with cholesterol or not. That is insane
- **[02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiU1B6VNDvQ&t=165s)** — because without cholesterol a lot of problems can occur. Cholesterol is a necessary thing that
- **[02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiU1B6VNDvQ&t=170s)** — your body makes and needs for several things. Number one, it's needed to make a lot of
- **[02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiU1B6VNDvQ&t=177s)** — different hormones including testosterone, estrogen, progesterone, the stress hormone
- **[03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiU1B6VNDvQ&t=181s)** — called cortisol. It's needed to make the cell membranes. And you have a lot of cell membranes.
- **[03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiU1B6VNDvQ&t=187s)** — In fact, the surface area of membrane that surrounds your cells is roughly, and I'm not
- **[03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiU1B6VNDvQ&t=195s)** — So instead of trying to block the production of cholesterol, let's actually get rid of certain
- **[03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiU1B6VNDvQ&t=200s)** — things that are causing high levels of cholesterol. Another lie that people are told is that
- **[03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiU1B6VNDvQ&t=205s)** — hypertension is really too much salt in the diet. Is it really the salt? Some people that
- **[03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiU1B6VNDvQ&t=210s)** — take salt before bed sleep better because it lowers cortisol. We don't want to start
- **[03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiU1B6VNDvQ&t=215s)** — lowering salt below the threshold. Instead, we want to take the opposing mineral, which is
- **[03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiU1B6VNDvQ&t=221s)** — and increase that. That allows a person to tolerate more sodium. Salt sensitive people
- **[03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiU1B6VNDvQ&t=227s)** — are no longer salt sensitive when they have more potassium. Potassium is great for blood
- **[03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiU1B6VNDvQ&t=232s)** — pressure because it helps soften the arteries. It helps calm this tightness down. All right,
- **[03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiU1B6VNDvQ&t=237s)** — the next one. The doctor says your vitamin D is low. We're going to give you six to eight
- **[04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiU1B6VNDvQ&t=242s)** — hundred IUs, right? Which is a ridiculous number. It's so small it's not going to
- **[04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiU1B6VNDvQ&t=247s)** — dent into your levels. So then you go back to the doctor because you probably found one of
- **[04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiU1B6VNDvQ&t=252s)** — my videos that said you should take a minimum of ten thousand IUs every day as a maintenance
- **[04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiU1B6VNDvQ&t=257s)** — dosage. And they tell you, oh my gosh, that's toxic. That's a lie. If you're out for 40
- **[04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiU1B6VNDvQ&t=263s)** — minutes in summer, you'll get 20,000 IUs of vitamin D3. Have you ever heard being out
- **[04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiU1B6VNDvQ&t=269s)** — in the sun for 20 minutes will give you some toxicity with vitamin D? No, you don't,
- **[04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiU1B6VNDvQ&t=275s)** — because vitamin D from the sun is the most natural way to get all the benefits. What
- **[04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiU1B6VNDvQ&t=279s)** — you have to know is the international units are not a measurement of weight or size. They're
- **[04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiU1B6VNDvQ&t=285s)** — based on a group of people deciding that's what it should be. A 10,000 IUs of vitamin D3 is not
- **[04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiU1B6VNDvQ&t=291s)** — that much. If I'm not mistaken, it's less than a quarter of one milligram of vitamin D3. Now,
- **[04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiU1B6VNDvQ&t=298s)** — this next one is actually kind of comical. You've probably been told by your doctor
- **[05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiU1B6VNDvQ&t=301s)** — you need to give up red meat because red meat causes colon cancer, causes heart disease, right?
- **[05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiU1B6VNDvQ&t=307s)** — Really? Is that actually true? The answer is no. In fact, out of all of the foods that you can
- **[05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiU1B6VNDvQ&t=314s)** — eat that can help heal you, grass-fed red meat is at the top of the list. Why? Because it
- **[05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiU1B6VNDvQ&t=321s)** — provides the most quality protein that your body needs. Number one, it has virtually all of
- **[05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiU1B6VNDvQ&t=327s)** — the B vitamins. Zinc, selenium, copper, iron, all in the form that's easily absorbed. It also has
- **[05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiU1B6VNDvQ&t=334s)** — another thing called creatine which gives you energy and it helps your muscles. It has l-carnitine
- **[05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiU1B6VNDvQ&t=340s)** — which helps deliver fats into the mitochondria for energy. It helps you burn fat. It even
- **[05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiU1B6VNDvQ&t=345s)** — has something called coenzyme Q10 and it's one of the best sources of glutamine for any
- **[05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiU1B6VNDvQ&t=350s)** — type of gut inflammation. But of course, the conventional health care industry says that red
- **[05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiU1B6VNDvQ&t=355s)** — meat is bad and you should avoid it. They kind of lump it in with processed meat saying it's all
- **[06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiU1B6VNDvQ&t=360s)** — the same. Next one is that you have to avoid saturated fats. Well, they blame the saturated
- **[06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiU1B6VNDvQ&t=366s)** — fat when in fact they should be blaming the unsaturated fat, the seed oils which make up 30%
- **[06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiU1B6VNDvQ&t=372s)** — of our diet. Saturated fat by itself is not the culprit. If you take a look at all the junk
- **[06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiU1B6VNDvQ&t=377s)** — food out there, there's not a lot of saturated fat in junk food. I'm talking about the
- **[06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiU1B6VNDvQ&t=384s)** — very inflammatory. This next one is interesting. They're mostly going to tell you to lose weight
- **[06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiU1B6VNDvQ&t=389s)** — because the weight's the cause. No, weight is a symptom. Your high cholesterol is a symptom. You
- **[06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiU1B6VNDvQ&t=395s)** — see, if you actually put weight as the cause of your problem, then you're going to be susceptible
- **[06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiU1B6VNDvQ&t=400s)** — to taking certain measures that might not be healthy to lose weight like ozempic or some
- **[06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiU1B6VNDvQ&t=404s)** — other medication. My question is what is really at the root of your weight problem? It's kind
- **[06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiU1B6VNDvQ&t=409s)** — of circular because they'll say that your weight problem causes your high blood pressure and they
- **[06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiU1B6VNDvQ&t=414s)** — might put you in this boat where you have metabolic syndrome. So you have all these
- **[06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiU1B6VNDvQ&t=418s)** — different syndromes. They're all associated with each other, but no one's really talking about
- **[07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiU1B6VNDvQ&t=423s)** — the root cause. The root cause is really something called insulin resistance where the body is
- **[07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiU1B6VNDvQ&t=428s)** — pumping out a lot of insulin and that insulin is making you fat. It's making the arteries
- **[07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiU1B6VNDvQ&t=432s)** — constrict causing blood pressure to go up and that's caused by eating too many refined
- **[07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiU1B6VNDvQ&t=437s)** — carbs and sugars and seed oils. So my philosophy is always it's not lose weight to get healthy.
- **[07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiU1B6VNDvQ&t=442s)** — It's get healthy first to lose the weight. So focus on the health. The next one relates to
- **[07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiU1B6VNDvQ&t=448s)** — maybe a recommendation you might get from a dietician and this would be you need to be
- **[07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiU1B6VNDvQ&t=452s)** — more plant-based, right? Because plant-based is cleaner. If you take a look at some of the
- **[07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiU1B6VNDvQ&t=458s)** — ingredients on these plant-based artificial fake meats, it's all alter processed food
- **[07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiU1B6VNDvQ&t=465s)** — ingredients. We're talking about soy protein isolates. We're talking about hidden maltodextrin.
- **[07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiU1B6VNDvQ&t=470s)** — It's not really healthy. Grass-fed, organic, free-range, pasture-raised eggs, much healthier.
- **[07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiU1B6VNDvQ&t=475s)** — And this next one is really fascinating because it'll say that hypoglycemia is a complication of
- **[08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiU1B6VNDvQ&t=480s)** — diabetes and so we have to manage it because it's one of the dangers of having diabetes is
- **[08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiU1B6VNDvQ&t=485s)** — to have hypoglycemia. Well, what is hypoglycemia? Low blood sugar. What is diabetes? High blood
- **[08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiU1B6VNDvQ&t=490s)** — sugar. So if diabetes is high blood sugar, shouldn't we lower the glucose and sugar
- **[08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiU1B6VNDvQ&t=496s)** — and carbohydrates? Wouldn't that be the best thing to do? Well, guess what? Doctors don't
- **[08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiU1B6VNDvQ&t=502s)** — really tell you to do that. Instead, they tell you to keep some glucose pills in your
- **[08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiU1B6VNDvQ&t=507s)** — pocket or candy in case your blood sugars go too low because the medication you're taking
- **[08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiU1B6VNDvQ&t=513s)** — is lowering your blood glucose. We don't want it to go too low. That's completely illogical.
- **[08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiU1B6VNDvQ&t=518s)** — Why doesn't the doctor just tell you to lower the medication and take less candy? Because it's
- **[08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiU1B6VNDvQ&t=524s)** — the carbohydrates that spike the insulin that drops the blood glucose. So anyone who has
- **[08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiU1B6VNDvQ&t=530s)** — hypoglycemia or low blood sugar really has too much insulin. And thus the problem with
- **[08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiU1B6VNDvQ&t=535s)** — the medical industry. There hasn't been any deep dive in evaluation into nutrients and
- **[09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiU1B6VNDvQ&t=540s)** — what they do and how they can benefit someone. But what I will say is I have done a deep dive
- **[09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiU1B6VNDvQ&t=546s)** — in many different aspects on nutrition. If you want more information on that,

- **[00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeQffcNyo2w&t=0s)** — Did you realize that it's extremely difficult to reverse a magnesium deficiency?
- **[00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeQffcNyo2w&t=6s)** — But I'm going to tell you how to do it in this video.
- **[00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeQffcNyo2w&t=8s)** — So my question is, how long does it take to solve a problem that you're treating with the wrong solution?
- **[00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeQffcNyo2w&t=15s)** — And the answer is, you'll never solve the problem if you use the wrong solution.
- **[00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeQffcNyo2w&t=19s)** — Most people don't realize how common a magnesium deficiency is.
- **[00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeQffcNyo2w&t=23s)** — There's been some reports that up to 88% of the general public are low in magnesium.
- **[00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeQffcNyo2w&t=30s)** — And what's even more shocking than that is that it's really hard to test for a magnesium deficiency.
- **[00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeQffcNyo2w&t=37s)** — There's no gold standard. You can do a questionnaire.
- **[00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeQffcNyo2w&t=40s)** — And there's another test that you can actually extract some tissue from the inside of your mouth and send it to the lab.
- **[00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeQffcNyo2w&t=46s)** — But the problem with that test, and the reason I'm not recommending it, is because I can't get a hold of the lab
- **[00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeQffcNyo2w&t=51s)** — that does this very specific special eye test. So I'm not going to put that in the link because they're not going to call you back.
- **[00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeQffcNyo2w&t=58s)** — So in this little chart, you can see that 60% of all your magnesium is in your bones.
- **[01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeQffcNyo2w&t=65s)** — 39% is in your soft tissues, like your muscles.
- **[01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeQffcNyo2w&t=68s)** — But only 1% of all the magnesium in your body is in your blood.
- **[01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeQffcNyo2w&t=72s)** — So this is why doing a blood test is not going to give you a lot of information unless you're very, very, very, very, very severe.
- **[01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeQffcNyo2w&t=79s)** — Because even if you're deficient in the blood, guess what's going to happen? You're going to borrow some of it from the bone or the soft tissues.
- **[01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeQffcNyo2w&t=87s)** — And in the bone and the soft tissues, most of that is not outside the cell. It's inside your cells. It's called intracellular calcium.
- **[01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeQffcNyo2w&t=94s)** — And so one of the principles that I use in health is I use a principle out of this book called The Technology of War by Sun Tzu.
- **[01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeQffcNyo2w&t=104s)** — Now, of course, this book is about fighting wars, but you can apply it to anything.
- **[01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeQffcNyo2w&t=108s)** — And so Sun Tzu talks about cross referencing data to see if a situation or a problem exists where you can cross reference symptoms that are related to a magnesium deficiency.
- **[02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeQffcNyo2w&t=122s)** — You can also look at your foods to see how much magnesium is coming from your foods or not.
- **[02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeQffcNyo2w&t=127s)** — If you have inflammation in your gut, if you're diabetic, if you have insulin resistance, if you consume a lot of sugar.
- **[02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeQffcNyo2w&t=136s)** — Also, if you take a lot of vitamin D, the requirement for magnesium goes up.
- **[02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeQffcNyo2w&t=141s)** — So if you're not taking magnesium with vitamin D, you can actually end up having lower amounts of magnesium because your body is using more of that magnesium for vitamin D absorption.
- **[02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeQffcNyo2w&t=151s)** — And also, if you're on medications, let's say you're on a PPI, an antacid, or you're taking an antibiotic, or you're on a diuretic.
- **[02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeQffcNyo2w&t=160s)** — All these factors when cross reference can kind of indicate you might have a magnesium deficiency.
- **[02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeQffcNyo2w&t=167s)** — But now let's cross reference this with a potential indicators or symptoms you might have if you're low on magnesium.
- **[02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeQffcNyo2w&t=174s)** — Tetany. Let's say you have a little twitch underneath your left eye. Are your muscles relaxed or are they tight?
- **[02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeQffcNyo2w&t=179s)** — Do you have insomnia? Do you have a lot of anxiety? Do you have fatigue?
- **[03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeQffcNyo2w&t=184s)** — Did you realize that you need magnesium just to make ATP, the energy currency of your body?
- **[03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeQffcNyo2w&t=190s)** — Also, a magnesium deficiency can create, you know, things like nystigmas, which is like when your eyes kind of go back and forth like that.
- **[03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeQffcNyo2w&t=197s)** — And migraines and kidney stones and especially something called pathogenic calcification. What is that?
- **[03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeQffcNyo2w&t=206s)** — That is calcification. That's calcium buildup in places that you shouldn't have it.
- **[03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeQffcNyo2w&t=210s)** — So I'm just going to run down the list of foods that are fairly high in magnesium compared to other foods.
- **[03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeQffcNyo2w&t=216s)** — OK, and we're going to talk about the quantity of 100 grams. OK, that's three and a half ounces.
- **[03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeQffcNyo2w&t=220s)** — So at the top of the list, you have sea kelp. Three and a half ounces of sea kelp is equivalent to 760 milligrams.
- **[03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeQffcNyo2w&t=226s)** — Now, I'd like to see you eat three and a half ounces of sea kelp. It's probably not going to happen.
- **[03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeQffcNyo2w&t=232s)** — OK, what about almonds? That would give you about 490 milligrams. Nutritional yeast is 231 milligrams.
- **[03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeQffcNyo2w&t=238s)** — Pecans, 142 milligrams. Leafy greens, roughly about 100 milligrams of magnesium. Dark chocolate is about 165 milligrams.
- **[04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeQffcNyo2w&t=250s)** — Pumpkin seeds are 265 milligrams of magnesium. But magnesium is also in meats and fish, but not as much as you might think.
- **[04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeQffcNyo2w&t=259s)** — So 100 grams or three and a half ounces of meat or fish, you're going to get between 25 to 35 milligrams of magnesium.
- **[04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeQffcNyo2w&t=267s)** — And even if we look at the requirements of magnesium, it's called the RDAs, that usually is between 300 and 420 milligrams per day on average.
- **[04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeQffcNyo2w&t=279s)** — But the average person only consumes 215 milligrams of magnesium per day.
- **[04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeQffcNyo2w&t=286s)** — People aren't getting enough from the diet, not to mention the foods nowadays are grown in soil that has lower amounts of minerals, especially magnesium.
- **[04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeQffcNyo2w&t=293s)** — And it's really two situations or actually three situations. Number one, how do we get enough magnesium from the diet? Do we have to supplement?
- **[05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeQffcNyo2w&t=302s)** — And three, how long does it take to really satisfy your deficiency?
- **[05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeQffcNyo2w&t=306s)** — Oh, and by the way, all the information I'm talking about is in this book right here called The Miraculous Cure for and Prevention of All Diseases.
- **[05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeQffcNyo2w&t=314s)** — What Doctors Never Learned. I'll put this link down below. It's a really fascinating book based on a lot of different things related to magnesium and vitamin D.
- **[05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeQffcNyo2w&t=322s)** — But all the data that I'm sharing today is based in that book. So if you're deficient, you're going to have to not only beef up, no pun intended, your magnesium foods,
- **[05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeQffcNyo2w&t=333s)** — but you're also going to have to supplement as well. And the type of magnesium I would recommend is magnesium glycinate, which actually helps, you know, stress, sleeping, etc.
- **[05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeQffcNyo2w&t=344s)** — And the amount of supplement I would recommend would be about 800 milligrams every single day. So usually they come in like 400 ish, maybe 300 milligrams per tablet.
- **[05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeQffcNyo2w&t=357s)** — Take a couple of those every day. But here's the thing. How long is it actually going to take to really fix a true deficiency?
- **[06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeQffcNyo2w&t=365s)** — It could take up to a year or more to fix a chronic magnesium deficiency. You have to realize that when you take magnesium from foods or a supplement, it doesn't just go in storage.
- **[06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeQffcNyo2w&t=378s)** — A good majority of it will be washed out through the kidneys. But you might find your symptoms go away within weeks or months, but I wouldn't stop there.
- **[06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeQffcNyo2w&t=387s)** — If I would increase the amount over a longer period of time, then maybe after about a year of taking supplements, then maybe then you just maintain it with your diet.
- **[06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeQffcNyo2w&t=398s)** — But of course, make sure that you calculate how much magnesium is going into the body and then make sure at least it's like 400 milligrams per day.
- **[06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeQffcNyo2w&t=407s)** — Now I have a little more information on the type of magnesium that might work for you. And for that information, I put that in this video right here. Check it out.

- **[00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_oadHYkoV0&t=0s)** — There is definitely a myth that calcium is the main mineral that you need for osteoporosis to strengthen your bones.
- **[00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_oadHYkoV0&t=9s)** — And unfortunately, so many menopausal women are just downing like over a thousand milligrams of calcium.
- **[00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_oadHYkoV0&t=17s)** — Of course, it's in the wrong form. It's an elemental form called calcium carbonate, which is basically limestone.
- **[00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_oadHYkoV0&t=23s)** — You'd be better off chewing on the cement out there.
- **[00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_oadHYkoV0&t=24s)** — But the point is that somehow we have in our minds that if we take this calcium, we'll prevent osteoporosis.
- **[00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_oadHYkoV0&t=32s)** — And it's absolutely not true. Did you realize that the majority of bone, what makes up bone, I'm talking about over 70 percent of it, is not calcium.
- **[00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_oadHYkoV0&t=42s)** — It is collagen, which is protein. And there is calcium in bone for sure. There's a good amount.
- **[00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_oadHYkoV0&t=50s)** — But that calcium is tied up with phosphorus. But you don't hear people saying, well, you need to have more phosphorus for bone health.
- **[00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_oadHYkoV0&t=58s)** — And they don't definitely say you need more collagen for bone health. It's mainly calcium.
- **[01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_oadHYkoV0&t=64s)** — In some pretty hardcore research and studies, I'm going to put the links down below, people that take calcium do not prevent fractures.
- **[01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_oadHYkoV0&t=73s)** — There is strong evidence that if you take calcium in supplement forms, this can increase your risk of cardiovascular accidents.
- **[01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_oadHYkoV0&t=82s)** — So if calcium is not the main mineral that builds bone to prevent osteoporosis, what is?
- **[01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_oadHYkoV0&t=90s)** — Well, it's a combination of many things. Since bone is made out of protein and that protein is activated by various minerals and trace minerals like cobalt, manganese,
- **[01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_oadHYkoV0&t=103s)** — magnesium and phosphorus and many other minerals, making sure you have all of the trace minerals in the diet is going to help you.
- **[01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_oadHYkoV0&t=111s)** — You also need vitamins. Vitamins help transport these minerals. And the most important vitamin for bone health is vitamin D and vitamin K2.
- **[02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_oadHYkoV0&t=122s)** — They both work together by making calcium available to make bone, as well as to help deliver the calcium that's in the blood from the absorption of the intestine directly to the bone.
- **[02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_oadHYkoV0&t=135s)** — That's vitamin K2. So you need vitamin D3 and K2 to build bone. Other factors relate to hormones.
- **[02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_oadHYkoV0&t=143s)** — If you're deficient in estrogen, for example, that can lead to osteoporosis or if you have too much cortisol, really to build bone, you just need to focus on creating a healthy body because it's not just one thing.
- **[02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_oadHYkoV0&t=158s)** — It's the whole package. People that have bone loss have an underlying metabolic problem that does not just focus on one loss of one mineral.
- **[02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_oadHYkoV0&t=168s)** — It's not that you're just losing calcium. And that's why you have osteoporosis. That is just a total myth.
- **[02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_oadHYkoV0&t=175s)** — Now the question is, since we're talking about calcium, what would be the best source of calcium to support one part of this puzzle to strengthen your bone?
- **[03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_oadHYkoV0&t=185s)** — Should you do more plant base? Should you do more dairy? The bioavailability of calcium in dairy is definitely better than plants.
- **[03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_oadHYkoV0&t=195s)** — One reason is because some plants like spinach, for example, and Swiss chard has a very potent inhibitor of calcium called oxalates.
- **[03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_oadHYkoV0&t=207s)** — And so oxalates block the absorption of calcium. Beans are high in oxalates. Almond are high in oxalates.
- **[03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_oadHYkoV0&t=213s)** — Eggplant and beets. Did I mention beets are high in oxalates? So a combination of plants and dairy, I think, would be good to help support calcium. But as far as dairy goes,
- **[03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_oadHYkoV0&t=224s)** — raw milk cheese is a good source of bioavailable calcium. Now it's more difficult to find raw milk cheese in the US. If I'm correct, I think you have to buy this cheese that's over 60 days.
- **[03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_oadHYkoV0&t=238s)** — And there's certain other regulations. But in Europe, you can find raw cheese all over the place. But this raw cheese supports the calcium complex. It supports the collagen,
- **[04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_oadHYkoV0&t=250s)** — protein, and other minerals and probiotics as well. And since we're on the topic of calcium,
- **[04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_oadHYkoV0&t=257s)** — what are some of the problems when you become deficient in calcium?
- **[04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_oadHYkoV0&t=262s)** — Well, I'm going to go through them. But I do want to mention if you get your calcium tested in the blood, your serum calcium,
- **[04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_oadHYkoV0&t=268s)** — that doesn't necessarily tell you about the free available calcium. Serum calcium could
- **[04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_oadHYkoV0&t=277s)** — be made up of the protein bound calcium that's unavailable and not the ionized calcium that is active in your body. So if you really want to know
- **[04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_oadHYkoV0&t=288s)** — if you have enough calcium that's available, you want to get a test that measures the
- **[04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_oadHYkoV0&t=293s)** — ionized calcium. That will give you a lot more information. So if you're deficient in calcium, you can end up with muscle spasms.
- **[05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_oadHYkoV0&t=303s)** — You can end up with tetany, which is a little twitching. Sometimes it's on top of the left eyelid right here, the arm. It could be anywhere in the body. And by the way, tetany can also be caused from a lack of magnesium, from a lack of potassium.
- **[05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_oadHYkoV0&t=322s)** — Because your body is too alkaline and one cause of alkalinity is low potassium and another cause is hyperventilation that can change your pH.
- **[05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_oadHYkoV0&t=333s)** — And so if you can imagine if someone has these panic attacks and they're hyperventilating and sometimes they get these little twitches.
- **[05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_oadHYkoV0&t=342s)** — Well, that's why your heart rate can go up or down if you're deficient in calcium. Another deficiency of low calcium is numbness around your mouth.
- **[05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_oadHYkoV0&t=351s)** — Or numbness and tingling, pins and needles in your fingertips, as well as in your feet. You can also have a spasm in your larynx. Okay, that comes from low calcium. That's going to show up in like hoarseness or kind of a rough
- **[06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_oadHYkoV0&t=368s)** — sounding vocal cords or it can even feel like you have this lump in the throat. Calcium is also needed for many different things too. It's a good thing.
- **[06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_oadHYkoV0&t=375s)** — Just not needed in large amounts. I recommend to get it from the food mostly. But if you get it from a supplement, make sure it's on the lower amounts because of that darn
- **[06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_oadHYkoV0&t=386s)** — problem or potential risk of increasing your risk of getting heart attacks. And I'm not sure if that has only to do with the type of calcium people take like calcium carbonate. But calcium actually does provide
- **[06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_oadHYkoV0&t=398s)** — some good benefits to prevent against intestinal cancers as well. When you're low in calcium, okay, there's a message sent to a gland that surrounds your thyroid. It's called the parathyroid.
- **[06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_oadHYkoV0&t=411s)** — And you have four little glands around this thyroid. And low calcium activates the parathyroid to increase
- **[07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_oadHYkoV0&t=421s)** — vitamin D, okay, to thereby increase more calcium absorption in the intestine, as well as giving other signals to the bone to release calcium. So we can actually
- **[07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_oadHYkoV0&t=433s)** — use calcium from the bone. The bone is kind of a reservoir of calcium. And one point to mention about vitamin D, if you're deficient of vitamin D, which most people are,
- **[07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_oadHYkoV0&t=442s)** — you're going to have a hard time raising the calcium up to level it needs to be from the intestine to the blood.
- **[07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_oadHYkoV0&t=450s)** — So if you have vitamin D, you can increase this calcium by a factor of 20x. Okay. But if you don't have that vitamin D, you're going to have a problem with calcium. Another thing that's needed with this absorption of calcium is magnesium,
- **[07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_oadHYkoV0&t=464s)** — which is another factor. A lot of people are deficient in magnesium. So if you don't have enough magnesium, you're not going to be able to have the levels of calcium that you need.
- **[07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_oadHYkoV0&t=476s)** — Other factors are involved in calcium as well. For example, if you consume an excessive amount of protein, that can create
- **[08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_oadHYkoV0&t=486s)** — some loss of calcium. But again, if you're taking enough calcium in, it's not anything to be worried about. But I just want to point it out that there are things that
- **[08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_oadHYkoV0&t=496s)** — tend to cause a loss of calcium. And that would be excessive amount of protein.
- **[08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_oadHYkoV0&t=502s)** — That would be excessive amount of sodium. Okay. And I'm not telling you to cut down your sodium. I'm just kind of giving you the relationship between these two
- **[08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_oadHYkoV0&t=511s)** — Another thing is if you drink a lot of coffee or caffeine in excessive amounts can deplete your calcium. Also, if you are exposed to a lot of phosphorus, you can lose calcium from the bone.
- **[08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_oadHYkoV0&t=524s)** — Now, where do you get phosphorus from? Well, it's actually in animal meats, but it's also in soft drinks.
- **[08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_oadHYkoV0&t=531s)** — Because people that are drinking all these sodas all day long, boy, they're just depleting the calcium left and right. Also, if you have refined sugar,
- **[09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_oadHYkoV0&t=540s)** — that can also deplete your calcium levels. Anyway, I wanted to bring up your awareness on this relationship between calcium and your bones.
- **[09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_oadHYkoV0&t=548s)** — And make sure you had all the information. And this is another reason why you should just eat healthy to create strong bones. Since we're on this topic of calcium, and I did mention
- **[09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_oadHYkoV0&t=558s)** — this thing called oxalates. You should definitely check out my video on oxalates if you haven't already seen it. And I'll put it up right here.

- **[00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH9llWp0ixs&t=0s)** — Okay, welcome back. We are going to talk first about the gallbladder. It is a little sack underneath the rib cage on the right side.
- **[00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH9llWp0ixs&t=6s)** — It actually stores something called bile. And it concentrates bile. And then when you eat fats, it squeezes out the bile and it helps you dissolve the fat
- **[00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH9llWp0ixs&t=15s)** — in extracting vitamin A, D, E, and K. These are vitamins called fat soluble vitamins. Vitamin A is for the eyes and the skin. Vitamin D is for the bones.
- **[00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH9llWp0ixs&t=26s)** — Vitamin E is for the hormones. Vitamin K is for clotting. And also vitamin K2 is for removing calcium out of the arteries in the joints.
- **[00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH9llWp0ixs&t=35s)** — So these are really, really important. So here you are having all sorts of vitamin A deficiencies, vitamin D, vitamin E, vitamin K deficiencies.
- **[00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH9llWp0ixs&t=42s)** — Well, it could be that you just don't have a gallbladder or enough bile like your gallbladder is congested. So that alone could cause these deficiencies.
- **[00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH9llWp0ixs&t=53s)** — Especially if you are taking these vitamins and noticing symptoms. So let's just say, for example, you have macular degeneration, okay?
- **[01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH9llWp0ixs&t=61s)** — Yet you're consuming kale with all these amazing fat soluble vitamin vital nutrients. And it's not actually fixing the macula.
- **[01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH9llWp0ixs&t=72s)** — Or let's say you're consuming vitamin A and your vision, you still can't see it at night. Okay? But you're taking this.
- **[01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH9llWp0ixs&t=79s)** — So you're taking this. It could be that you just don't have enough bile. So you could take bile salts, purified bile salts.
- **[01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH9llWp0ixs&t=87s)** — It's in something called gallbladder formula. And you take that at the same time of consuming vitamin A or D or E or K.
- **[01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH9llWp0ixs&t=97s)** — So you're taking the bile salts with this vitamin. It drives in like a rocket ship. It just goes right into the body.
- **[01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH9llWp0ixs&t=103s)** — So anytime you want to enhance a vitamin, especially a fat soluble vitamin, and you take bile salts, you can do it very easily.
- **[01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH9llWp0ixs&t=113s)** — So some people have these skin issues where it's a classic vitamin A deficiency, yet vitamin A isn't enough because they need a little booster.
- **[02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH9llWp0ixs&t=122s)** — So this actually just helps drive in that nutrient into the cell. So if I developed something called macular degeneration,
- **[02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH9llWp0ixs&t=128s)** — I would not just consume the kale with high levels of lutein, which actually help the macula, but I would add some bile salt at the same time
- **[02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH9llWp0ixs&t=137s)** — and really drive that right into the eye so I can actually start to improve that situation.
- **[02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH9llWp0ixs&t=143s)** — So stomach acids are really important in the absorption of minerals, trace minerals, and proteins.
- **[02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH9llWp0ixs&t=150s)** — So if you're deficient in any of the trace minerals and minerals that you're taking them, you're not seeing any difference,
- **[02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH9llWp0ixs&t=156s)** — well, start adding some alpacite vinegar, add some betaine hydrochloride. Those are two things that acidify the stomach,
- **[02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH9llWp0ixs&t=164s)** — and it can really help you absorb these minerals, especially if you're trying to fix your weak nails, hair loss, that type of thing.
- **[02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH9llWp0ixs&t=173s)** — But minerals have a lot of different functions that go from building proteins, to also metabolism, to energy, to hydration,
- **[03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH9llWp0ixs&t=182s)** — and making sure that your heart is in rhythm, many, many different things, okay?
- **[03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH9llWp0ixs&t=186s)** — And then we have insulin resistance. This is a pre-diabetic situation. When you have insulin resistance, you can't absorb certain minerals and vitamins.
- **[03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH9llWp0ixs&t=195s)** — You can't absorb potassium, for example, magnesium, vitamin D. It's hard to absorb B vitamins.
- **[03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH9llWp0ixs&t=203s)** — So here you are, here consuming everything, you're taking your vitamins, but it's not working because you're pre-diabetic or you're diabetic.
- **[03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH9llWp0ixs&t=211s)** — That's why. So you have to fix this right here to start absorbing it.
- **[03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH9llWp0ixs&t=216s)** — What's really interesting is that once you start taking more of these vitamins that can't go in, like potassium, magnesium, vitamin D, B vitamins,
- **[03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH9llWp0ixs&t=226s)** — well guess what? That actually improves insulin resistance. And then improving insulin resistance helps the absorption of those nutrients.
- **[03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH9llWp0ixs&t=234s)** — So that's the saving grace with that. And then we have low-friendly bacteria in the gut.
- **[03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH9llWp0ixs&t=239s)** — If your gut doesn't have enough of the right bacteria, you'll start showing deficiencies of B vitamins.
- **[04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH9llWp0ixs&t=245s)** — So it shows up in the skin as rashes, psoriasis, itching, all sorts of skin issues.
- **[04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH9llWp0ixs&t=252s)** — So you want to start to consume things with a lot of probiotics. One of the best things, which is even better than a lot of probiotics, is sauerkraut.
- **[04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH9llWp0ixs&t=261s)** — Sauerkraut is like consuming 10 times the amount of probiotics.
- **[04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH9llWp0ixs&t=266s)** — So if you have like a cupful a day and just consume that, you'll actually get enough of the good bacteria that you need.
- **[04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH9llWp0ixs&t=273s)** — So in this last video, I'm going to show you a summary of everything. I'll see you then.

- **[00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MepoaLLacXg&t=0s)** — Let's talk about the benefits of raw versus cooked vegetables. Is it better to consume your
- **[00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MepoaLLacXg&t=5s)** — vegetables cooked or raw? Now, to understand that question, we have to first understand what's in a
- **[00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MepoaLLacXg&t=12s)** — vegetable. Okay, how does it benefit us? You have like folate, vitamin C, then you have beta
- **[00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MepoaLLacXg&t=18s)** — carotene, which is like a precursor to vitamin A, which doesn't really add up to a lot of active
- **[00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MepoaLLacXg&t=25s)** — retinol. So if you compare plant-based vitamins versus animal-based vitamins,
- **[00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MepoaLLacXg&t=30s)** — the animal-based vitamins are much more bioavailable. Like the iron in spinach versus
- **[00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MepoaLLacXg&t=36s)** — the iron in red meat. Huge difference as far as how your body can assimilate it. So if you do
- **[00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MepoaLLacXg&t=42s)** — this comparison, most of the vitamins in animal products are way more bioavailable. But when we
- **[00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MepoaLLacXg&t=51s)** — look at plant-based products, you have vitamin C, folate, beta carotene. Those are better sources
- **[00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MepoaLLacXg&t=54s)** — in plants. You also have vitamin E in plants. So we have vitamins and then we have minerals,
- **[01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MepoaLLacXg&t=63s)** — especially potassium, magnesium. Magnesium is at the heart of the chlorophyll molecule,
- **[01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MepoaLLacXg&t=69s)** — and that's the green stuff in the plant. So anything green that you eat has a good amount of
- **[01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MepoaLLacXg&t=75s)** — But we also need that potassium. There's other minerals as well in plants. You have trace
- **[01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MepoaLLacXg&t=81s)** — minerals and things like that. But it really depends on what that plant is grown on. For
- **[01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MepoaLLacXg&t=87s)** — example, if you're eating plants that are grown in hydroponic, in just like a water
- **[01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MepoaLLacXg&t=92s)** — solution, they only really put 15 minerals in that solution. Well, there's a lot more than
- **[01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MepoaLLacXg&t=99s)** — 15 minerals in the soil. But then again, if you're growing your plants on soil that has
- **[01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MepoaLLacXg&t=103s)** — no biology or microbes, chances are they're going to be pretty low in minerals. What about
- **[01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MepoaLLacXg&t=110s)** — amino acids like proteins? There's not a lot of protein or amino acids in these plants. What
- **[01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MepoaLLacXg&t=116s)** — about fat? There's not a lot of fat in these plants. What about fiber? There is a lot of
- **[02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MepoaLLacXg&t=121s)** — fiber in vegetables and this is what we can feed our microbes. And what's interesting about
- **[02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MepoaLLacXg&t=127s)** — is that herbivores, animals that consume plants, have more than double the strains of microbes
- **[02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MepoaLLacXg&t=134s)** — versus the carnivore animals. They have less than half of the quantity of microbes.
- **[02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MepoaLLacXg&t=143s)** — So basically, if you eat vegetables and you're eating a wider range of vegetables,
- **[02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MepoaLLacXg&t=147s)** — which with different fibers, compared to someone who doesn't consume any vegetables,
- **[02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MepoaLLacXg&t=152s)** — you're going to have more diverse microbiome. And what those microbiome do is they make
- **[02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MepoaLLacXg&t=160s)** — all sorts of things for you. They make vitamins. They make biotin. They make other
- **[02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MepoaLLacXg&t=165s)** — B vitamins. They make vitamin K. They actually help you make bile. They help you make B12
- **[02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MepoaLLacXg&t=173s)** — available. But here's something that you definitely get that you normally don't get from
- **[02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MepoaLLacXg&t=177s)** — foods. And that would be phytonutrients. So we're talking about antioxidants,
- **[03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MepoaLLacXg&t=184s)** — plant-based chemicals that have a range of properties from anti-inflammatory to chemicals
- **[03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MepoaLLacXg&t=191s)** — that help fight cancer. And these phytochemicals are in the thousands and it's like a mini
- **[03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MepoaLLacXg&t=196s)** — natural drugstore because they create all sorts of very, very cool effects. A common one would
- **[03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MepoaLLacXg&t=202s)** — be like lutein or xanthin, which is essential for being able to see in the dark at night
- **[03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MepoaLLacXg&t=211s)** — and prevent macular degeneration. And these phytonutrients also defend against the
- **[03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MepoaLLacXg&t=216s)** — complications of chronic disease. Also, they go into your skin and protect you against
- **[03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MepoaLLacXg&t=222s)** — UV radiation to prevent skin cancer. And this is something you probably have never heard of
- **[03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MepoaLLacXg&t=227s)** — Plants contain a very good amount of probiotics. That's friendly bacteria,
- **[03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MepoaLLacXg&t=236s)** — microbes that are within the plant. And there's a lot. Like in one cup of a vegetable,
- **[04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MepoaLLacXg&t=244s)** — you're looking at a hundred million microbes. So when you're consuming vegetables, you're
- **[04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MepoaLLacXg&t=249s)** — getting a lot of probiotics. If they're grown on soil versus something that doesn't have a
- **[04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MepoaLLacXg&t=257s)** — kind of a medium that enhances the microbiome. But the way that the plant gets the microbes
- **[04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MepoaLLacXg&t=263s)** — is from the soil. So the roots of the plant actually eat microbes as their primary nutrient
- **[04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MepoaLLacXg&t=269s)** — source and they're extracting minerals from it. And then they actually kind of let the
- **[04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MepoaLLacXg&t=273s)** — microbe go out of the root. But some actually travel up into the plant. And those are the
- **[04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MepoaLLacXg&t=277s)** — ones that I'm talking about. You probably never looked at these raw vegetables as a
- **[04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MepoaLLacXg&t=286s)** — discovered that plants have these microbes. Before that, they thought they were sterile,
- **[04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MepoaLLacXg&t=292s)** — but they're not. Microbes get destroyed with heat. Okay. So the more you cook the vegetable,
- **[05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MepoaLLacXg&t=300s)** — the less effect you're going to have as a probiotic. Now a couple things you need to know
- **[05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MepoaLLacXg&t=305s)** — about this. An organic vegetable versus conventional, you're going to get about 40%
- **[05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MepoaLLacXg&t=310s)** — more also diversity too. So yes, organic is better. And the microbes in the plant
- **[05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MepoaLLacXg&t=317s)** — create substantial change in your own gut microbiome. And if you're concerned about
- **[05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MepoaLLacXg&t=325s)** — these microbes surviving the stomach, apparently they do survive in large quantities,
- **[05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MepoaLLacXg&t=330s)** — probably being protected with the little encapsulated fiber that they kind of are in.
- **[05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MepoaLLacXg&t=336s)** — Then they kind of get released lower in the digestive tract when your microbiome
- **[05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MepoaLLacXg&t=342s)** — eats that fiber and breaks them up. Now that being said, there's a couple little things you
- **[05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MepoaLLacXg&t=348s)** — need to know. If you are immune compromised, if you have inflammation in your gut, if you have
- **[05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MepoaLLacXg&t=356s)** — celiac, diverticulitis, any type of inflammatory condition in your gut, you're
- **[06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MepoaLLacXg&t=361s)** — probably not going to tolerate some of the microbes that are in the vegetable because those
- **[06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MepoaLLacXg&t=365s)** — microbes can act to stimulate your immune system. They can act like a natural vaccine.
- **[06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MepoaLLacXg&t=371s)** — And if here you are having inflammation or leaky gut, these microbes and other
- **[06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MepoaLLacXg&t=375s)** — phytonutrients and the fiber itself can react and create more inflammation.
- **[06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MepoaLLacXg&t=381s)** — This is why if you consume vegetables and you feel worse, or you get extreme bloating,
- **[06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MepoaLLacXg&t=388s)** — or you have any type of major inflammatory condition in your gut,
- **[06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MepoaLLacXg&t=392s)** — you're probably going to do better on the carnivore for a while. So not everyone can tolerate
- **[06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MepoaLLacXg&t=399s)** — these plants. But I will say that things like salmonella, E. coli, those incidents are very
- **[06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MepoaLLacXg&t=407s)** — rare. They're not very common. And if a plant is sick or grown on poor soils that are
- **[06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MepoaLLacXg&t=416s)** — with low immune system, because if the soil has an immune system and so does a plant,
- **[07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MepoaLLacXg&t=420s)** — then they're more likely to get these pathogens. But typically these microbes and plants
- **[07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MepoaLLacXg&t=425s)** — are pretty friendly. There might be a small group of them that are unfriendly or pathogenic.
- **[07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MepoaLLacXg&t=431s)** — But the other microbes and the phytonutrients, one of their purposes is to help suppress these
- **[07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MepoaLLacXg&t=438s)** — pathogens and keep that plant's immune system strong. Another side note that's interesting is
- **[07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MepoaLLacXg&t=444s)** — that fermented vegetables, as far as looking at the microbes in those fermented vegetables,
- **[07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MepoaLLacXg&t=449s)** — like sauerkraut, kefir, things like that, those microbes have a very similar profile to your own
- **[07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MepoaLLacXg&t=457s)** — gut microbiome. Which means that the worse off your digestion is, the more you're going to
- **[07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MepoaLLacXg&t=464s)** — benefit from maybe fermented vegetables or no vegetables at all, or even more cooked
- **[07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MepoaLLacXg&t=471s)** — vegetables because you're breaking down things, making them easier to absorb and digest. What
- **[07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MepoaLLacXg&t=477s)** — about the effect of heat on vitamins? Well, you are going to lower vitamin C and you are
- **[08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MepoaLLacXg&t=484s)** — going to destroy a lot of the vitamins and enzymes. What about minerals? Well, it depends.
- **[08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MepoaLLacXg&t=488s)** — If you are steaming them versus boiling them, a lot of times when you boil vegetables and you
- **[08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MepoaLLacXg&t=494s)** — see all the green in the solution, you're basically leaching out chlorophyll and you're
- **[08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MepoaLLacXg&t=502s)** — minerals. But if you steam or slightly steam or saute your vegetables, you're not going to lose
- **[08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MepoaLLacXg&t=509s)** — the mineral part. You might lose some of the vitamins depending on the duration and the heat
- **[08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MepoaLLacXg&t=516s)** — and the temperature. When we talk about phytonutrients, there's some interesting data
- **[08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MepoaLLacXg&t=520s)** — on that. It shows that heat, especially when you steam things or saute things, you actually
- **[08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MepoaLLacXg&t=528s)** — increase the phytonutrient content. You make some of those phytonutrients more available.
- **[08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MepoaLLacXg&t=535s)** — Now, I looked at the data and I didn't see that it was consistent. There's a lot of mixed
- **[09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MepoaLLacXg&t=541s)** — studies on this and it didn't look like there was a massive increase. There might have been
- **[09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MepoaLLacXg&t=547s)** — an increase in phytonutrients by 18 percent and yet other ones showed a decrease by 6 percent.
- **[09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MepoaLLacXg&t=553s)** — It's a bit inconsistent because there are so many different phytonutrients and so many other
- **[09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MepoaLLacXg&t=557s)** — variables. It's hard to tell. But the point is that cooking your vegetables might enhance the
- **[09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MepoaLLacXg&t=563s)** — phytonutrients by a certain amount. But I don't think that is so significant that you have to
- **[09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MepoaLLacXg&t=569s)** — really put a lot of attention on it. Now, what does heat do for the microbes in the plant?
- **[09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MepoaLLacXg&t=575s)** — Well, the heat kills them. So based on that information, it's probably going to be
- **[09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MepoaLLacXg&t=582s)** — to consume a good portion of your vegetables raw. But of course, certain things I think you
- **[09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MepoaLLacXg&t=589s)** — should cook like Brussels sprouts, maybe broccoli, maybe cauliflower. But as far as your salads go,
- **[09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MepoaLLacXg&t=597s)** — and let's say bell peppers and tomatoes and other vegetables, I would keep those raw.
- **[10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MepoaLLacXg&t=603s)** — Apparently, the worst thing you can do to vegetables as far as nutrients go is
- **[10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MepoaLLacXg&t=607s)** — Now, if you're eating some fried vegetables, that's fine. But just don't think you're getting
- **[10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MepoaLLacXg&t=613s)** — a lot of nutrients from the fried vegetables or when you do pressure cooking, things like that.
- **[10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MepoaLLacXg&t=619s)** — Anyway, I wanted to give you some backgrounds on whether you should consume raw versus cooked
- **[10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MepoaLLacXg&t=623s)** — vegetables and some different viewpoints that you probably haven't heard before. Now, if you
- **[10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MepoaLLacXg&t=628s)** — have not seen my video on sauerkraut, I think you should check it out. It's actually very,
- **[10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MepoaLLacXg&t=632s)** — very good. And I put it up right here.

- **[00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8OSlBn6qRqs&t=0s)** — Today, I'm going to do an FAQ on this amazing new product that I want to share with you.
- **[00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8OSlBn6qRqs&t=5s)** — It's called Scalp and Hair Follicule Serum. Okay? Now, what's in here? Now, the reason why I came
- **[00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8OSlBn6qRqs&t=12s)** — up with this product is that I wanted a really high quality blend of oils and other ingredients
- **[00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8OSlBn6qRqs&t=22s)** — that can penetrate the scalp. Now, the scalp is a fat layer, and unless something is fat soluble,
- **[00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8OSlBn6qRqs&t=30s)** — it won't penetrate the scalp. And just like the garden, when you're spraying things like a foliar
- **[00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8OSlBn6qRqs&t=35s)** — spray and you're putting nutrients right into the leaf, the same thing can happen with your scalp.
- **[00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8OSlBn6qRqs&t=40s)** — These oils can penetrate into the scalp, into the hair root, and create some really wonderful
- **[00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8OSlBn6qRqs&t=47s)** — effects with rejuvenation, with stimulation of hair growth, with decreasing something called DHT,
- **[00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8OSlBn6qRqs&t=54s)** — which is a very powerful testosterone which tends to burn out the hair follicle. So,
- **[00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8OSlBn6qRqs&t=59s)** — there's a special blend of 15 phytonutrient-rich essential oils infused with vitamin D
- **[01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8OSlBn6qRqs&t=67s)** — and vitamin E, both essential for hair. So, we have jojoba oil, grapeseed oil, castor oil,
- **[01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8OSlBn6qRqs&t=76s)** — flaxseed oil, avocado oil, rosemary oil, ginger root oil, clove flower oil, thyme oil,
- **[01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8OSlBn6qRqs&t=86s)** — lavender oil, cedarwood oil, baringrage oil, sesame seed oil, tea tree leaf oil, garlic oil.
- **[01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8OSlBn6qRqs&t=95s)** — So, you can see there's some seriously powerful ingredients into this product
- **[01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8OSlBn6qRqs&t=100s)** — with many different properties, antimicrobial properties, anti-inflammatory properties,
- **[01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8OSlBn6qRqs&t=107s)** — inflammation has been known to really kill the hair roots. A lot of the phytonutrients
- **[01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8OSlBn6qRqs&t=113s)** — act as a free radical scavenger, so they help to eliminate the free radicals that create

- **[00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1BiWgHxSL0&t=0s)** — So many people are having digestive issues and they're changing their diet and they're doing all
- **[00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1BiWgHxSL0&t=5s)** — these things or taking supplements but it's not really working. And that's probably because there's
- **[00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1BiWgHxSL0&t=10s)** — something else going on that I want to share with you today. It's kind of a hidden source of
- **[00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1BiWgHxSL0&t=15s)** — digestive problems that you need to be aware of. And when I tell you this, it'll make sense.
- **[00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1BiWgHxSL0&t=20s)** — And you maybe already knew it but it's called stress. Okay? And I'm going to talk about the
- **[00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1BiWgHxSL0&t=26s)** — specific types of stress that influence our digestion the most. But this stress-digestive
- **[00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1BiWgHxSL0&t=33s)** — problem link is huge. So I'm going to go through exactly what happens when you go through stress
- **[00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1BiWgHxSL0&t=39s)** — and this will kind of be mind-blowing when you think about it. But if you even look at the
- **[00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1BiWgHxSL0&t=44s)** — autonomic nervous system in relationship to the two different systems... well actually there's
- **[00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1BiWgHxSL0&t=48s)** — three. You have the sympathetic flight or fight mechanism and then you have the parasympathetic
- **[00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1BiWgHxSL0&t=53s)** — nervous system which is also called rest and digest. Most of the healthy digestion occurs in a
- **[01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1BiWgHxSL0&t=61s)** — parasympathetic low stress state. But you also have another part of the autonomic nervous
- **[01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1BiWgHxSL0&t=68s)** — system. The system that works on automatic called the enteric nervous system. And that's
- **[01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1BiWgHxSL0&t=76s)** — another system that's directly embedded into your digestive system and that links right up to the
- **[01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1BiWgHxSL0&t=81s)** — vagus nerve that goes up to the brain. And this is why whatever's going on down here is going to
- **[01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1BiWgHxSL0&t=88s)** — affect up here. But it's a two-way street. Whatever's going on up here as in stress
- **[01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1BiWgHxSL0&t=94s)** — can go down here as well. And that is what we're going to be focusing on today. When we talk
- **[01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1BiWgHxSL0&t=100s)** — about digestion, if we take a look at the foundational part of digestion, it's a cell.
- **[01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1BiWgHxSL0&t=106s)** — And it's a single layer cell in your small intestine and the large that's called the
- **[01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1BiWgHxSL0&t=112s)** — enterocyte. Okay, now in the colon it's usually referred to as the colonocyte. But basically
- **[01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1BiWgHxSL0&t=118s)** — it's a little cell that absorbs things. Minerals, trace minerals, vitamins, amino acids,
- **[02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1BiWgHxSL0&t=125s)** — and longer amino acids called peptides, and lipids which are fats, and B12, and even bile.
- **[02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1BiWgHxSL0&t=132s)** — So these cells are constantly absorbing these nutrients. Okay, and of course they're broken
- **[02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1BiWgHxSL0&t=138s)** — down from the acid in the stomach, the enzymes in the stomach, and a lot of the enzymes within
- **[02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1BiWgHxSL0&t=143s)** — the small intestine as well as the pancreas as well. As well as the bile does help break
- **[02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1BiWgHxSL0&t=148s)** — down the fat to a certain level so then the enzyme can break it down even more. But at some
- **[02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1BiWgHxSL0&t=152s)** — point it needs to be absorbed into these little cells. One interesting thing about these cells
- **[02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1BiWgHxSL0&t=158s)** — or this layer of cells is the surface area is massive. The body is very smart and strategically
- **[02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1BiWgHxSL0&t=167s)** — the way that it increases surface area is by kind of having these folds. Okay, like if you
- **[02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1BiWgHxSL0&t=175s)** — took an accordion or like a slinky for example and you stretch it out it would be a lot
- **[03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1BiWgHxSL0&t=180s)** — longer, right? Well, same thing with the intestines. You have these little
- **[03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1BiWgHxSL0&t=185s)** — villi which are little pouches that kind of come up and down like this. So basically it can
- **[03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1BiWgHxSL0&t=190s)** — actually increase the surface area but within each villi or little pouch you have these tiny
- **[03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1BiWgHxSL0&t=197s)** — little cells and then hairs which are like kind of a micro version of these villi extending
- **[03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1BiWgHxSL0&t=205s)** — from that little cell. So if you were to stretch all that out you're going to get a
- **[03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1BiWgHxSL0&t=212s)** — Now these colonocytes or these entorocytes aren't the only cells. There's other cells.
- **[03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1BiWgHxSL0&t=218s)** — I don't want to get into that but they some cells that produce mucus, a mucus layer as a
- **[03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1BiWgHxSL0&t=223s)** — protection between like pathogens and microbes and then the actual surface area as well. So
- **[03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1BiWgHxSL0&t=230s)** — that's just a side note. All right, so now let's talk about the consequence of stress
- **[03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1BiWgHxSL0&t=235s)** — in your digestive tract. Well, number one there's a conversion of the bacteria to
- **[04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1BiWgHxSL0&t=242s)** — something called biofilms which are these colonies of microbes that band together and
- **[04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1BiWgHxSL0&t=247s)** — they start to develop either a slime or even a calcium, a little protective mechanism so they
- **[04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1BiWgHxSL0&t=253s)** — can go underneath the radar with your immune system and because a lot of these guys are
- **[04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1BiWgHxSL0&t=256s)** — pathogenic and they create a lot of problems but you're going to get more biofilms developing
- **[04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1BiWgHxSL0&t=262s)** — when you have more stress. That's their survival mechanism. Number two, you get an erosion
- **[04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1BiWgHxSL0&t=269s)** — of the mucosal layer. Now if it keeps eroding more and more and more you end up eventually
- **[04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1BiWgHxSL0&t=275s)** — get an ulcer and maybe you've heard the link between H. pylori and ulcers and that's
- **[04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1BiWgHxSL0&t=282s)** — because of the microbial infection. You see the H. pylori is normally in your stomach
- **[04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1BiWgHxSL0&t=287s)** — hanging out not creating any problem, okay, but when you stress it, it comes out of
- **[04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1BiWgHxSL0&t=293s)** — remission and it starts to hammer you and create immune reactions and they don't know
- **[04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1BiWgHxSL0&t=298s)** — exactly why that mucosal layer becomes destroyed but it does and then you start getting an
- **[05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1BiWgHxSL0&t=304s)** — ulcer and so the way they treat it is with antibiotics. That gives you a bunch of other
- **[05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1BiWgHxSL0&t=310s)** — problems. I'm going to recommend a much safer remedy, sulforaphane which is in broccoli
- **[05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1BiWgHxSL0&t=316s)** — sprouts or it's in cabbage and radish or zinc carnosine. Zinc carnosine helps you
- **[05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1BiWgHxSL0&t=325s)** — establish this mucosal layer in your stomach, in the top part of the intestine and even the
- **[05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1BiWgHxSL0&t=330s)** — large colon and another thing it can do is potently inhibit H. pylori and it's a really
- **[05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1BiWgHxSL0&t=339s)** — good anti-inflammatory and apparently stress inhibits this zinc, okay, but zinc carnosine
- **[05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1BiWgHxSL0&t=347s)** — is the best to take for an ulcer or for gastritis or for an eroding mucosal layer. These microbes
- **[05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1BiWgHxSL0&t=356s)** — are very strategic and very smart and sneaky because H. pylori produces this enzyme to make
- **[06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1BiWgHxSL0&t=363s)** — more urea which then turns into ammonia and the pH of ammonia is really super high. It's very
- **[06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1BiWgHxSL0&t=370s)** — alkaline and that's how it counters the acid in your stomach to survive.
- **[06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1BiWgHxSL0&t=378s)** — So if you can understand that and keep your stomach strongly acidic, you can kind of keep
- **[06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1BiWgHxSL0&t=384s)** — this H. pylori at bay but it can start doing more damage in an alkaline environment. Just
- **[06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1BiWgHxSL0&t=390s)** — remember that. So with stress you get more biofilms, you get this erosion of the mucosal
- **[06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1BiWgHxSL0&t=395s)** — layer, you get decreased transient time of food particles going through the digestive track. This
- **[06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1BiWgHxSL0&t=402s)** — is called constipation. I mean even think about this when you go through stress what do you
- **[06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1BiWgHxSL0&t=406s)** — feel? You feel like a knot in your stomach, maybe nauseous because it locks everything up.
- **[06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1BiWgHxSL0&t=412s)** — It takes a very relaxed state to be able to digest and have things travel through nicely.
- **[06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1BiWgHxSL0&t=418s)** — The actual bacteria during a stress state start to feed off these enterocytes and they can start
- **[07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1BiWgHxSL0&t=427s)** — to break them down to the point where you start getting leaky gut which now there's spaces
- **[07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1BiWgHxSL0&t=432s)** — or an increased permeability and this is not good because food particles and proteins and all
- **[07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1BiWgHxSL0&t=439s)** — sorts of things can then travel through and they don't go through the normal emigration
- **[07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1BiWgHxSL0&t=444s)** — And this creates an immune reaction because your body now senses even good things as bad things,
- **[07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1BiWgHxSL0&t=453s)** — potentially incorrectly identifying them as pathogens. And now you have antibodies against
- **[07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1BiWgHxSL0&t=457s)** — maybe some good things, your own tissues, foods that are good for you. And now you're allergic
- **[07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1BiWgHxSL0&t=462s)** — to those as well. So allergies and autoimmune diseases really stem from this leaky gut
- **[07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1BiWgHxSL0&t=469s)** — You get an alteration of the ratios of bad to good. You get more bad pathogenic microbes versus good.
- **[07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1BiWgHxSL0&t=477s)** — You also get a decreased diversity of microbes. You get decreased total microbes. So the
- **[08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1BiWgHxSL0&t=484s)** — relationship of these microbes starts to change when the environment is stressful. Of course,
- **[08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1BiWgHxSL0&t=489s)** — this is going to lead to inflammation. So these are all the different things that can happen.
- **[08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1BiWgHxSL0&t=493s)** — I recently did a video on stress relating to damage to the heart muscle, right? Because
- **[08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1BiWgHxSL0&t=499s)** — adrenaline causes hypoxia, a lack of oxygen. Well, now we're talking about how stress affects
- **[08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1BiWgHxSL0&t=506s)** — the digestive system directly. Now, let's touch on the type of stress that creates these
- **[08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1BiWgHxSL0&t=512s)** — problems. Probably the biggest thing is emotional stress. This can happen after a
- **[08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1BiWgHxSL0&t=516s)** — a loss of a loved one, a loss of a job, loss of money, loss of anything, or an ongoing emotional
- **[08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1BiWgHxSL0&t=523s)** — stress that you're stuck in and can't get out of it. That's the worst type of stress. It could
- **[08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1BiWgHxSL0&t=527s)** — be related to the environment, the world, relationships, anything. It has a profound effect
- **[08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1BiWgHxSL0&t=534s)** — over your digestion. And anything you can do to improve that would be very beneficial to your
- **[09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1BiWgHxSL0&t=540s)** — gut issues. And I have a ton of videos on how to cope with stress. You know, nose breathing,
- **[09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1BiWgHxSL0&t=544s)** — controlling your breath, especially when you're sleeping, going for long walks. There are so
- **[09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1BiWgHxSL0&t=548s)** — many things you can do exercise-wise. There's just many things. Now, another big stress
- **[09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1BiWgHxSL0&t=554s)** — for these microbes and your lining of your colon and your small intestine is antibiotics.
- **[09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1BiWgHxSL0&t=562s)** — Okay. And also things that act like an antibiotic, like chlorine in tap water,
- **[09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1BiWgHxSL0&t=568s)** — artificial sweeteners, GMO foods that have glyphosate. Glyphosate is an herbicide that is
- **[09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1BiWgHxSL0&t=575s)** — classified as an antibiotic. And then you also have all the foods that are sterilized, okay,
- **[09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1BiWgHxSL0&t=582s)** — pasteurized milk products, pasteurized juice, pasteurization of canned foods, box foods,
- **[09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1BiWgHxSL0&t=589s)** — preservatives, processed foods. But the more the food is cooked, the more it's dead. It
- **[09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1BiWgHxSL0&t=597s)** — microbes, okay, good microbes. And they do this to increase shelf life. And that comes with the
- **[10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1BiWgHxSL0&t=603s)** — package. You're creating an encouragement of sterilization of your own microbiome. Anytime
- **[10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1BiWgHxSL0&t=609s)** — you take an antibiotic, you better at the same time start taking a probiotic. But there's
- **[10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1BiWgHxSL0&t=614s)** — some other interesting stresses that I want to talk about that directly relate to your digestive
- **[10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1BiWgHxSL0&t=620s)** — system. And one being intravenous feeding. When you're in ICU in the hospital or for other
- **[10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1BiWgHxSL0&t=629s)** — situations, you have to be fed through an IV. Boy, does it create a lot of problems with
- **[10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1BiWgHxSL0&t=635s)** — your digestive system. And your liver, fatty liver, liver disease, increased risk of infections,
- **[10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1BiWgHxSL0&t=643s)** — blood clots, severe deficiencies of all sorts of things. And I'm just bringing that up because
- **[10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1BiWgHxSL0&t=647s)** — you have to take this or you know someone taking this, you might want to look for a more quality
- **[10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1BiWgHxSL0&t=655s)** — type of intravenous food because what they use for the calories is they use
- **[11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1BiWgHxSL0&t=661s)** — soybean oil. Wow, you're going to inject some of the soybean oil. And that's very, very high
- **[11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1BiWgHxSL0&t=666s)** — in omega-6. It creates a lot of problems in the liver, like I said, a fatty liver. And
- **[11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1BiWgHxSL0&t=669s)** — there's a lot of research to back that up. If it creates that many problems injected, what is
- **[11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1BiWgHxSL0&t=673s)** — doing in her diet, right? It creates some other issues. It's not a safe product. And also in this
- **[11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1BiWgHxSL0&t=679s)** — intravenous feeding, they put glucose, synthetic vitamins, minerals that are probably not
- **[11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1BiWgHxSL0&t=687s)** — in the right form. Not good. Now, I mentioned ICU, right? Critical care. This creates a lot
- **[11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1BiWgHxSL0&t=696s)** — of digestive problems because when someone's in that state of critical care, a lot of times
- **[11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1BiWgHxSL0&t=702s)** — they're fed their nutrition through an IV, which I already mentioned all the problems with that.
- **[11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1BiWgHxSL0&t=707s)** — But they a lot of times put someone on a PPI and an acid type medication, which creates
- **[11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1BiWgHxSL0&t=713s)** — more stress within the digestive system itself. And then they put you on an antibiotic, right?
- **[11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1BiWgHxSL0&t=718s)** — So you're just like just putting massive stress on these microbes at the worst time,
- **[12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1BiWgHxSL0&t=724s)** — a critical care situation. And sometimes they feed you epinephrine and they have to,
- **[12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1BiWgHxSL0&t=729s)** — but you have to realize what that's doing to your gut flora. It's creating hypoxia.
- **[12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1BiWgHxSL0&t=734s)** — Okay. It's creating more stress because what does epinephrine? That's a stress hormone.
- **[12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1BiWgHxSL0&t=739s)** — You inject it right in the person. Now, sometimes you have to, but boy,
- **[12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1BiWgHxSL0&t=742s)** — you better be doing something to kind of counter some of the bad effects.
- **[12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1BiWgHxSL0&t=747s)** — And then let's say they use opiates, right? Opiates really shut down your GI system. So now
- **[12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1BiWgHxSL0&t=753s)** — we have all these pathogens that are stuck there. You have constipation
- **[12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1BiWgHxSL0&t=757s)** — as a side effect. And I even know when you have like anesthetics, they put you out.
- **[12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1BiWgHxSL0&t=762s)** — A lot of people wake up and they can't urinate. They can't eliminate. There's just so many
- **[12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1BiWgHxSL0&t=768s)** — problems with surgeries and ICU that I think more attention needs to put on this,
- **[12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1BiWgHxSL0&t=774s)** — this critical time where you're in the hospital and it's just amazing how anyone
- **[12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1BiWgHxSL0&t=778s)** — survives that. And just as a side note, when you take antacids or anything that addresses
- **[13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1BiWgHxSL0&t=784s)** — the pH of your stomach, whether it's PPIs or other types of medication,
- **[13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1BiWgHxSL0&t=789s)** — and you start raising the pH of that stomach above 3.8. Normally it should be between one
- **[13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1BiWgHxSL0&t=796s)** — and three. When it goes above 3.8, you start getting overgrowth of bacteria in the wrong place
- **[13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1BiWgHxSL0&t=803s)** — in your small intestine. And so now every time you eat fiber, guess what? You have microbes
- **[13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1BiWgHxSL0&t=808s)** — in the wrong place. That's going to start to ferment in your small intestine and create a lot
- **[13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1BiWgHxSL0&t=814s)** — bloating. So I'm just bringing this up because the solution of fixing one problem ends up giving
- **[13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1BiWgHxSL0&t=821s)** — you another problem. So the question is now, what can we do about it? Number one, do whatever
- **[13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1BiWgHxSL0&t=827s)** — you can to reduce the stress. And I put some links down below of things to help you cope
- **[13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1BiWgHxSL0&t=832s)** — with stress in addition to eliminating the source of the stress. Right? Okay. Number two,
- **[13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1BiWgHxSL0&t=838s)** — L-glutamine is really beneficial to heal an inflamed gut as well as a leaky gut.
- **[14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1BiWgHxSL0&t=846s)** — L-glutamine. That's a really good remedy. All right. Number three, probiotics and
- **[14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1BiWgHxSL0&t=853s)** — fermented foods, as in kefir. If you don't have a dairy problem, like in some allergy
- **[14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1BiWgHxSL0&t=860s)** — or lactate intolerance problem, sauerkraut is really awesome. But here's the thing.
- **[14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1BiWgHxSL0&t=865s)** — If you have sauerkraut or kimchi or some type of fermented vegetables, like pickles, for example,
- **[14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1BiWgHxSL0&t=871s)** — and you have more bloating from that, then you're going to have to do the carnivore diet for a
- **[14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1BiWgHxSL0&t=877s)** — while because that's one way to address severe inflammatory problems in the bowel as well as
- **[14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1BiWgHxSL0&t=885s)** — SIBO, small intestinal bacterial overgrowth, where you have a lot of bloating. Because
- **[14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1BiWgHxSL0&t=889s)** — every time you have fiber, it feeds the microbes and these microbes are in the wrong
- **[14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1BiWgHxSL0&t=893s)** — place. Now, if you haven't seen another really good video on digestion, you should check this
- **[14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1BiWgHxSL0&t=898s)** — out, which gives you a lot of the remedies that are not necessarily related to stress,
- **[15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1BiWgHxSL0&t=904s)** — but other things. And I put that up right here. Check it out.

- **[00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6mOAgbJvhqg&t=0s)** — Today's topic revolves around the number one missing trace mineral in arthritis. For arthritis,
- **[00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6mOAgbJvhqg&t=8s)** — a lot of people are taking vitamin D and they may not see the difference. Other people take a lot of
- **[00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6mOAgbJvhqg&t=15s)** — magnesium for the joints and they also might not feel much difference unless they have this
- **[00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6mOAgbJvhqg&t=22s)** — additional trace mineral involved. And that is boron. Now let me explain what boron is.
- **[00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6mOAgbJvhqg&t=28s)** — It's a trace mineral that we don't have a lot of studies on, but there's a lot of data relating
- **[00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6mOAgbJvhqg&t=33s)** — to arthritis that I'm going to share with you. Boron seems to be the key trace mineral to allow
- **[00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6mOAgbJvhqg&t=40s)** — calcium to work, to allow magnesium to work. If you're deficient in boron, you're going to have
- **[00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6mOAgbJvhqg&t=48s)** — excess amounts of calcium and magnesium in the urine. You're going to tend to get more
- **[00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6mOAgbJvhqg&t=52s)** — calcification in the soft tissues. You're not going to have the strong bones. So boron really
- **[00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6mOAgbJvhqg&t=59s)** — helps keep the minerals inside the bone and allows vitamin D to be activated and help this
- **[01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6mOAgbJvhqg&t=65s)** — whole process work. Boron also prevents tooth decay like in tooth cavities. If you don't
- **[01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6mOAgbJvhqg&t=72s)** — have enough boron, you're going to have more inflammation in the joints because boron helps
- **[01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6mOAgbJvhqg&t=77s)** — reduce something called C-reactive protein. You may even find that you're getting receding gums
- **[01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6mOAgbJvhqg&t=82s)** — kidney stones, calcium in the arteries and calcium in the joint because you're deficient in boron.
- **[01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6mOAgbJvhqg&t=88s)** — The tissue that contains or stores the most boron is something called the parathyroid gland.
- **[01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6mOAgbJvhqg&t=94s)** — Let me explain very simply what the parathyroid gland does. It sees four small glands around
- **[01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6mOAgbJvhqg&t=100s)** — your thyroid and what the parathyroid gland does is produces a hormone that helps control
- **[01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6mOAgbJvhqg&t=106s)** — calcium. So let's say for example you don't have enough vitamin D or you don't have
- **[01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6mOAgbJvhqg&t=110s)** — calcium. Well the parathyroid hormone will increase to extract the calcium from your
- **[01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6mOAgbJvhqg&t=117s)** — bone, pull it out so you have enough calcium. So you can look at the parathyroid hormone as
- **[02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6mOAgbJvhqg&t=125s)** — kind of like another vitamin D. And what's interesting about the parathyroid hormone is
- **[02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6mOAgbJvhqg&t=129s)** — you need this boron to allow this whole thing to work. Even if your levels of vitamin D
- **[02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6mOAgbJvhqg&t=135s)** — are normal in your blood, you might have vitamin D resistance. And this is where the parathyroid
- **[02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6mOAgbJvhqg&t=141s)** — hormone starts going higher and higher and higher. Even though you're taking vitamin D.
- **[02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6mOAgbJvhqg&t=146s)** — Well it's because you have vitamin D resistance, but it can also be you're short in boron.
- **[02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6mOAgbJvhqg&t=152s)** — So I think a lot of people are deficient in boron because they really haven't put it on
- **[02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6mOAgbJvhqg&t=158s)** — the radar as being something they need. Also if you're low in boron, you're going to have
- **[02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6mOAgbJvhqg&t=162s)** — amounts of testosterone. You're going to have low amounts of estrogen. Now when doing a deep dive
- **[02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6mOAgbJvhqg&t=169s)** — into nutrition, I always look at research on animals, right? Because sometimes with humans,
- **[02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6mOAgbJvhqg&t=177s)** — the research is kind of like hidden and buried. But for animals, it's usually out there. And
- **[03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6mOAgbJvhqg&t=182s)** — I found something interesting with horses. If a horse is deficient in boron, their head starts
- **[03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6mOAgbJvhqg&t=187s)** — shaking because they have a problem with the trigeminal nerve that causes pain and inflammation.
- **[03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6mOAgbJvhqg&t=193s)** — And they're trying to do something to get rid of it. Well magnesium in boron gets rid of it
- **[03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6mOAgbJvhqg&t=199s)** — pretty quickly. There's even data that boron can help decrease the risk of prostate cancer.
- **[03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6mOAgbJvhqg&t=206s)** — As far as the amounts of boron to take, I would recommend starting out with like three
- **[03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6mOAgbJvhqg&t=213s)** — milligrams three times a day. And see if your problem is resolved after a period of one to three
- **[03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6mOAgbJvhqg&t=219s)** — months. Now some people take a lot more boron just so you know. Like some people take like
- **[03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6mOAgbJvhqg&t=224s)** — 30 milligrams a day. You have to realize that the toxicity level of boron is less than salt.
- **[03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6mOAgbJvhqg&t=229s)** — And the heavy tilling of our soils have depleted a lot of these trace minerals,
- **[03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6mOAgbJvhqg&t=233s)** — including boron. So I just wanted to put boron on your radar just so you know it's
- **[03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6mOAgbJvhqg&t=238s)** — out there. And when it does there's a little more data to know about arthritis. If you

- **[00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XxPLWR1U5D0&t=0s)** — I want to show you how to clear out your respiratory mucus, which includes bronchitis, mucus with
- **[00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XxPLWR1U5D0&t=5s)** — pneumonia, sinusitis, any mucus in your respiratory system, with something better than salt.
- **[00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XxPLWR1U5D0&t=11s)** — Now, I've done quite a few videos on using salt to get rid of mucus, and it's good,
- **[00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XxPLWR1U5D0&t=15s)** — but there's something much better. And that remedy is NAC. NAC is also used in hospitals
- **[00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XxPLWR1U5D0&t=22s)** — and emergency rooms as the antidote to Tylenol poisoning. The benefits of NAC go
- **[00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XxPLWR1U5D0&t=28s)** — way beyond mucus, which I'm going to cover, but let's just focus on what it does to your
- **[00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XxPLWR1U5D0&t=32s)** — mucus. NAC basically thins your mucus. It makes your mucus less sticky. Salt will do
- **[00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XxPLWR1U5D0&t=40s)** — that as well by absorbing water into the mucus, but NAC takes it one step further.
- **[00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XxPLWR1U5D0&t=45s)** — It's a very potent anti-inflammatory. It also is a very potent antioxidant. Not
- **[00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XxPLWR1U5D0&t=51s)** — only does it thin the mucus, but it also stops the production of mucus. It strengthens
- **[00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XxPLWR1U5D0&t=55s)** — the little hairs, the cilia, in your respiratory system that helps move mucus. And not only that,
- **[01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XxPLWR1U5D0&t=61s)** — it's antibacterial, antiviral, and it can even break up something called biofilms,
- **[01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XxPLWR1U5D0&t=67s)** — which are certain micro colonies that live within the mucus that are protected sometimes
- **[01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XxPLWR1U5D0&t=72s)** — by either calcium or other things. And there's three ways that you can take NAC. You can
- **[01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XxPLWR1U5D0&t=77s)** — take it orally as a supplement. You can get it injected. Certain doctors do that. Or you
- **[01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XxPLWR1U5D0&t=82s)** — can inhale it through a nebulizer. I'm going to get into a little more details in a little
- **[01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XxPLWR1U5D0&t=86s)** — bit on how to take it. And the reason I'm putting this NAC on your radar is because
- **[01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XxPLWR1U5D0&t=90s)** — it does a lot. You can use it for many different things. Whether you have mucus
- **[01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XxPLWR1U5D0&t=94s)** — from an infection or you have something called CLPD, which is chronic obstructive pulmonary
- **[01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XxPLWR1U5D0&t=100s)** — disease where the lungs are generating a lot of mucus or even a genetic condition
- **[01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XxPLWR1U5D0&t=105s)** — that involves the lung and mucus called cystic fibrosis, NAC can come to the rescue.
- **[01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XxPLWR1U5D0&t=110s)** — And so let's first touch on what it does for Tylenol poisoning. When someone takes too much
- **[01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XxPLWR1U5D0&t=115s)** — Tylenol, what it's going to do is going to produce this chemical that's going to deplete
- **[02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XxPLWR1U5D0&t=120s)** — glutathione. And without glutathione, your liver goes right down the tubes. You develop
- **[02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XxPLWR1U5D0&t=124s)** — liver damage and the liver can literally shut down. NAC helps build up glutathione in the
- **[02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XxPLWR1U5D0&t=131s)** — liver to protect the liver from breaking down. Now, why can't you just take glutathione?
- **[02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XxPLWR1U5D0&t=136s)** — It just doesn't work. You want to take a precursor to help build up your own glutathione
- **[02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XxPLWR1U5D0&t=142s)** — in your liver. The other very interesting thing about NAC is it helps enhance brain function
- **[02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XxPLWR1U5D0&t=148s)** — because it crosses the blood brain barrier and it can act as a very powerful antioxidant
- **[02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XxPLWR1U5D0&t=152s)** — in the brain as well. So there's some pretty positive research on using NAC for Alzheimer's,
- **[02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XxPLWR1U5D0&t=158s)** — Parkinson's, obsessive compulsive disorder, certain addictions to cocaine, marijuana,
- **[02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XxPLWR1U5D0&t=164s)** — and even gambling, depression, schizophrenia. And just as a side note, if you know someone
- **[02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XxPLWR1U5D0&t=169s)** — with schizophrenia, give them high doses of niacinamide. That's another remedy for
- **[02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XxPLWR1U5D0&t=175s)** — schizophrenia. NAC also apparently improves insulin sensitivity. So what would that mean?
- **[03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XxPLWR1U5D0&t=181s)** — That means your blood sugars are going to do much better. You're not going to develop a
- **[03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XxPLWR1U5D0&t=186s)** — fatty liver from all that insulin. You're going to probably end up with lower blood pressure
- **[03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XxPLWR1U5D0&t=190s)** — and better cholesterol profiles. So in other words, you'll have less oxidative LDL. Also,
- **[03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XxPLWR1U5D0&t=196s)** — people with asthma take NAC. And as another side note with that, if you have asthma,
- **[03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XxPLWR1U5D0&t=203s)** — you're going to also benefit from high doses of vitamin D3. There's even immune benefits
- **[03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XxPLWR1U5D0&t=208s)** — from NAC. Certain people with HIV take NAC with good results. And even if you have a
- **[03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XxPLWR1U5D0&t=215s)** — toxicity, apparently NAC can act as a chelator to bind the mercury and pull it out of the body.
- **[03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XxPLWR1U5D0&t=222s)** — If we compare salt for mucus versus NAC for mucus, salt is good for acute infections,
- **[03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XxPLWR1U5D0&t=229s)** — like some quick results with your mucus. But NAC goes a lot deeper. It handles not just the
- **[03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XxPLWR1U5D0&t=236s)** — mucus, but the inflammation behind the mucus, also the oxidative stress. It can kind of put
- **[04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XxPLWR1U5D0&t=241s)** — fire out with that. And it can even help modulate or regulate the immune system. NAC,
- **[04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XxPLWR1U5D0&t=246s)** — if we do a comparison, is just much better for anything related to mucus in your respiratory
- **[04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XxPLWR1U5D0&t=251s)** — system. There's even reports that NAC is good for fibromyalgia and also improving eye problems
- **[04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XxPLWR1U5D0&t=257s)** — with certain types of autoimmune diseases. And there's also things you can take in addition
- **[04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XxPLWR1U5D0&t=262s)** — to NAC to speed things up. Let me just list the things that can enhance the NAC effects.
- **[04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XxPLWR1U5D0&t=268s)** — If you add vitamin C or curcumin in turmeric, a probiotic can be very beneficial. Magnesium can
- **[04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XxPLWR1U5D0&t=274s)** — help the airways because it's a vasor relaxor. And also you can add quercetin, which is a
- **[04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XxPLWR1U5D0&t=280s)** — phytonutrient that's usually in onions. But of course, I think one of the biggest things I
- **[04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XxPLWR1U5D0&t=284s)** — would add is the vitamin D. And about 20,000 I use. Vitamin D is hands down one of the most
- **[04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XxPLWR1U5D0&t=290s)** — powerful things to help regulate the immune system so you don't even get this infection
- **[04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XxPLWR1U5D0&t=295s)** — the first place. And if you do, you can overcome the infection pretty quick. Now, as far as the
- **[05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XxPLWR1U5D0&t=301s)** — NAC dosage, I would recommend taking 600 milligrams three times a day. That would be your dosage.
- **[05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XxPLWR1U5D0&t=308s)** — And the percentage of this liquid NAC would be anywhere between 10 to 20 percent. And you'd
- **[05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XxPLWR1U5D0&t=315s)** — use that in a nebulizer to create a mist to put it into your sinuses, inhale it so it
- **[05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XxPLWR1U5D0&t=321s)** — goes down the respiratory tract and into the lungs. However, taking the Orally also does work.
- **[05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XxPLWR1U5D0&t=327s)** — You don't necessarily have to use a nebulizer. I wanted to make this video fairly short,
- **[05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XxPLWR1U5D0&t=332s)** — to the point, no fluff. And since vitamin D is so important with respiratory infections,
- **[05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XxPLWR1U5D0&t=338s)** — you should probably watch this video right here.

- **[00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMfSBFPBAl4&t=0s)** — So if you have any type of... excuse me one second... oh man... any problem with mucus in your throat,
- **[00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMfSBFPBAl4&t=8s)** — today we're going to talk about how to get rid of it using salt. Very, very simple. This is part of
- **[00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMfSBFPBAl4&t=13s)** — a series of three different videos to address this problem from different angles. So whether
- **[00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMfSBFPBAl4&t=17s)** — you have a sinus mucus or mucus in the inner ear or coming from your tonsils or up from the
- **[00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMfSBFPBAl4&t=25s)** — we're going to get into it. So I'm not sure if you know this, but salt is really good for anything
- **[00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMfSBFPBAl4&t=31s)** — bacterial, fungal, yeast, and mold. Even if you think about how they cure meat, they add salt to
- **[00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMfSBFPBAl4&t=40s)** — actually raw meat to stop any type of bacterial growth. And even when you make sauerkraut,
- **[00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMfSBFPBAl4&t=45s)** — you have this bacteria that is fermenting this cabbage, but then when they want to stop it,
- **[00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMfSBFPBAl4&t=49s)** — they add salt to it. Then it stabilizes this stage of making sauerkraut. I want to explain
- **[00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMfSBFPBAl4&t=55s)** — what salt does to these microbes. Okay, if we take a look at my little chart right here,
- **[01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMfSBFPBAl4&t=61s)** — if we put salt on either a bacteria, a fungus, a yeast, or a mold, the salt concentration is a
- **[01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMfSBFPBAl4&t=69s)** — lot more outside than inside, right? Inside you have water, and water tends to flow towards
- **[01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMfSBFPBAl4&t=76s)** — a concentrated salt mixture. So the water is going to move out of the cell
- **[01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMfSBFPBAl4&t=83s)** — into the extracellular area right here, turning this bacteria into a shriveled, dehydrated,
- **[01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMfSBFPBAl4&t=91s)** — dead particle. So the salt will kill bacteria, fungus, mold, and yeast through dehydration.
- **[01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMfSBFPBAl4&t=102s)** — Another cool thing that the salt will do is it'll thin mucus. So a lot of times people get this
- **[01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMfSBFPBAl4&t=109s)** — really thick mucus that won't come out of their bodies. Well, you can use salt to loosen it up.
- **[01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMfSBFPBAl4&t=115s)** — How does it do that? The same mechanism. It takes the water out of the mucus, it breaks it
- **[02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMfSBFPBAl4&t=120s)** — up, and it thins the mucus. So we have two things going on. We have the inhibiting of the
- **[02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMfSBFPBAl4&t=125s)** — microbial growth and the killing of microbes, and we also have the thinning of the mucus. So
- **[02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMfSBFPBAl4&t=129s)** — this is really good for an infection anywhere in your respiratory tract. You could have a
- **[02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMfSBFPBAl4&t=134s)** — post-nasal sinus drip situation. That's leaking down into the back part of the sinuses into the
- **[02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMfSBFPBAl4&t=140s)** — throat. You could also have a situation where there's an ear infection and there's mucus
- **[02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMfSBFPBAl4&t=147s)** — buildup through the estation tubes on either side, and that can end up in the throat as
- **[02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMfSBFPBAl4&t=151s)** — well. And so here you are trying to get rid of the throat infection, but it keeps coming
- **[02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMfSBFPBAl4&t=155s)** — from the ear. So the source is the ear, the effect is the throat. So you have to be able to
- **[02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMfSBFPBAl4&t=161s)** — handle where it's originating from. And also if it's in the sinuses, you have to handle that
- **[02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMfSBFPBAl4&t=165s)** — as well. So this mucus can be originating from the sinus, from the ear, or even from
- **[02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMfSBFPBAl4&t=172s)** — the tonsils, which are little immune glands in the back part of the throat, which can swell
- **[02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMfSBFPBAl4&t=179s)** — up, especially in children, and be a source of infection. But really the tonsils are
- **[03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMfSBFPBAl4&t=185s)** — any invading of the microbes deeper into the body. So it intends to create defenses,
- **[03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMfSBFPBAl4&t=192s)** — and it creates inflammation, and a lot of times you'll end up with a sore throat. On occasion,
- **[03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMfSBFPBAl4&t=198s)** — some of the mucus could be coming up from the esophagus, because you have either
- **[03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMfSBFPBAl4&t=203s)** — acid reflux that's irritating the esophagus, or you could have some mucus that's coming up
- **[03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMfSBFPBAl4&t=208s)** — from the lungs. So there's many different things that you can do related to salt,
- **[03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMfSBFPBAl4&t=213s)** — from very expensive to very inexpensive. So let's start with the least expensive thing you can do.
- **[03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMfSBFPBAl4&t=219s)** — You can basically take a teaspoon of sea salt. Now as far as the salt that I recommend, I
- **[03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMfSBFPBAl4&t=223s)** — don't recommend using table salt, because they have so many additives in their anti-caking
- **[03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMfSBFPBAl4&t=228s)** — agents, and you really don't know the source of where they got that refined product. I would
- **[03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMfSBFPBAl4&t=234s)** — highly recommend you find a good rock salt, something that has been preserved, that hasn't
- **[04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMfSBFPBAl4&t=240s)** — been exposed to plastics and pollution in our oceans. A lot of times people will use Himalayan
- **[04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMfSBFPBAl4&t=246s)** — sea salt, but I will mention if you're going to use one of the therapies that I'm going to
- **[04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMfSBFPBAl4&t=251s)** — recommend, I think usually when you buy one of these units, which I'm going to explain,
- **[04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMfSBFPBAl4&t=255s)** — it comes with its own rock salt. And so in that case, you maybe you don't want to put
- **[04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMfSBFPBAl4&t=259s)** — Himalayan sea salt, because that does have a bit more iron, but certain units also just
- **[04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMfSBFPBAl4&t=264s)** — use sodium chloride. So let's say for example, you're not going to get those units,
- **[04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMfSBFPBAl4&t=268s)** — you're just going to use some sea salt. Himalayan sea salt is a really good one. What you're going
- **[04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMfSBFPBAl4&t=273s)** — to do is you're going to take a teaspoon of the sea salt and dissolve it in a glass of water,
- **[04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMfSBFPBAl4&t=279s)** — and you're going to drink that down. Just by drinking it down, you're going to expose
- **[04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMfSBFPBAl4&t=283s)** — everything in your mouth and the throat area to this salt. Plus, the salt is going to go
- **[04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMfSBFPBAl4&t=287s)** — inside the body and strengthen something called the autonomic nervous system, which especially
- **[04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMfSBFPBAl4&t=292s)** — focuses in on this fight or flight mechanism. It tends to improve that. So many people will
- **[04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMfSBFPBAl4&t=298s)** — think that it results just from drinking some salt water. So you want to heat up the water to a certain
- **[05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMfSBFPBAl4&t=303s)** — degree so you can dissolve the salt in there. So you have the option of drinking it or using it
- **[05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMfSBFPBAl4&t=308s)** — as something you can gargle with. Right? So you just you drink this salt water, you gargle it,
- **[05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMfSBFPBAl4&t=313s)** — get the back of your throat all exposed to this sea water, and you're going to start to
- **[05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMfSBFPBAl4&t=318s)** — improve your immune system because it's going to kill off the microbe and start loosening up
- **[05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMfSBFPBAl4&t=321s)** — this mucus. So salt water gargles are great. But just remember, when you gargle with this,
- **[05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMfSBFPBAl4&t=328s)** — make sure you dilute the salt in the water. You may want to also add a teaspoon of apple cider
- **[05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMfSBFPBAl4&t=334s)** — vinegar. I like Fairchild's because it's a little more concentrated and it's more pure.
- **[05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMfSBFPBAl4&t=339s)** — But apple cider vinegar changes the pH and it kills microbes as well. So we're not only
- **[05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMfSBFPBAl4&t=347s)** — going to dehydrate the microbes, thin the mucus, but we can actually also kill the microbes
- **[05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMfSBFPBAl4&t=353s)** — by adding this apple cider vinegar, which is acetic acid. Now, I'm not telling you to put
- **[05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMfSBFPBAl4&t=358s)** — this straight concentrated acid into your body because that's going to irritate, especially if
- **[06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMfSBFPBAl4&t=363s)** — you have a sore throat. You want to dilute it like one teaspoon in a glass of water to make
- **[06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMfSBFPBAl4&t=369s)** — it more diluted. But both salt and apple cider vinegar works really good for an antibacterial
- **[06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMfSBFPBAl4&t=377s)** — effect as well as an anti-inflammatory effect. The next thing you have an option to do is get a
- **[06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMfSBFPBAl4&t=383s)** — neti pot. A neti pot is something called a nasal irrigation in which you're going to pour some
- **[06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMfSBFPBAl4&t=390s)** — salt water up into your sinuses through here and it's going to come out the other side over
- **[06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMfSBFPBAl4&t=395s)** — the sink. So the reason I like that is that you're using this diluted salt water and it's
- **[06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMfSBFPBAl4&t=407s)** — going to come out the other side over the sink. So you're going to get a lot of mucus and you
- **[06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMfSBFPBAl4&t=408s)** — will notice that when you blow your nose a lot of mucus will come out. If you have a post-nasal
- **[06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMfSBFPBAl4&t=413s)** — drip all year round, suspect a fungal infection or some type of mold growing in your
- **[06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMfSBFPBAl4&t=419s)** — sinuses because that would indicate it's not seasonal. And hopefully you're going to change
- **[07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMfSBFPBAl4&t=423s)** — your diet and come off any sugar because sugar feeds this mold and candida and fungus.
- **[07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMfSBFPBAl4&t=429s)** — You'd probably want to do like a nasal irrigation neti pot maybe every other day until it's
- **[07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMfSBFPBAl4&t=435s)** — completely settled down. The problem with some people is they get their sinuses scraped out
- **[07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMfSBFPBAl4&t=440s)** — and they might get surgery and now they damage this very delicate layer of skin that has all
- **[07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMfSBFPBAl4&t=446s)** — these good bacteria to protect you against pathogens. So in another video I talked about
- **[07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMfSBFPBAl4&t=452s)** — using a drop of diluted kimchi juice and a little cotton swab to add that microbiome
- **[07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMfSBFPBAl4&t=458s)** — to the sinuses to give you relief. There's some great data on that. Now the next thing you can do
- **[07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMfSBFPBAl4&t=464s)** — is use a humidifier which basically turns a liquid into a vapor. And so you would use this
- **[07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMfSBFPBAl4&t=468s)** — while you're sleeping. You turn it on, you put your salt water in there, and you let it
- **[07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMfSBFPBAl4&t=473s)** — run all night long. So you can actually breathe this into your body, into your lungs,
- **[07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMfSBFPBAl4&t=478s)** — and it can help to thin the mucus. One more thing I would recommend is to really bundle up
- **[08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMfSBFPBAl4&t=482s)** — and get warm when you're in bed because a lot of times these infections, especially if
- **[08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMfSBFPBAl4&t=487s)** — it's in the lower part of the respiratory area or even the higher part, the upper respiratory,
- **[08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMfSBFPBAl4&t=493s)** — that can be viral and so antibiotics don't work. And so you want to heat your body up
- **[08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMfSBFPBAl4&t=499s)** — and generate more like a natural fever. So you want to bundle up, get in your bed, stay warm,
- **[08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMfSBFPBAl4&t=505s)** — and try to sweat so you can cook these viruses with temperature. And so we're going to
- **[08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMfSBFPBAl4&t=509s)** — kill them with dehydration, kill them with an acid, kill them with heat. And then the next
- **[08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMfSBFPBAl4&t=515s)** — thing you can do is what's called halotherapy, which is a couple options. You can actually go
- **[08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMfSBFPBAl4&t=520s)** — somewhere and they have these salt caves that you can go in. Or there's halotherapy machines,
- **[08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMfSBFPBAl4&t=526s)** — which basically are like a dry salt machine that puts this dry salt out into the air.
- **[08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMfSBFPBAl4&t=531s)** — And they usually come with their own type of salt, which is purified sodium chloride. And I
- **[08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMfSBFPBAl4&t=536s)** — don't think they use sea salts. They may. I'm not sure. But these halotherapy machines
- **[09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMfSBFPBAl4&t=541s)** — are a little bit more expensive. So if you can afford one, they might be worth it. Now,
- **[09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMfSBFPBAl4&t=546s)** — let's say, for example, you do this and it's just not working. It could be the source of
- **[09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMfSBFPBAl4&t=551s)** — your infection is coming from an ear infection or some type of microbe in the estation tubes,
- **[09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMfSBFPBAl4&t=556s)** — which can get really clogged up. For that, you have several options. You can just take a
- **[09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMfSBFPBAl4&t=561s)** — drop of this seawater and put it about four drops or five drops in each ear. Let it go in
- **[09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMfSBFPBAl4&t=567s)** — kind of shake it out. And what that will do, it'll create a thinning of the mucus through here
- **[09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMfSBFPBAl4&t=573s)** — and co-opt those microbes. You can also do the same thing with diluted apple cider vinegar,
- **[09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMfSBFPBAl4&t=578s)** — not concentrated, just a few, like maybe four or five drops of that diluted apple cider vinegar
- **[09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMfSBFPBAl4&t=584s)** — in the water, one teaspoon per glass. And you would put that in each year. So you have
- **[09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMfSBFPBAl4&t=589s)** — different options of things you can do based on your feeling comfortable about it. There's
- **[09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMfSBFPBAl4&t=597s)** — drop of garlic oil in each year. That works really well. It kills the microbe and allows
- **[10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMfSBFPBAl4&t=603s)** — this thing to clear out. And of course, you also have this acid reflux thing. If that is the
- **[10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMfSBFPBAl4&t=609s)** — problem, you have to watch my video down below on how to get rid of acid reflux. But
- **[10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMfSBFPBAl4&t=614s)** — you're going to know if you have acid reflux because you're going to have digestive issues.
- **[10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMfSBFPBAl4&t=618s)** — You might have heartburn. You might feel it indigestion down here. Typically, this is not
- **[10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMfSBFPBAl4&t=624s)** — going to be the issue. It's mainly going to be either coming from the sinuses or even the
- **[10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMfSBFPBAl4&t=629s)** — tonsils. So the gargling will really help. Now, on top of all of this, I would highly recommend
- **[10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMfSBFPBAl4&t=635s)** — you take vitamin D. There's a large amount of data on the relationship between kids that have
- **[10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMfSBFPBAl4&t=641s)** — enlarged tonsils and a vitamin D deficiency, kids and adults that have sinus allergies,
- **[10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMfSBFPBAl4&t=647s)** — sinus mucus and low vitamin D, ear infections, okay, and people with vitamin D deficiencies.
- **[10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMfSBFPBAl4&t=654s)** — And so just the fact that vitamin D receptors are in every single cell in your body,
- **[10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMfSBFPBAl4&t=659s)** — including almost every single immune cell, it makes sense to take vitamin D and probably
- **[11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMfSBFPBAl4&t=664s)** — at least 20,000 IUs. One little extra strategy that I would use instead of taking
- **[11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMfSBFPBAl4&t=671s)** — regular doses of vitamin D for something like this is I would just take 50,000 IUs of vitamin D
- **[11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMfSBFPBAl4&t=679s)** — once a week. That way you get this shotgun effect and you can actually speed up the
- **[11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMfSBFPBAl4&t=685s)** — clearing of this mucus. Now, if you haven't seen how to get rid of respiratory mucus
- **[11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMfSBFPBAl4&t=689s)** — with salt, you have to check that video out. I put it up right here.

- **[00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DGGOYN148Mg&t=0s)** — You know, a lot of people eat sardines. They're very healthy. I consume them. They're great.
- **[00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DGGOYN148Mg&t=6s)** — A very good source of omega-3 fatty acids. But I want to introduce you to another food that has even higher amounts of omega-3 fatty acids.
- **[00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DGGOYN148Mg&t=14s)** — Cod liver. I recommend you have both, because they both have their own strengths.
- **[00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DGGOYN148Mg&t=20s)** — But so many people have never even heard about cod liver. I think they're missing out.
- **[00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DGGOYN148Mg&t=24s)** — Now, I want to first touch on this cod liver oil thing. Because why do they have cod liver oil?
- **[00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DGGOYN148Mg&t=32s)** — And why don't they promote other fish liver oil type products?
- **[00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DGGOYN148Mg&t=37s)** — And that is because something's very unique about the cod fish. In the muscle of the cod fish, there's not much oil.
- **[00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DGGOYN148Mg&t=45s)** — Why is that? Because all of the oil is in the cod's liver, not the muscle.
- **[00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DGGOYN148Mg&t=50s)** — In a salmon, they have small livers, not as much oil, hardly at all. Most of it is in the muscle meat.
- **[00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DGGOYN148Mg&t=58s)** — So let's start with the omega-3 fatty acids. That would be both EPA and DHA.
- **[01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DGGOYN148Mg&t=64s)** — EPA is more for inflammation, and DHA is more for brain, nerve, heart.
- **[01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DGGOYN148Mg&t=70s)** — So with omega-3 fats, with sardines, we're dealing with 0.9 to 2 grams of omega-3 fatty acids.
- **[01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DGGOYN148Mg&t=79s)** — Versus cod liver, we're dealing with 9 to 11 grams of omega-3 fatty acids.
- **[01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DGGOYN148Mg&t=85s)** — So hands down, cod liver has way more omega-3 fatty acids.
- **[01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DGGOYN148Mg&t=89s)** — Alright, next one is vitamin D. Sardines will give you 4.8 micrograms.
- **[01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DGGOYN148Mg&t=94s)** — That basically gives you like 24% of your RDAs.
- **[01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DGGOYN148Mg&t=97s)** — Yet on the cod liver side, we're talking about 100 micrograms.
- **[01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DGGOYN148Mg&t=102s)** — So 4.8 micrograms to 100 micrograms for cod liver. That's going to give you 500% of the RDA.
- **[01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DGGOYN148Mg&t=109s)** — Next one is vitamin A. I'm not talking about beta-carotene, I'm talking about the active form called retinol.
- **[01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DGGOYN148Mg&t=114s)** — Vitamin A is for your vision, vision at night especially, the inner mucosal membranes of your mouth, your throat, your sinuses, your lungs.
- **[02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DGGOYN148Mg&t=124s)** — Also, vitamin A is very important for your thyroid. And also, vitamin A works with iodine.
- **[02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DGGOYN148Mg&t=129s)** — In fact, if you're low in vitamin A, your thyroid could enlarge.
- **[02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DGGOYN148Mg&t=134s)** — So with sardines, you get about 32 micrograms. But with cod liver, we're talking about 5,100 micrograms.
- **[02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DGGOYN148Mg&t=144s)** — Which is about 638% of the RDAs. So sardines is 4%, cod liver is 638%.
- **[02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DGGOYN148Mg&t=152s)** — Alright, now let's go to protein, actual protein. We have 24.6 grams. On the cod liver side, we only have 4.6 grams, much lower.
- **[02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DGGOYN148Mg&t=162s)** — So 24.6 to 4.6. Sardines have much more protein. And that's probably because cod liver is mostly fat.
- **[02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DGGOYN148Mg&t=170s)** — Alright, next one is folate, a very important vitamin, vitamin B9. Sardines, 10 micrograms. Cod liver, 300 micrograms.
- **[03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DGGOYN148Mg&t=183s)** — Okay, now let's talk about calcium. On the sardine side, we have 392 milligrams. And on the cod liver side, we only have 10 milligrams.
- **[03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DGGOYN148Mg&t=191s)** — Okay, so sardines have much more calcium. Let's talk about phosphorus. On the sardine side, we have 545 milligrams.
- **[03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DGGOYN148Mg&t=200s)** — Versus the cod liver side, we only have 100 milligrams. 545 milligrams to 100 milligrams for the cod liver.
- **[03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DGGOYN148Mg&t=207s)** — And then we get to B12. On the sardine side, we're dealing with 11 micrograms. And on the cod liver, we're dealing with slightly less, like 10.6 micrograms.
- **[03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DGGOYN148Mg&t=218s)** — So as far as the B12, it's almost the same, just a little bit more on the sardine side. So now do you see why you need both?
- **[03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DGGOYN148Mg&t=225s)** — Because cod liver oil has some things that the sardines don't have, and the sardines have things that the cod liver doesn't have.
- **[03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DGGOYN148Mg&t=231s)** — And then if we look at sardines relating to salmon, okay, the salmon does have more B vitamins, but the sardines have more calcium, more phosphorus, more selenium, more iron, more magnesium, and more zinc.
- **[04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DGGOYN148Mg&t=245s)** — Now if you have not seen my video on the benefits of cod liver oil, you should check it out. I put it up right here.

- **[00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1TruE9w7PO4&t=0s)** — I was taught that the heart is the primary pump for all the circulation.
- **[00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1TruE9w7PO4&t=4s)** — But there's other data to show that that's not quite true.
- **[00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1TruE9w7PO4&t=7s)** — I'm going to show you how to improve the blood flow through your legs and your ankles and your feet.
- **[00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1TruE9w7PO4&t=11s)** — But there's many different problems that occur when you have poor circulation.
- **[00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1TruE9w7PO4&t=14s)** — A demon swelling, painful feet as well, cramps in the feet and the calves.
- **[00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1TruE9w7PO4&t=18s)** — I'm going to cover all of these and then relate them to a really simple solution.
- **[00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1TruE9w7PO4&t=22s)** — I'm also going to be covering several important exercises.
- **[00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1TruE9w7PO4&t=25s)** — This information is based on a book called Understanding the Heart by Stephen Hussey.
- **[00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1TruE9w7PO4&t=30s)** — In one part of the book he talked about trees.
- **[00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1TruE9w7PO4&t=32s)** — How do trees pump this water from the roots all the way up to the leaves?
- **[00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1TruE9w7PO4&t=37s)** — They don't have hearts.
- **[00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1TruE9w7PO4&t=38s)** — What he has found through a lot of scientific research is that the heart spins the blood.
- **[00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1TruE9w7PO4&t=43s)** — And when you put water through a vortex, even underneath the earth you have moving water.
- **[00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1TruE9w7PO4&t=47s)** — Water always should move. It shouldn't be sitting there.
- **[00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1TruE9w7PO4&t=50s)** — Really the theory of this is the heart is acting as a mechanism to create structured water.
- **[00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1TruE9w7PO4&t=54s)** — To allow it to kind of go through the body.
- **[00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1TruE9w7PO4&t=58s)** — Now we do know the heart is very very electrical.
- **[01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1TruE9w7PO4&t=60s)** — I mean just think about what an EKG does, right?
- **[01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1TruE9w7PO4&t=62s)** — You're measuring the electrical part of the heart.
- **[01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1TruE9w7PO4&t=64s)** — Part of the solution that he did is he started increasing more structured water throughout his circulatory system.
- **[01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1TruE9w7PO4&t=70s)** — And so this leads us to increase structured water in your blood.
- **[01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1TruE9w7PO4&t=75s)** — The best way to do that is to get more exposure from infrared.
- **[01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1TruE9w7PO4&t=80s)** — Over 50% of the sun's energy is infrared.
- **[01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1TruE9w7PO4&t=84s)** — Infrared is just one little piece of the spectrum of light.
- **[01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1TruE9w7PO4&t=88s)** — Which apparently has a lot of healing.
- **[01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1TruE9w7PO4&t=90s)** — I mean a lot of people are using infrared for all sorts of things.
- **[01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1TruE9w7PO4&t=93s)** — But you can also make it to create more structured water in your circulation.
- **[01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1TruE9w7PO4&t=97s)** — More exposure to the sun is one important tip.
- **[01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1TruE9w7PO4&t=101s)** — To improve the circulation in your legs and improve your heart function.
- **[01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1TruE9w7PO4&t=104s)** — You can get an infrared device.
- **[01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1TruE9w7PO4&t=106s)** — There is infrared saunas.
- **[01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1TruE9w7PO4&t=108s)** — You can even sit in front of a campfire or your fireplace.
- **[01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1TruE9w7PO4&t=111s)** — You're going to get a good amount of infrared from that.
- **[01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1TruE9w7PO4&t=113s)** — Infrared also is a wonderful thing for your arteries.
- **[01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1TruE9w7PO4&t=117s)** — Especially to increase something called nitric oxide.
- **[02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1TruE9w7PO4&t=120s)** — Which helps with blood pressure.
- **[02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1TruE9w7PO4&t=121s)** — And then you also have the vitamin D from the UV.
- **[02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1TruE9w7PO4&t=125s)** — That automatically increases nitric oxide.
- **[02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1TruE9w7PO4&t=127s)** — Let's say you have swelling in your feet.
- **[02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1TruE9w7PO4&t=129s)** — Potassium is one of the best natural diuretics to get rid of excess fluid.
- **[02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1TruE9w7PO4&t=133s)** — You have to take maybe 1 to 2000 milligrams per day.
- **[02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1TruE9w7PO4&t=136s)** — The combination of getting rid of all the sugar and the starch.
- **[02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1TruE9w7PO4&t=139s)** — That's the bread, pasta, cereal, crackers, biscuits, waffles, pancakes, etc.
- **[02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1TruE9w7PO4&t=144s)** — Getting rid of those will get rid of a lot of fluid in your lower extremities.
- **[02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1TruE9w7PO4&t=150s)** — And the other thing about that is that when you consume a lot of sugar.
- **[02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1TruE9w7PO4&t=154s)** — You will deplete vitamin B1.
- **[02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1TruE9w7PO4&t=156s)** — Sometimes the pain in your toes or the bottom of your feet is related to that.
- **[02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1TruE9w7PO4&t=160s)** — And so you need to take something called benfotamine to restore it.
- **[02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1TruE9w7PO4&t=163s)** — In addition to your limiting your carbohydrates.
- **[02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1TruE9w7PO4&t=167s)** — Let's say for example you have cramps.
- **[02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1TruE9w7PO4&t=169s)** — Sometimes people think that the cramps really are poor circulation. They're not.
- **[02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1TruE9w7PO4&t=173s)** — Cramping in your calves or your feet is merely a magnesium deficiency.
- **[02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1TruE9w7PO4&t=178s)** — The thing about magnesium is that it's really hard to test for it because
- **[03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1TruE9w7PO4&t=183s)** — you only have 1% of your body magnesium in your blood.
- **[03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1TruE9w7PO4&t=186s)** — 99% is in the cells.
- **[03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1TruE9w7PO4&t=188s)** — It's a really important mineral involved with blood pressure,
- **[03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1TruE9w7PO4&t=193s)** — making energy and especially muscle because it works with calcium.
- **[03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1TruE9w7PO4&t=198s)** — It controls calcium. In fact one of the medications for blood pressure is called a calcium channel blocker.
- **[03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1TruE9w7PO4&t=205s)** — Well guess what magnesium is? It's a natural calcium channel blocker.
- **[03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1TruE9w7PO4&t=208s)** — Why don't they just use magnesium? Because you can't patent it.
- **[03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1TruE9w7PO4&t=211s)** — Magnesium is really important for blood pressure, but it's also essential to get rid of cramps.
- **[03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1TruE9w7PO4&t=216s)** — But sometimes you have to take enough over a long period of time.
- **[03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1TruE9w7PO4&t=219s)** — I recommend taking about 800 milligrams per day in the evening for some weeks
- **[03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1TruE9w7PO4&t=226s)** — until you get rid of your cramps and you can reduce it down to 400 milligrams per day.
- **[03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1TruE9w7PO4&t=230s)** — You want to take magnesium glycinate because that's the one that is the best absorbed and it doesn't cause diarrhea.
- **[03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1TruE9w7PO4&t=236s)** — Another mistake, compression stockings.
- **[03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1TruE9w7PO4&t=238s)** — If you already have problems with your arteries being constricted and you use these compression stockings,
- **[04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1TruE9w7PO4&t=244s)** — you're basically constricting blood flow. Not the best thing to do.
- **[04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1TruE9w7PO4&t=248s)** — Now let's talk about varicose veins. There's a really good remedy for that.
- **[04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1TruE9w7PO4&t=252s)** — Diasmen. And it can help with varicose veins.
- **[04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1TruE9w7PO4&t=254s)** — Another little mistake that I think people make when they have circulation problems
- **[04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1TruE9w7PO4&t=259s)** — is they start doing high intensity type exercise.
- **[04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1TruE9w7PO4&t=262s)** — If you have a problem with the lower part of your body, whether it's edema, varicose veins,
- **[04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1TruE9w7PO4&t=268s)** — you want to go light on the exercise. You do not want to do any high intense anything.
- **[04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1TruE9w7PO4&t=273s)** — Okay, you don't really want to do sprints just because there's a chance it could get worse.
- **[04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1TruE9w7PO4&t=277s)** — Walking would be the best thing. Let's go into the exercises.
- **[04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1TruE9w7PO4&t=280s)** — In this first exercise, we're going to combine elevating our legs with an ankle pump.
- **[04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1TruE9w7PO4&t=286s)** — So you will be lying on your back with your feet up on your wall
- **[04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1TruE9w7PO4&t=291s)** — while you move one foot at a time back and forth.
- **[04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1TruE9w7PO4&t=294s)** — And you're pumping the fluid from your lower extremity back to the heart.
- **[05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1TruE9w7PO4&t=300s)** — The combination of elevation and the pumping motion is great to push fluid
- **[05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1TruE9w7PO4&t=306s)** — from the lower extremity back up to where it needs to go.
- **[05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1TruE9w7PO4&t=309s)** — That's one exercise. The next one I'm going to show you is an ankle pump while you're sitting.
- **[05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1TruE9w7PO4&t=313s)** — Now, let's say you're sitting in your chair through the day.
- **[05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1TruE9w7PO4&t=316s)** — You can literally just do this ankle pumping underneath your desk.
- **[05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1TruE9w7PO4&t=320s)** — This next exercise is really, really good because it involves activating more of the muscles
- **[05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1TruE9w7PO4&t=326s)** — in your calf and in your shin at the same time.
- **[05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1TruE9w7PO4&t=329s)** — And this is called heel to toe rocking. In this first one, you're going to be holding something,
- **[05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1TruE9w7PO4&t=334s)** — whether it's a wall or something to stabilize yourself so you don't fall down.
- **[05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1TruE9w7PO4&t=338s)** — And you're basically going to go through this motion where you're rocking back
- **[05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1TruE9w7PO4&t=342s)** — and you're going to go up on your toes back and forth.
- **[05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1TruE9w7PO4&t=345s)** — You're going to do this about 10 times.
- **[05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1TruE9w7PO4&t=347s)** — And you can do that a few times through the day.
- **[05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1TruE9w7PO4&t=348s)** — But this is one of the best exercises if you want to push fluid
- **[05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1TruE9w7PO4&t=352s)** — from the lower part of the body up to the heart.
- **[05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1TruE9w7PO4&t=355s)** — And then after you get good enough, you can do this without any support
- **[05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1TruE9w7PO4&t=358s)** — and basically stand there and do this rocking motion to allow your body to adapt
- **[06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1TruE9w7PO4&t=363s)** — so you're not having to depend on holding something.
- **[06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1TruE9w7PO4&t=366s)** — I would recommend just doing it 10 times.
- **[06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1TruE9w7PO4&t=368s)** — Okay, and then do that several times during the day.
- **[06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1TruE9w7PO4&t=370s)** — Recovered circulation, edema, swelling, pain.
- **[06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1TruE9w7PO4&t=374s)** — What about cold feet? What can you do for cold feet?
- **[06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1TruE9w7PO4&t=376s)** — That is normally an iodine deficiency because the thyroid is low.
- **[06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1TruE9w7PO4&t=381s)** — C-calp is one of the best sources of iodine.
- **[06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1TruE9w7PO4&t=382s)** — You can take that. That will help strengthen your thyroid
- **[06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1TruE9w7PO4&t=385s)** — so you can actually have warmer feet.
- **[06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1TruE9w7PO4&t=387s)** — So I gave you a lot of things to do today.
- **[06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1TruE9w7PO4&t=389s)** — Go ahead and apply some of them.
- **[06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1TruE9w7PO4&t=391s)** — And then please come back and comment down below on how it worked for you.

- **[00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rra9FJ2lURI&t=0s)** — Today I'm going to talk about how to slow down the aging process. If you want to look younger,
- **[00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rra9FJ2lURI&t=5s)** — live longer, and have fewer diseases, then this video is for you. Now, I know I don't look 75
- **[00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rra9FJ2lURI&t=12s)** — years old, okay? And it's probably because I'm not 75 years old. I'm 59. But what I'm going to
- **[00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rra9FJ2lURI&t=17s)** — show you is based on a huge deep dive into this longevity topic. I'm not sure if you've ever
- **[00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rra9FJ2lURI&t=23s)** — heard of the mitochondria before, but the mitochondria is the energy factory. And so you're
- **[00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rra9FJ2lURI&t=29s)** — as your mitochondria is functioning and in good shape. So without getting into too much biochemistry,
- **[00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rra9FJ2lURI&t=37s)** — if you've taken a biology class, you may remember there's something called the Krebs
- **[00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rra9FJ2lURI&t=41s)** — cycle. And the Krebs cycle is basically a little circle. It's like an assembly line. And there's
- **[00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rra9FJ2lURI&t=48s)** — various steps and different chemicals involved in this little assembly line. And it starts
- **[00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rra9FJ2lURI&t=53s)** — with food that enters this Krebs cycle, and it ends with energy. And I think the biggest
- **[00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rra9FJ2lURI&t=58s)** — thing that was missing when I studied the Krebs cycle was something called cofactors. This Krebs
- **[01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rra9FJ2lURI&t=63s)** — cycle requires nutrients to go from A to B to C. Because if you're missing a certain nutrient,
- **[01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rra9FJ2lURI&t=70s)** — instead, it becomes bottlenecked and things back up. And you're not going to be able to
- **[01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rra9FJ2lURI&t=76s)** — make the energy. And so by this additional understanding of nutrients related to the
- **[01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rra9FJ2lURI&t=89s)** — nutrients. And the reason I'm even bringing this up is that I'm leading up to this one molecule.
- **[01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rra9FJ2lURI&t=95s)** — It's called NAD. And NAD is involved in extracting energy from food. NAD is a very
- **[01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rra9FJ2lURI&t=103s)** — vital molecule in helping you live long. And the energy that it's going to make is called ATP.
- **[01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rra9FJ2lURI&t=110s)** — It's also involved in preventing muscle loss, especially if someone has cancer. It's also
- **[01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rra9FJ2lURI&t=117s)** — involved in protecting you against radiation. And here's the big thing you need to know. As we
- **[02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rra9FJ2lURI&t=123s)** — age, the NAD decreases. Researchers have found that there's this thing that has eaten up NAD.
- **[02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rra9FJ2lURI&t=132s)** — And this thing is called CD38. In mice studies, when they're born without this CD38,
- **[02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rra9FJ2lURI&t=141s)** — they live a long life. They don't have a lot of health problems. So there are five compounds
- **[02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rra9FJ2lURI&t=147s)** — that you can start getting from your diet that can then keep your NAD very high. So you can
- **[02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rra9FJ2lURI&t=153s)** — live a long life. So let's start with the first one. It's called epigenin. Parsley has
- **[02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rra9FJ2lURI&t=158s)** — the most epigenin of all plants that I could find. The next one on the list is thyme. Then
- **[02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rra9FJ2lURI&t=164s)** — oregano, basil, celery. These are various spices and herbs that you can use on your food on a
- **[02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rra9FJ2lURI&t=171s)** — regular basis. Number two, antho xanthan. And you can get this in the following foods.
- **[02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rra9FJ2lURI&t=179s)** — Blueberries. Anything blue, purple, or even red has high amounts of this particular natural
- **[03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rra9FJ2lURI&t=187s)** — chemical. Elderberry is really also good for your immune system. Then we have the concord
- **[03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rra9FJ2lURI&t=193s)** — purple potatoes are loaded with this. The next one is called curcumin. And you might already
- **[03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rra9FJ2lURI&t=199s)** — know that one is in the turmeric spice. And then the next phytonutrient is called quercetin.
- **[03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rra9FJ2lURI&t=205s)** — And the food that has the highest quercetin is the onion. Most of the quercetin is in the
- **[03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rra9FJ2lURI&t=211s)** — outer part of the onion. So when you peel the onion, don't peel it too deep. And then
- **[03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rra9FJ2lURI&t=217s)** — we have the apple skin. Of course apples are high in sugar, right? Well, if you just ate the skin
- **[03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rra9FJ2lURI&t=223s)** — of the apple, you would get a lot of quercetin. And then the last one on the list is called
- **[03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rra9FJ2lURI&t=227s)** — methylene blue. Now, this is not a plant. This is a synthetic dye. This was actually the first
- **[03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rra9FJ2lURI&t=234s)** — drug that was ever invented. They used to use it for many different things. But it seems
- **[03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rra9FJ2lURI&t=239s)** — a good inhibitor of this CD38, which can then increase the NAD and increase your longevity.
- **[04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rra9FJ2lURI&t=247s)** — If you haven't seen my video on methylene blue, this might tie this whole topic together for
- **[04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rra9FJ2lURI&t=252s)** — you. So for that information, you should watch this video next right here.

*Click any timestamp to jump to that moment in the video*

- **[00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecu697VQopI&t=0s)** — Today we are going to talk about the number one vitamin that controls your mental health.
- **[00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecu697VQopI&t=3s)** — Thinking is a good thing, right? I mean, that's a very positive thing.
- **[00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecu697VQopI&t=7s)** — But overthinking, especially too long, especially when you're trying to go to bed at night,
- **[00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecu697VQopI&t=12s)** — can prevent you from sleeping.
- **[00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecu697VQopI&t=13s)** — When your thoughts dominate your mind and you can't turn it off
- **[00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecu697VQopI&t=17s)** — because you're solving the problems of the world, it becomes a problem,
- **[00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecu697VQopI&t=20s)** — which will also then trigger cortisol, which is more stress.
- **[00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecu697VQopI&t=24s)** — Thinking about stress will activate your physical hormones
- **[00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecu697VQopI&t=28s)** — that will put your body into a stress state.
- **[00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecu697VQopI&t=31s)** — So the question is, are the hormones causing you to do that?
- **[00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecu697VQopI&t=34s)** — Or is it your mind causing the hormones to be activated?
- **[00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecu697VQopI&t=36s)** — Well, I think both can affect each other.
- **[00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecu697VQopI&t=38s)** — But a lot of times people are stuck in this loop, thinking and thinking.
- **[00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecu697VQopI&t=42s)** — They're very, very focused on a certain problem or a certain thought
- **[00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecu697VQopI&t=46s)** — that they can't seem to unfixate their attention off that one thing.
- **[00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecu697VQopI&t=51s)** — And they end up, you know, looking at different scenarios,
- **[00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecu697VQopI&t=54s)** — different ways of solving something, speculating.
- **[00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecu697VQopI&t=57s)** — Sometimes creating stress that's not even there,
- **[01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecu697VQopI&t=60s)** — which in itself is like the definition of a problem.
- **[01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecu697VQopI&t=62s)** — It's an unresolved thing.
- **[01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecu697VQopI&t=64s)** — And then you get into this paralysis of analysis.
- **[01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecu697VQopI&t=67s)** — Another name for that is you're just stuck in your head.
- **[01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecu697VQopI&t=69s)** — The reason I'm bringing this up is that that would be the definition of anxiety, worry, feeling nervous.
- **[01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecu697VQopI&t=75s)** — And I want to talk about the nutritional imbalance involved in this.
- **[01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecu697VQopI&t=79s)** — There is a major deficiency of a certain nutrient
- **[01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecu697VQopI&t=82s)** — that can cause you to obsessively think and kind of be too stuck in your head.
- **[01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecu697VQopI&t=88s)** — And unfortunately, one of the ways that people address this is they're put on usually in SSRI.
- **[01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecu697VQopI&t=94s)** — That's a fancy name for a drug that blocks the reabsorption of serotonin.
- **[01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecu697VQopI&t=100s)** — So it basically kind of keeps the serotonin you have in your body so it doesn't go away.
- **[01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecu697VQopI&t=106s)** — But it comes with a big package.
- **[01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecu697VQopI&t=109s)** — And the package is a lot of side effects, as well as the downgrade.
- **[01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecu697VQopI&t=112s)** — of the receptor for serotonin.
- **[01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecu697VQopI&t=114s)** — So now you're extremely deficient in serotonin.
- **[01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecu697VQopI&t=117s)** — Where before you were deficient, but now it's like extremely low.
- **[02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecu697VQopI&t=121s)** — And one of the big symptoms of low serotonin is this obsessive solving problems and thinking all the time.
- **[02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecu697VQopI&t=127s)** — With the inability to unfixate your mind about a certain problem.
- **[02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecu697VQopI&t=131s)** — Of course, with this medication. Oh wow, it affects your other neurotransmitters too, like dopamine.
- **[02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecu697VQopI&t=136s)** — One of the big side effects from SSRIs.
- **[02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecu697VQopI&t=140s)** — It's called SSRI zombie syndrome.
- **[02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecu697VQopI&t=144s)** — Because you lose your emotions.
- **[02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecu697VQopI&t=147s)** — You feel numb to the world.
- **[02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecu697VQopI&t=149s)** — You start to lose your ability to get any pleasure from sex.
- **[02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecu697VQopI&t=152s)** — Now, if you've been on this medication and you have that side effect.
- **[02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecu697VQopI&t=156s)** — I do have a solution I'm going to talk about.
- **[02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecu697VQopI&t=158s)** — But I just wanted to mention if you're thinking about taking this medication, you have to be very aware of the terrible side effects that come along with it.
- **[02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecu697VQopI&t=165s)** — So that particular symptom is a very severe deficiency of serotonin and dopamine.
- **[02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecu697VQopI&t=172s)** — And so what Big Pharma has done is they have a whole bunch of other medications that manipulate other neurotransmitters in certain ways.
- **[02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecu697VQopI&t=178s)** — So there's several things that decrease serotonin.
- **[03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecu697VQopI&t=181s)** — Drugs, chronic stress, junk food, lack of sun can also create lowered amounts of dopamine.
- **[03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecu697VQopI&t=188s)** — But the big thing that will deplete your dopamine is not having enough vitamin D.
- **[03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecu697VQopI&t=192s)** — Of course, vitamin D comes from the sun.
- **[03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecu697VQopI&t=194s)** — This is why during the winter months so many people get the blues because of a lack of vitamin D.
- **[03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecu697VQopI&t=200s)** — But now you know why. Because vitamin D helps serotonin to work.
- **[03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecu697VQopI&t=202s)** — And so if you're really deficient in vitamin D, you're not only going to get anxiety, it's going to drop down to depression as well.
- **[03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecu697VQopI&t=209s)** — In fact, there's an interesting study that shows that vitamin D will create the exact same effects as a medication for depression, but of course without the side effects.
- **[03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecu697VQopI&t=220s)** — And what's missing in this mysterious puzzle is having all the microbiome.
- **[03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecu697VQopI&t=225s)** — Because if you take an antibiotic and all of a sudden you get depressed, now you know why.
- **[03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecu697VQopI&t=231s)** — Because there are certain microbes that help increase serotonin way more than others.
- **[03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecu697VQopI&t=236s)** — And those microbes are very sensitive to broad spectrum antibiotics.
- **[04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecu697VQopI&t=243s)** — And a lot of times they'll kill them off and they never come back.
- **[04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecu697VQopI&t=245s)** — And now this person is stuck in a state of stress and they don't even realize they don't connect the dots.
- **[04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecu697VQopI&t=251s)** — Instead they go for the medication and that makes it worse.
- **[04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecu697VQopI&t=254s)** — So there's two things I'm going to highly recommend.
- **[04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecu697VQopI&t=256s)** — You need to get on vitamin D immediately.
- **[04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecu697VQopI&t=258s)** — And I'm not talking about a small amount.
- **[04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecu697VQopI&t=260s)** — I'm talking about at least 10,000 or more of vitamin D3 every single day.
- **[04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecu697VQopI&t=265s)** — But there's something else that's equally as important.
- **[04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecu697VQopI&t=268s)** — Making sure that you have the right microbiome, especially the ones that are involved in serotonin.
- **[04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecu697VQopI&t=275s)** — And the microbe that affects serotonin the most out of all the other ones.
- **[04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecu697VQopI&t=280s)** — That's virtually non-existent in 96% of the population because of an antibiotic they had long ago.
- **[04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecu697VQopI&t=287s)** — Is called Elruderi.
- **[04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecu697VQopI&t=289s)** — Before you take Elruderi, I'm going to recommend that you not take it as a probiotic.
- **[04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecu697VQopI&t=295s)** — I recommend instead you take that microbe from a supplement and you make your own probiotic.
- **[05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecu697VQopI&t=300s)** — That will allow you to get the concentrations you're going to need to really fix this problem.
- **[05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecu697VQopI&t=305s)** — Because this microbe not only helps you with anxiety, but it will also increase oxytocin.
- **[05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecu697VQopI&t=311s)** — That will greatly help reduce cortisol.
- **[05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecu697VQopI&t=315s)** — And this is the antidote to what we talked about before.
- **[05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecu697VQopI&t=318s)** — If you were on an SSRI and now you're pretty much flatlined.
- **[05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecu697VQopI&t=323s)** — You don't experience pleasure anymore.
- **[05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecu697VQopI&t=325s)** — You can reestablish those feelings consuming it in a yogurt like form over a period of time.
- **[05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecu697VQopI&t=331s)** — And I have this information in other videos because it's so important.
- **[05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecu697VQopI&t=334s)** — And if you haven't seen this video, it'll show you how to make that culture with that microbe.
- **[05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecu697VQopI&t=341s)** — And I'll put it up right here.
- **[05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecu697VQopI&t=342s)** — And I will also put it down in the description.

- **[00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZB84A--178&t=0s)** — You never want to take iron supplements. Iron is the most toxic mineral that you can consume.
- **[00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZB84A--178&t=6s)** — And so if you are unknowingly taking and being exposed to too much iron over time,
- **[00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZB84A--178&t=10s)** — your organs are going to start to accumulate iron. Your tissues are going to get iron overload.
- **[00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZB84A--178&t=15s)** — Even certain people have a genetic problem where they accumulate too much iron and they cannot get
- **[00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZB84A--178&t=20s)** — rid of it, which is very dangerous. You might not even be aware of how much iron is in your
- **[00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZB84A--178&t=26s)** — I mean, this is really important because you might not even be aware of how you are getting
- **[00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZB84A--178&t=30s)** — exposed to iron from all sorts of strange places. Let me just kind of cover all the risk factors
- **[00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZB84A--178&t=37s)** — if you have iron overload. Number one, cancer, especially colorectal. Number two,
- **[00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZB84A--178&t=42s)** — liver disease. I am talking about scar tissue, inflammation of the liver, which leads to cirrhosis.
- **[00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZB84A--178&t=47s)** — Heart disease, because if you think about iron, think about rust. It rusts the inside of your
- **[00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZB84A--178&t=52s)** — body if you have too much. Low testosterone, low libido, diabetes, chronic fatigue syndrome,
- **[00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZB84A--178&t=58s)** — infertility, neural degeneration, and a wide range of inflammatory diseases. You know,
- **[01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZB84A--178&t=64s)** — I did a video on iron deficiency being the most common mineral deficiency. At the same time,
- **[01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZB84A--178&t=69s)** — it is the most dangerous if you are getting too much. A toxic amount of iron is the most
- **[01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZB84A--178&t=77s)** — diagnosed, overlooked condition in relationship to all the vitamins and minerals. And so,
- **[01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZB84A--178&t=83s)** — let's just cover the common ways that you get iron that you might not even be aware of.
- **[01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZB84A--178&t=88s)** — One way that people are being overloaded is with their supplements, especially the one-a-days.
- **[01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZB84A--178&t=93s)** — I do not recommend getting a one-a-day supplement with iron. And you do not absorb
- **[01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZB84A--178&t=98s)** — much, which means a lot of it accumulates and sits around in your digestive tract,
- **[01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZB84A--178&t=104s)** — which means that it is time to cause constipation, nausea, diarrhea, bloating,
- **[01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZB84A--178&t=111s)** — irritation in the colon. You really only absorb like 10% of it, and the rest is kind of
- **[01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZB84A--178&t=116s)** — irritates the digestive tract. The type of iron that most people are taking through
- **[02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZB84A--178&t=122s)** — supplements is the type that will feed pathogens in your digestive tract. Pathogens love to eat
- **[02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZB84A--178&t=132s)** — and you can very easily get an overgrowth of pathogens by giving them too much of the iron
- **[02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZB84A--178&t=138s)** — food. The heme iron in red meat and even in fish get absorbed a lot more, at least 35%
- **[02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZB84A--178&t=146s)** — absorption, and it goes right into the blood, which means there is very little free iron that
- **[02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZB84A--178&t=152s)** — is left in the digestive tract. Plus, in red meat you have a lot of other nutrients
- **[02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZB84A--178&t=156s)** — like vitamin B2, B3, B1, B12, zinc, selenium, and high quality protein, which can then act to
- **[02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZB84A--178&t=164s)** — help balance out iron as compared to just like taking a supplement with higher amounts of iron.
- **[02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZB84A--178&t=170s)** — Let me just first touch on this genetic problem with iron. This is not as rare as you might
- **[02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZB84A--178&t=175s)** — think, and what is interesting in that condition is the person usually has way too much iron
- **[03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZB84A--178&t=180s)** — in their body, but at the same time they are deficient. And that is really the theme of this
- **[03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZB84A--178&t=186s)** — video. When people have too much iron or they have not enough iron, they really have a iron
- **[03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZB84A--178&t=192s)** — dysfunction. It's not as simple as just taking more iron and solving the problem. Beyond the
- **[03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZB84A--178&t=198s)** — one a day supplement, you also have iron supplements, which I'm... I highly recommend you
- **[03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZB84A--178&t=202s)** — never take those. Again, get your iron from actual food. If you're menstruating, for example,
- **[03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZB84A--178&t=206s)** — and you're losing blood, eat more red meat, or take grass-fed liver pills. When you consume
- **[03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZB84A--178&t=211s)** — bread or pasta in the U.S., it is so heavy with iron, it's going to sit in your gut. You're
- **[03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZB84A--178&t=217s)** — going to feel so bloated because the iron is messing with your microbes and it's irritating
- **[03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZB84A--178&t=221s)** — your gut because it's not absorbed that well. But the grains itself don't help. Just look on
- **[03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZB84A--178&t=226s)** — the back of the label with every junk food that you would eat. They have iron added,
- **[03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZB84A--178&t=230s)** — but you might not even read it as iron. I'm just going to give you three different types of
- **[04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZB84A--178&t=244s)** — iron. Supplements, fortification, cast iron pots. When you cook with cast iron,
- **[04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZB84A--178&t=250s)** — you're leaching out a lot of the wrong type of iron. If you drink a lot of alcohol,
- **[04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZB84A--178&t=255s)** — your liver is going to get damaged. And if you have any liver damage at all,
- **[04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZB84A--178&t=260s)** — that alone can cause you to accumulate iron. The biggest way that most people have
- **[04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZB84A--178&t=265s)** — functional iron is a lack of copper. Copper is more higher level and helps control iron.
- **[04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZB84A--178&t=274s)** — There are many, many different enzymes that are dependent on copper that relate directly to the
- **[04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZB84A--178&t=281s)** — control of iron. The first enzyme with copper converts iron to a form that is less
- **[04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZB84A--178&t=290s)** — accumulative in your body. It changes this toxic iron into something that's safer.
- **[04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZB84A--178&t=295s)** — Copper also allows you to transport iron through the body. If you don't have copper,
- **[05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZB84A--178&t=301s)** — you can't transport iron effectively, so you accumulate iron. Copper is involved in a very
- **[05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZB84A--178&t=306s)** — powerful antioxidant to reduce oxidation that comes from iron. When you combine iron
- **[05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZB84A--178&t=314s)** — with something in the body called hydrogen peroxide, which your body makes, certain cells
- **[05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZB84A--178&t=319s)** — you form one of the most deadly free radicals in existence. It creates the most damage in the
- **[05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZB84A--178&t=323s)** — body and it comes from hydrogen peroxide and iron. Copper helps reduce this oxidative
- **[05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZB84A--178&t=330s)** — stress, this rusting out in the body. Copper is necessary to make
- **[05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZB84A--178&t=335s)** — heme. This is the protein that allows iron to carry oxygen. You're saying,
- **[05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZB84A--178&t=340s)** — well, wait a second, I don't think I'm deficient in copper. I want to give you
- **[05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZB84A--178&t=343s)** — some data on that too, because you might be deficient in copper. I'm not telling you to
- **[05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZB84A--178&t=347s)** — take a copper supplement because just as we have copper deficiencies, there's also a copper
- **[05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZB84A--178&t=352s)** — toxicity problem as well. Let me just quickly go down the list of things that really create a
- **[05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZB84A--178&t=357s)** — copper deficiency. One is glyphosate. The chemical, roundup ready, binds more to the
- **[06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZB84A--178&t=362s)** — copper than any other mineral in the ground. If you're eating any food with that glyphosate,
- **[06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZB84A--178&t=368s)** — boy, you are not getting any copper at all. A lot of the farming methods now just completely
- **[06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZB84A--178&t=373s)** — destroy the soil. So you're not getting these trace minerals, especially copper.
- **[06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZB84A--178&t=377s)** — Certain antibiotics work by depleting copper. So that's another way to become copper deficient.
- **[06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZB84A--178&t=382s)** — High fructose corn syrup blocks copper absorption big time. When you consume any of the cereals
- **[06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZB84A--178&t=390s)** — or the breads with the wheat products, that can bind up the copper as well. The point I'm
- **[06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZB84A--178&t=396s)** — trying to bring to your awareness is that iron deficiency anemia is really iron dysfunctional
- **[06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZB84A--178&t=402s)** — which many times is related to a mere copper deficiency. And so the best foods for copper are
- **[06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZB84A--178&t=412s)** — oysters, shellfish, organ meats. Like I said in the beginning, never take iron supplements.
- **[06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZB84A--178&t=419s)** — Get your iron from actual food, animal food. Don't forget the copper as well because many
- **[07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZB84A--178&t=425s)** — people have a problem with iron simply because they're deficient in copper. And if you want
- **[07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZB84A--178&t=429s)** — a little more information about copper, you should check out this video right here.

## Full Transcript with Timestamps

*Click any timestamp to jump to that moment in the video*

- **[00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MW_D2Sdlr3k&t=0s)** — Now, there's some pretty strange, very unique, different symptoms with a B3 niacin deficiency
- **[00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MW_D2Sdlr3k&t=9s)** — that you need to know about because you might have these.
- **[00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MW_D2Sdlr3k&t=12s)** — You're dealing with the four D's. Dermatitis, really bad skin reactions, diarrhea, dementia,
- **[00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MW_D2Sdlr3k&t=20s)** — and the fourth one is death. Other than that, you're perfectly fine.
- **[00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MW_D2Sdlr3k&t=24s)** — But let's go through the subclinical symptoms, okay? And this might shock you. And we're
- **[00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MW_D2Sdlr3k&t=29s)** — talking about subclinical, we're talking about not a major deficiency. You're deficient to
- **[00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MW_D2Sdlr3k&t=34s)** — a certain degree. Number one, you might lose this sense of taste.
- **[00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MW_D2Sdlr3k&t=38s)** — Number two, you might have a metallic taste in your mouth or rancid taste in your mouth.
- **[00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MW_D2Sdlr3k&t=45s)** — That could be a niacin deficiency. And the good thing about that is just by taking
- **[00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MW_D2Sdlr3k&t=50s)** — it within a week, that could resolve it, depending on how deficient you are.
- **[00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MW_D2Sdlr3k&t=53s)** — The next one is a loss of smell. Normally we think about zinc being a deficiency
- **[00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MW_D2Sdlr3k&t=58s)** — of smell, but it can also be niacin. Or you might have a change in your smell.
- **[01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MW_D2Sdlr3k&t=64s)** — Things don't smell like they should. Next one is when you're looking in the
- **[01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MW_D2Sdlr3k&t=68s)** — mirror, your face is moving a little bit, okay? That's pretty wild. It might
- **[01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MW_D2Sdlr3k&t=75s)** — not necessarily be moving, but it could be changing shapes. When you read
- **[01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MW_D2Sdlr3k&t=79s)** — a book, you notice that the words and the page tend to move a little bit.
- **[01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MW_D2Sdlr3k&t=84s)** — When you're walking on the ground, the ground seems to be a little unstable or
- **[01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MW_D2Sdlr3k&t=89s)** — could be moving a little bit. You may also have fatigue or just the feeling
- **[01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MW_D2Sdlr3k&t=93s)** — like you can't relax. These are all subclinical niacin deficiencies.
- **[01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MW_D2Sdlr3k&t=98s)** — Now the major deficiency is called polygra. And just so you know, to correct
- **[01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MW_D2Sdlr3k&t=104s)** — these deficiencies, you can't just take the normal RDAs, which is like
- **[01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MW_D2Sdlr3k&t=109s)** — 20 milligrams. You'd have to take large amounts. And you can take niacin or
- **[01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MW_D2Sdlr3k&t=115s)** — niacinamide, which is the non-flush version, but you'd probably need amounts
- **[01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MW_D2Sdlr3k&t=119s)** — like six grams per day. That's a lot. But that's what it takes to correct
- **[02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MW_D2Sdlr3k&t=125s)** — some of these deficiencies. One big reason why we need niacin is for
- **[02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MW_D2Sdlr3k&t=130s)** — our mitochondria. It's called NAD. It helps you extract electrons from
- **[02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MW_D2Sdlr3k&t=135s)** — which is your energy currency. B3 directly is the precursor for this.
- **[02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MW_D2Sdlr3k&t=141s)** — And also having sufficient amounts of niacin, you can produce more energy
- **[02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MW_D2Sdlr3k&t=145s)** — from the food that you eat. You can support something called sirtuins,
- **[02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MW_D2Sdlr3k&t=149s)** — which is involved in longevity and DNA repair. I mean, if you think
- **[02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MW_D2Sdlr3k&t=154s)** — about most diseases, they really originate from the mitochondria.
- **[02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MW_D2Sdlr3k&t=159s)** — In all these degenerative diseases, you're going to see a great
- **[02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MW_D2Sdlr3k&t=162s)** — deficiency of this NAD, and especially in diseases that are related to
- **[02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MW_D2Sdlr3k&t=166s)** — aging, okay? Because as you age, your NAD gets less and less and less.
- **[02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MW_D2Sdlr3k&t=172s)** — Tryptophan can actually turn into niacin. Tryptophan also converts
- **[02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MW_D2Sdlr3k&t=177s)** — to serotonin and then melatonin for your sleep. But B3 is super
- **[03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MW_D2Sdlr3k&t=183s)** — important for your skin. I mean, think about what a deficiency will
- **[03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MW_D2Sdlr3k&t=188s)** — severe, scaly, damaged skin. So it's super beneficial for the skin,
- **[03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MW_D2Sdlr3k&t=193s)** — for acne, psoriasis. If you take the form of B3 as niacinamide,
- **[03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MW_D2Sdlr3k&t=200s)** — that can actually help you more with inflammatory conditions
- **[03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MW_D2Sdlr3k&t=203s)** — like rheumatoid arthritis, any of the arthritis.
- **[03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MW_D2Sdlr3k&t=207s)** — But the niacin version greatly helps your lipids, cholesterol, LDL, HDL.
- **[03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MW_D2Sdlr3k&t=214s)** — It was really, really popular before we came out with statins.
- **[03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MW_D2Sdlr3k&t=218s)** — And of course now with recent research, we found that no longer has
- **[03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MW_D2Sdlr3k&t=222s)** — any benefits, right? Well, if someone told me that niacin doesn't do
- **[03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MW_D2Sdlr3k&t=226s)** — anything, I would ask them, what happens when you become
- **[03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MW_D2Sdlr3k&t=229s)** — deficient in niacin? And if we take a look at what foods
- **[03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MW_D2Sdlr3k&t=233s)** — are high in B3, you're going to find high levels of B3 in animal
- **[03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MW_D2Sdlr3k&t=239s)** — meat products, as well as liver, organ meats,
- **[04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MW_D2Sdlr3k&t=243s)** — but definitely red meat for sure at the top of the list. It's in other foods
- **[04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MW_D2Sdlr3k&t=247s)** — too, but not to the degree that it's in
- **[04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MW_D2Sdlr3k&t=249s)** — animal foods. But you can also get it from nutritional yeast.
- **[04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MW_D2Sdlr3k&t=252s)** — If you're going to get it from nutritional yeast, I would recommend
- **[04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MW_D2Sdlr3k&t=255s)** — getting it without the added synthetic vitamins that
- **[04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MW_D2Sdlr3k&t=258s)** — they normally put in there. You can also get it from spirulina as
- **[04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MW_D2Sdlr3k&t=262s)** — well. There's a tremendous amount of research on niacin
- **[04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MW_D2Sdlr3k&t=265s)** — for cholesterol, the heart, and many other conditions. I was surprised on
- **[04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MW_D2Sdlr3k&t=270s)** — how much research there is on this topic. And even for schizophrenia,
- **[04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MW_D2Sdlr3k&t=275s)** — depression, bipolar, all sorts of mood disorders. How do we become
- **[04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MW_D2Sdlr3k&t=281s)** — deficient? Processed foods can create a B3 deficiency. Processed corn,
- **[04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MW_D2Sdlr3k&t=288s)** — processed grains, wheat, cereal, things like that. The more protein
- **[04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MW_D2Sdlr3k&t=292s)** — in carbs that you eat, the more the requirement for B3 is going to be
- **[04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MW_D2Sdlr3k&t=296s)** — because B3 is intimately involved in helping you
- **[05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MW_D2Sdlr3k&t=300s)** — extract energy out of food. But of course, if you're eating the right
- **[05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MW_D2Sdlr3k&t=304s)** — foods, you'll have your B3 that's already in these foods
- **[05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MW_D2Sdlr3k&t=307s)** — versus the refined foods or the ultra processed foods.
- **[05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MW_D2Sdlr3k&t=311s)** — Pregnancy. Being an alcoholic, COVID-19 can increase the demand
- **[05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MW_D2Sdlr3k&t=317s)** — for B3. Therefore, explaining a lot of the symptoms with a lack of
- **[05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MW_D2Sdlr3k&t=321s)** — smell and taste. Yes, it can be a zinc deficiency, but don't forget
- **[05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MW_D2Sdlr3k&t=326s)** — about niacin. And of course, if you're on medications, a lot of
- **[05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MW_D2Sdlr3k&t=329s)** — your need for B3 goes way up as well. And I think a lot of people
- **[05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MW_D2Sdlr3k&t=334s)** — might be concerned with the flushing of the niacin. Well, you can
- **[05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MW_D2Sdlr3k&t=339s)** — use the non-flush version unless you have a specific problem with
- **[05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MW_D2Sdlr3k&t=344s)** — cholesterol and you want to lower the cholesterol, you need the
- **[05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MW_D2Sdlr3k&t=347s)** — flushing version. But you can just start off very small and then
- **[05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MW_D2Sdlr3k&t=352s)** — gradually over time increase it to the point where your body will
- **[05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MW_D2Sdlr3k&t=355s)** — adapt to the flushing. I personally don't mind the flushing. It's not
- **[05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MW_D2Sdlr3k&t=358s)** — dangerous, but sometimes people think they're allergic to it.
- **[06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MW_D2Sdlr3k&t=361s)** — They're not. People take niacin also for a fatty liver. And
- **[06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MW_D2Sdlr3k&t=365s)** — overall, there are certain things that increase the demand for
- **[06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MW_D2Sdlr3k&t=368s)** — niacin like I've talked about. Or it could just be you have a
- **[06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MW_D2Sdlr3k&t=372s)** — deficiency in your diet. Now, since we are on the topic of
- **[06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MW_D2Sdlr3k&t=377s)** — nutrients, if you have not seen my video on zinc, it's a real
- **[06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MW_D2Sdlr3k&t=381s)** — popular one, very interesting. You should check that one out as
- **[06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MW_D2Sdlr3k&t=384s)** — well. I put that up right here.

- **[00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XH-mc-yMMbA&t=9s)** — Now, what prompted me to do this video is a while ago, I went to this event where a five-star chef cooked for us and we were participating in the cooking.
- **[00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XH-mc-yMMbA&t=19s)** — And so I was in charge of making the salad dressing. And so I asked him, well, okay, what do I do? He says, uh, just go ahead and wing it.
- **[00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XH-mc-yMMbA&t=25s)** — There's some spices over there. Go ahead and make it. I'm sure it'll be fine. I don't have a lot of experience in this topic.
- **[00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XH-mc-yMMbA&t=31s)** — I usually just use two ingredients, olive oil and balsamic vinaigrette. So I started to put a bunch of things together and then he came by and tasted it.
- **[00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XH-mc-yMMbA&t=40s)** — And he just looked at me like, what the hell did you do? And I said, uh, I don't know. I just threw some things together.
- **[00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XH-mc-yMMbA&t=48s)** — He goes, Eric, it's obvious. It's obvious to make this. I said, no, it's not obvious.
- **[00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XH-mc-yMMbA&t=52s)** — To make something taste good, you have to have the combination of certain herbs and things, or else it could be a disaster.
- **[01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XH-mc-yMMbA&t=60s)** — The problem with salad dressings is trying to find one that is edible. That doesn't have all these high omega-6 fatty acids.
- **[01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XH-mc-yMMbA&t=67s)** — I mean, it's really hard to find something just with pure olive oil. Even the ones with olive oil have additional oils.
- **[01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XH-mc-yMMbA&t=73s)** — So the benefit of adding olive oil to your salad is this. A lot of the phytonutrients in salad, like these very important
- **[01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XH-mc-yMMbA&t=81s)** — health promoting chemicals in plants, especially salad, go way beyond just vitamins and minerals.
- **[01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XH-mc-yMMbA&t=89s)** — The phytonutrients or the phytochemicals in salad are fat soluble, which means we need to eat them with some type of fat or oil.
- **[01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XH-mc-yMMbA&t=99s)** — And I'm going to recommend use a high quality extra virgin olive oil. So these six salad dressings that I'm going to talk about
- **[01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XH-mc-yMMbA&t=105s)** — will add some additional health benefits that go way beyond just the salad itself.
- **[01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XH-mc-yMMbA&t=110s)** — Now of course salad is loaded with potassium, magnesium, folate, vitamin C, as well as all these phytonutrients.
- **[01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XH-mc-yMMbA&t=118s)** — But the salad dressing itself can really take it to the next level. So these salad dressings that I'm going to recommend
- **[02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XH-mc-yMMbA&t=124s)** — are all wrapped around this base of extra virgin olive oil, lemon juice, and apple cider vinegar.
- **[02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XH-mc-yMMbA&t=133s)** — And then what you do is you put this mixture, this base, in a 16 ounce mason jar in your fridge.
- **[02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XH-mc-yMMbA&t=139s)** — So every time you eat a salad you take out this mixture and in a little bowl you take about a
- **[02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XH-mc-yMMbA&t=145s)** — fourth of a cup or you know up to a half of a cup depending on how big your salad is.
- **[02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XH-mc-yMMbA&t=150s)** — Then you add your spices, mix it up, and pour it on your salad. So let's first talk about this
- **[02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XH-mc-yMMbA&t=155s)** — base that you're going to make. Okay this is these three ingredients. What are the ratios?
- **[02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XH-mc-yMMbA&t=160s)** — It comes out to a third of a cup of extra virgin olive oil, a fourth of a cup of apple cider vinegar,
- **[02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XH-mc-yMMbA&t=166s)** — and two tablespoons of lemon juice. So let's first talk about the first combination. This could be
- **[02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XH-mc-yMMbA&t=173s)** — called the apple cider vinaigrette. You're going to add one tablespoon of mustard. Some people
- **[02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XH-mc-yMMbA&t=178s)** — use Dijon. You'll take one clove of garlic, minced, a pinch of sea salt, and a dash of
- **[03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XH-mc-yMMbA&t=185s)** — pepper. Mix it up, pour it on your salad. All right so the next combination is the French
- **[03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XH-mc-yMMbA&t=190s)** — dressing. We're going to add one teaspoon of dried tarragon, half a teaspoon of dried thyme,
- **[03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XH-mc-yMMbA&t=197s)** — a fourth of a teaspoon of dried lavender, and a pinch of ground pepper. Very delicious.
- **[03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XH-mc-yMMbA&t=203s)** — Another one to try is the Italian version. For this one we're going to use one teaspoon
- **[03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XH-mc-yMMbA&t=207s)** — of dried oregano, half a teaspoon of dried basil, a fourth of a teaspoon of crushed garlic,
- **[03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XH-mc-yMMbA&t=214s)** — and just a little pinch of crushed red pepper. So I really like that combination. Very delicious.
- **[03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XH-mc-yMMbA&t=220s)** — All right, next one. Mediterranean. With this one you're going to use one teaspoon of dried
- **[03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XH-mc-yMMbA&t=225s)** — rosemary, half a teaspoon of dried mint, a fourth of a teaspoon of sumac, with just one
- **[03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XH-mc-yMMbA&t=231s)** — little pinch of sea salt. All right, just to keep things interesting, let's give you two more.
- **[03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XH-mc-yMMbA&t=236s)** — This one is the Asian version. For this one you're going to add to the base one teaspoon
- **[04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XH-mc-yMMbA&t=241s)** — of toasted sesame seeds, one half of a teaspoon of dried ginger, one fourth of a teaspoon
- **[04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XH-mc-yMMbA&t=247s)** — crushed peppercorn, and a splash of tamari. And let's not forget the Indian version,
- **[04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XH-mc-yMMbA&t=253s)** — okay, for my friends in India. For this one we're going to add to the base one teaspoon
- **[04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XH-mc-yMMbA&t=258s)** — of ground coriander, one half teaspoon of ground turmeric, one fourth of a teaspoon of ground
- **[04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XH-mc-yMMbA&t=264s)** — cinnamon, with a pinch of dried cardamom. So I think these six recipes will keep things very
- **[04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XH-mc-yMMbA&t=271s)** — interesting for you. It'll actually keep the variety there. If you have not seen my video
- **[04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XH-mc-yMMbA&t=276s)** — on the quantity of salad that a person should be consuming, which is seven to ten cups,
- **[04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XH-mc-yMMbA&t=281s)** — you really need to watch this one right here.

- **[00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VkP4tqGhdY&t=0s)** — Today I'm going to give you a really good, effective protocol for gout. And so the question
- **[00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VkP4tqGhdY&t=5s)** — that I get a lot of times with remedies is like, if it's so effective, why don't
- **[00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VkP4tqGhdY&t=9s)** — doctors recommend it? Well, because it's not medical care. There's not a lot of money in
- **[00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VkP4tqGhdY&t=15s)** — these natural remedies. You can't actually patent some of these remedies. Well, actually,
- **[00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VkP4tqGhdY&t=19s)** — that's not true because I find a lot of great protocols from patents, which in this case,
- **[00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VkP4tqGhdY&t=25s)** — I'm going to put a link down below with a patent on a certain combination, but we're not using the
- **[00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VkP4tqGhdY&t=30s)** — whole combination. We're using something very specific to help with gout. So why am I doing
- **[00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VkP4tqGhdY&t=35s)** — this video? What's wrong with the current medical treatment for gout? Well, the medication
- **[00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VkP4tqGhdY&t=40s)** — that they recommend has side effects, whereas natural remedies have much less side effects,
- **[00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VkP4tqGhdY&t=46s)** — if any. And so let's just dive right in. So what is gout? Gout is a situation where
- **[00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VkP4tqGhdY&t=50s)** — you have a buildup of uric acid, and for some reason it's building up crystals in certain
- **[00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VkP4tqGhdY&t=55s)** — places in your body. Primarily it's in the big toe, but it can be in other places as well.
- **[01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VkP4tqGhdY&t=62s)** — They've determined that almost 24% of the cases is genetic related, but even if you
- **[01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VkP4tqGhdY&t=67s)** — have a genetic propensity to get gout, there's still things you can do. We're going to use a
- **[01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VkP4tqGhdY&t=73s)** — strategy. Okay, we want to use natural remedies, things that will help excrete uric acid. And
- **[01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VkP4tqGhdY&t=79s)** — also want things that will help get rid of pain directly if there's a gout attack. Now,
- **[01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VkP4tqGhdY&t=86s)** — alipurinol, the main medication for gout, works by inhibiting an enzyme. It's called xanthine
- **[01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VkP4tqGhdY&t=92s)** — oxidase. So this medication inhibits that enzyme. But I want to give you some natural
- **[01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VkP4tqGhdY&t=98s)** — inhibitors that have virtually no side effects. The other thing to talk about is your diet.
- **[01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VkP4tqGhdY&t=104s)** — If you look up gout, they're going to have you recommend a lot of different foods,
- **[01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VkP4tqGhdY&t=108s)** — especially proteins. But I found that if you eliminate sugar, especially fructose,
- **[01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VkP4tqGhdY&t=115s)** — and of course, alcohol, especially beer, you're going to be a lot more successful.
- **[02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VkP4tqGhdY&t=120s)** — And generally speaking, there's two things that can be done to reduce the intensity of gout.
- **[02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VkP4tqGhdY&t=127s)** — Number one is just drinking more water to dilute the concentration of uric acid. And
- **[02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VkP4tqGhdY&t=132s)** — two, raising the pH of your urine. You'll have less precipitation of this uric acid forming
- **[02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VkP4tqGhdY&t=140s)** — in the joints. One more really important point I want to mention. This protocol I'm going to
- **[02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VkP4tqGhdY&t=145s)** — give you, I would recommend to do it for at least two to three weeks. Number one is called
- **[02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VkP4tqGhdY&t=152s)** — white Chinese mulberry extract. There's some great research on this. And all the research,
- **[02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VkP4tqGhdY&t=159s)** — I'm just going to put links down below. Well, this remedy, mulberry, has a certain
- **[02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VkP4tqGhdY&t=163s)** — phytonutrient that can inhibit that enzyme that forms uric acid. The next recommendation
- **[02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VkP4tqGhdY&t=169s)** — is Chinese cinnamon. The scientific name is called cinnamomum cassia. And you can probably
- **[02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VkP4tqGhdY&t=177s)** — find this in a powder or a capsule. Chinese cinnamon has some fascinating principles. It's
- **[03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VkP4tqGhdY&t=189s)** — other additional properties to help with blood sugars and insulin resistance.
- **[03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VkP4tqGhdY&t=195s)** — And so it can help you in various ways. Diabetics, for example, or people that are
- **[03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VkP4tqGhdY&t=200s)** — pre-diabetic or have insulin resistance, have a much greater risk of getting gout than
- **[03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VkP4tqGhdY&t=206s)** — people that don't. And the third would be omega-3 fatty acids. And yes, you can use
- **[03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VkP4tqGhdY&t=211s)** — fish oils. I recommend cod liver oil because it adds two additional things, vitamin A and
- **[03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VkP4tqGhdY&t=216s)** — vitamin D. Vitamin A is good for your kidneys. And vitamin D is also good as a natural
- **[03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VkP4tqGhdY&t=222s)** — anti-inflammatory. But there's some interesting research that shows that when you take omega-3
- **[03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VkP4tqGhdY&t=227s)** — in sufficient quantities, it can act as an anti-inflammatory, but it can also inhibit
- **[03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VkP4tqGhdY&t=233s)** — the enzyme that forms uric acid. All right, so the next remedy, and this is specifically
- **[03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VkP4tqGhdY&t=237s)** — to help excrete excessive amounts of uric acid, I would recommend alpha-lipoic acid.
- **[04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VkP4tqGhdY&t=245s)** — Alpha-lipoic acid is also beneficial for peripheral neuropathy if you're a diabetic
- **[04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VkP4tqGhdY&t=252s)** — and you have nerve pain, but it can help get rid of uric acid. And as a side note,
- **[04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VkP4tqGhdY&t=258s)** — there's many theories about why people get gout. I think what happens with people with gout,
- **[04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VkP4tqGhdY&t=265s)** — their kidney just has a very difficult time getting rid of uric acid. So the more you
- **[04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VkP4tqGhdY&t=275s)** — function, you're going to have much less gout. But with gout patients,
- **[04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VkP4tqGhdY&t=281s)** — they're just reabsorbing a lot more uric acid than they should. The last two remedies
- **[04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VkP4tqGhdY&t=286s)** — are mainly for gout attacks. So the first remedy is devil's claw. Another name for this
- **[04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VkP4tqGhdY&t=294s)** — would be cat's claw because the flowers look like a claw. But devil's claw is in one study
- **[05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VkP4tqGhdY&t=301s)** — just as effective as Vioxx, which they took off the market. But it's a very potent anti-inflammatory.
- **[05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VkP4tqGhdY&t=308s)** — And so you can take it to get rid of really any type of pain, arthritis pain, but definitely
- **[05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VkP4tqGhdY&t=314s)** — gout pain. And the last remedy is from the Brazilian rainforest. It's called ipo-ruru. And
- **[05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VkP4tqGhdY&t=320s)** — this herb is also another potent anti-inflammatory. And it can act as a COX-2 inhibitor. So
- **[05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VkP4tqGhdY&t=328s)** — that's how aspirin works. And when someone has gout, a lot of times they're recommended
- **[05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VkP4tqGhdY&t=333s)** — aspirin or other types of NSAIDs, non-steroidal anti-inflammatories. But this remedy from the
- **[05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VkP4tqGhdY&t=341s)** — Brazil rainforest can act as a natural NSAID to help decrease pain. Now, the last point
- **[05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VkP4tqGhdY&t=347s)** — I want to bring up, there's some great data on your microbes in your gut helping you break
- **[05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VkP4tqGhdY&t=352s)** — down this uric acid. And so one thing I would add to your diet to help bring up certain microbes,
- **[05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VkP4tqGhdY&t=359s)** — to help you fight this, would be eating certain foods that are more probiotic, like the
- **[06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VkP4tqGhdY&t=365s)** — sauerkraut, the kimchi. I would highly recommend doing that as well as consuming enough good
- **[06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VkP4tqGhdY&t=370s)** — salad that's healthy, that can feed the microbes, because there's some additional data
- **[06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VkP4tqGhdY&t=375s)** — that when the microbes eat this fiber, they make something called a small chain fatty acid
- **[06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VkP4tqGhdY&t=382s)** — called butyrate, which is also great for gout. Now before you go, to get more information on how
- **[06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VkP4tqGhdY&t=388s)** — to alkalize your urine, I created this video for you and I'll put it up right here. Check it out.

- **[00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7g1gKyzL94&t=0s)** — The number one best way to remove dental plaque, aka tartar.
- **[00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7g1gKyzL94&t=6s)** — I stumbled on something that's a game changer.
- **[00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7g1gKyzL94&t=8s)** — It's not only going to get rid of your tartar, it will also help you prevent cavities.
- **[00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7g1gKyzL94&t=14s)** — This is going to be really important with children as well as adults.
- **[00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7g1gKyzL94&t=17s)** — Plaque and tartar are biofilm.
- **[00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7g1gKyzL94&t=20s)** — When you think about biofilm, think of like this protective shield
- **[00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7g1gKyzL94&t=24s)** — against your immune system that's in your mouth.
- **[00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7g1gKyzL94&t=26s)** — So the bacteria make this biofilm, this shield out of calcium,
- **[00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7g1gKyzL94&t=30s)** — and it's made by a certain microbe called streptococcus mutans.
- **[00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7g1gKyzL94&t=35s)** — This is also the one that's involved in making cavities as well.
- **[00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7g1gKyzL94&t=38s)** — So when you consume sugar and especially starches,
- **[00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7g1gKyzL94&t=41s)** — that microbe will make a ton of acid.
- **[00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7g1gKyzL94&t=43s)** — And then it takes the sugar and then it starts making this glue-like substance
- **[00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7g1gKyzL94&t=47s)** — that then starts creating a shield or this biofilm gel, aka tartar.
- **[00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7g1gKyzL94&t=52s)** — And unfortunately, the acid is now trapped against your tooth,
- **[00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7g1gKyzL94&t=57s)** — causing a breakdown of the actual enamel.
- **[00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7g1gKyzL94&t=59s)** — And what's even more wild, they found this microbe in other places in your body,
- **[01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7g1gKyzL94&t=65s)** — including on the valves of your heart.
- **[01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7g1gKyzL94&t=68s)** — But not only that, hidden deep in the plaque in your arteries,
- **[01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7g1gKyzL94&t=72s)** — you'll find this microbe.
- **[01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7g1gKyzL94&t=73s)** — One thing you should also know is what's worse than just sugar
- **[01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7g1gKyzL94&t=76s)** — is when you add a sugar and a starch.
- **[01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7g1gKyzL94&t=79s)** — That will form a glue that kind of sticks to your teeth even more than the sugar.
- **[01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7g1gKyzL94&t=83s)** — How do we remove this plaque?
- **[01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7g1gKyzL94&t=85s)** — Okay, of course, number one, stop eating sugar and starches.
- **[01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7g1gKyzL94&t=89s)** — Number two, hydrogen peroxide, 3%.
- **[01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7g1gKyzL94&t=92s)** — Make sure it's food grade and use a half of a teaspoon.
- **[01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7g1gKyzL94&t=96s)** — Hydrogen peroxide is very good to start breaking down this biofilm
- **[01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7g1gKyzL94&t=100s)** — and also make your teeth a little bit whiter.
- **[01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7g1gKyzL94&t=102s)** — And then you're going to use half of a teaspoon of baking soda.
- **[01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7g1gKyzL94&t=105s)** — All right, so why are we using baking soda?
- **[01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7g1gKyzL94&t=107s)** — Well, it's a mild abrasive material that will help to cleanse the teeth.
- **[01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7g1gKyzL94&t=112s)** — The big purpose is to alkalize the acidity in your mouth
- **[01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7g1gKyzL94&t=116s)** — because baking soda is alkaline.
- **[01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7g1gKyzL94&t=118s)** — And by the way, your body makes that as well.
- **[02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7g1gKyzL94&t=121s)** — Your pancreas makes it to help neutralize the acids coming from the stomach.
- **[02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7g1gKyzL94&t=124s)** — And then we're going to use three drops of the absolute best essential oil, clove oil.
- **[02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7g1gKyzL94&t=131s)** — It helps to disrupt the biofilm and start breaking down the tartar.
- **[02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7g1gKyzL94&t=135s)** — It also has other benefits of decreasing pain in your mouth.
- **[02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7g1gKyzL94&t=139s)** — But you're going to use three drops of this essential oil.
- **[02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7g1gKyzL94&t=142s)** — So now I want to talk about this additional ingredient, microcrystalline hydroxyapatite powder.
- **[02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7g1gKyzL94&t=150s)** — Okay, you can buy this on Amazon.
- **[02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7g1gKyzL94&t=152s)** — It's not that expensive, but it's a powder of very tiny crystals of a material that bone is made out of.
- **[02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7g1gKyzL94&t=160s)** — And you're going to mix a half of a teaspoon with these other ingredients.
- **[02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7g1gKyzL94&t=163s)** — They can go into the small little crevices, the little cavities, and remineralize the bone tissue
- **[02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7g1gKyzL94&t=170s)** — and becomes the enamel around the tooth.
- **[02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7g1gKyzL94&t=173s)** — Now we can prevent the acid from breaking down the small crevices in your tooth.
- **[02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7g1gKyzL94&t=179s)** — And then of course, you're just going to add three teaspoons of water with this.
- **[03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7g1gKyzL94&t=183s)** — Mix it all up, put it on your toothbrush, and then in circular motions brush your teeth
- **[03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7g1gKyzL94&t=188s)** — on the outside and the inside once a day.
- **[03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7g1gKyzL94&t=191s)** — I also recommend that you find a gum that has friendly oral bacteria that you can chew
- **[03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7g1gKyzL94&t=197s)** — and repopulate your mouth with the good bacteria, which will also help protect you against the formation of biofilms.
- **[03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7g1gKyzL94&t=203s)** — Those bacteria not only will help prevent tartar, but it will also prevent bad breath, cavities.
- **[03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7g1gKyzL94&t=208s)** — Now, as far as in your diet, one of the best foods that you can consume
- **[03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7g1gKyzL94&t=213s)** — to prevent all these problems that we talked about is grass-fed butter.
- **[03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7g1gKyzL94&t=216s)** — When I was a kid, I craved butter for my birthday.
- **[03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7g1gKyzL94&t=222s)** — I remember requesting a pound of butter and I would literally just eat it.
- **[03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7g1gKyzL94&t=228s)** — I would eat butter. And it's so interesting when I look back, the reason why I crave the butter,
- **[03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7g1gKyzL94&t=233s)** — I had a lot of dental decay and unfortunately every single tooth in my mouth had cavities over time
- **[03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7g1gKyzL94&t=239s)** — and I visited the dentist frequently, unfortunately.
- **[04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7g1gKyzL94&t=243s)** — But if I didn't consume those foods as a child and I had the butter, I probably could have fixed my teeth.
- **[04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7g1gKyzL94&t=249s)** — But grass-fed butter has vitamin K2, which basically takes the calcium in your body and pushes it into the bones.
- **[04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7g1gKyzL94&t=256s)** — Butter also has vitamin A. You also need vitamin A to keep your enamel very, very strong.
- **[04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7g1gKyzL94&t=262s)** — It's interesting because an early pioneer, Western Price, who was a dentist back, I think, in the 1930s or 40s,
- **[04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7g1gKyzL94&t=270s)** — talked about something called activator X. Activator X actually is vitamin K2 because he noticed some of the traditional cultures
- **[04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7g1gKyzL94&t=278s)** — around the world consumed grass-fed butter. They consumed food high in vitamin K2.
- **[04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7g1gKyzL94&t=285s)** — And these are the foods that really kept the teeth super healthy with also good dental bone structure as well.
- **[04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7g1gKyzL94&t=292s)** — So I would definitely recommend including grass-fed butter in your diet on a regular basis.
- **[04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7g1gKyzL94&t=299s)** — I mean, butter does a lot. It has something else called butyrate, which actually goes into your brain.
- **[05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7g1gKyzL94&t=304s)** — Butyrate also feeds your colon cells. So wow that we were told to avoid butter because of the cholesterol
- **[05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7g1gKyzL94&t=310s)** — and this idea that it's going to create a heart problem when in fact it's loaded with vitamin K2
- **[05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7g1gKyzL94&t=316s)** — that keeps the plaque from building up in the arteries, pushing this calcium into your teeth and your bones.
- **[05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7g1gKyzL94&t=322s)** — So butter is really good for the bone. It's also good as a raw material for your hormones, including testosterone,
- **[05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7g1gKyzL94&t=327s)** — because all of your sex hormones are made from cholesterol. Now that you have the updated protocol
- **[05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7g1gKyzL94&t=333s)** — to get rid of tartar and prevent cavities, go ahead and try it and then comment down below and tell me how it worked.

- **[00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wh8uodrOh-Q&t=0s)** — Today I want to share the best supplements for very specific health conditions.
- **[00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wh8uodrOh-Q&t=4s)** — And I think everyone should really know this information, because sooner or later you might
- **[00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wh8uodrOh-Q&t=9s)** — end up with one of these problems. And it'd be nice to know a remedy that could help you,
- **[00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wh8uodrOh-Q&t=13s)** — especially if you're not into taking drugs. Now, when people research supplements, they have
- **[00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wh8uodrOh-Q&t=18s)** — this idea that evidence-based research is the best way to find out if a supplement worked.
- **[00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wh8uodrOh-Q&t=23s)** — This is very misleading because when you look at evidence-based research, you're going to
- **[00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wh8uodrOh-Q&t=28s)** — a lot of mixed reviews when we get into supplements, simply because certain organizations,
- **[00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wh8uodrOh-Q&t=35s)** — and I'm not going to mention their name, will purposely do research to invalidate the results
- **[00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wh8uodrOh-Q&t=40s)** — of natural remedies that compete with commercial remedies that make a lot of money. Who's going
- **[00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wh8uodrOh-Q&t=47s)** — to fund a natural remedy? It's very, very expensive to do research. And so you're not
- **[00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wh8uodrOh-Q&t=51s)** — going to see a lot of credible research in the area of nutrition. We have this omitted
- **[00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wh8uodrOh-Q&t=56s)** — research that people will say, well, there's no research to say that it works. That doesn't
- **[01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wh8uodrOh-Q&t=61s)** — mean it doesn't work. It just means that no one wanted to pay for the research to validate
- **[01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wh8uodrOh-Q&t=65s)** — if it worked. So what I'm going to share with you is based on a lot of personal experience
- **[01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wh8uodrOh-Q&t=70s)** — working with a lot of people, tens, hundreds of thousands of people over years,
- **[01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wh8uodrOh-Q&t=76s)** — and just observing what works the majority of the time and what doesn't work, as well as a
- **[01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wh8uodrOh-Q&t=81s)** — lot of deep diving into the mechanics of how nutrition solves a problem. This video is not
- **[01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wh8uodrOh-Q&t=86s)** — going to be a comprehensive study on every single health condition, but I'm going to talk about
- **[01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wh8uodrOh-Q&t=92s)** — the top health conditions and how supplements or a nutrient or remedy could help that problem.
- **[01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wh8uodrOh-Q&t=99s)** — Starting with probably the most important one, which is vitamin D. One thing you need to know
- **[01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wh8uodrOh-Q&t=104s)** — about vitamin D is that we have a lot of resistance against absorbing vitamin D for all
- **[01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wh8uodrOh-Q&t=108s)** — of the reasons from the lack of sun because we're not outside as much, depending on the season,
- **[01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wh8uodrOh-Q&t=114s)** — where you live in relationship to the equator, how old you are, how much you weigh, if you have
- **[01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wh8uodrOh-Q&t=119s)** — insulin resistance or diabetes. You can override all these problems by just taking more vitamin D3.
- **[02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wh8uodrOh-Q&t=124s)** — You would need to have at least 10,000 IUs to up to 50,000 IUs every day and even more
- **[02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wh8uodrOh-Q&t=130s)** — than that depending on certain circumstances. And I've done a lot of videos on this topic. One
- **[02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wh8uodrOh-Q&t=134s)** — of the most important conditions with an S that vitamin D can help you with is autoimmune
- **[02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wh8uodrOh-Q&t=140s)** — diseases. The common theme of an autoimmune condition is inflammation. So vitamin D in
- **[02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wh8uodrOh-Q&t=146s)** — the right dosage can be a very potent anti-inflammatory. Vitamin D regulates
- **[02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wh8uodrOh-Q&t=152s)** — the immune system. In other words, if you have a hyperimmune system, vitamin D can tone it
- **[02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wh8uodrOh-Q&t=157s)** — down. And then we have other conditions where we're lacking immune support. And that would
- **[02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wh8uodrOh-Q&t=163s)** — definitely be something like cancer, AIDS. Vitamin D is essential for those conditions.
- **[02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wh8uodrOh-Q&t=167s)** — Vitamin D also works great for depression. Another condition that you might not realize
- **[02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wh8uodrOh-Q&t=173s)** — that vitamin D is good for is glaucoma. In fact, a lot of problems with the eye can be
- **[02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wh8uodrOh-Q&t=178s)** — greatly improved with high doses of vitamin D3. And then we have the classic low back pain
- **[03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wh8uodrOh-Q&t=183s)** — or anything related to your pelvis like hip pain, deep bone pain, vitamin D3. Because
- **[03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wh8uodrOh-Q&t=189s)** — vitamin D3 can help benign tumors as well as cancer. Another really great benefit of D3 is
- **[03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wh8uodrOh-Q&t=196s)** — anything related to hair loss, dermatitis. A dermatologist would give one remedy, vitamin
- **[03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wh8uodrOh-Q&t=202s)** — D3 in high amounts. They would get amazing results with almost every different type of
- **[03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wh8uodrOh-Q&t=208s)** — skin inflammatory condition. And one key point about vitamin D, anytime you take vitamin D3,
- **[03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wh8uodrOh-Q&t=213s)** — you also need to take the cofactors, magnesium and zinc and vitamin K2. Alright, the next
- **[03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wh8uodrOh-Q&t=220s)** — supplement I'm going to recommend is magnesium glycinate. I don't recommend other forms of
- **[03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wh8uodrOh-Q&t=225s)** — magnesium too much, especially because the absorption is not that great. So what is
- **[03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wh8uodrOh-Q&t=230s)** — magnesium good for? Well, allowing vitamin D to work. They both work together. You could
- **[03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wh8uodrOh-Q&t=235s)** — actually take vitamin D and be severely magnesium deficient and not see any of the results from
- **[04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wh8uodrOh-Q&t=240s)** — The same thing goes with magnesium. If you're taking magnesium without vitamin D3, magnesium
- **[04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wh8uodrOh-Q&t=248s)** — will only work to a certain degree. And anytime you take either magnesium by itself or vitamin D
- **[04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wh8uodrOh-Q&t=255s)** — by itself and then develop side effects, it's usually because you're deficient in the other
- **[04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wh8uodrOh-Q&t=261s)** — cofactor. There's a lot of body conditions that occur in the early morning because of
- **[04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wh8uodrOh-Q&t=266s)** — the deficiency of magnesium. Because magnesium kind of goes on this wave and you're going to hit the
- **[04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wh8uodrOh-Q&t=271s)** — lowest point in the early morning, maybe about between 5 a.m., 6 a.m., 7 a.m. What kind of
- **[04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wh8uodrOh-Q&t=277s)** — problems occur more in the morning? A lot of problems. Cramps in the legs, cramps in the
- **[04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wh8uodrOh-Q&t=282s)** — foot, increased risk of heart attacks, clotting happens more in the morning, strokes
- **[04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wh8uodrOh-Q&t=287s)** — happen in the morning. Even the dawn phenomena, which is the higher blood sugars occur in the
- **[04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wh8uodrOh-Q&t=291s)** — All of that means you need magnesium. Migraine headaches, magnesium. But you need higher
- **[04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wh8uodrOh-Q&t=297s)** — amounts. If you're taking like 400 milligrams, you'll see the results. But with migraines,
- **[05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wh8uodrOh-Q&t=302s)** — sometimes you need to take 800 to 1000 or even more milligrams of magnesium to create the
- **[05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wh8uodrOh-Q&t=308s)** — effect with migraines, depending on how bad they are. Also, magnesium lowers cortisol and
- **[05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wh8uodrOh-Q&t=313s)** — adrenaline. That's why it's good for sleep. Magnesium also helps thin the blood and helps
- **[05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wh8uodrOh-Q&t=319s)** — prevent clotting. Magnesium is good for blood pressure, good for anti-clotting effects,
- **[05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wh8uodrOh-Q&t=325s)** — good to prevent cramping of muscle. But magnesium is really good as an electrolyte to prevent
- **[05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wh8uodrOh-Q&t=331s)** — arrhythmias, as an atrial fibrillation. So that's another really important heart effect.
- **[05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wh8uodrOh-Q&t=336s)** — Magnesium is also at the heart of making energy. So anything related to chronic fatigue,
- **[05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wh8uodrOh-Q&t=342s)** — a loss of energy in the mitochondria, magnesium is the answer. Especially if you're
- **[05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wh8uodrOh-Q&t=347s)** — just don't have that endurance, you need magnesium. The way that I know that I have enough
- **[05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wh8uodrOh-Q&t=351s)** — magnesium is all of the muscles in my body are calm and not tight. This last point is magnesium
- **[05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wh8uodrOh-Q&t=358s)** — to prevent kidney stones. This is a huge reason why people have kidney stones,
- **[06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wh8uodrOh-Q&t=364s)** — is they're magnesium deficient. Next is betaine hydrochloride. That should be taken
- **[06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wh8uodrOh-Q&t=370s)** — anytime you have heartburn or indigestion. Betaine hydrochloride gives the stomach more
- **[06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wh8uodrOh-Q&t=376s)** — acidification, okay, more acid. Most of this is a lack of acid and also the valve just doesn't
- **[06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wh8uodrOh-Q&t=383s)** — close because there's a lack of acid. What betaine hydrochloride does is help you keep
- **[06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wh8uodrOh-Q&t=388s)** — that top valve closed, giving you more acid so you can digest better. Sometimes you have to
- **[06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wh8uodrOh-Q&t=394s)** — take three or four or five or six or seven before a meal to get it to work because it's
- **[06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wh8uodrOh-Q&t=399s)** — highly concentrated. Next remedy is zinc carnosine. Hands down the best remedy for an ulcer in your
- **[06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wh8uodrOh-Q&t=406s)** — stomach and it helps calm down gastritis. Now, next remedy is selenium. Okay, selenium,
- **[06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wh8uodrOh-Q&t=413s)** — believe it or not, is really good if you have AIDS. Selenium seems to fix certain T-cells
- **[07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wh8uodrOh-Q&t=420s)** — that will then help counter this AIDS situation because AIDS is really an acquired
- **[07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wh8uodrOh-Q&t=427s)** — immunodeficiency syndrome. So basically you don't have an immune system anymore. You lost
- **[07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wh8uodrOh-Q&t=432s)** — the quarterback of the immune system. So selenium is very, very important in that. You can get a
- **[07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wh8uodrOh-Q&t=436s)** — good amount of selenium just from one Brazil nut a day. Selenium is also good to lower getting
- **[07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wh8uodrOh-Q&t=441s)** — this autoimmune condition called Hashimoto's. If you have Hashimoto's, which is an autoimmune
- **[07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wh8uodrOh-Q&t=446s)** — thyroid problem, you need selenium. So when you think selenium, think Hashimoto's and AIDS.
- **[07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wh8uodrOh-Q&t=451s)** — Next remedy is vitamin B1. Here's another interesting thing. You need magnesium as a
- **[07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wh8uodrOh-Q&t=459s)** — cofactor to allow B1 to work. So if you take B1 and it doesn't work, it could mean that
- **[07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wh8uodrOh-Q&t=463s)** — you just need magnesium. B1 is an amazing remedy for nervous tension, worry, stress, anxiety,
- **[07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wh8uodrOh-Q&t=473s)** — restless leg syndrome. Restless leg syndrome, you take magnesium and B1 and you're almost
- **[07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wh8uodrOh-Q&t=478s)** — to get rid of that condition. Then we also have another type of B1 that's made in a fat
- **[08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wh8uodrOh-Q&t=484s)** — soluble form called Benfotamine. Benfotamine is really good for anything with nerves in the
- **[08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wh8uodrOh-Q&t=490s)** — peripheral part of the body, in the bottom of the feet, the toes and the hands. You take
- **[08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wh8uodrOh-Q&t=495s)** — four pills through the day. Just keep it in your body and that condition will improve.
- **[08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wh8uodrOh-Q&t=500s)** — Another supplement is calcium lactate for chronic coughing. But I normally do not recommend
- **[08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wh8uodrOh-Q&t=508s)** — any calcium supplements other than if it's just a small amount. But you don't want large
- **[08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wh8uodrOh-Q&t=513s)** — amounts of calcium. Over a thousand, twelve hundred, fifteen hundred milligrams because it's
- **[08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wh8uodrOh-Q&t=518s)** — going to put you at risk for heart problems. And I recommend that you get your calcium from
- **[08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wh8uodrOh-Q&t=521s)** — your food like cheese, vegetables, sardines with the bones in it, but not as a supplement.
- **[08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wh8uodrOh-Q&t=527s)** — Same thing with iron. I don't recommend you taking an iron supplement. I'd rather you get
- **[08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wh8uodrOh-Q&t=531s)** — it from food, red meat, liver or take liver pills. That's good for low blood pressure,
- **[08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wh8uodrOh-Q&t=536s)** — but it's also good for energy. I also recommend potassium for people that are salt sensitive.
- **[09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wh8uodrOh-Q&t=542s)** — They're told to lower their salt. I recommend you just increase your potassium. But the thing
- **[09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wh8uodrOh-Q&t=547s)** — about potassium is that we need so much of it. We need 4,700 milligrams. I don't know of
- **[09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wh8uodrOh-Q&t=554s)** — the next supplements. Coenzyme Q10. If anyone's on a statin, they better be on Coenzyme Q10
- **[09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wh8uodrOh-Q&t=560s)** — because a statin which blocks cholesterol will deplete you of Coenzyme Q10. What about vitamin
- **[09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wh8uodrOh-Q&t=566s)** — E? There's two different forms of vitamin E. I recommend the tocatrinols one because it
- **[09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wh8uodrOh-Q&t=570s)** — works 50 times stronger. And tocatrinols are really good to prevent fibrosis. It's also
- **[09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wh8uodrOh-Q&t=575s)** — good for angina, chest pain. It's good to support the inner layer of the arteries to
- **[09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wh8uodrOh-Q&t=580s)** — prevent plaque. It's also good for infertility. Next supplement is one of my favorites. It's
- **[09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wh8uodrOh-Q&t=586s)** — called tutka. The tutka is a very specialized type of bile salt. A lot of people have a
- **[09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wh8uodrOh-Q&t=591s)** — problem with thickened bile and it creates pressure and causes pain that radiates to the
- **[09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wh8uodrOh-Q&t=596s)** — right shoulder up to the neck. Tutka will just like make that go away. Tutka is also
- **[10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wh8uodrOh-Q&t=601s)** — good for neurological problems in your brain. It does a lot, but I have separate videos on
- **[10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wh8uodrOh-Q&t=606s)** — Let's talk about iodine. Great for fiber cystic breast. That's an excess amount of
- **[10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wh8uodrOh-Q&t=611s)** — estrogen that's causing those cysts. And iodine is a natural inhibitor or regulator of excess
- **[10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wh8uodrOh-Q&t=618s)** — estrogen. So iodine is great for that. Vitamin C is good for collagen, especially
- **[10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wh8uodrOh-Q&t=622s)** — for bleeding gums. If you're brushing your teeth and it turns pink because you're
- **[10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wh8uodrOh-Q&t=626s)** — bleeding easily because your gums are inflamed, you need vitamin C. Probiotics.
- **[10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wh8uodrOh-Q&t=631s)** — If someone's on a lot of diet soda, they're going to really mess up their gut and they
- **[10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wh8uodrOh-Q&t=634s)** — get off the artificial sweeteners. Biotin. Good for hair, nails, and skin, especially
- **[10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wh8uodrOh-Q&t=640s)** — to make your hair and nails grow. Manganese. Good for Tourette's and Ticks. NAC is a
- **[10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wh8uodrOh-Q&t=648s)** — wonderful supplement if you've accidentally taken too much Tylenol. It's really good
- **[10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wh8uodrOh-Q&t=653s)** — for anything poisonous to the liver. Those snake bites, poisonous mushrooms.
- **[10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wh8uodrOh-Q&t=657s)** — Think NAC and milk thistle. Mastic gum is good for gastritis. If you've tried a lot of different
- **[11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wh8uodrOh-Q&t=665s)** — supplements for your sleep and it hasn't worked, I recommend melatonin for some people.
- **[11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wh8uodrOh-Q&t=672s)** — Tends to help a lot of people and it does a lot of other things, which I'll have to do a
- **[11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wh8uodrOh-Q&t=676s)** — video on. But I recommend that for severe sleep problems that you've tried everything
- **[11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wh8uodrOh-Q&t=681s)** — and nothing's worked. Niacin. Really good for anything related to cholesterol. And I
- **[11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wh8uodrOh-Q&t=687s)** — recommend taking higher amounts of it. 500mg, 1000mg. Work up to it. You will have a flush
- **[11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wh8uodrOh-Q&t=692s)** — response and that's normal, but you want the one with the flush. Clove oil. Great for any
- **[11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wh8uodrOh-Q&t=698s)** — pain in your teeth or gums. Now of course I can go on and on and on and on, but this is
- **[11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wh8uodrOh-Q&t=703s)** — a fairly long video. I think you've learned the most important effects of certain
- **[11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wh8uodrOh-Q&t=708s)** — supplements. If you want all this in a quick download, I put the link down below. Check it

- **[00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HT3oYW2pQSk&t=0s)** — This is a very important video for anyone with an autoimmune disorder, or for that matter,
- **[00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HT3oYW2pQSk&t=6s)** — any inflammatory disorders. Now of course, the thing to do if you have an autoimmune condition
- **[00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HT3oYW2pQSk&t=11s)** — is go to the experts, right? So this is what they will tell you what to do, right? Consume
- **[00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HT3oYW2pQSk&t=16s)** — plenty of fruits and vegetables and whole grains, legumes, only have moderate amounts of alcohol,
- **[00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HT3oYW2pQSk&t=25s)** — limit your sugars and sodas, and also limit your refined grains. But of course, the diet is going
- **[00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HT3oYW2pQSk&t=30s)** — to recommend you can have some sugars, you know, juice and alcohol and sugar and fine grains,
- **[00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HT3oYW2pQSk&t=36s)** — just don't have too much and you'll be totally fine. Well, I'm going to let you know right now,
- **[00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HT3oYW2pQSk&t=41s)** — you will never ever get better if you follow that recommendation. So let's go ahead and dissect
- **[00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HT3oYW2pQSk&t=47s)** — and talk about what's really behind an autoimmune disorder. Most autoimmune disorders
- **[00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HT3oYW2pQSk&t=53s)** — where your own cells are attacking itself, creating a lot of collateral damage with inflammation
- **[01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HT3oYW2pQSk&t=60s)** — start in the gut. But I want to talk about the mechanism of what starts it. In the gut,
- **[01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HT3oYW2pQSk&t=65s)** — we have this immune barrier. Okay, we also have other barriers on their skin, the internal
- **[01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HT3oYW2pQSk&t=72s)** — skin, we have other immune things like acids in your stomach, bile that's produced by the
- **[01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HT3oYW2pQSk&t=81s)** — microbes that all prevent pathogens from invading the body. And we also have this thing called
- **[01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HT3oYW2pQSk&t=86s)** — the blood brain barrier, which protects pathogens from invading the brain. And so the immune
- **[01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HT3oYW2pQSk&t=91s)** — system, and I just have to say this is so highly complex and so mysterious. Really,
- **[01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HT3oYW2pQSk&t=98s)** — no one understands the complexity of this magical defense mechanism, and how amazing it is. And
- **[01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HT3oYW2pQSk&t=106s)** — you appreciate it, you're much less susceptible to using things to try to bypass your immune
- **[01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HT3oYW2pQSk&t=112s)** — system like antibiotics, for example, or anything to stop an infection, you want to
- **[01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HT3oYW2pQSk&t=117s)** — let your body learn from it and develop more immunity. Before we get into this, I want to
- **[02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HT3oYW2pQSk&t=123s)** — just touch on something that's really important. It's about the immune system. Since we're on
- **[02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HT3oYW2pQSk&t=127s)** — the topic of autoimmune, our immune system is developed when we're small infants. Hopefully,
- **[02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HT3oYW2pQSk&t=133s)** — you had a natural childbirth, you weren't c-sectioned, because that can inhibit
- **[02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HT3oYW2pQSk&t=138s)** — the starting of the immune system because of the microbiome that's developed in a natural
- **[02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HT3oYW2pQSk&t=144s)** — birthing process. And hopefully, you were breastfed too because of the probiotics
- **[02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HT3oYW2pQSk&t=149s)** — that are in the breast milk really fortify that immune system early on. You know,
- **[02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HT3oYW2pQSk&t=155s)** — when we talk about a fetus growing in a mother's womb, it's not a sterile environment.
- **[02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HT3oYW2pQSk&t=160s)** — They did think it was sterile at one time, but they recently found microbes in the amniotic fluid.
- **[02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HT3oYW2pQSk&t=167s)** — And some babies actually have their first bowel movement right inside the womb, and they found
- **[02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HT3oYW2pQSk&t=173s)** — microbes in there. Where do they come from? Well, they came from the mother. And so,
- **[02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HT3oYW2pQSk&t=177s)** — an infant's immune system starts at birth. And if they don't have these certain factors,
- **[03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HT3oYW2pQSk&t=182s)** — okay, if things are too sterile, if an infant is exposed to antibiotics or anything that can
- **[03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HT3oYW2pQSk&t=187s)** — inhibit that microbiome, boy, is that immune system affected later on in life.
- **[03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HT3oYW2pQSk&t=192s)** — And the recent interest that I have in this topic relates to farming and growing certain plants.
- **[03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HT3oYW2pQSk&t=201s)** — And I'm going to be doing some very interesting research on my farm relating to this topic.
- **[03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HT3oYW2pQSk&t=205s)** — But a seed that is grown in the soil is not just a little packet of genetic information.
- **[03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HT3oYW2pQSk&t=213s)** — It is literally Noah's Ark. You have all sorts of microbes growing inside that seed,
- **[03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HT3oYW2pQSk&t=220s)** — and on the surface of that seed, that helps that seed be fortified in its growing process.
- **[03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HT3oYW2pQSk&t=226s)** — And so they found that if you disrupt that microbiome early on, that plant won't really
- **[03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HT3oYW2pQSk&t=231s)** — grow. It won't really have that microbiome to help it absorb nutrition. Well, the exact same
- **[03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HT3oYW2pQSk&t=237s)** — thing happens with us, with our immune system, early on. We're talking about the gut barrier,
- **[04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HT3oYW2pQSk&t=242s)** — okay? There are these protective things called tight junctions that keep the cells very, very,
- **[04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HT3oYW2pQSk&t=249s)** — very tight and secure. So it forms a very, very nice barrier between the inside of your body
- **[04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HT3oYW2pQSk&t=257s)** — and the outside of the body, or really the inside of the gut. So if there's a pathogen
- **[04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HT3oYW2pQSk&t=261s)** — trying to invade the gut, these tight junctions prevent it from doing so. Now,
- **[04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HT3oYW2pQSk&t=266s)** — the medical term for this is intestinal permeability. Of course, it's the same
- **[04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HT3oYW2pQSk&t=271s)** — thing as a leaky gut, right? There's holes in your intestine that allow things to pass through
- **[04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HT3oYW2pQSk&t=276s)** — that then don't get the stamp of immune approval through immigration. And then certain things can
- **[04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HT3oYW2pQSk&t=282s)** — be tagged incorrectly, and then your immune system can go after them. And then we have
- **[04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HT3oYW2pQSk&t=287s)** — a war, we have the inflammation, and then we can develop autoimmune diseases. Now, there's this
- **[04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HT3oYW2pQSk&t=293s)** — protein that regulates these tight junctions. And if this zonulin and the tight junctions
- **[05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HT3oYW2pQSk&t=300s)** — are not working correctly, the immune system is not going to have the ability to differentiate
- **[05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HT3oYW2pQSk&t=305s)** — between self and non-self. In other words, your immune system can make a mistake and start
- **[05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HT3oYW2pQSk&t=312s)** — incorrectly assigning your own tissue being a foreign pathogen and start developing antibodies,
- **[05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HT3oYW2pQSk&t=319s)** — you know, whether it's for the thyroid, the brain, anything. And so this zonulin protein is
- **[05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HT3oYW2pQSk&t=324s)** — always elevated in autoimmune diseases as well as a lot of inflammatory conditions. It is the
- **[05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HT3oYW2pQSk&t=331s)** — primary regulator of that intestinal permeability. So if we look at what foods
- **[05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HT3oYW2pQSk&t=337s)** — are best for an autoimmune disease, it would be those foods that reduce permeability
- **[05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HT3oYW2pQSk&t=344s)** — and that keep this zonulin in check and prevent it from getting too high. So what I did
- **[05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HT3oYW2pQSk&t=350s)** — is I cross-reference a lot of different foods and other things that relate to not only
- **[05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HT3oYW2pQSk&t=357s)** — increasing or decreasing zonulin, but also affecting the intestinal permeability,
- **[06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HT3oYW2pQSk&t=363s)** — as well as directly causing autoimmune diseases. So the number one thing that helps regulate
- **[06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HT3oYW2pQSk&t=370s)** — zonulin is your own microbiome. So anything that destroys your microbiome is going to be
- **[06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HT3oYW2pQSk&t=377s)** — very, very bad for the situation. Anything that supports it is going to be very, very good.
- **[06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HT3oYW2pQSk&t=381s)** — And again, we come full circle to these microbes, right? They're not us, but they live with us
- **[06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HT3oYW2pQSk&t=386s)** — and they greatly help us. A very large portion of our immune system is due to these microbes.
- **[06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HT3oYW2pQSk&t=393s)** — And I really think if we look at the difference between like 50 years ago and now,
- **[06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HT3oYW2pQSk&t=397s)** — we definitely do not have the numbers and the diversity of microbiome in our guts.
- **[06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HT3oYW2pQSk&t=402s)** — And we definitely don't have the numbers and diversity of microbiome in this soil.
- **[06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HT3oYW2pQSk&t=407s)** — I think that is really at the core of the problem. So the first food I'm going to recommend
- **[06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HT3oYW2pQSk&t=412s)** — is a probiotic food, right? That would be sauerkraut, kimchi, kefir, okay? Anything that
- **[07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HT3oYW2pQSk&t=421s)** — will give you these friendly microbes. And you might even want to take a probiotic as well,
- **[07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HT3oYW2pQSk&t=425s)** — because we're trying to increase the diversity of microbes. Now, if we take in the flip
- **[07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HT3oYW2pQSk&t=430s)** — side, I think we should also talk about what to avoid. Well, guess what? Antibiotics.
- **[07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HT3oYW2pQSk&t=436s)** — Antibiotics directly increase leaky gut. Okay, they increase this zonulin and they
- **[07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HT3oYW2pQSk&t=443s)** — directly relate and can cause autoimmune diseases. So at the first sign of a sickness,
- **[07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HT3oYW2pQSk&t=449s)** — don't jump to start taking the antibiotic. And if you have to, okay, definitely take a
- **[07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HT3oYW2pQSk&t=456s)** — same time. It's so important. I mean, the amount of antibiotics that I have taken in my life
- **[07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HT3oYW2pQSk&t=461s)** — are just off the charts simply because I didn't know the long term effects.
- **[07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HT3oYW2pQSk&t=465s)** — Do you realize that when you take an antibiotic, there are going to be certain
- **[07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HT3oYW2pQSk&t=468s)** — microbes that are going to survive that are going to develop a resistance to that antibiotic.
- **[07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HT3oYW2pQSk&t=473s)** — That microbe that now is resistant to that antibiotic can do something called
- **[07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HT3oYW2pQSk&t=478s)** — horizontal gene transfer, where it shares this information with other microbes that were not
- **[08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HT3oYW2pQSk&t=486s)** — exposed to that antibiotic to give them the genes that help them resist that antibiotic in
- **[08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HT3oYW2pQSk&t=493s)** — the future. So these microbes can share information back and forth. And this is part of the
- **[08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HT3oYW2pQSk&t=500s)** — survival mechanism that they have developed. And so the next time you take the antibiotic,
- **[08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HT3oYW2pQSk&t=503s)** — it works less and less to the point where it won't work at all. Another food that is good
- **[08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HT3oYW2pQSk&t=510s)** — potentially for autoimmune would be anything fermented. Okay, fermented. I'm not talking
- **[08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HT3oYW2pQSk&t=515s)** — about like fermented like beer or alcohol. I'm talking about like fermented vegetables,
- **[08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HT3oYW2pQSk&t=521s)** — because fermented vegetables are easier to digest. They have microbes. They have the
- **[08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HT3oYW2pQSk&t=525s)** — fiber that can actually feed the microbes. They have all sorts of other secondary chemicals
- **[08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HT3oYW2pQSk&t=531s)** — that support keeping that intestinal line really, really tight. But if you have the type of
- **[08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HT3oYW2pQSk&t=538s)** — autoimmune that involves damage to your gut, there's too much inflammation, then you might
- **[09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HT3oYW2pQSk&t=544s)** — have a problem with vegetables in general. You might have to do carnivore for a little while.
- **[09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HT3oYW2pQSk&t=548s)** — But if you don't have that, you might benefit from fermented vegetables. And this
- **[09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HT3oYW2pQSk&t=553s)** — also includes vegetables, okay, because personally I do very well on them. I don't
- **[09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HT3oYW2pQSk&t=558s)** — apparently have that much gut damage that it's a problem. Some people don't. But if you have an
- **[09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HT3oYW2pQSk&t=564s)** — autoimmune disease that's affecting the gut, you might not do well on vegetables. But if you
- **[09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HT3oYW2pQSk&t=569s)** — don't, vegetables can contribute to a good gut microbiome because they feed the microbes
- **[09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HT3oYW2pQSk&t=576s)** — from the fiber, but also the phytonutrients in these vegetables greatly support zonulin.
- **[09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HT3oYW2pQSk&t=583s)** — And one of the biggest ones that is very well researched is sulforaphane. And not only broccoli
- **[09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HT3oYW2pQSk&t=589s)** — sprouts, but in broccoli, cabbage, and other cruciferous vegetables. So sulforaphane directly
- **[09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HT3oYW2pQSk&t=597s)** — helps reverse gut dysbiosis, okay, alteration in the microbiome. Sulforaphane is a great
- **[10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HT3oYW2pQSk&t=606s)** — remedy for H. pylori, another microbe in your body that is in the stomach that can get out of
- **[10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HT3oYW2pQSk&t=614s)** — control and turn unfriendly in certain environments. And then it can create ulcers.
- **[10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HT3oYW2pQSk&t=620s)** — But guess what? Sulforaphane can help kill H. pylori and put it back into remission.
- **[10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HT3oYW2pQSk&t=627s)** — Sulforaphane helps the mucous lining in your gut. And sulforaphane directly inhibits
- **[10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HT3oYW2pQSk&t=635s)** — autoimmune conditions, okay, especially like lupus and even psoriasis and other autoimmune
- **[10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HT3oYW2pQSk&t=641s)** — conditions. So you could probably get the most sulforaphane in broccoli sprouts. You can just
- **[10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HT3oYW2pQSk&t=646s)** — put that on your salad each day, or you can get sulforaphane in a supplement. All right,
- **[10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HT3oYW2pQSk&t=650s)** — let's go to the flip side. What to avoid, okay? Anything with the herbicide glyphosate,
- **[10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HT3oYW2pQSk&t=657s)** — this is in the Roundup Ready and in GMO Foods. And if you look this up, it's interesting because
- **[11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HT3oYW2pQSk&t=664s)** — you'll see these mixed reviews. Of course, the ones that they say the glyphosate is fine
- **[11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HT3oYW2pQSk&t=669s)** — are funded by companies that have a vested interest. But if you think about it, glyphosate
- **[11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HT3oYW2pQSk&t=675s)** — has a patent on it being an antibiotic. Yeah, because it kills microbes. Certain things you'll
- **[11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HT3oYW2pQSk&t=681s)** — see on the internet will say that there is no danger to glyphosate in humans because the pathway
- **[11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HT3oYW2pQSk&t=688s)** — that biochemically it interrupts is not part of the human body. Well, it is part of the microbes
- **[11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HT3oYW2pQSk&t=697s)** — that live inside of our gut that we depend on. So it definitely affects us from the microbiome
- **[11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HT3oYW2pQSk&t=704s)** — level. But glyphosate is in so many different things, even in non-GMO things, including wheat,
- **[11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HT3oYW2pQSk&t=710s)** — in other grains, not to mention soy, corn. It's just all over the place. And so now I think it's
- **[11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HT3oYW2pQSk&t=718s)** — appropriate to bring up another really bad thing for autoimmune diseases, and that would be
- **[12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HT3oYW2pQSk&t=723s)** — gluten in certain grains. Gluten is a kind of a general term for several
- **[12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HT3oYW2pQSk&t=730s)** — types of proteins that have a very devastating effect on our GI system.
- **[12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HT3oYW2pQSk&t=735s)** — Now you might think just about celiac, which is a very severe disorder, which is
- **[12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HT3oYW2pQSk&t=740s)** — not as common as other disorders. But then you also have gluten intolerance, gluten sensitivity,
- **[12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HT3oYW2pQSk&t=746s)** — which is pretty common. But what about for those people that don't have a problem with
- **[12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HT3oYW2pQSk&t=751s)** — gluten, right? Well, check this out. Gluten, whether you have an intolerance or not, gluten
- **[12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HT3oYW2pQSk&t=758s)** — is going to increase zonulin in everyone. So it's going to open up those tight junctions
- **[12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HT3oYW2pQSk&t=764s)** — in people that are not sensitive to it. And the big problem with gluten is that it's
- **[12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HT3oYW2pQSk&t=769s)** — the only protein that our bodies cannot fully digest. So if we get this undigested protein
- **[12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HT3oYW2pQSk&t=778s)** — floating down our GI tract, and then it opens up the hole in the gut and it goes right through,
- **[13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HT3oYW2pQSk&t=783s)** — now we're going to start to have immune reactions or at least inflammation, especially if you're
- **[13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HT3oYW2pQSk&t=787s)** — consuming it on a chronic basis, which most people are. And unfortunately, lately in the
- **[13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HT3oYW2pQSk&t=793s)** — 20 years or more, gluten has really increased in wheat and in other foods. And so you can
- **[13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HT3oYW2pQSk&t=800s)** — imagine the amount of inflammation going on in our guts without us even knowing it.
- **[13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HT3oYW2pQSk&t=804s)** — All right, let's talk about number four, okay, the food that you should be consuming.
- **[13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HT3oYW2pQSk&t=808s)** — Food, and this is kind of just a general category, but foods high in glutamine,
- **[13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HT3oYW2pQSk&t=813s)** — okay, glutamine. Maybe you've heard of this, maybe you haven't, but glutamine is a good
- **[13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HT3oYW2pQSk&t=817s)** — to reduce inflammation in your gut. Now, glutamine is an amino acid that is a precursor
- **[13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HT3oYW2pQSk&t=824s)** — for glutathione, right, which is one of the most important antioxidants in your body.
- **[13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HT3oYW2pQSk&t=830s)** — And so what foods are high in glutamine? Well, red cabbage. And by the way, cabbage
- **[13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HT3oYW2pQSk&t=836s)** — is just good for any type of gastrointestinal problem. Grass-fed beef, eggs, fish, these are
- **[14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HT3oYW2pQSk&t=844s)** — really high in glutamine. Now on the flip side, additional things you should avoid would be,
- **[14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HT3oYW2pQSk&t=849s)** — of course, glucose, fructose. Both glucose and fructose increase zonulin and increase
- **[14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HT3oYW2pQSk&t=856s)** — permeability. Alcohol is another one that will just put a hole right through your gut.
- **[14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HT3oYW2pQSk&t=860s)** — And of course, vegetable oils, another big one like corn oil, soy oil,
- **[14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HT3oYW2pQSk&t=867s)** — cottonseed oil, canola. These vegetable oils are highly inflammatory and they definitely
- **[14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HT3oYW2pQSk&t=871s)** — will create increased permeability. And of course, trans fats are also really bad for
- **[14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HT3oYW2pQSk&t=877s)** — the intestinal lining. And number five food would be the omega-3 fats. And that's another
- **[14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HT3oYW2pQSk&t=881s)** — category that includes, you know, cod liver oil, fish, salmon, sardines. Omega-3 is really
- **[14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HT3oYW2pQSk&t=890s)** — good for the gut and keeping those junctions really, really tight, as well as reducing the
- **[14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HT3oYW2pQSk&t=896s)** — risk for autoimmune. Now this last part is very, very important too. And this is not foods,
- **[15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HT3oYW2pQSk&t=900s)** — just nutrients. And these nutrients that I'm going to talk about are hands down the most
- **[15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HT3oYW2pQSk&t=906s)** — important nutrients to support the zonulin, to support autoimmune, support the gut lining to
- **[15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HT3oYW2pQSk&t=911s)** — make it really, really tight. Okay. We have zinc, vitamin D, vitamin A, which is in egg
- **[15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HT3oYW2pQSk&t=918s)** — yolks, beef liver, butter, things like that. So now you have the basic information
- **[15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HT3oYW2pQSk&t=922s)** — on what you should be consuming if you have an autoimmune disease. And since we're on the
- **[15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HT3oYW2pQSk&t=928s)** — topic of the gut, another really important video for you to watch would be my more comprehensive
- **[15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HT3oYW2pQSk&t=933s)** — video on the digestive system. And I put that up right here. Check it out.

## Full Transcript with Timestamps

*Click any timestamp to jump to that moment in the video*

- **[00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BlnOEpsPt1A&t=0s)** — Today we are going to talk about the number one blood test that is most overlooked when you are evaluating hair loss.
- **[00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BlnOEpsPt1A&t=6s)** — So whether you have hair loss or thinning of the hair or just a general loss of volume, this video is for you.
- **[00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BlnOEpsPt1A&t=12s)** — Now check this out. Down here we have the hair follicle. There is a big confusion about what a follicle is.
- **[00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BlnOEpsPt1A&t=17s)** — People think that a follicle is your hair. No. The follicle is the cavity that supports the hair.
- **[00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BlnOEpsPt1A&t=23s)** — And what is interesting is that the hair is not alive. The follicle is alive but the hair is not actually alive.
- **[00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BlnOEpsPt1A&t=29s)** — And then we have this little thing underneath the hair root called the dermal papilla.
- **[00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BlnOEpsPt1A&t=33s)** — This is what regulates the growth stages. There are three of them. One is growth, which basically takes between two and seven years.
- **[00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BlnOEpsPt1A&t=41s)** — So your hair has a lifespan of about two to seven years. And then it goes into this transition phase where it starts to loosen up.
- **[00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BlnOEpsPt1A&t=49s)** — Then the third phase, which is the rest phase, which basically that hair releases and then you have another one that replaces it.
- **[00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BlnOEpsPt1A&t=56s)** — And so there is a lot that can go wrong with this area. You might have this powerful form of testosterone called DHT,
- **[01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BlnOEpsPt1A&t=63s)** — which can burn out this follicle or interfere with the regulation of the growth, making the hair smaller or inhibiting this growth process.
- **[01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BlnOEpsPt1A&t=72s)** — You also have scalp calcification. Around this root to the point where you are going to lose blood supply.
- **[01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BlnOEpsPt1A&t=79s)** — And this is why some people do scalp massages or they try to stimulate the scalp to get the blood flow.
- **[01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BlnOEpsPt1A&t=85s)** — But they are dealing with scalp calcification. Now the last point I want to make about this thing right here is that not only regulates the growth stages,
- **[01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BlnOEpsPt1A&t=92s)** — but it also regulates these stem cells, which are super important because the stem cells are kind of cells that don't really have a purpose.
- **[01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BlnOEpsPt1A&t=101s)** — These are specifically going to rest there and wait until you need them. And then they turn into a hair cell.
- **[01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BlnOEpsPt1A&t=107s)** — Now let's get into what test would you possibly want to look at to ensure that you have the best chance of getting a full head of hair.
- **[01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BlnOEpsPt1A&t=116s)** — Can you take a while and guess what nutrient deficiency that would be? If you guessed D3, you are correct.
- **[02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BlnOEpsPt1A&t=123s)** — But when you get your blood tested, unfortunately the doctor is usually going to say, oh it's normal, you're fine, so I'm going to unpack some things about vitamin D.
- **[02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BlnOEpsPt1A&t=132s)** — The first question is, are there any vitamin D genes associated to hair or hair loss?
- **[02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BlnOEpsPt1A&t=139s)** — One thing you need to know about vitamin D, vitamin D is not really a vitamin. It's a hormone and it's involved in 10% of our genes.
- **[02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BlnOEpsPt1A&t=148s)** — So we have like 25,000 genes. So that means it's involved with 2,500 different genes.
- **[02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BlnOEpsPt1A&t=154s)** — And there just so happens to be several really important genes that if you don't have enough vitamin D, that gene will not get triggered to allow this growing process to occur.
- **[02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BlnOEpsPt1A&t=167s)** — And specifically down here in this structure right here, the dermal papilla. So the first gene I want to talk about is called beta-captanin.
- **[02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BlnOEpsPt1A&t=174s)** — This gene does a lot. It regulates the follicle with the stages of developing a hair.
- **[03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BlnOEpsPt1A&t=181s)** — This gene also is essential for going through one phase to another phase. And so if there's not enough vitamin D that's going to trigger that gene, you're not going to have this transition.
- **[03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BlnOEpsPt1A&t=191s)** — And you're really not going to be able to grow the hair to the potential that you should.
- **[03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BlnOEpsPt1A&t=194s)** — Now I'm going to list down all the genes in the description, but I just wanted to mention another gene, just the name of it because I thought it was kind of hilarious.
- **[03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BlnOEpsPt1A&t=203s)** — This is called the Sonic Hedgehog gene. That's right. Sonic Hedgehog? Yeah, look it up. It's true. That's one of the genes that affects the hair that's controlled by vitamin D.
- **[03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BlnOEpsPt1A&t=213s)** — So that's clue number one. Number two, are the receptors for vitamin D in this follicle? Absolutely. There's a high concentration of vitamin D receptors right around through this area right here.
- **[03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BlnOEpsPt1A&t=226s)** — So that explains if you don't have enough vitamin D, you're not going to feed the hair what it needs to grow.
- **[03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BlnOEpsPt1A&t=231s)** — Next question I want to ask is, what about alopecia? Isn't that an autoimmune disease? The answer is yes. And aren't autoimmune diseases related to a vitamin D deficiency?
- **[04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BlnOEpsPt1A&t=241s)** — And the answer is yes. Without vitamin D, your immune system is really at risk for developing autoimmune diseases.
- **[04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BlnOEpsPt1A&t=249s)** — This is why one of the most potent remedies for any autoimmune disease is high levels of vitamin D.
- **[04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BlnOEpsPt1A&t=256s)** — Number one, because it gets rid of the inflammation. But number two, what vitamin D does to your T cells and helping put control over the T cells so they can now differentiate between a normal cell or something else.
- **[04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BlnOEpsPt1A&t=268s)** — Because what is an autoimmune disease? It's your own body attacking itself because it can't tell the difference between your cell and something else. Vitamin D regulates that whole process.
- **[04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BlnOEpsPt1A&t=281s)** — Alright, the next question is related to the scalp. Is there any condition related to the scalp that is related to vitamin D? And the answer is yes.
- **[04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BlnOEpsPt1A&t=290s)** — Psoriasis on the scalp or on your skin, that can be a severe vitamin D deficiency. Dandruff is also related to a vitamin D deficiency.
- **[04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BlnOEpsPt1A&t=299s)** — As well as almost every dermatitis. Because the remedy for all these different types of skin inflammatory diseases is prednisone.
- **[05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BlnOEpsPt1A&t=309s)** — What is prednisone? It's a steroid. What does a steroid do? It gets rid of inflammation. Vitamin D is one of the most potent anti-inflammatories.
- **[05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BlnOEpsPt1A&t=317s)** — But it doesn't come with all the side effects. If any side effects. Because if you have too much buildup of calcium underneath your scalp, around this hair follicle, it's going to starve off the blood flow, the oxygen to that hair.
- **[05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BlnOEpsPt1A&t=331s)** — And it's going to die. So you're going to have hair loss. But the question is how does this relate to vitamin D?
- **[05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BlnOEpsPt1A&t=337s)** — Well, there's another little key to this mystery. And that is magnesium is the most potent regulator of calcium.
- **[05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BlnOEpsPt1A&t=347s)** — Whether you have calcium building up inside your cell or your mitochondria, magnesium is the regulator of that.
- **[05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BlnOEpsPt1A&t=354s)** — If you've watched any of my other videos, I might have talked about vitamin K2 regulating calcium. That's true.
- **[06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BlnOEpsPt1A&t=361s)** — But magnesium is the cofactor to allow the enzymes for vitamin K2 to work. So magnesium is at the bottom of a lot of calcification problems.
- **[06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BlnOEpsPt1A&t=374s)** — Vitamin D is number one. Magnesium is number two. Why? Because magnesium is involved with 300 different enzymes.
- **[06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BlnOEpsPt1A&t=381s)** — And there's actually six of those enzymes that relate to hair. And so if we don't have the right mineral in the hair, we can't develop the structure of the hair.
- **[06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BlnOEpsPt1A&t=390s)** — Another one is just in the energy production of the hair growth. It takes energy to grow hair. And magnesium is at the heart of making energy.
- **[06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BlnOEpsPt1A&t=400s)** — All of the energy in your body cannot be created without magnesium. There are three different places in the biochemistry of vitamin D where if you don't have magnesium,
- **[06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BlnOEpsPt1A&t=409s)** — vitamin D cannot be produced. So that's how it relates. We need magnesium for vitamin D. We also need magnesium to prevent calcification in the scalp.
- **[06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BlnOEpsPt1A&t=418s)** — So magnesium is really important. But the question is, why didn't I mention two different blood tests to do? Magnesium and vitamin D.
- **[07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BlnOEpsPt1A&t=425s)** — Because you cannot test magnesium in your blood and get any accurate information. Out of all the magnesium in your body, only 1% of that is in the blood.
- **[07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BlnOEpsPt1A&t=435s)** — The rest of it is in different places, mainly inside the cell in different places. So when you test magnesium in the blood, you do not get a very accurate picture of what's going on in the cells.
- **[07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BlnOEpsPt1A&t=447s)** — So it's very difficult to test magnesium. Some people might be willing to do a biopsy. That's a great way to test it. There are other tests to do, but they're more difficult and they're not easy to do.
- **[07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BlnOEpsPt1A&t=457s)** — In fact, I know a lot of doctors, and I don't know one doctor who ever ordered those tests. So magnesium is difficult to test. It's involved in a lot of different things.
- **[07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BlnOEpsPt1A&t=466s)** — 300 different enzymes including vitamin D, as well as this calcification thing in your scalp. And most people are deficient in magnesium because it's not easy to get.
- **[07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BlnOEpsPt1A&t=476s)** — And even the doctors don't recognize it because it's not tested. So that answers this question right here. Yes, magnesium is involved with a lot of different enzymes related to hair loss.
- **[08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BlnOEpsPt1A&t=485s)** — But I'm primarily recommending it to allow vitamin D to work. Now let's get into the testing of vitamin D. So you go to your doctor and he or she says, oh, you have normal vitamin D levels.
- **[08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BlnOEpsPt1A&t=496s)** — Okay, so you're okay. And let's say it's on the low end like 20 or even 30 or even maybe sometimes 40. Well, what's not very commonly known is there's two systems of vitamin D.
- **[08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BlnOEpsPt1A&t=509s)** — Okay, we have one system that feeds the calcium in the bone, but we have another system that has other functions that go beyond calcium, like restoring and maintaining and regulating growth of your hair.
- **[08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BlnOEpsPt1A&t=525s)** — All the vitamin D functions of this work off this other system, which is very, very different. I mean, just take a look at what happens. You get the sun, you eat vitamin D from the food, you take supplements.
- **[08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BlnOEpsPt1A&t=538s)** — It goes into your blood. Most of this vitamin D is feeding the calcium in your bone, but very little of it is feeding these other functions. I'm talking about your skin, your hair, your immune system, your gut, very tiny bits of this right here.
- **[09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BlnOEpsPt1A&t=552s)** — I'm talking like .04% of this vitamin D in your blood. So where is the vitamin D coming from? It's coming from either the sun, the vitamin D in your food, or the supplements. This is a different type of vitamin D.
- **[09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BlnOEpsPt1A&t=568s)** — There's actually three different types of vitamin D. And this is where you're getting most of it right through in here. If you're getting daily sun, if you're eating the right kind of foods, and if you take vitamin D on a daily basis,
- **[09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BlnOEpsPt1A&t=582s)** — because the thing about this form of vitamin D, it only has a 24 hour half-life. This is like two to three weeks. 24 hours. This means you need daily amounts of either sun or the vitamin D from the food or the supplements.
- **[09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BlnOEpsPt1A&t=599s)** — And people don't realize this. This is why we have such a massive epidemic of a vitamin D deficiency problem worldwide. In fact, the average person, depending on where you are in the world, has like less than 20 to maybe 30.
- **[10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BlnOEpsPt1A&t=614s)** — That is not enough to create a therapeutic change to be able to feed the hair follicles. There are so many barriers that a person is up against genetically.
- **[10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BlnOEpsPt1A&t=624s)** — The color of the skin. If it's darker, they're going to get less vitamin D. If they have insulin resistance, diabetes, obesity, air pollution, blocking the sun. There's so many different barriers that are going on to prevent vitamin D.
- **[10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BlnOEpsPt1A&t=637s)** — So, what do you need to do? You need to make sure that the blood values when you get your test are at least 70 nanograms per milliliter, up to 100 or even more.
- **[10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BlnOEpsPt1A&t=650s)** — You need higher amounts to be able to penetrate through all the barriers. I'm going to recommend daily amounts of at least 20,000 I use every single day.
- **[10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BlnOEpsPt1A&t=659s)** — Now, the first thing that comes to people's mind is, oh my gosh, that's a toxic amount. No, it's not. If you were out in the sun in the summer for 40 minutes, this is how much vitamin D that you would get.
- **[11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BlnOEpsPt1A&t=671s)** — No one will ever tell you that being on the sun for 40 minutes is going to be toxic to you. They might say that don't get burned. But the point is that you get vitamin D from the sun and you're going to get like every 20 minutes, you're going to get another 10,000 and that is not toxic at all.
- **[11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BlnOEpsPt1A&t=687s)** — Toxicity levels for vitamin D occur when you're taking hundreds of thousands of vitamin D3 every single day for months. And especially without the cofactors. This is why I'm recommending the magnesium with it. At least 50 milligrams. And take that at night.
- **[11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BlnOEpsPt1A&t=702s)** — But you want to take the cofactors. Magnesium, K2, zinc. So this data about vitamin D is interesting as it relates to the hair. But it's even more interesting that you can't really go by these low normals, okay? Because this is a different system.
- **[11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BlnOEpsPt1A&t=717s)** — So we want to raise this higher by taking more of it on a daily basis with the cofactors. Now if you have no hair in your head and you have calcification in your scalp, then you might want to take even a little bit more magnesium over a period of time because that could eventually help regulate the amount of calcium buildup in the soft tissues.
- **[12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BlnOEpsPt1A&t=739s)** — Now there are a few more nutrients I want to share with you related to the hair because I just talked about the most important one and the blood test. But let's get into the other ones. And I also want to mention that vitamin D also inhibits this DHT from destroying this follicle.
- **[12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BlnOEpsPt1A&t=758s)** — So vitamin D protects you against high levels of this very powerful form of testosterone. So vitamin D does a lot. But there's also other nutrients like zinc controls the growth and repair. If you're deficient in zinc, you can have dry hair as well. And you can have just short hairs or even hair loss. So that's very important.
- **[12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BlnOEpsPt1A&t=777s)** — Iron is also important in the red blood cells. So when you get your ferritin levels tested, make sure it's above 70. You're normally going to see this in a situation where a woman is menstruating and they're losing iron. In which case they need to consume more red meat or liver or liver pills, something like that. But you might also see it in men with too much ferritin or too much iron.
- **[13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BlnOEpsPt1A&t=802s)** — Now wait a second, how could that correlate? Well, what happens is there's certain genetic problems where we tend to accumulate more iron. In which case we're very deficient in iron at the same time. This is why especially men that have too much iron are severely anemic. Because it just doesn't work. In that case, you might need to go donate blood because it can be very toxic. But it can also affect your hair because it's locked up and you also become anemic. And also if you're B12 deficient, which you need for the red blood cells, you need iron and B12.
- **[13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BlnOEpsPt1A&t=832s)** — Then the hair follicle can't get oxygen. So that's another test to take a look at. As well as your omega 3s. If you're low in omega 3 because maybe you're doing a lot of seed oil, that can also create dryness of the hair.
- **[14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BlnOEpsPt1A&t=845s)** — Anyway, it's a lot to unpack. I think it's very important. Start taking vitamin D and also magnesium. And please comment down below if this helps you with any problem that you have with your hair. Thanks for watching and I will see you in the next video.

- **[00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vJu7v9JtD-o&t=0s)** — If you have Mitral Valve Prolapse Syndrome, today we are going to talk about the number one nutrient deficiency in this syndrome.
- **[00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vJu7v9JtD-o&t=8s)** — The first question is, what is Mitral Valve Prolapse? Well, you have these valves in the heart.
- **[00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vJu7v9JtD-o&t=12s)** — They are little doors that open and shut. And if they can close and open correctly, the motor,
- **[00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vJu7v9JtD-o&t=18s)** — the pump is very efficient and you feel great. Everything is fine. But with the Mitral Valve
- **[00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vJu7v9JtD-o&t=23s)** — Prolapse, they are kind of floppy, they kind of leak, they are kind of large and they can bulge.
- **[00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vJu7v9JtD-o&t=30s)** — And this bulging is called prolapse. Prolapse is kind of a displaced tissue from the normal position.
- **[00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vJu7v9JtD-o&t=37s)** — So we have the valve in the wrong position. It is just not correct. And from that, you get a lot
- **[00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vJu7v9JtD-o&t=44s)** — of inefficiency of this heart pumping action. And this creates various symptoms like weakness,
- **[00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vJu7v9JtD-o&t=50s)** — fatigue, palpitations, anxiety, shortness of breath. And if you look this condition up,
- **[00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vJu7v9JtD-o&t=57s)** — a lot of times you will see a word connected to it called idiopathic. That basically means,
- **[01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vJu7v9JtD-o&t=62s)** — we do not know what caused it. And this condition is usually treated with either
- **[01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vJu7v9JtD-o&t=66s)** — beta blockers or a calcium channel blocker. Now, there is a very interesting research
- **[01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vJu7v9JtD-o&t=72s)** — paper on this. And so I am going to show you what I found. I am going to put those
- **[01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vJu7v9JtD-o&t=75s)** — in the description. But from the American Journal of Cardiology, there was a double
- **[01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vJu7v9JtD-o&t=80s)** — blind study done. And the title of this paper was, clinical symptoms of mitral valve prolapse
- **[01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vJu7v9JtD-o&t=87s)** — are related to hypomagnesemia. See, now you can use that at a party to sound really,
- **[01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vJu7v9JtD-o&t=94s)** — really smart. You can ask your friends, have you ever been checked for hypomagnesemia?
- **[01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vJu7v9JtD-o&t=98s)** — Just do not mention my name when you ask them that. Basically, that means you have
- **[01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vJu7v9JtD-o&t=101s)** — low magnesium in your blood. And attenuated, that means lessened by magnesium supplements.
- **[01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vJu7v9JtD-o&t=110s)** — They had 141 subjects and they compared it to 40 people who did not have this condition.
- **[01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vJu7v9JtD-o&t=116s)** — And the first thing they did is they tested both groups for magnesium deficiency. And they
- **[02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vJu7v9JtD-o&t=121s)** — found in the group with mitral valve prolapse, there was a 60% deficiency of magnesium. Now,
- **[02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vJu7v9JtD-o&t=128s)** — the healthy group, only 5% of these people had a magnesium deficiency. And the results were this.
- **[02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vJu7v9JtD-o&t=136s)** — There was a significant decrease in anxiety, weakness, shortness of breath, and palpitations.
- **[02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vJu7v9JtD-o&t=145s)** — And there was also a significant decrease in adrenaline. I do not know if you know this,
- **[02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vJu7v9JtD-o&t=152s)** — but when you have low magnesium, adrenaline tends to go high. Now, check this out. This
- **[02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vJu7v9JtD-o&t=158s)** — is interesting. A magnesium deficiency accelerates the aging of the fibroblast cell. It is basically
- **[02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vJu7v9JtD-o&t=167s)** — the cell that helps you make collagen, elastin, and hyaluronic acid. Now, all three of these
- **[02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vJu7v9JtD-o&t=174s)** — things are like really important as we age for our skin, for our ligaments, for our tendons,
- **[03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vJu7v9JtD-o&t=181s)** — for our valves. Well, apparently this is kind of one theory of why we developed this mitral valve
- **[03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vJu7v9JtD-o&t=188s)** — prolapse. Because of the magnesium deficiency and the fibroblast, the formation of those little
- **[03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vJu7v9JtD-o&t=193s)** — collagen elastic valves. Now, if you actually watched my other video on magnesium, the one
- **[03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vJu7v9JtD-o&t=201s)** — where I talk about the first symptom of a magnesium deficiency is tetany, like twitching,
- **[03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vJu7v9JtD-o&t=207s)** — like that. Maybe underneath the left eye, could be anywhere in the body. If we just take a look at
- **[03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vJu7v9JtD-o&t=212s)** — tetany in relationship to the heart, this tetany is the heart's equivalent to this mitral
- **[03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vJu7v9JtD-o&t=218s)** — valve prolapse and its associated symptoms like arrhythmias. Because tetany is a problem with
- **[03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vJu7v9JtD-o&t=226s)** — the muscle nerve connection. Well, if you have that in the heart, you can have an arrhythmia.
- **[03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vJu7v9JtD-o&t=231s)** — And check this out, 85% of people with mitral valve prolapse have tetany and other places in
- **[03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vJu7v9JtD-o&t=239s)** — the body. And if we come back to the medications that are used, what does a beta blocker do?
- **[04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vJu7v9JtD-o&t=246s)** — It blocks adrenaline, the very thing that's increased with a magnesium deficiency. When you
- **[04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vJu7v9JtD-o&t=253s)** — take magnesium, you don't want to just rely on the RDAs because you're usually already
- **[04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vJu7v9JtD-o&t=259s)** — deficient. And it takes many years to become deficient. And so if you take a look at like a
- **[04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vJu7v9JtD-o&t=264s)** — lifelong deficiency of magnesium, just by going to the regular RDAs, you're probably not going
- **[04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vJu7v9JtD-o&t=270s)** — to fix that problem. Magnesium is tightly regulated. And so when you take magnesium,
- **[04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vJu7v9JtD-o&t=275s)** — it's going to like, it's not just going to spike up overnight, it's going to slowly
- **[04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vJu7v9JtD-o&t=280s)** — increase over a period of months. And it could take even a year. I had someone reach out to
- **[04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vJu7v9JtD-o&t=286s)** — me and they said, you know, I have arrhythmias and I was taking the magnesium and I didn't really
- **[04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vJu7v9JtD-o&t=292s)** — see any change. I took it for a week. I said, did you realize how long it takes to fulfill
- **[04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vJu7v9JtD-o&t=298s)** — a chronic lifelong magnesium deficiency? It takes quite some time. I would take 400 milligrams
- **[05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vJu7v9JtD-o&t=305s)** — twice or even maybe three times a day. And of course, I would work up to it. I would start
- **[05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vJu7v9JtD-o&t=310s)** — with 400 milligrams for several days, then go up to 800 milligrams. I would take one in the morning,
- **[05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vJu7v9JtD-o&t=318s)** — one in the afternoon, and then take that for maybe a few weeks, and then maybe even add a
- **[05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vJu7v9JtD-o&t=323s)** — little bit more. I would also, and this is important, make sure you have enough vitamin D.
- **[05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vJu7v9JtD-o&t=328s)** — Magnesium won't work without vitamin D. Very, very important. And as a minimum amount,
- **[05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vJu7v9JtD-o&t=334s)** — would take 10,000 I use of vitamin D3. And of course, I would make sure I avoid the things
- **[05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vJu7v9JtD-o&t=341s)** — that deplete magnesium. Sugar, refined carbohydrates, like the breads, the pasta, the cereal,
- **[05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vJu7v9JtD-o&t=347s)** — the crackers, the biscuits. If we even take a look at what sugar does to magnesium, if you
- **[05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vJu7v9JtD-o&t=352s)** — were to eat sugar right now, let's just say you're eating glucose as one half of the sugar
- **[05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vJu7v9JtD-o&t=356s)** — It would take 24 atoms of magnesium to help process and deal with one molecule of glucose.
- **[06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vJu7v9JtD-o&t=369s)** — And then if we get to fructose, to metabolize one molecule of fructose, you need 56 atoms of
- **[06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vJu7v9JtD-o&t=377s)** — magnesium. And also if you're cooking and boiling the food, you could kind of, you know,
- **[06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vJu7v9JtD-o&t=382s)** — a lot of magnesium. I mean, in America, there's like 50% of the population that consumes ultra
- **[06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vJu7v9JtD-o&t=388s)** — processed foods. So you know, every single one of those people are severely deficient in magnesium.
- **[06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vJu7v9JtD-o&t=395s)** — The main takeaway from this video is this. It takes years for a magnesium deficiency
- **[06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vJu7v9JtD-o&t=399s)** — to show up. And it also takes a year for the magnesium to be corrected in the body.
- **[06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vJu7v9JtD-o&t=406s)** — And the type of magnesium I would recommend is called magnesium glycinate. Now there's another
- **[06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vJu7v9JtD-o&t=413s)** — very popular video that I did on magnesium that I highly recommend you watch. I'll
- **[06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vJu7v9JtD-o&t=418s)** — put it up right here. Check it out.

- **[00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4-llgWDKEkM&t=0s)** — If we take a look over the last 50 years and evaluate all of the foods that we've been eating,
- **[00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4-llgWDKEkM&t=8s)** — and we have consumed this one food in a massive amount. Check out this graph. So on the left here
- **[00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4-llgWDKEkM&t=15s)** — we have various different types of foods which I'm hiding right here. And we can see the relative
- **[00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4-llgWDKEkM&t=20s)** — amounts of certain calories, right? Compared from 1970 to 2014. You can see this one food
- **[00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4-llgWDKEkM&t=28s)** — here spiked over 8,000 percent. That's 8,853 percent. Compared to this food spiked 198 percent. This
- **[00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4-llgWDKEkM&t=40s)** — one 129 percent. And these are quite large, but nothing compared to this one food right here. Can

- **[00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4-llgWDKEkM&t=56s)** — American. That equals about 63 pounds. Most ultra processed foods have three basic ingredients.
- **[01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4-llgWDKEkM&t=64s)** — The starches that includes maltodextrin, modified food starch, and modified cornstarch.
- **[01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4-llgWDKEkM&t=71s)** — You have the sugar, which usually is in the form of glucose syrup, corn syrup,
- **[01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4-llgWDKEkM&t=76s)** — or beet sugar. Then you have seed oils like corn oil, and soy oil, and canola. So I did
- **[01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4-llgWDKEkM&t=83s)** — mention this ingredient yet. Can you still guess what it is? I'll give you another hint. When you
- **[01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4-llgWDKEkM&t=88s)** — consume it, only one organ can break it down. And that is the liver. And this ingredient acts
- **[01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4-llgWDKEkM&t=96s)** — much like alcohol, even though it's not alcohol. In other words, the body has to get rid of it,
- **[01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4-llgWDKEkM&t=101s)** — and it uses similar pathways to break it down. And it produces seven times the glycation effect.
- **[01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4-llgWDKEkM&t=107s)** — And glycation is when you have the combining of a protein to a sugar. And when you consume
- **[01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4-llgWDKEkM&t=111s)** — it, it suppresses hunger. It also depletes your vitamins and minerals. It's probably one of the
- **[01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4-llgWDKEkM&t=116s)** — most potent triggers to metabolic syndrome, a fatty liver, inflammation. Can you guess what it
- **[02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4-llgWDKEkM&t=122s)** — is? Let's take a look. Okay, high fructose corn syrup. That's right, high fructose corn syrup
- **[02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4-llgWDKEkM&t=130s)** — has spiked by over 8,000%. Let's take a look at the next one. Corn products. That would be
- **[02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4-llgWDKEkM&t=138s)** — corn starch. That would be the corn oil, but not necessarily high fructose corn syrup. And I do
- **[02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4-llgWDKEkM&t=144s)** — not think this includes the seed oils. All right, next one is skim milk has increased by 129%.
- **[02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4-llgWDKEkM&t=153s)** — Then we get chicken, turkey. Then we get added fats and oils. Vegetables have been
- **[02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4-llgWDKEkM&t=160s)** — going down by 3%. Butter has been down training about 8%. And then we have eggs
- **[02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4-llgWDKEkM&t=166s)** — downtrending by 21%. Beef downtrending by 29%. So there's a lot of people against beef because
- **[02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4-llgWDKEkM&t=175s)** — they think it's the problem, but it's been decreasing by almost 30% over this time period.
- **[03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4-llgWDKEkM&t=181s)** — And look at this, refined white sugar has been decreasing or downtrending by 35%
- **[03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4-llgWDKEkM&t=187s)** — over this time period. So high fructose corn syrup is very poisonous. You need to avoid it.
- **[03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4-llgWDKEkM&t=193s)** — It's hidden in a lot of different foods and drinks and sodas and other processed foods.
- **[03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4-llgWDKEkM&t=199s)** — You just have to start reading the labels. Unfortunately, we subsidize corn. So a good
- **[03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4-llgWDKEkM&t=205s)** — portion of the corn that these manufacturing companies use come from what's called dent corn,
- **[03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4-llgWDKEkM&t=211s)** — which is not even edible. They're even making milk out of corn right now. I'm not kidding.
- **[03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4-llgWDKEkM&t=216s)** — Most of it's GMO, which means it's herbicide tolerant. You spray an herbicide on it like
- **[03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4-llgWDKEkM&t=222s)** — a phosphate and it doesn't die. Unfortunately, the US is the top producer of corn and the top
- **[03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4-llgWDKEkM&t=228s)** — consumer of corn. Corn has now replaced the consumption of rice in China. And most
- **[03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4-llgWDKEkM&t=235s)** — the corn sold in the US is sold for animal feeds. Unfortunately, they don't really use
- **[04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4-llgWDKEkM&t=240s)** — grass as much as they should. In 1930, farmers would extract about 20 and a half bushels
- **[04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4-llgWDKEkM&t=248s)** — of corn per acre. In 2022, farmers extract 173 bushels per acre. With the advent of all the
- **[04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4-llgWDKEkM&t=259s)** — different pesticides and GMOs, we can grow a tremendous amount of product in a very small
- **[04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4-llgWDKEkM&t=265s)** — area, which is not only not good for the environment, but not good for the soil,
- **[04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4-llgWDKEkM&t=269s)** — not good for our health. So as you start to read ingredients, not only avoid the
- **[04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4-llgWDKEkM&t=276s)** — fructose corn syrup, but also the modified food starch, as well as the modified corn
- **[04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4-llgWDKEkM&t=282s)** — starch and the maltodextrin and the glucose syrup and the seed oils. Now,
- **[04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4-llgWDKEkM&t=287s)** — if we want to flip to the absolute best food you should be eating, you should watch

- **[00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6RPRzN4kTWI&t=0s)** — Today I'm going to talk about skin diseases and dermatitis. Dermatitis comes from the word
- **[00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6RPRzN4kTWI&t=4s)** — derm, which means skin, itis, inflammation of. There are many, many different types of dermatitis.
- **[00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6RPRzN4kTWI&t=13s)** — And I just want to share there's a common denominator with every single one of these
- **[00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6RPRzN4kTWI&t=18s)** — conditions. But here's the thing, you have this skin inflammatory condition. There's redness,
- **[00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6RPRzN4kTWI&t=24s)** — there's itching, might be blisters, there might be flakiness. Each one has its own scientific name.
- **[00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6RPRzN4kTWI&t=30s)** — But in this video, I'm going to make this whole topic extremely simple. And I think it could be
- **[00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6RPRzN4kTWI&t=35s)** — very useful for anyone who has any type of skin problems. I mean, you have contact dermatitis.
- **[00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6RPRzN4kTWI&t=41s)** — Contact means you come in contact with it and you get some itchiness or some rash. And then
- **[00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6RPRzN4kTWI&t=45s)** — you have something called atopic dermatitis. Then you have something that's called saboreic
- **[00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6RPRzN4kTWI&t=50s)** — and the derivation comes from a word that means discharge or flowing. And you have many
- **[00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6RPRzN4kTWI&t=57s)** — different types of dermatitis, like in plainness, in pitigo, candida, dermatitis, psoriasis,
- **[01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6RPRzN4kTWI&t=64s)** — eczema. So you have all these very scientific sounding descriptions of various symptoms that
- **[01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6RPRzN4kTWI&t=71s)** — revolve around your skin. But basically when it boils down to skin problems, you either have
- **[01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6RPRzN4kTWI&t=76s)** — reaction to something like an allergy reaction, or you have some type of immune reaction that's
- **[01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6RPRzN4kTWI&t=81s)** — reacting to bacteria, a virus, a fungus, etc. Many of the symptoms from skin conditions
- **[01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6RPRzN4kTWI&t=89s)** — are really coming from our own immune system that is reacting to something. So you can
- **[01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6RPRzN4kTWI&t=96s)** — consider a lot of these conditions as an overreactive immune system. So what's the most
- **[01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6RPRzN4kTWI&t=102s)** — common treatment? Steroids, topical or oral. It suppresses the immune system. And then of
- **[01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6RPRzN4kTWI&t=110s)** — course the next most common treatment is an antibiotic. So you kill only bacteria. And this
- **[01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6RPRzN4kTWI&t=115s)** — is why many times you end up with a secondary infection, an overgrowth of candida, an overgrowth
- **[02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6RPRzN4kTWI&t=121s)** — of fungus, mold, or yeast. What you need to know is the superficial part of your skin is
- **[02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6RPRzN4kTWI&t=129s)** — a universe of bacteria, microbes, all different types. It's called commensal relationship, where
- **[02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6RPRzN4kTWI&t=138s)** — they don't bother you, you don't bother them, and everything is just fine. And then the skin
- **[02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6RPRzN4kTWI&t=142s)** — itself is a barrier because right underneath the skin you have a huge network of lymphatic
- **[02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6RPRzN4kTWI&t=150s)** — tissue, blood vessels, capillaries, which is just filled with immune cells ready to protect
- **[02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6RPRzN4kTWI&t=157s)** — against foreign invaders. So what's the common thread or problem in all of these conditions?
- **[02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6RPRzN4kTWI&t=162s)** — They all seem to significantly respond in a positive way to taking vitamin D. For example,
- **[02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6RPRzN4kTWI&t=169s)** — when you have hives from something called contact dermatitis. So you got this itchiness.
- **[02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6RPRzN4kTWI&t=175s)** — Well, vitamin D inhibits the cells that make histamine. They're called mast cells. Vitamin D
- **[03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6RPRzN4kTWI&t=182s)** — lowers the histamine response. Vitamin D is the main regulator or controller of your immune
- **[03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6RPRzN4kTWI&t=190s)** — system. And even if you look at almost every single one of these skin problems are worse
- **[03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6RPRzN4kTWI&t=195s)** — in the winter. What a coincidence when we have the lowest amount of vitamin D. They're
- **[03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6RPRzN4kTWI&t=200s)** — also worse under stress. It just so happens when you raise cortisol from stress, you
- **[03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6RPRzN4kTWI&t=207s)** — can take vitamin D and take vitamin D. Now, even with acne, for example, that involves the
- **[03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6RPRzN4kTWI&t=212s)** — sebaceous gland, when you take vitamin D, it can help shrink and normalize the sebaceous
- **[03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6RPRzN4kTWI&t=218s)** — gland and help regulate the overproduction of that oil. One version of that, if it's on the
- **[03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6RPRzN4kTWI&t=226s)** — scalp, is dandruff. And you can use vitamin D cream to successfully treat dandruff. Eczema,
- **[03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6RPRzN4kTWI&t=234s)** — psoriasis, vitiligo, as well as alopecia are all related to having a vitamin D deficiency. In fact,
- **[04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6RPRzN4kTWI&t=240s)** — it's usually the low vitamin D that triggers an autoimmune disease. But here's the interesting
- **[04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6RPRzN4kTWI&t=245s)** — thing about microbes. Because if you have a type of infection on your skin or anywhere in
- **[04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6RPRzN4kTWI&t=250s)** — your body with a microbe, what some of them do is they start to reduce the vitamin D
- **[04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6RPRzN4kTWI&t=256s)** — in your skin. And ultimately, that's the end point where vitamin D can connect and be
- **[04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6RPRzN4kTWI&t=264s)** — activated. And if the microbe can keep that not working that well, then the microbe can survive.
- **[04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6RPRzN4kTWI&t=271s)** — But also, I found out that certain fungi will do it as well. The real solution is just to
- **[04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6RPRzN4kTWI&t=277s)** — take more vitamin D. Vitamin D increases a certain enzyme that helps you make melanin. And
- **[04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6RPRzN4kTWI&t=284s)** — it's the pigment in your skin. So when you're deficient in vitamin D, you're more susceptible
- **[04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6RPRzN4kTWI&t=290s)** — to vitiligo. Vitamin D has a very potent anti fungal effect. It directly inhibits
- **[04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6RPRzN4kTWI&t=299s)** — fungal growth from preventing the development of a fungal infection to preventing biofilms,
- **[05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6RPRzN4kTWI&t=305s)** — which is a condition where you have microbes that start to develop these little calcium
- **[05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6RPRzN4kTWI&t=310s)** — cells. But vitamin D helps prevent the biofilms. Even when you don't have enough vitamin D,
- **[05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6RPRzN4kTWI&t=317s)** — your skin becomes drier and less hydrated. And this whole area of dermatology seems to be very,
- **[05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6RPRzN4kTWI&t=323s)** — very complex. But there's a common theme between almost every single skin disorder,
- **[05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6RPRzN4kTWI&t=329s)** — and that would be a vitamin D deficiency. And since we're on the topic of autoimmune
- **[05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6RPRzN4kTWI&t=333s)** — conditions on the skin, if you have not seen this video on psoriasis, check it out. I put
- **[05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6RPRzN4kTWI&t=338s)** — it up right here.

- **[00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZ7MLOc9k9c&t=0s)** — You know, when I was in high school, I was lifting weights and I wanted to bulk up.
- **[00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZ7MLOc9k9c&t=3s)** — So I went to the health food store and I bought these Muscle Gainer protein powders, right?
- **[00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZ7MLOc9k9c&t=8s)** — And I started consuming them. And man, did I feel like crap. And now I know why. Because
- **[00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZ7MLOc9k9c&t=14s)** — there's one ingredient that is pretty dangerous. And they put this certain ingredient into these
- **[00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZ7MLOc9k9c&t=19s)** — products to enhance muscle growth. But you're going to find out it's not going to do that.
- **[00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZ7MLOc9k9c&t=25s)** — Personally, I think it's a very dangerous ingredient. It can increase acne, bloating,
- **[00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZ7MLOc9k9c&t=31s)** — inflammation in the gut, mental irritability and anxiety, insomnia. It's highly addictive
- **[00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZ7MLOc9k9c&t=37s)** — because it increases dopamine, which is like the reward neurotransmitter. And it'll actually
- **[00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZ7MLOc9k9c&t=42s)** — produce more acid in your mouth to promote cavities. But the worst thing it'll do,
- **[00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZ7MLOc9k9c&t=47s)** — it'll spike your blood sugar so high, way more than sugar, and then create a crash right after.
- **[00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZ7MLOc9k9c&t=55s)** — Now, if you do this repetitively, you're going to develop belly fat, high cholesterol, and you know,
- **[01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZ7MLOc9k9c&t=61s)** — a fatty liver. Other than that, I'm sure it's going to be fine. And this ingredient is usually
- **[01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZ7MLOc9k9c&t=65s)** — the first ingredient in the list on the label, which means it represents most of the product.
- **[01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZ7MLOc9k9c&t=72s)** — And this ingredient is called maltodextrin. This is one of the worst ingredients in most
- **[01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZ7MLOc9k9c&t=78s)** — ultra processed food products, aka junk food, where they start out with dent corn. What's dent
- **[01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZ7MLOc9k9c&t=85s)** — corn? Dent corn is an edible. You can't eat it. Okay, it's for feed and things like that.
- **[01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZ7MLOc9k9c&t=90s)** — They grind it up into powder, and then they add acids and alkaline chemicals to it. And
- **[01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZ7MLOc9k9c&t=96s)** — then they'll heat it up, they'll put pressure into it. And they have to take the color out,
- **[01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZ7MLOc9k9c&t=101s)** — take the odor out. And then you end up with this powder. And what's wild about
- **[01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZ7MLOc9k9c&t=106s)** — maltodextrin is that it's a filler. It's just some cheap material to add bulk to a product,
- **[01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZ7MLOc9k9c&t=113s)** — so they can make more money. I mean, there's absolutely no benefit to taking this for your
- **[01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZ7MLOc9k9c&t=117s)** — body. It's classified as a carbohydrate, but it acts like a sugar. So when you read the
- **[02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZ7MLOc9k9c&t=124s)** — label, you're looking, oh, yeah, it's low in sugar. Take a look on the glycemic index,
- **[02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZ7MLOc9k9c&t=128s)** — which is the index that shows you how much an ingredient spikes your blood sugar. Table sugar
- **[02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZ7MLOc9k9c&t=134s)** — is about 65. Glucose is 100. Maltodextrin is between 105 and 185 on that scale. So it creates
- **[02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZ7MLOc9k9c&t=145s)** — way more of a spike than even glucose. And check this out, in one serving, they're going
- **[02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZ7MLOc9k9c&t=150s)** — to put 253 grams. Now in your mind, you're going, well, okay, it's 253 grams of carbs.
- **[02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZ7MLOc9k9c&t=157s)** — No, it's not. It's 253 grams of sugar, which is equivalent to 60 teaspoons of sugar. This is
- **[02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZ7MLOc9k9c&t=165s)** — just in one serving. 1012 calories of sugar. Actually, it's something that's even worse than
- **[02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZ7MLOc9k9c&t=171s)** — sugar. You're going to put in your body to supposedly bulk up your muscles. I mean,
- **[02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZ7MLOc9k9c&t=177s)** — per serving, they're only going to give you 50 grams of protein as whey protein and 253
- **[03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZ7MLOc9k9c&t=183s)** — grams of carbohydrate and sugar, right? It's not a good ratio. I mean, you don't want to combine
- **[03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZ7MLOc9k9c&t=189s)** — protein with that much starch or sugar because it creates all sorts of issues in your body.
- **[03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZ7MLOc9k9c&t=195s)** — So when you dump that much carbohydrate into the energy factory called the mitochondria,
- **[03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZ7MLOc9k9c&t=201s)** — your demand for certain vitamins are going to go super, super high. Like for B1, for
- **[03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZ7MLOc9k9c&t=212s)** — much pure sugar. Of course, they add some vitamins in there, but they only add like
- **[03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZ7MLOc9k9c&t=218s)** — 0.4 milligrams of B1. That's not going to even come in the ballpark of how much you need. So
- **[03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZ7MLOc9k9c&t=224s)** — what happens is you end up depleting your nutrients when you take this much refined
- **[03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZ7MLOc9k9c&t=229s)** — carbohydrate. I mean, just think about what this starch really is. It's ultra processed,
- **[03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZ7MLOc9k9c&t=235s)** — which means they're extracting enzymes, vitamins, trace minerals. When you consume that,
- **[04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZ7MLOc9k9c&t=242s)** — it takes a lot of nutrient reserves that you have in your body to be able to even metabolize
- **[04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZ7MLOc9k9c&t=248s)** — that. So you end up depleting things down the road when you can keep consuming it.
- **[04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZ7MLOc9k9c&t=254s)** — And in the process, you're creating a lot of what's called oxidation, which is kind of like
- **[04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZ7MLOc9k9c&t=258s)** — you're rusting your body out from the inside out. And that's going to lead to inflammation.
- **[04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZ7MLOc9k9c&t=263s)** — And you not knowing that, not even realizing you're getting that much sugar, you might think,
- **[04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZ7MLOc9k9c&t=267s)** — oh yeah, it's a great product. It's because everyone else is doing it. It's become normalized.
- **[04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZ7MLOc9k9c&t=273s)** — It doesn't even fit the definition of the word food. So it can't even be called ultra
- **[04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZ7MLOc9k9c&t=277s)** — processed food, because it can't sustain life. You can't live on it. So you can imagine what's
- **[04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZ7MLOc9k9c&t=282s)** — happened to the pancreas too, because every time you consume that it's like a massive spike
- **[04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZ7MLOc9k9c&t=287s)** — of blood sugars. And that cell that makes this is pumping out of this insulin, it's just
- **[04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZ7MLOc9k9c&t=291s)** — going to be like whiplashed every time you take it. And you're going to find that after you take
- **[04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZ7MLOc9k9c&t=296s)** — it, you're going to feel kind of groggy. Blood sugars kind of feel funky. Next morning,
- **[04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZ7MLOc9k9c&t=299s)** — hard to get out of bed. And you wake up with low blood sugar, because you ate sugar the day
- **[05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZ7MLOc9k9c&t=305s)** — before, which will cause you to want more of that to fulfill this emptiness. But then you
- **[05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZ7MLOc9k9c&t=312s)** — keep doing this over weeks and months. And now what happens is the body's going to start
- **[05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZ7MLOc9k9c&t=317s)** — developing something called insulin resistance. And now it's going to be harder and harder to get
- **[05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZ7MLOc9k9c&t=322s)** — energy into the cells. And it's going to be harder to grow your muscles. To grow muscles,
- **[05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZ7MLOc9k9c&t=327s)** — you need exercise, you need protein. Nowhere have I ever observed that you need high doses
- **[05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZ7MLOc9k9c&t=335s)** — of refined sugar to grow muscle. Yes, it increases insulin. And insulin is an anabolic
- **[05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZ7MLOc9k9c&t=342s)** — hormone. But the problem is, when you start to stimulate insulin over a period of time,
- **[05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZ7MLOc9k9c&t=347s)** — you develop what's called insulin resistance. And that's what really creates a deficiency of
- **[05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZ7MLOc9k9c&t=351s)** — insulin because you develop this resistance. It's just part of the body trying to protect
- **[05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZ7MLOc9k9c&t=356s)** — itself from getting that much sugar. It'll start blocking it because sugar is toxic.
- **[06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZ7MLOc9k9c&t=361s)** — So if you haven't seen my full video on how to grow muscle that healthy way,
- **[06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZ7MLOc9k9c&t=366s)** — I'm going to put this video up right here. Check it out.

- **[00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8QqHBDxA94&t=0s)** — So when to take ginger and when not to take ginger, that's what we're going to talk about today.
- **[00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8QqHBDxA94&t=6s)** — Ginger can be a powerful remedy for so many things. It's been around for thousands of years.
- **[00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8QqHBDxA94&t=10s)** — It's been used on ships to prevent scurvy. Confucius, the Chinese philosopher,
- **[00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8QqHBDxA94&t=16s)** — not just consumed it every day, but he consumed it every single meal. In the 14th century,
- **[00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8QqHBDxA94&t=22s)** — a pound of ginger cost the same as buying an entire sheep, so it was very expensive.
- **[00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8QqHBDxA94&t=28s)** — Ginger was one of the first spices to be exported from southwest India. And ginger has very high
- **[00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8QqHBDxA94&t=36s)** — antioxidant levels, only to be surpassed by pomegranate juice. Now the benefits I'm going
- **[00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8QqHBDxA94&t=41s)** — to tell you are based on a paper that looked at 190 articles on ginger. From that, 43 meant
- **[00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8QqHBDxA94&t=49s)** — high quality evidence. Ginger has many many effects. Antimicrobial, anti-inflammatory,
- **[00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8QqHBDxA94&t=55s)** — anti-diabetic. There's anti-cancer properties, especially colorectal. It's also great for
- **[01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8QqHBDxA94&t=62s)** — menstrual pain, arthritis, increasing HDL, as well as improving heartburn. But ginger's biggest
- **[01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8QqHBDxA94&t=69s)** — effect that it's known for is its ability to get rid of feeling nauseous. So it creates an
- **[01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8QqHBDxA94&t=76s)** — anti-nausea effect when you're pregnant, going through chemo, when you feel nauseous,
- **[01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8QqHBDxA94&t=82s)** — having a menstrual cycle, as well as after a surgery. I remember when I had my shoulder
- **[01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8QqHBDxA94&t=88s)** — surgery, I came out of it and I felt very very nauseous. So any time you feel nauseous,
- **[01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8QqHBDxA94&t=93s)** — think ginger. In fact, they compared vitamin B6 to ginger. And ginger was more effective than
- **[01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8QqHBDxA94&t=100s)** — vitamin B6. There's some contraindications that you need to know about. In other words,
- **[01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8QqHBDxA94&t=104s)** — if you're taking ginger and you have the following things I'm going to talk about,
- **[01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8QqHBDxA94&t=108s)** — to stop taking it. If you're on warfarin or you're on some type of blood thinner or aspirin,
- **[01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8QqHBDxA94&t=114s)** — because ginger helps you thin the blood. And if you're on a blood thinner and you're taking
- **[01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8QqHBDxA94&t=119s)** — ginger, you're going to thin the blood even more. And also if you have a bleeding disorder,
- **[02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8QqHBDxA94&t=123s)** — I wouldn't take ginger. Now ginger also inhibits insulin. So if you're taking insulin,
- **[02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8QqHBDxA94&t=129s)** — you have to be careful because it's going to bring your blood sugars down. And of course,
- **[02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8QqHBDxA94&t=132s)** — next question is if we compare medication to ginger, there's probably less side effects from
- **[02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8QqHBDxA94&t=138s)** — ginger. So why wouldn't you just want to take that? You can talk with your doctor about that.
- **[02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8QqHBDxA94&t=143s)** — But I mean, it just fascinates me that when I was in practice, some people would take natural
- **[02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8QqHBDxA94&t=148s)** — remedies, right? While they're taking certain medications. And the doctor get very, very
- **[02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8QqHBDxA94&t=153s)** — upset because the natural remedies were interfering with the medications. Now a couple of things
- **[02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8QqHBDxA94&t=159s)** — about ginger. Ginger tends to lower your blood pressure. So if you're taking blood pressure
- **[02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8QqHBDxA94&t=164s)** — medication, whether it's a beta blocker or a calcium channel blocker or a diuretic,
- **[02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8QqHBDxA94&t=170s)** — apparently ginger can make your blood pressure go lower. So you might want to consult your
- **[02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8QqHBDxA94&t=174s)** — doctor on that one point. And lastly, ginger stimulates the gallbladder. You might not
- **[03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8QqHBDxA94&t=180s)** — want to take ginger if you have gallstones, especially if they're big. Now, since we're on
- **[03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8QqHBDxA94&t=185s)** — topic of natural remedies, if you have not seen my apple cider vinegar and lemon video,
- **[03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8QqHBDxA94&t=190s)** — I put it up right here. Check it out. I think you'll enjoy it.

- **[00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=29NS6PxfE2s&t=0s)** — Today we are going to talk about vitamin B6 deficiency symptoms that you have never heard before.
- **[00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=29NS6PxfE2s&t=6s)** — Now, the data I am going to share with you is out of this book right here.
- **[00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=29NS6PxfE2s&t=9s)** — One of my favorite books, Laboratory Evaluations for Integrative and Functional Medicine.
- **[00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=29NS6PxfE2s&t=16s)** — It is amazing because it covers every aspect of nutrition in depth.
- **[00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=29NS6PxfE2s&t=22s)** — So, I have tore this book up many times, so it is fantastic.
- **[00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=29NS6PxfE2s&t=26s)** — Now, what is interesting about B6 is that if you look this up, they will tell you it is very rare to have a deficiency.
- **[00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=29NS6PxfE2s&t=32s)** — And they never talk about this idea of subclinical deficiencies of nutrients.
- **[00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=29NS6PxfE2s&t=37s)** — Instead they focus on these major deficiency symptoms.
- **[00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=29NS6PxfE2s&t=40s)** — But this is going to be an interesting topic. Let me just kind of go through it.
- **[00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=29NS6PxfE2s&t=43s)** — Most people might know that if you are deficient in B6, you will typically have rashes around your nose.
- **[00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=29NS6PxfE2s&t=49s)** — You might have cracks or rashes around your mouth.
- **[00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=29NS6PxfE2s&t=52s)** — You might even get pink eye as a symptom.
- **[00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=29NS6PxfE2s&t=55s)** — You can get anemia as well as neurological problems, which involves numbness in the bottom of your hands and your feet.
- **[01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=29NS6PxfE2s&t=63s)** — Which typically come from a B1 deficiency, but also from a B6 deficiency.
- **[01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=29NS6PxfE2s&t=67s)** — Some people might know that you can get depressed if you are deficient in B6.
- **[01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=29NS6PxfE2s&t=71s)** — But today I want to talk about all the other problems that you can end up with if you are low in B6.
- **[01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=29NS6PxfE2s&t=76s)** — But first let me just kind of give you some interesting information about B6.
- **[01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=29NS6PxfE2s&t=80s)** — Vitamin B6 is involved in over 140 different enzyme pathways.
- **[01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=29NS6PxfE2s&t=87s)** — So you can imagine how broadly this vitamin extends into our bodily functions.
- **[01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=29NS6PxfE2s&t=91s)** — And yes, there are toxicity symptoms. But typically B6 is a water soluble vitamin.
- **[01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=29NS6PxfE2s&t=97s)** — So you would have to consume over a thousand milligrams of B6 to have some problems.
- **[01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=29NS6PxfE2s&t=104s)** — Now typically there are no side effects if you are taking less than 200 milligrams per day.
- **[01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=29NS6PxfE2s&t=111s)** — But the side effects start going up if you get over a thousand.
- **[01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=29NS6PxfE2s&t=114s)** — And the main side effect will be neurological issues like neuropathy.
- **[01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=29NS6PxfE2s&t=119s)** — So neuropathy can come from a deficiency of B6 and too much B6.
- **[02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=29NS6PxfE2s&t=124s)** — But rarely do I know anyone taking over 200 milligrams per day.
- **[02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=29NS6PxfE2s&t=128s)** — Now the other interesting thing about B6 deficiencies is it can be used as an indicator for inflammation status.
- **[02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=29NS6PxfE2s&t=137s)** — It's highly correlated for C-reactive protein, which is an inflammatory biomarker.
- **[02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=29NS6PxfE2s&t=143s)** — And people, especially with gut inflammation, IBS, have low levels of B6.
- **[02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=29NS6PxfE2s&t=149s)** — And when people talk about B6, they are really talking about a collection of a group of different compounds
- **[02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=29NS6PxfE2s&t=157s)** — that are precursors to the active form of B6.
- **[02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=29NS6PxfE2s&t=161s)** — And the active form is P5P. I won't get into the long name. You don't need to know that.
- **[02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=29NS6PxfE2s&t=166s)** — But when you see the form P5P, that is the active form.
- **[02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=29NS6PxfE2s&t=171s)** — The other forms are like precursors that have to turn into this active form.
- **[02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=29NS6PxfE2s&t=175s)** — And the food to achieve the best bioavailability of B6 would be from beef, pork, fish, and chicken.
- **[03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=29NS6PxfE2s&t=184s)** — Dairy and eggs are not the best source. And even plant-based B6 is not the best source.
- **[03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=29NS6PxfE2s&t=191s)** — So here are the symptoms that very few people know about that are related to a B6 deficiency.
- **[03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=29NS6PxfE2s&t=196s)** — I just mentioned inflammation, so let's put that on the top of the list.
- **[03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=29NS6PxfE2s&t=199s)** — So inflammation, especially of the gut, could be related to a B6 deficiency.
- **[03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=29NS6PxfE2s&t=204s)** — Number two, B6 helps control polyunsaturated fatty acids.
- **[03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=29NS6PxfE2s&t=209s)** — Those are the ones that I always tell people to avoid, like from corn oil, soy oil, canola, cottonseed oil, things like that.
- **[03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=29NS6PxfE2s&t=217s)** — And also if you're consuming a lot of these oils and you can't metabolize it because you don't have enough B6,
- **[03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=29NS6PxfE2s&t=222s)** — this can lead to the dermatitis rashes that I mentioned when I first talked about this.
- **[03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=29NS6PxfE2s&t=228s)** — Number three, B6 is intimately involved in making neurotransmitters like serotonin, dopamine.
- **[03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=29NS6PxfE2s&t=235s)** — And you can imagine all the symptoms that can occur from having a deficiency of neurotransmitters.
- **[04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=29NS6PxfE2s&t=241s)** — So in other words, B6 is necessary to make all of these neurotransmitters.
- **[04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=29NS6PxfE2s&t=246s)** — So it can affect your mood, it can affect having addictions, it can affect your general state of just nerve communication.
- **[04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=29NS6PxfE2s&t=253s)** — Number four, B6 is involved in the conversion from something called ALA to DHA.
- **[04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=29NS6PxfE2s&t=260s)** — Now what is that?
- **[04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=29NS6PxfE2s&t=261s)** — Walnuts have a good amount of ALA, which is a precursor to the active form of the omega-3 fatty acid.
- **[04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=29NS6PxfE2s&t=268s)** — So let's say, for example, you don't consume a lot of fish or fish oils or cod liver oil,
- **[04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=29NS6PxfE2s&t=273s)** — and you're doing a lot of walnuts thinking that you're getting all the necessary precursors to make your omega-3 fatty acid.
- **[04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=29NS6PxfE2s&t=281s)** — Well, without B6, you might not be able to convert this as well.
- **[04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=29NS6PxfE2s&t=286s)** — And this could lead to more inflammation.
- **[04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=29NS6PxfE2s&t=289s)** — Alright, the next one, number five, B6 is necessary to make selenium work.
- **[04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=29NS6PxfE2s&t=294s)** — Now selenium is involved in a lot of other things, from making glutathione
- **[04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=29NS6PxfE2s&t=299s)** — to involved in converting your thyroid hormones from the inactive to the active.
- **[05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=29NS6PxfE2s&t=304s)** — So you can see indirectly that B6 deficiency could lead to all sorts of other deficiencies
- **[05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=29NS6PxfE2s&t=309s)** — related to a lack of selenium doing its work in different enzymes.
- **[05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=29NS6PxfE2s&t=314s)** — Number six, B6 is necessary to convert tryptophan into niacin.
- **[05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=29NS6PxfE2s&t=320s)** — Number seven, B6 is necessary in a lot of different things related to amino acids.
- **[05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=29NS6PxfE2s&t=326s)** — One of the things that can occur as a problem is alopecia, hair loss, because you don't have enough B6.
- **[05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=29NS6PxfE2s&t=332s)** — In another study, I found that B6 is intimately involved in an enzyme
- **[05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=29NS6PxfE2s&t=338s)** — that if you're deficient, you can have a higher risk of getting seizures.
- **[05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=29NS6PxfE2s&t=343s)** — If you know anyone who has seizures, you should make sure they're consuming more B6.
- **[05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=29NS6PxfE2s&t=350s)** — Another thing that B6 is needed for is lowering homocysteine,
- **[05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=29NS6PxfE2s&t=356s)** — which can affect your heart in a negative way.
- **[05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=29NS6PxfE2s&t=358s)** — Typically, people might know to reduce your homocysteine, you take enough B12 and folate,
- **[06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=29NS6PxfE2s&t=364s)** — but B6 is also necessary as well. Let's say someone's deficient in B6,
- **[06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=29NS6PxfE2s&t=369s)** — and they also have a problem with their gut microbiome.
- **[06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=29NS6PxfE2s&t=373s)** — They're greatly more susceptible to having autism than if they just had a B6 deficiency
- **[06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=29NS6PxfE2s&t=378s)** — and they had good microbes. In other words, there's this whole gut-brain interaction
- **[06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=29NS6PxfE2s&t=384s)** — that can influence symptoms of autism, especially if you're deficient in B6.
- **[06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=29NS6PxfE2s&t=393s)** — Does it all come from diet? Actually not.
- **[06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=29NS6PxfE2s&t=395s)** — A portion of this B6 comes from your own microbiome in the large intestine making B6,
- **[06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=29NS6PxfE2s&t=403s)** — just like it makes a lot of other B vitamins.
- **[06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=29NS6PxfE2s&t=406s)** — So this relates to one of the reasons why people are deficient in B6
- **[06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=29NS6PxfE2s&t=411s)** — when they take antibiotics, especially for things like TB, because of this lack of B6.
- **[06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=29NS6PxfE2s&t=417s)** — Anyway, I would just recommend if you know anyone with autism,
- **[07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=29NS6PxfE2s&t=420s)** — make sure they're taking the active form of B6, P5P, as well as taking a good probiotic.
- **[07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=29NS6PxfE2s&t=428s)** — And just to give you a little more information about that, B6 helps regulate or suppress gut pathogens.
- **[07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=29NS6PxfE2s&t=437s)** — So those are the symptoms, but how are people deficient?
- **[07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=29NS6PxfE2s&t=440s)** — Well, eating too many processed foods, also taking diuretics.
- **[07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=29NS6PxfE2s&t=444s)** — Certain medications like high blood pressure medication can create a deficiency.
- **[07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=29NS6PxfE2s&t=447s)** — Taking certain antibiotics, also being on birth control pills, drinking alcohol.
- **[07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=29NS6PxfE2s&t=454s)** — If you're pregnant or lactating, also smoking creates a deficiency.
- **[07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=29NS6PxfE2s&t=459s)** — Certain herbicides, as in glyphosate, in all the GMO foods.
- **[07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=29NS6PxfE2s&t=463s)** — And even taking high levels of an herb called Ginkgo biloba can create a deficiency,
- **[07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=29NS6PxfE2s&t=468s)** — but you'd have to take quite a bit of that compound.
- **[07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=29NS6PxfE2s&t=470s)** — Now because of the censoring and the suppressing of the algorithms on YouTube,
- **[07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=29NS6PxfE2s&t=475s)** — it's becoming more difficult to find my content.
- **[07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=29NS6PxfE2s&t=478s)** — And there's a lot of content that I cannot put on YouTube, unfortunately.

- **[00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cLJ2zWYttOk&t=0s)** — This is actually quite amazing. There is zero evidence that depression is a chemical imbalance in the brain involving serotonin,
- **[00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cLJ2zWYttOk&t=13s)** — despite years of selling massive amount of drugs. The amount of money that these drug companies made on this theory is astronomical.
- **[00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cLJ2zWYttOk&t=26s)** — It's only a theory and there's no evidence that increasing or decreasing serotonin in the brain does anything for depression.
- **[00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cLJ2zWYttOk&t=36s)** — It has been found that SSRIs, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, basically these are medications to block the reuptake or the absorption of serotonin so you'll have more serotonin in the brain.
- **[00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cLJ2zWYttOk&t=49s)** — They have found that when you give someone this drug it does increase at least temporarily the available serotonin in the brain.
- **[00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cLJ2zWYttOk&t=58s)** — The drug trials on SSRIs show that these antidepressants are barely indistinguishable from the actual drug and the placebo in treating depression.
- **[01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cLJ2zWYttOk&t=70s)** — But they come with a package. A lot of side effects including something called a black box warning.
- **[01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cLJ2zWYttOk&t=77s)** — In fact all psychiatric drugs have a black box warning which means they have a high risk of suicide thoughts and behaviors.
- **[01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cLJ2zWYttOk&t=86s)** — But on top of that there's some serious side effects involving the sex organs.
- **[01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cLJ2zWYttOk&t=91s)** — I'm talking about lack of orgasm, penile and genital anesthesia which is the loss of feeling of your private parts, erectile dysfunction, premature ejaculation.
- **[01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cLJ2zWYttOk&t=104s)** — So it's just bizarre to me that we have all these high risk for side effects yet we don't have any evidence on this theory that it actually will work for you.
- **[01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cLJ2zWYttOk&t=114s)** — There's even some research that shows that it's the elevation, it's the high levels of serotonin that causes depression not low levels.
- **[02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cLJ2zWYttOk&t=123s)** — And in other experiments where they actually tried to lower serotonin they did not find that a person gets depressed when you lower their serotonin.
- **[02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cLJ2zWYttOk&t=131s)** — So as far as the treatment of depression with pharmaceuticals you really need to think twice and three times and four times and evaluate all the risks and the benefits.
- **[02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cLJ2zWYttOk&t=142s)** — As well as understanding the mechanism of what happens when you're taking a drug to manipulate the neurotransmitters.
- **[02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cLJ2zWYttOk&t=151s)** — So neurotransmitters are communication particles and they go from one neuron to the next.
- **[02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cLJ2zWYttOk&t=158s)** — Very similar to hormones that work in your blood yet neurotransmitters work within the nervous system.
- **[02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cLJ2zWYttOk&t=164s)** — And there's quite a few neurotransmitters. I think there's over a hundred and they create all sorts of effects.
- **[02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cLJ2zWYttOk&t=170s)** — But when you artificially try to manipulate these neurotransmitters you kind of screw up the whole communication within the neurons itself.
- **[02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cLJ2zWYttOk&t=178s)** — And when we talk about depression does depression cause body problems?
- **[03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cLJ2zWYttOk&t=185s)** — Okay, or is it body problems causing depression? Is it the chicken or the egg?
- **[03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cLJ2zWYttOk&t=190s)** — Well I think it's both because you can have a stress event, you can have a severe loss and be depressed.
- **[03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cLJ2zWYttOk&t=195s)** — And have that depression severely affect your physical health.
- **[03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cLJ2zWYttOk&t=201s)** — But on the other hand you could have certain types of physical health problems and deficiencies that can directly cause depression.
- **[03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cLJ2zWYttOk&t=210s)** — And that is the area that I want to talk about. So there are four main things that I think cause a physical reason why a person is depressed.
- **[03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cLJ2zWYttOk&t=218s)** — The first one is insomnia. Insomnia increases the risk of getting depression by a factor of 10x.
- **[03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cLJ2zWYttOk&t=228s)** — That's a thousand percent increase. That's pretty significant.
- **[03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cLJ2zWYttOk&t=232s)** — And when someone can't sleep they usually have a problem with this neurotransmitter called acetylcholine.
- **[04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cLJ2zWYttOk&t=241s)** — Acetylcholine is the neurotransmitter that the vagus nerve operates with.
- **[04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cLJ2zWYttOk&t=247s)** — And the vagus nerve is all about countering stress as far as it being the parasympathetic nervous system opposing the sympathetic which is the flutter fight.
- **[04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cLJ2zWYttOk&t=259s)** — The parasympathetic is all about rest and digest.
- **[04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cLJ2zWYttOk&t=264s)** — And this is why if you're deficient in acetylcholine, boy you have problems with digestion.
- **[04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cLJ2zWYttOk&t=269s)** — You can't make hydrochloric acid. You can't release bile. You can't release enzymes.
- **[04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cLJ2zWYttOk&t=276s)** — Your peristalsis, the ability of your stool to go through the tubes through the digestive tract, are inhibited.
- **[04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cLJ2zWYttOk&t=284s)** — So acetylcholine is very very important in digestion but also equally important in rest.
- **[04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cLJ2zWYttOk&t=291s)** — So there are several things that can help increase acetylcholine as a neurotransmitter.
- **[04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cLJ2zWYttOk&t=298s)** — Having enough vitamin B1, very important. Having enough choline.
- **[05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cLJ2zWYttOk&t=304s)** — On my DNA test, one of the problems I had genetically is I have a difficult time absorbing choline.
- **[05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cLJ2zWYttOk&t=311s)** — So I have to take more choline. And the foods that are highest in choline are number one, egg yolks.
- **[05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cLJ2zWYttOk&t=320s)** — Okay, egg yolks are very high in choline. Beef liver, which a lot of people don't like.
- **[05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cLJ2zWYttOk&t=324s)** — So I recommend doing egg yolks and fatty fish. Another vitamin that can greatly help increase
- **[05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cLJ2zWYttOk&t=331s)** — your acetylcholine is vitamin D. I would take at least 10,000 IUs before bed.
- **[05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cLJ2zWYttOk&t=339s)** — It helps a lot of people with insomnia and you might even need to take a little bit more
- **[05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cLJ2zWYttOk&t=343s)** — because so many people are deficient in vitamin D. And also getting out and having enough sun is
- **[05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cLJ2zWYttOk&t=348s)** — also even a better choice if you have the option. But just don't let yourself get burned.
- **[05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cLJ2zWYttOk&t=353s)** — But with the sun, you not just get vitamin D, you also get
- **[05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cLJ2zWYttOk&t=358s)** — melatonin, which comes from the infrared. Over 50% of the sun's rays are infrared.
- **[06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cLJ2zWYttOk&t=366s)** — And it penetrates even through your clothes, even through a hat. So you can get the benefit
- **[06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cLJ2zWYttOk&t=371s)** — of the melatonin increase as well through the sun. But vitamin D is very, very important.
- **[06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cLJ2zWYttOk&t=376s)** — Vitamin B5 is also very important. Vitamin B5 is very easy to get from pretty much almost
- **[06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cLJ2zWYttOk&t=383s)** — all foods. So that's usually not the problem. And then another thing that can also help
- **[06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cLJ2zWYttOk&t=388s)** — increase acetylcholine is magnesium. And the type of magnesium that I would recommend
- **[06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cLJ2zWYttOk&t=395s)** — for insomnia would be magnesium trienate. That's the one that penetrates the blood-brain
- **[06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cLJ2zWYttOk&t=401s)** — barrier and can greatly help that neurotransmitter and help you sleep. How does someone end up with
- **[06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cLJ2zWYttOk&t=407s)** — more amounts of acetylcholine? One big one is high carb diets, sugar, insulin resistance.
- **[06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cLJ2zWYttOk&t=415s)** — Okay, that blocks these neurotransmitters, especially acetylcholine. All right, so number
- **[07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cLJ2zWYttOk&t=420s)** — one is insomnia. Number two is the thing that you get as a side effect from insomnia,
- **[07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cLJ2zWYttOk&t=427s)** — chronic fatigue, right? You're going to be tired if you have insomnia. So chronic fatigue
- **[07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cLJ2zWYttOk&t=432s)** — can definitely cause someone to be depressed because they don't have the energy. And it could
- **[07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cLJ2zWYttOk&t=438s)** — be a dysfunctional mitochondria, okay, the energy factory, because the person is missing
- **[07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cLJ2zWYttOk&t=442s)** — something like coenzyme Q10 or even B1. Also, a person can be chronically fatigued if they have
- **[07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cLJ2zWYttOk&t=451s)** — a virus, okay? I'm talking about one of those viruses that can go in remission and
- **[07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cLJ2zWYttOk&t=456s)** — out of remission, like the Epstein-Barr virus, which a lot of people have a problem with.
- **[07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cLJ2zWYttOk&t=460s)** — And then they can become chronically fatigued and then they can become depressed. And you just
- **[07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cLJ2zWYttOk&t=466s)** — have to find out why you're chronically fatigued. Is it your diet? Is it the lack of sleep? Is it
- **[07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cLJ2zWYttOk&t=472s)** — a viral infection? Which actually, it's very common to have a viral component because of the
- **[07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cLJ2zWYttOk&t=478s)** — next thing. Number three, stress, especially chronic stress, can reactivate a virus and cause
- **[08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cLJ2zWYttOk&t=487s)** — chronic fatigue syndrome and fibromyalgia. And so chronic stress is another huge factor
- **[08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cLJ2zWYttOk&t=493s)** — of why people can become depressed. That chronic stimulation of cortisol, which directly
- **[08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cLJ2zWYttOk&t=500s)** — will cause insomnia. A lot of people who have these viruses that are coming out in remission,
- **[08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cLJ2zWYttOk&t=507s)** — it's usually always after some stress event. So this is not a little thing, it's a big
- **[08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cLJ2zWYttOk&t=513s)** — thing. So if you are chronically stressed, find out whatever is stressing you out and
- **[08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cLJ2zWYttOk&t=518s)** — see what you can do to improve it. And number four, nutritional deficiencies can directly cause
- **[08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cLJ2zWYttOk&t=523s)** — depression. The big one is a vitamin D deficiency. Now do you see how they cross over from not
- **[08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cLJ2zWYttOk&t=530s)** — having enough sun or enough vitamin D? Or even the stress factor can deplete you of vitamin D,
- **[08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cLJ2zWYttOk&t=536s)** — but a vitamin D deficiency can directly make you depressed. I mean think about what happens
- **[09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cLJ2zWYttOk&t=540s)** — during the winter months. So many people get the blues. It's a vitamin D. Minimally 10,000 I use,
- **[09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cLJ2zWYttOk&t=546s)** — but I would usually if someone is depressed recommend like 20,000 to 30,000 I use every
- **[09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cLJ2zWYttOk&t=551s)** — single day. And if it's going to work, it's going to work within a few days and you'll
- **[09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cLJ2zWYttOk&t=556s)** — feel much better. The next deficiency that can cause direct depression would be a B12 deficiency.
- **[09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cLJ2zWYttOk&t=563s)** — This can usually come from a person being on antacids or they have inflammatory problems in
- **[09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cLJ2zWYttOk&t=569s)** — gut or they're a vegan and don't consume animal products or they had a gastric bypass
- **[09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cLJ2zWYttOk&t=576s)** — or they're getting older and they just don't have enough hydrochloric acid in their stomach.
- **[09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cLJ2zWYttOk&t=581s)** — So there's many different reasons. A vitamin B1 deficiency, which usually comes from consuming
- **[09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cLJ2zWYttOk&t=586s)** — too much sugar, coffee, tea, chocolate, mainly though too many carbs can cause depression,
- **[09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cLJ2zWYttOk&t=596s)** — but most of the time it starts off with anxiety and worry and then that can lead to depression.
- **[10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cLJ2zWYttOk&t=603s)** — So anxiety is a lot of worry and stress. Depression is kind of like I give up,
- **[10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cLJ2zWYttOk&t=610s)** — I'm hopeless or I'm sad. If someone has a magnesium deficiency, they can also be
- **[10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cLJ2zWYttOk&t=617s)** — chronically fatigued or they can be depressed because the influence of magnesium on the energy
- **[10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cLJ2zWYttOk&t=623s)** — generation of ATP, they can just have not enough energy and they're going to feel very very down
- **[10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cLJ2zWYttOk&t=629s)** — and sometimes depressed or exhausted. I mean when you think about it, can you actually be
- **[10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cLJ2zWYttOk&t=634s)** — depressed if you have a lot of energy? It's kind of hard. And the last point about depression
- **[10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cLJ2zWYttOk&t=639s)** — as far as the nutritional efficiency is the omega-3 DHA because that makes up a good portion
- **[10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cLJ2zWYttOk&t=646s)** — of your brain and if you're deficient in that because you don't consume DHA, that can
- **[10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cLJ2zWYttOk&t=653s)** — depression. So those are the four factors. I do want to add one more thing. It's exercise
- **[10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cLJ2zWYttOk&t=659s)** — and the lack of it. The more you exercise, the less depressed you're going to be. You're
- **[11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cLJ2zWYttOk&t=665s)** — going to build up your mitochondria. You're going to generate energy. It's going to help
- **[11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cLJ2zWYttOk&t=669s)** — you reduce stress. It's going to help you sleep better. So don't forget about exercise.
- **[11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cLJ2zWYttOk&t=675s)** — Now there's a bit more information on insomnia that I want you to know about from this video
- **[11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cLJ2zWYttOk&t=680s)** — right here. Check it out.

- **[00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haVr3AAYC80&t=0s)** — So today we're... oh one second, let me just... oh yeah. Oh yeah, that's the spot. A little to the left,
- **[00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haVr3AAYC80&t=10s)** — good. A little to the right, oh my gosh, these come in handy. Today we're going to talk about
- **[00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haVr3AAYC80&t=16s)** — the 15 deeper causes of itching that you probably have never heard about before.
- **[00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haVr3AAYC80&t=23s)** — So the medical name for itching is called pruritus, okay? And the remedy typically
- **[00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haVr3AAYC80&t=28s)** — is just to scratch the itch, right? And it usually involves some superficial nerve that is within
- **[00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haVr3AAYC80&t=34s)** — your skin that's being aggravated to some level. You can have lice on your body, scabies, which is
- **[00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haVr3AAYC80&t=40s)** — a microorganism. You could have hookworms, herpes, an insect bite like bed bugs. You can even have
- **[00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haVr3AAYC80&t=47s)** — a yeast infection different places in your body, usually private parts. Or you can have poison
- **[00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haVr3AAYC80&t=51s)** — ivy. Now I am deadly allergic to poison ivy and when I get it, it spreads and boy does it itch like
- **[00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haVr3AAYC80&t=59s)** — crazy and I have to resist the temptation to scratch it. I found that going into a hot shower
- **[01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haVr3AAYC80&t=64s)** — tends to be the only thing that can relieve the itching for three hours. But I can definitely
- **[01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haVr3AAYC80&t=70s)** — relate to poison ivy. Then you have a tick bite, right? Usually tick bites initially kind of
- **[01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haVr3AAYC80&t=81s)** — different tick bites that I found on my body because I live in the countryside and some even
- **[01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haVr3AAYC80&t=86s)** — had the bullseye and I never got lime. So that's good. But sometimes you have to kind of check
- **[01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haVr3AAYC80&t=91s)** — yourself because you don't know if these ticks are on your body. But sometimes they do leave
- **[01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haVr3AAYC80&t=96s)** — an itch and you can find out where they are. And you can also itch from having diabetes.
- **[01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haVr3AAYC80&t=100s)** — Now why would a diabetic start itching? Because they have problems with circulation,
- **[01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haVr3AAYC80&t=105s)** — specifically blood flow to nerve endings. So like even in the bottom of your feet, you can have
- **[01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haVr3AAYC80&t=111s)** — what's called peripheral neuropathy where the blood flow to the nerves are not happening. And
- **[01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haVr3AAYC80&t=115s)** — so the nerves start dying off. And so the sensation could be anywhere from an itching to
- **[02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haVr3AAYC80&t=121s)** — a burning pain to an actual severe pain. You can start losing circulation and the circulation
- **[02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haVr3AAYC80&t=128s)** — is necessary for the nerves to function correctly. There's another condition called
- **[02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haVr3AAYC80&t=133s)** — polycythemia where you have too many red blood cells, which can create a lack of circulation
- **[02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haVr3AAYC80&t=140s)** — in your blood flow, lowered oxygen into your actual skin itself. And that's what's causing
- **[02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haVr3AAYC80&t=145s)** — the itching. And even a problem with the parathyroid gland. The parathyroid gland is
- **[02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haVr3AAYC80&t=150s)** — four glands that are around your thyroid and they control calcium. And if the thyroid is
- **[02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haVr3AAYC80&t=158s)** — working too hard, you can start developing too much calcium in the blood and then too much
- **[02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haVr3AAYC80&t=164s)** — calcium that deposits in the skin and even create calcification of your skin. And that can
- **[02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haVr3AAYC80&t=172s)** — affect the nerve endings. So there's been an associated relationship between people that had
- **[02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haVr3AAYC80&t=178s)** — severe itching and then they have their parathyroids removed and the itching goes away.
- **[03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haVr3AAYC80&t=182s)** — And then you have a problem with the kidney called uremia where you have this build-up of urea
- **[03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haVr3AAYC80&t=189s)** — in the skin and that's creating all sorts of irritation on the nerves because someone has an
- **[03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haVr3AAYC80&t=195s)** — advanced kidney disease. Then you have the liver. And this is very common whether you
- **[03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haVr3AAYC80&t=199s)** — have cirrhosis of the liver or hepatitis. When the liver, which is supposed to make
- **[03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haVr3AAYC80&t=204s)** — bile salts, can't make the bile salts anymore, then you start developing this thickened sludge
- **[03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haVr3AAYC80&t=210s)** — that comes down these little ducts into the gallbladder called cholestasis. And you're
- **[03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haVr3AAYC80&t=215s)** — going to feel like a fullness underneath your right rib cage and maybe even pain that refers
- **[03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haVr3AAYC80&t=220s)** — to your right shoulder blade. And then you have also a condition where you have dry skin.
- **[03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haVr3AAYC80&t=225s)** — That can create itching probably because the gallbladder doesn't have enough bile to be
- **[03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haVr3AAYC80&t=229s)** — able to pull in vitamin A from the foods or you're not consuming a lot of vitamin A.
- **[03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haVr3AAYC80&t=235s)** — Or it could be also a lack of vitamin D which can increase inflammation. And so when I was in
- **[04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haVr3AAYC80&t=240s)** — practice there's a high correlation between people that have itching and people that have
- **[04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haVr3AAYC80&t=246s)** — gallbladder issues or liver issues. One would be just irritation of the gallbladder directly.
- **[04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haVr3AAYC80&t=251s)** — Number two, it can decrease your omega-3 fatty acids because omega-6 and omega-3 compete.
- **[04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haVr3AAYC80&t=258s)** — The average person has like 20 times more omega-6 to omega-3. The remedy is very simple.
- **[04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haVr3AAYC80&t=265s)** — You just need to change your diet and there's a remedy called TUTCUP. It's a type of bile salt
- **[04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haVr3AAYC80&t=272s)** — that thins the bile and it's been found to significantly decrease itching in people with
- **[04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haVr3AAYC80&t=277s)** — like cirrhosis. So I will put that research down below as well. Now what's interesting
- **[04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haVr3AAYC80&t=283s)** — about the relief of scratching and itch is that you're going to stimulate serotonin
- **[04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haVr3AAYC80&t=291s)** — and dopamine as the relief chemicals. And there's even professional back scratchers that you can go
- **[04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haVr3AAYC80&t=297s)** — get your back scratched and pay someone to do that which is pretty wild because it's very
- **[05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haVr3AAYC80&t=302s)** — relaxing. But anyway, I wanted to increase your awareness on what's behind parietis especially if
- **[05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haVr3AAYC80&t=308s)** — it's on a chronic nature and give you a lot more information so you could potentially
- **[05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haVr3AAYC80&t=312s)** — identify the real reason why you might have itching. Now since I did mention the gallbladder,
- **[05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haVr3AAYC80&t=316s)** — if you have not seen my videos on the gallbladder, I put up a really good one right here.
- **[05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haVr3AAYC80&t=322s)** — You should check it out.

- **[00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kUmXIXsMi0g&t=0s)** — Today I want to discuss the seven warning signs of a zinc deficiency that has the potential
- **[00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kUmXIXsMi0g&t=4s)** — to make your life a living hell. Now we are going to go through all of these, but I will
- **[00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kUmXIXsMi0g&t=9s)** — say number seven is the most deadly and it's the most common. The reason I am doing a
- **[00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kUmXIXsMi0g&t=15s)** — video on zinc is because zinc is the third most important nutrient. Number one being
- **[00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kUmXIXsMi0g&t=20s)** — vitamin D. Why? Because vitamin D is involved in 2500 genes. Number two is magnesium.
- **[00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kUmXIXsMi0g&t=26s)** — Why? Because it's involved in 300 different enzymes. And zinc is number three because
- **[00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kUmXIXsMi0g&t=32s)** — it's involved with over 200 different enzymes. That's a lot of biochemistry. Zinc allows
- **[00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kUmXIXsMi0g&t=36s)** — you to make glutathione, which is the most powerful antioxidant. Zinc is highly concentrated
- **[00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kUmXIXsMi0g&t=41s)** — in your prostate. It helps you make sperm and testosterone. Zinc is also in your
- **[00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kUmXIXsMi0g&t=46s)** — pancreas, the specific part that makes insulin. Zinc is even in your brain, in
- **[00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kUmXIXsMi0g&t=51s)** — your brain. It's a very specific part that is like a relay switch to your memories.
- **[00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kUmXIXsMi0g&t=56s)** — It's called a hippocampus. So when your hippocampus goes down, you get dementia.
- **[01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kUmXIXsMi0g&t=62s)** — Then you also have zinc's involvement in wound healing, decreasing gastritis, helping
- **[01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kUmXIXsMi0g&t=67s)** — you make collagen, and even helping you grow your hair. But now let's get into
- **[01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kUmXIXsMi0g&t=71s)** — the symptoms that can make your life a living hell. Night blindness is one big
- **[01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kUmXIXsMi0g&t=75s)** — indication of a zinc deficiency. And if you heard drove at night when it's dark
- **[01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kUmXIXsMi0g&t=78s)** — and you can't see, it's extremely scary and dangerous. Alright, number two,
- **[01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kUmXIXsMi0g&t=83s)** — low testosterone. In fact, you can even get something called hypogonadism,
- **[01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kUmXIXsMi0g&t=88s)** — where your testicles are shrunk. Now, if you're female, you're going to notice your
- **[01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kUmXIXsMi0g&t=92s)** — estrogen and progesterone are going to be excessively low. And if you're female,
- **[01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kUmXIXsMi0g&t=98s)** — going through menopause, you need those hormones to be a lot higher. And if they're
- **[01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kUmXIXsMi0g&t=102s)** — not, your life can be a living hell. As far as cortisol goes, what happens,
- **[01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kUmXIXsMi0g&t=107s)** — the cortisol goes down because someone's deficient in zinc, and then that sends a
- **[01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kUmXIXsMi0g&t=110s)** — signal back up to the brain, and then the brain causes the adrenal glands to
- **[01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kUmXIXsMi0g&t=115s)** — overcompensate. So then you make more cortisol because you don't have enough
- **[01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kUmXIXsMi0g&t=119s)** — zinc. So guess what? You're going to have more stress. Alright, that was
- **[02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kUmXIXsMi0g&t=123s)** — number two. Number three is diarrhea. And if you've ever had chronic
- **[02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kUmXIXsMi0g&t=127s)** — diarrhea, your life will be a living hell. A lot of children who consume
- **[02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kUmXIXsMi0g&t=131s)** — a lot of cereal and grains in poor countries develop diarrhea because of a
- **[02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kUmXIXsMi0g&t=137s)** — zinc deficiency because these grains have something called phytic acid that
- **[02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kUmXIXsMi0g&t=141s)** — blocks the absorption of zinc. Number four is acne. I had really bad acne in
- **[02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kUmXIXsMi0g&t=147s)** — high school, and that was very unfortunate because it really affected
- **[02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kUmXIXsMi0g&t=150s)** — my self-esteem. I had one interest in high school that was girls, but I
- **[02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kUmXIXsMi0g&t=157s)** — So that was a big barrier. No confidence. Your skin is highly influenced by zinc.
- **[02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kUmXIXsMi0g&t=163s)** — Number five is alopecia. You actually lose hair. If you combine acne with
- **[02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kUmXIXsMi0g&t=168s)** — hair loss, that would be a life of living hell. Zinc is so important in
- **[02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kUmXIXsMi0g&t=173s)** — helping the growth of the root of the hair, also making the hair thick,
- **[02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kUmXIXsMi0g&t=178s)** — and also to support the elasticity of the entire hair. Alright, number six
- **[03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kUmXIXsMi0g&t=182s)** — is the need for cataract surgery because a lack of zinc can cause
- **[03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kUmXIXsMi0g&t=186s)** — cataracts, which is terrible because your lens of your eye starts becoming
- **[03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kUmXIXsMi0g&t=190s)** — opaque and you just can't see. Everything is white. So personally, I
- **[03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kUmXIXsMi0g&t=195s)** — don't want cataracts, and number two, I don't want surgery on my eyes.
- **[03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kUmXIXsMi0g&t=198s)** — Alright, now comes number seven. So you might want to be sitting down for
- **[03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kUmXIXsMi0g&t=201s)** — this one because this one is extremely important. Maybe you're not ready for
- **[03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kUmXIXsMi0g&t=206s)** — this. Maybe I should cover this in the next video.
- **[03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kUmXIXsMi0g&t=209s)** — No, I'm just kidding. I'll tell you what it is. The thymus gland,
- **[03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kUmXIXsMi0g&t=212s)** — which is the master immune gland, which sits on top of the heart, shrinks.
- **[03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kUmXIXsMi0g&t=216s)** — But what's fascinating is it starts shrinking right after puberty. Check
- **[03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kUmXIXsMi0g&t=221s)** — this out. You have a very healthy thymus gland, right? You have all
- **[03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kUmXIXsMi0g&t=225s)** — that gland right there. And then at age 25, it's already down to this
- **[03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kUmXIXsMi0g&t=229s)** — level. Now the rest of this is just fat. And then look at that 50 years
- **[03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kUmXIXsMi0g&t=233s)** — old, significantly less thymus gland, thus less immune system. And then
- **[03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kUmXIXsMi0g&t=238s)** — at 70, you just have traces of this thymus gland. So you have maybe just
- **[04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kUmXIXsMi0g&t=242s)** — a little bit of residue left to be able to fight infections. The
- **[04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kUmXIXsMi0g&t=246s)** — thymus is the most important immune gland. It makes T cells. Now,
- **[04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kUmXIXsMi0g&t=251s)** — I'm sure you've probably heard of T cells, but the letter T stands
- **[04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kUmXIXsMi0g&t=255s)** — for thymus because they originate from the thymus gland. And these
- **[04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kUmXIXsMi0g&t=258s)** — T cells control and coordinate every aspect of your immune system. If you
- **[04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kUmXIXsMi0g&t=263s)** — instantly just take an antibiotic for every infection and an aspirin
- **[04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kUmXIXsMi0g&t=266s)** — to reduce the fever, you weaken the immune system. I would just let it go
- **[04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kUmXIXsMi0g&t=271s)** — through its cycle. I wouldn't try to suppress it. If it gets over 104,
- **[04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kUmXIXsMi0g&t=274s)** — okay, good, check with your doctor. But that fever really is part of
- **[04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kUmXIXsMi0g&t=277s)** — your immune defenses, and it's there to cook the viruses and
- **[04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kUmXIXsMi0g&t=281s)** — bacteria. But the T cells are not just about infection. They're also
- **[04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kUmXIXsMi0g&t=285s)** — about killing cancer and preventing autoimmune diseases. So if there's
- **[04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kUmXIXsMi0g&t=292s)** — immune cells that are not able to differentiate, in other words,
- **[04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kUmXIXsMi0g&t=294s)** — they're not able to tell the difference between your cell and a bad
- **[04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kUmXIXsMi0g&t=299s)** — guy or a pathogen, then your immune system kills them, gets rid of them
- **[05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kUmXIXsMi0g&t=302s)** — because we don't want to have a self attack. And that's what happens
- **[05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kUmXIXsMi0g&t=305s)** — in autoimmune diseases. A researcher, Professor Greg Fay, who has
- **[05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kUmXIXsMi0g&t=310s)** — some mind blowing research I'm going to share with you. His whole
- **[05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kUmXIXsMi0g&t=313s)** — thing is about anti-aging. And he basically is all of his work is
- **[05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kUmXIXsMi0g&t=317s)** — designed to help restore and regenerate this atrophy thymus
- **[05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kUmXIXsMi0g&t=323s)** — gland. So if you can actually regenerate the thymus gland, you can
- **[05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kUmXIXsMi0g&t=328s)** — literally increase lifespan because you're going to decrease the
- **[05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kUmXIXsMi0g&t=331s)** — risk of getting cancer and infections. So in his study, he
- **[05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kUmXIXsMi0g&t=336s)** — gave patients growth hormone, also metformin and DHEA to prevent
- **[05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kUmXIXsMi0g&t=341s)** — the side effect of growth hormone, which is diabetes. The growth
- **[05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kUmXIXsMi0g&t=345s)** — hormone actually stimulated the growth of the thymus and a 20%
- **[05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kUmXIXsMi0g&t=349s)** — increase in VO2 max. I mean, VO2 max is your maximum lung capacity,
- **[05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kUmXIXsMi0g&t=356s)** — your ability to use oxygen, which a high level usually relates to
- **[05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kUmXIXsMi0g&t=359s)** — an athlete. But the subjects that went through his program
- **[06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kUmXIXsMi0g&t=363s)** — didn't do a lot of extra exercise. He was one of the first
- **[06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kUmXIXsMi0g&t=366s)** — people to reverse this biological clock. So this is fascinating
- **[06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kUmXIXsMi0g&t=369s)** — information. I was really excited about it. I started to look into
- **[06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kUmXIXsMi0g&t=372s)** — the research on animal studies. And I found some additional
- **[06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kUmXIXsMi0g&t=376s)** — information I want to share with you. In this one study, a
- **[06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kUmXIXsMi0g&t=379s)** — transplanted the thymus from a younger rat into this older
- **[06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kUmXIXsMi0g&t=382s)** — rat. And there is remarkable regeneration and aging. It was
- **[06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kUmXIXsMi0g&t=387s)** — just quite mind blowing. The rat lived a lot longer with
- **[06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kUmXIXsMi0g&t=390s)** — regrowth of the organ. Okay, now I want to show you two
- **[06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kUmXIXsMi0g&t=393s)** — amazing studies involving giving zinc to mice, a full
- **[06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kUmXIXsMi0g&t=398s)** — recovery of the thymus function with regrowing of the
- **[06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kUmXIXsMi0g&t=402s)** — organ, and a partial improvement in the immune
- **[06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kUmXIXsMi0g&t=405s)** — system as measured by natural killer cells. So we're increasing
- **[06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kUmXIXsMi0g&t=410s)** — these natural killer cells that basically kill viruses, and

- **[00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_b9yXz0lsM&t=0s)** — One of my favorite drinks for the liver is a combination between apple cider vinegar and lemon.
- **[00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_b9yXz0lsM&t=5s)** — Today let's talk about the benefits of combining both of these amazing ingredients into one drink.
- **[00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_b9yXz0lsM&t=11s)** — Let's talk about apple cider vinegar in itself. Some people have this idea that it's filled with
- **[00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_b9yXz0lsM&t=16s)** — all sorts of nutrients and you have the mother that's doing all these wonderful things. Well,
- **[00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_b9yXz0lsM&t=21s)** — there's not actually a lot of nutrients in apple cider vinegar. There's a little bit.
- **[00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_b9yXz0lsM&t=25s)** — Also the mother. Yes, it might have some enzymes and some probiotics, but mainly it's sediment.
- **[00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_b9yXz0lsM&t=32s)** — So it's not some magical thing that's creating these effects. It's mainly the basic acetic acid.
- **[00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_b9yXz0lsM&t=39s)** — But this acetic acid is quite amazing. First of all, it's an acid made by certain bacteria
- **[00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_b9yXz0lsM&t=45s)** — that has a lot of cool effects on our bodies. It will address some big problems that a lot of
- **[00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_b9yXz0lsM&t=52s)** — especially insulin resistance. It helps you make insulin more sensitive. So insulin works in the
- **[00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_b9yXz0lsM&t=59s)** — body. And if you have diabetes or pre-diabetes or you just have insulin resistance,
- **[01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_b9yXz0lsM&t=64s)** — apple cider vinegar can help correct this problem. Because if insulin is made more
- **[01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_b9yXz0lsM&t=69s)** — sensitive, you're going to have better blood sugar. You're going to have better cognitive
- **[01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_b9yXz0lsM&t=73s)** — function. You're going to store less fat in the liver. You're going to have less inflammation.
- **[01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_b9yXz0lsM&t=79s)** — So apple cider vinegar can actually stop that whole process from occurring
- **[01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_b9yXz0lsM&t=83s)** — and in some aspects potentially could reverse it. Apple cider vinegar also helps this thing
- **[01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_b9yXz0lsM&t=89s)** — called oxidative stress. So all this free radical damage that can happen. Apple cider
- **[01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_b9yXz0lsM&t=94s)** — vinegar can kind of slow it down. Apple cider vinegar also helps you store glycogen in the
- **[01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_b9yXz0lsM&t=101s)** — liver. And so that's going to actually help you with exercise and your capacity to use
- **[01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_b9yXz0lsM&t=106s)** — your stored fuel in the liver as well as the muscles. And at the same time, the brain will get
- **[01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_b9yXz0lsM&t=113s)** — fuel from the liver. Also I've noticed a great lessening of the appetite when you do apple
- **[01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_b9yXz0lsM&t=119s)** — cider vinegar and better digestion, less bloating. Now I will say most of the research
- **[02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_b9yXz0lsM&t=124s)** — I'm going to put down below on apple cider vinegar backing up some of these claims are done
- **[02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_b9yXz0lsM&t=129s)** — on mice. Okay, so if you have, I don't know, a pet hamster, pet mouse, definitely put them
- **[02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_b9yXz0lsM&t=135s)** — on apple cider vinegar as well. Now as far as the type of apple cider vinegar, organic, okay.
- **[02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_b9yXz0lsM&t=142s)** — I prefer Fairchild's over Bragg's because they don't dilute it. Is it important to have the mother?
- **[02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_b9yXz0lsM&t=148s)** — Not necessarily. We're after a high quality acetic acid. And as far as commercial apple cider
- **[02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_b9yXz0lsM&t=155s)** — vinegar that's not organic, you know it could contain pesticides and stuff like that. So just
- **[02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_b9yXz0lsM&t=159s)** — make sure you get the organic type. Now let's switch gears to lemon, right? Now you could just
- **[02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_b9yXz0lsM&t=165s)** — do lemon juice or you could just juice the lemon or you could just blend the whole lemon,
- **[02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_b9yXz0lsM&t=171s)** — which takes more time. And of course, if you have a drink that blends the lemon, you'll have
- **[02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_b9yXz0lsM&t=175s)** — a lot of extra benefits, especially the phytonutrients, the essential oils that are in the
- **[03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_b9yXz0lsM&t=180s)** — outside peel. There's all sorts of flavonoids, which are just natural compounds that have a lot
- **[03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_b9yXz0lsM&t=187s)** — different effects from antioxidant effects to anti-inflammatory. So basically in a lemon,
- **[03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_b9yXz0lsM&t=193s)** — you have citric acid, which is good to prevent kidney stones. It will also help you support
- **[03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_b9yXz0lsM&t=198s)** — the mitochondria. Also you have vitamin C, unless you are taking lemon juice from a bottle
- **[03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_b9yXz0lsM&t=205s)** — that's been pasteurized. So combined, it creates a hipato protective effect, liver protecting
- **[03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_b9yXz0lsM&t=213s)** — There's been some studies, of course, on mice that have drinking alcohol that it can help to
- **[03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_b9yXz0lsM&t=219s)** — reduce the liver enzymes. So if your mice tend to be drinkers, give them some lemon right
- **[03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_b9yXz0lsM&t=226s)** — after. There's also some interesting studies on using lemon for problems with different
- **[03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_b9yXz0lsM&t=232s)** — lipids and cholesterol imbalances. And some of that research, they used garlic combined with
- **[03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_b9yXz0lsM&t=238s)** — But it was pretty credible. This was done on humans and it was a randomized double blinded
- **[04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_b9yXz0lsM&t=244s)** — placebo controlled trial. There's also a study I found where lemon can help reduce fat on your
- **[04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_b9yXz0lsM&t=250s)** — liver. For the most part, it's going to help reduce free radical damage and oxidative stress.
- **[04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_b9yXz0lsM&t=255s)** — And very simply, and this is what I like about this, it's simple. You get a glass of water,
- **[04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_b9yXz0lsM&t=259s)** — 12 ounces, sometimes 16 ounces, whatever you want to do. And you put a tablespoon of
- **[04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_b9yXz0lsM&t=263s)** — And put a tablespoon of lemon juice or squeeze the entire juice from a lemon or blend the
- **[04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_b9yXz0lsM&t=272s)** — entire lemon. I would recommend using a straw so you don't affect the teeth because it's
- **[04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_b9yXz0lsM&t=277s)** — going to be slightly acidic and over time it could affect the enamel, but not if you use
- **[04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_b9yXz0lsM&t=282s)** — a straw. But I have to emphasize sometimes when I've recommended alpacite vinegar and
- **[04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_b9yXz0lsM&t=286s)** — lemon, sometimes people just drink it straight without adding the water. So it's going to,
- **[04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_b9yXz0lsM&t=292s)** — it's a little bit too acidic. So don't do that. The only time I probably wouldn't do this drink
- **[04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_b9yXz0lsM&t=296s)** — is if you feel like you have this severe burning in your stomach, which could mean you
- **[05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_b9yXz0lsM&t=302s)** — have an ulcer, in which case you don't want to be taking alpacite vinegar in your gut.
- **[05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_b9yXz0lsM&t=307s)** — However, many people that have indigestion, heartburn, acid reflux don't have an ulcer. So
- **[05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_b9yXz0lsM&t=313s)** — this is probably just a reminder of this drink because you probably already know about it,
- **[05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_b9yXz0lsM&t=317s)** — but it's actually a very simple thing that can create some really cool benefits,
- **[05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_b9yXz0lsM&t=321s)** — as well as giving you energy. Now, if you haven't seen this video on alpacite vinegar,
- **[05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_b9yXz0lsM&t=326s)** — it's actually very interesting. I put it up right here. Check it out.

- **[00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1FPKsx2YlaY&t=0s)** — Let's talk about the difference between sauerkraut and kimchi.
- **[00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1FPKsx2YlaY&t=3s)** — These are two very popular fermented vegetables.
- **[00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1FPKsx2YlaY&t=5s)** — And today we're going to talk about which one is better.
- **[00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1FPKsx2YlaY&t=7s)** — Sauerkraut has a much more mild taste.
- **[00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1FPKsx2YlaY&t=10s)** — Kimchi is very spicy. It can be very hot.
- **[00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1FPKsx2YlaY&t=12s)** — Kimchi is made from a certain type of cabbage called napa cabbage.
- **[00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1FPKsx2YlaY&t=17s)** — Radishes, garlic, chili pepper, ginger, and salt.
- **[00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1FPKsx2YlaY&t=21s)** — Obviously right there, if you have more vegetables involved,
- **[00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1FPKsx2YlaY&t=24s)** — you're going to have more phytonutrients.
- **[00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1FPKsx2YlaY&t=26s)** — It also has more of a diversity of different microbes.
- **[00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1FPKsx2YlaY&t=30s)** — Now with sauerkraut, the dominant microbe is something called lactobacillus plantarum.
- **[00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1FPKsx2YlaY&t=36s)** — Now of course, that's also the dominant microbe in kimchi as well.
- **[00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1FPKsx2YlaY&t=39s)** — This microbe is very interesting because it can survive in very harsh environments.
- **[00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1FPKsx2YlaY&t=43s)** — It can not be affected by the acid in your stomach.
- **[00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1FPKsx2YlaY&t=47s)** — They can survive and other microbes cannot.
- **[00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1FPKsx2YlaY&t=49s)** — And therefore it can help us because it balances out more good bacteria than bad bacteria.
- **[00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1FPKsx2YlaY&t=55s)** — That helps make this mucus barrier to prevent pathogens from going in there and creating leaky gut.
- **[01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1FPKsx2YlaY&t=60s)** — It has the ability to increase serotonin.
- **[01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1FPKsx2YlaY&t=63s)** — 90% of all the serotonin in your body is made in the gut.
- **[01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1FPKsx2YlaY&t=67s)** — Serotonin is also the precursor to another hormone called melatonin.
- **[01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1FPKsx2YlaY&t=72s)** — And melatonin is a very potent antioxidant if it's inside your cell.
- **[01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1FPKsx2YlaY&t=76s)** — But it also is something that helps you sleep at night.
- **[01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1FPKsx2YlaY&t=79s)** — If we switch over to kimchi, kimchi helps cultivate a very unique microbe that's not in sauerkraut.
- **[01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1FPKsx2YlaY&t=86s)** — And what this unique microbe does is it inhibits pathogens.
- **[01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1FPKsx2YlaY&t=90s)** — Like some of the microbes that contaminate our food.
- **[01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1FPKsx2YlaY&t=93s)** — Listeria is one of them.
- **[01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1FPKsx2YlaY&t=95s)** — Kimchi's microbe greatly inhibits that pathogen.
- **[01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1FPKsx2YlaY&t=98s)** — What's really unique about this microbe as well is it inhibits not just pathogens,
- **[01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1FPKsx2YlaY&t=104s)** — but also funguses and yeast in certain molds.
- **[01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1FPKsx2YlaY&t=108s)** — And some people even take diluted drops of the liquid in kimchi and they spray it in their sonnuses.
- **[01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1FPKsx2YlaY&t=115s)** — However, if you just take raw kimchi, you know, just by consuming it orally,
- **[02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1FPKsx2YlaY&t=120s)** — it can indirectly help the sonnuses because it can travel up through the respiratory tissues.
- **[02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1FPKsx2YlaY&t=126s)** — Kimchi also survives in cold temperature.
- **[02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1FPKsx2YlaY&t=129s)** — This is why you can keep it in the fridge and everything is fine.
- **[02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1FPKsx2YlaY&t=132s)** — And the same thing with sauerkraut as well.
- **[02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1FPKsx2YlaY&t=134s)** — If we flip over to sauerkraut, sauerkraut has a little bit more of a certain microbe called L-brevis,
- **[02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1FPKsx2YlaY&t=141s)** — which has a lot of benefits to the gut and even to the immune system.
- **[02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1FPKsx2YlaY&t=145s)** — Both sauerkraut and kimchi also make something else, something called bactericin.
- **[02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1FPKsx2YlaY&t=150s)** — Bactericins are natural antibiotics.
- **[02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1FPKsx2YlaY&t=153s)** — They're not going to be a broad spectrum antibiotic like you would get if you went to the doctor,
- **[02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1FPKsx2YlaY&t=159s)** — which they just wipe out everything.
- **[02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1FPKsx2YlaY&t=161s)** — And the devastation of broad spectrum antibiotics are just destroying our guts.
- **[02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1FPKsx2YlaY&t=168s)** — And this is why if someone is resistant to antibiotics,
- **[02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1FPKsx2YlaY&t=171s)** — they develop superbugs because they took a lot of antibiotics.
- **[02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1FPKsx2YlaY&t=174s)** — Now they have microbes that are resistant to antibiotics.
- **[02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1FPKsx2YlaY&t=177s)** — Sometimes sauerkraut and kimchi can help that situation.
- **[03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1FPKsx2YlaY&t=180s)** — Also, if we take a look at something very similar between sauerkraut and kimchi,
- **[03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1FPKsx2YlaY&t=185s)** — we have cabbage.
- **[03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1FPKsx2YlaY&t=186s)** — Number one, it's a cruciferous vegetable, so it has a lot of different phytonutrients.
- **[03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1FPKsx2YlaY&t=190s)** — It's loaded with glutathione, which is good for detoxifying things in the body,
- **[03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1FPKsx2YlaY&t=196s)** — anthocyanins, which help longevity.
- **[03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1FPKsx2YlaY&t=198s)** — There's also something called vitamin U.
- **[03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1FPKsx2YlaY&t=202s)** — And it was named by a researcher in the 50s who isolated this compound from cabbage.
- **[03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1FPKsx2YlaY&t=209s)** — What does the U stand for?
- **[03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1FPKsx2YlaY&t=211s)** — It stands for ulcers.
- **[03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1FPKsx2YlaY&t=212s)** — Protecting against ulcers helps you repair the inner tissue of your digestive system,
- **[03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1FPKsx2YlaY&t=217s)** — as well as decreasing inflammation.
- **[03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1FPKsx2YlaY&t=219s)** — This is why it's so good for ulcers as well as gastritis,
- **[03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1FPKsx2YlaY&t=223s)** — because it directly affects the cells that make gastric acid.
- **[03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1FPKsx2YlaY&t=228s)** — So anytime you have an ulcer or especially gastritis,
- **[03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1FPKsx2YlaY&t=232s)** — think cabbage, as well as any inflammation in the gut, like IBS.
- **[03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1FPKsx2YlaY&t=236s)** — Now on top of that molecule, you also have another thing that cabbage has,
- **[04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1FPKsx2YlaY&t=240s)** — and that's glutamine.
- **[04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1FPKsx2YlaY&t=242s)** — Now glutamine is really good for a leaky gut.
- **[04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1FPKsx2YlaY&t=244s)** — It also helps fuel the cells in the colon.
- **[04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1FPKsx2YlaY&t=247s)** — And it just so happens that glutamine is also in red meat, bone broth, and eggs.
- **[04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1FPKsx2YlaY&t=253s)** — And so there's some serious amazing health properties in both sauerkraut and kimchi.
- **[04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1FPKsx2YlaY&t=257s)** — Now there is a few more benefits to kimchi.
- **[04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1FPKsx2YlaY&t=260s)** — Not only do you have more of a diversity of microbes,
- **[04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1FPKsx2YlaY&t=263s)** — you also have fermented garlic, which is an amazing compound.
- **[04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1FPKsx2YlaY&t=267s)** — It does all sorts of things.
- **[04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1FPKsx2YlaY&t=268s)** — It's anti-cancer, it's anti-microbial, powerful anti-inflammatory, antioxidant.
- **[04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1FPKsx2YlaY&t=273s)** — Really good for your immune system.
- **[04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1FPKsx2YlaY&t=274s)** — There's a compound in ginger, which if fermented,
- **[04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1FPKsx2YlaY&t=278s)** — converts into several other stronger anti-inflammatory molecules
- **[04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1FPKsx2YlaY&t=283s)** — that also have amazing digestive properties as well.
- **[04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1FPKsx2YlaY&t=286s)** — And one other interesting thing about ginger is that it helps nausea,
- **[04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1FPKsx2YlaY&t=289s)** — or if you're nauseous.
- **[04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1FPKsx2YlaY&t=290s)** — And also fermented ginger gives us a lot more digestive enzymes as well.
- **[04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1FPKsx2YlaY&t=294s)** — So it's good for anything related to bloating, indigestion, gas, things like that.
- **[04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1FPKsx2YlaY&t=299s)** — The compound in chili pepper is also enhanced when it's fermented.
- **[05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1FPKsx2YlaY&t=305s)** — So this is going to be really good for inflammation, pain, circulation, metabolism,
- **[05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1FPKsx2YlaY&t=311s)** — and also fat loss as well.
- **[05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1FPKsx2YlaY&t=312s)** — And if we look at sauerkraut versus kimchi with weight loss,
- **[05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1FPKsx2YlaY&t=316s)** — kimchi is a lot better for weight loss.
- **[05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1FPKsx2YlaY&t=319s)** — And now we know why because it has certain properties that help with blood sugar,
- **[05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1FPKsx2YlaY&t=323s)** — insulin resistance, and anything that does that is going to help you lose weight.
- **[05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1FPKsx2YlaY&t=327s)** — So it's probably why the Korean people are so slim.
- **[05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1FPKsx2YlaY&t=330s)** — I don't know if that's true.
- **[05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1FPKsx2YlaY&t=331s)** — But the Koreans got the idea from the Chinese long ago.
- **[05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1FPKsx2YlaY&t=334s)** — I think it was in the 17th century.
- **[05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1FPKsx2YlaY&t=336s)** — The Chinese were fermenting vegetables back then, and then the Koreans created kimchi.
- **[05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1FPKsx2YlaY&t=341s)** — As you can see, both of these products have amazing health potential.
- **[05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1FPKsx2YlaY&t=344s)** — But kimchi gives you even more benefits than sauerkraut because it's obviously
- **[05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1FPKsx2YlaY&t=348s)** — there's more vegetables in that product.
- **[05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1FPKsx2YlaY&t=350s)** — Now personally, I cannot consume kimchi because it's just too spicy.
- **[05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1FPKsx2YlaY&t=355s)** — I will consume it because I know it's good for me.
- **[05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1FPKsx2YlaY&t=358s)** — And this is why I consume more sauerkraut.
- **[06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1FPKsx2YlaY&t=360s)** — And one last benefit of kimchi compared to sauerkraut is that kimchi has even more
- **[06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1FPKsx2YlaY&t=366s)** — vitamin C than sauerkraut.
- **[06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1FPKsx2YlaY&t=368s)** — Which is interesting because just with one cup you get over 700 milligrams.
- **[06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1FPKsx2YlaY&t=373s)** — That's 10 times the RDA for vitamin C.
- **[06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1FPKsx2YlaY&t=376s)** — Well apparently kimchi has more vitamin C than even sauerkraut.
- **[06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1FPKsx2YlaY&t=379s)** — Make sure if you're going to consume either sauerkraut or kimchi is you have it raw.
- **[06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1FPKsx2YlaY&t=383s)** — Because that's where you get the benefit of the microbes.
- **[06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1FPKsx2YlaY&t=385s)** — When they pasteurize it, they heat it, they kill it, they put it in a jar
- **[06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1FPKsx2YlaY&t=389s)** — and it sits on the shelf.
- **[06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1FPKsx2YlaY&t=390s)** — You don't want to consume that because you're not going to get the benefit from the microbes.
- **[06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1FPKsx2YlaY&t=395s)** — You might get the benefit from other things like some of the phytonutrients
- **[06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1FPKsx2YlaY&t=399s)** — and the lactic acid.
- **[06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1FPKsx2YlaY&t=400s)** — But you're leaving a lot on the table because all those microbes can greatly help us.
- **[06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1FPKsx2YlaY&t=404s)** — Since these fermented products are so good for your digestive system,
- **[06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1FPKsx2YlaY&t=408s)** — you should probably check out my video on the digestive system because there's a lot
- **[06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1FPKsx2YlaY&t=412s)** — can go wrong and this relates to these two products.
- **[06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1FPKsx2YlaY&t=417s)** — So check out that video right here.

- **[00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGovSgF_h4A&t=0s)** — Today I'm going to talk about the benefits, the side effects, and the dangers of alkaline water.
- **[00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGovSgF_h4A&t=6s)** — Now naturally when you're drinking water from a spring or from a well or an artesian well,
- **[00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGovSgF_h4A&t=12s)** — it's going to be alkaline. And it's alkaline because of the minerals, calcium, magnesium,
- **[00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGovSgF_h4A&t=17s)** — which are both alkaline. But definitely people have this idea that anything acid is unhealthy
- **[00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGovSgF_h4A&t=23s)** — or will cause sickness and anything alkaline is healthy, which is absolutely not true because in
- **[00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGovSgF_h4A&t=31s)** — our bodies we have a lot of different acids. Nucleic acids, as in your DNA. You have
- **[00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGovSgF_h4A&t=36s)** — hydrochloric acid as your stomach acid. You even have lactic acid that's in your colon to help you
- **[00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGovSgF_h4A&t=42s)** — digest. You have amino acids and fatty acids. So just because something is acid doesn't make
- **[00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGovSgF_h4A&t=47s)** — it bad. Okay, we have this scale of acidity and alkalinity. And right in the center is
- **[00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGovSgF_h4A&t=53s)** — seven which is neutral. And distilled water is neutral. And as the numbers go up, okay, above
- **[01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGovSgF_h4A&t=60s)** — seven, okay, so you have seven, eight, nine, ten, eleven, twelve, all the way up to fourteen.
- **[01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGovSgF_h4A&t=65s)** — Things are becoming more alkaline. And just so you know at the very top of the list,
- **[01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGovSgF_h4A&t=69s)** — like fourteen, which is extremely alkaline, you have things like drain cleaner, bleach,
- **[01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGovSgF_h4A&t=77s)** — which is I think thirteen, and soap, which is, you know, it could be anywhere between eight and
- **[01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGovSgF_h4A&t=83s)** — ten. So those are all alkaline. Then as we go lower, we get things like lemon juice and
- **[01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGovSgF_h4A&t=89s)** — apple cider vinegar and tomatoes and of course soda. Those are all acidic. But when we talk
- **[01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGovSgF_h4A&t=96s)** — about pH in our body, most of the time we're referencing our blood pH, which normally should
- **[01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGovSgF_h4A&t=104s)** — be slightly alkaline. So if neutral was seven, your blood is 7.34 to 7.45. And I think the
- **[01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGovSgF_h4A&t=114s)** — biggest myth about pH is that it's very difficult to change your pH by taking something.
- **[02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGovSgF_h4A&t=120s)** — And I'm talking about changing the pH of your blood. So whether someone's eating more
- **[02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGovSgF_h4A&t=124s)** — alkaline food or more acidic food, that pH in your blood is probably unlikely to change.
- **[02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGovSgF_h4A&t=130s)** — Our body tends to control and regulate the pHs of the different parts of our body. So for example,
- **[02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGovSgF_h4A&t=137s)** — your saliva should be slightly alkaline. Your blood should be slightly alkaline. Your stomach
- **[02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGovSgF_h4A&t=141s)** — should be very, very, very acidic. But your small intestine that goes right after the stomach
- **[02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGovSgF_h4A&t=147s)** — should be alkaline. Yet the large bowel should be acidic. Not like the stomach,
- **[02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGovSgF_h4A&t=154s)** — but slightly acidic. Of course, we have the gallbladder in bile, which should be alkaline.
- **[02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGovSgF_h4A&t=159s)** — So we don't want to alkalize the body. Okay, that's not a smart thing to do. And primarily,
- **[02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGovSgF_h4A&t=166s)** — the reason for that is because when you take something that's alkaline, and specifically
- **[02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGovSgF_h4A&t=170s)** — I'm talking about alkaline water, you are going to alter the stomach's pH, which should be
- **[02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGovSgF_h4A&t=176s)** — between one and three, very acidic. And doing that is going to come with a package. Like you
- **[03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGovSgF_h4A&t=182s)** — may end up with heartburn, acid reflux, gas, GERD. You might have an increased risk of
- **[03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGovSgF_h4A&t=189s)** — infection. You might have hair loss. You might have arrhythmias. And I'm not talking about
- **[03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGovSgF_h4A&t=193s)** — alkaline water from the spring or artesian well or some type of water that you would get
- **[03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGovSgF_h4A&t=199s)** — naturally with the minerals. And I'm mainly talking about a water that's created maybe from
- **[03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGovSgF_h4A&t=203s)** — a machine or something that has nothing to do with minerals. So there's a machine out
- **[03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGovSgF_h4A&t=209s)** — there that you can get that alkalizes the water. And they don't add minerals to it.
- **[03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGovSgF_h4A&t=213s)** — They put electricity through the water and they alter the water and take out the acidic part,
- **[03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGovSgF_h4A&t=220s)** — leaving this water very alkaline. I remember in practice once testing someone's urine
- **[03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGovSgF_h4A&t=225s)** — after they used this machine for about two weeks. And the pH of their urine, which
- **[03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGovSgF_h4A&t=230s)** — normally should be acidic, was like nine, which is extremely alkaline for your urine. And
- **[03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGovSgF_h4A&t=238s)** — so this will really put them in a situation where they're very susceptible to having
- **[04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGovSgF_h4A&t=242s)** — infections. They can't kill off microbes that well. So there is some huge side effects
- **[04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGovSgF_h4A&t=246s)** — from drinking a lot of extremely alkaline water. But there's not going to be any side
- **[04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGovSgF_h4A&t=251s)** — effects from drinking your spring water that's alkaline or some bottled spring water that has
- **[04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGovSgF_h4A&t=256s)** — a lot of minerals in it because it's made alkaline in a natural way. So here's some
- **[04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGovSgF_h4A&t=261s)** — missing information that you need to know. The pH in your stomach should be between one and
- **[04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGovSgF_h4A&t=266s)** — three. Very, very acidic. And the purpose of that acidity is to help you break down protein,
- **[04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGovSgF_h4A&t=271s)** — is to help you absorb minerals, also absorb B12, as well as to kill off pathogens. Right? I'm
- **[04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGovSgF_h4A&t=282s)** — talking about bacteria, fungus, parasites that could be in your food. Okay, it's kind of a
- **[04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGovSgF_h4A&t=287s)** — natural barrier, your immune barrier. And so as we age, we lose this stomach acid. People
- **[04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGovSgF_h4A&t=293s)** — that are taking an acids are putting their pH in their stomach in the wrong direction,
- **[05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGovSgF_h4A&t=300s)** — because the actual cause of heartburn, GERD, an acid reflux, most of the time is this. Your
- **[05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGovSgF_h4A&t=306s)** — stomach acids are not strong enough and that valve at the top of the stomach is not closing.
- **[05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGovSgF_h4A&t=312s)** — So you're regurgitating acids. The thing to do to correct this is to take more acids,
- **[05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGovSgF_h4A&t=318s)** — not to take less acids or not to alkalize the stomach with anything that just makes it
- **[05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGovSgF_h4A&t=323s)** — worse. So if we alkalize the stomach, we start developing a condition called hypochlorhydria,
- **[05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGovSgF_h4A&t=332s)** — or like no acid in your stomach, which is called a chlorhydria. And in that situation,
- **[05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGovSgF_h4A&t=338s)** — not only are you not going to be able to digest protein, so these undigested protein
- **[05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGovSgF_h4A&t=343s)** — particles get into the small intestine, into the large intestine, and it starts to affect
- **[05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGovSgF_h4A&t=349s)** — the immune system in a negative way. You may start developing allergies. There's an interesting
- **[05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGovSgF_h4A&t=355s)** — study done on mice where they got rid of the stomach acid, fed them fish, and they
- **[06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGovSgF_h4A&t=360s)** — developed allergies to fish protein, which is interesting. So not being able to digest protein
- **[06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGovSgF_h4A&t=365s)** — can increase risk of getting allergies, can create gas, and all sorts of like things like
- **[06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGovSgF_h4A&t=371s)** — constipation. The other important thing about stomach acids is to be able to absorb iron,
- **[06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGovSgF_h4A&t=377s)** — calcium, magnesium, zinc, potassium. Without having stomach acid, you could easily be
- **[06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGovSgF_h4A&t=383s)** — deficient in these minerals, not to mention the vitamin B12. So all this can create anemia
- **[06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGovSgF_h4A&t=389s)** — and it can lead to many other issues. And of course, this acid kills off microbes. So if
- **[06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGovSgF_h4A&t=395s)** — you can't kill off microbes, you end up with microbes in your small intestine. Okay? And that
- **[06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGovSgF_h4A&t=402s)** — term is called small intestinal bacterial overgrowth, which is a pretty nasty condition. So
- **[06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGovSgF_h4A&t=409s)** — that means every time you eat, you're going to feel bloated and it usually is created because
- **[06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGovSgF_h4A&t=413s)** — your stomach acid is not strong. The side effects from people taking antacids are the same
- **[06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGovSgF_h4A&t=419s)** — as those who have not enough stomach acid. So those are some of the side effects of
- **[07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGovSgF_h4A&t=425s)** — alkaline water. Now, should we drink acidic water? Well, personally, I found that when I
- **[07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGovSgF_h4A&t=432s)** — drink acidic water, it's slightly acidic and I actually can digest better, especially if I add
- **[07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGovSgF_h4A&t=437s)** — a little teaspoon of either apple cider vinegar or maybe some lemon juice. Now, since we're on
- **[07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGovSgF_h4A&t=442s)** — the topic of pH, I want to just talk about one more thing. If you actually develop a
- **[07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGovSgF_h4A&t=447s)** — condition called alkalosis, which your pH is definitely way too alkaline. So here are the
- **[07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGovSgF_h4A&t=453s)** — side effects from having alkalosis. Number one, you are going to have low potassium.
- **[07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGovSgF_h4A&t=458s)** — You're going to have low calcium. That calcium is going to bind to protein. Now this calcium is
- **[07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGovSgF_h4A&t=465s)** — unavailable for the muscle contraction, relaxation effect. And you're going to start having these
- **[07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGovSgF_h4A&t=471s)** — weird twitches. It's called tetany. Sometimes it's underneath the eye. Sometimes it's in the
- **[07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGovSgF_h4A&t=476s)** — arm. It could be anywhere in the body. It can also affect the heart rhythm. You can start
- **[08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGovSgF_h4A&t=481s)** — developing heart arrhythmias. The muscle is greatly affected in an alkalosis state. So
- **[08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGovSgF_h4A&t=487s)** — the muscle is going to be in spasm. It's going to be crampy. It's going to be in pain. It's
- **[08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGovSgF_h4A&t=492s)** — going to be weak. But overall, you're going to have some really abnormal sensations in the body,
- **[08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGovSgF_h4A&t=497s)** — both nerve-wise and muscle-wise. And it can even get so severe that you can go into either
- **[08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGovSgF_h4A&t=503s)** — a seizure or a coma. We don't want alkalosis and we don't want to be too acidic. We want
- **[08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGovSgF_h4A&t=509s)** — to have the right pH for the right part of your body. Having the right pH, especially in
- **[08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGovSgF_h4A&t=513s)** — your stomachs, will allow certain enzymes to work. The enzyme that helps you digest protein
- **[08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGovSgF_h4A&t=520s)** — is not activated unless you have the strong acid. And the same thing with the small
- **[08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGovSgF_h4A&t=525s)** — intestine. Certain enzymes, like for example for carbohydrates, are activated when it's
- **[08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGovSgF_h4A&t=531s)** — alkaline. But like I said before, different parts of your body require different pHs.
- **[08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGovSgF_h4A&t=536s)** — You know, where I live right now, I actually have spring water. And it comes from a spring.
- **[09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGovSgF_h4A&t=541s)** — And we recently drilled for water at a different location. And they had to go, I think,
- **[09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGovSgF_h4A&t=549s)** — 130 feet below rock. They had to drill through rock, like granite, to find this water. And so
- **[09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGovSgF_h4A&t=557s)** — I asked the guy, I said, like, where does that water come from? And he said, well,
- **[09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGovSgF_h4A&t=561s)** — we don't really know. Some people say it comes from the rain and snow that melts
- **[09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGovSgF_h4A&t=567s)** — through and it seeps through the soil and it gets into the earth and it kind of forms these little
- **[09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGovSgF_h4A&t=572s)** — pools and pockets. But my thought is, how does it get through these rock formations? And so
- **[09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGovSgF_h4A&t=578s)** — what I learned about that it's still a theory and where this water comes from. So it got me
- **[09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGovSgF_h4A&t=583s)** — curious. So I did another deep dive into where our water really comes from. And I found some
- **[09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGovSgF_h4A&t=588s)** — really interesting information. They actually found the chemistry of water, which is not in the
- **[09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGovSgF_h4A&t=593s)** — form. It was basically hydrogen and oxygen embedded into a mineral. And apparently this
- **[09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGovSgF_h4A&t=599s)** — came from a volcano. So it was very, very deep. They actually calculated it to be about 400
- **[10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGovSgF_h4A&t=608s)** — miles deep into the earth. And apparently, which is even more interesting, there's enough
- **[10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGovSgF_h4A&t=612s)** — water down there, or at least pre-water that can turn into water, to literally fill up an
- **[10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGovSgF_h4A&t=618s)** — So the advantage of these minerals in water, okay, give us some additional health benefits.
- **[10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGovSgF_h4A&t=625s)** — But only if they're created in a natural way, not from a machine that alkalizes the water,
- **[10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGovSgF_h4A&t=631s)** — which omits that help from the minerals. Now, since we're on the topic of water,
- **[10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGovSgF_h4A&t=636s)** — if you have not seen my video on carbonation in water, I put that video up right here. Check it out.

- **[00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7lSQ2hnycLg&t=0s)** — I'd like to discuss the first sign of a magnesium deficiency. Did you realize that 68% of people
- **[00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7lSQ2hnycLg&t=7s)** — in the United States don't get the required amounts of magnesium from their diet? Now,
- **[00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7lSQ2hnycLg&t=13s)** — not to mention all the other foods and things and drugs and things that people are exposed
- **[00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7lSQ2hnycLg&t=17s)** — to that deplete magnesium. Magnesium is a cofactor involved in 350 different enzymes.
- **[00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7lSQ2hnycLg&t=25s)** — What's a cofactor? A cofactor is something that is required by an enzyme for that enzyme to work.
- **[00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7lSQ2hnycLg&t=33s)** — And I'm not just talking about digestive enzymes. I'm talking about enzymes that make up all your
- **[00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7lSQ2hnycLg&t=37s)** — biochemistry that do all the bodily functions. The other thing about a magnesium deficiency is
- **[00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7lSQ2hnycLg&t=43s)** — many times a potassium deficiency has very similar symptoms. So it is difficult to determine
- **[00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7lSQ2hnycLg&t=52s)** — if you have a magnesium deficiency or a potassium deficiency. But the good news is they both come
- **[00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7lSQ2hnycLg&t=59s)** — from vegetables and salads. So as long as you're eating those, you're going to be totally fine.
- **[01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7lSQ2hnycLg&t=64s)** — But before I get into the number one most common symptom, let me go through some other
- **[01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7lSQ2hnycLg&t=68s)** — symptoms. Cramping, twitching, which could also come from other things as well, like
- **[01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7lSQ2hnycLg&t=74s)** — your pH being too alkaline. Arrhythmias of the heart. The heart starts skipping because
- **[01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7lSQ2hnycLg&t=80s)** — of a lack of magnesium. Mainly because magnesium works with calcium. Magnesium helps remove too
- **[01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7lSQ2hnycLg&t=87s)** — much calcium from the cell, helping this over-contracted vasoconstricted artery,
- **[01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7lSQ2hnycLg&t=95s)** — lowering your blood pressure. Now, as far as your bone health, people think calcium to
- **[01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7lSQ2hnycLg&t=100s)** — prevent osteoporosis, but magnesium is just as important. And osteomalacia, which is a
- **[01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7lSQ2hnycLg&t=110s)** — rickets because magnesium is essential for vitamin D activation. You can't activate vitamin D without
- **[01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7lSQ2hnycLg&t=119s)** — magnesium. Insulin resistance, and I've talked about this in many other videos, has a related
- **[02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7lSQ2hnycLg&t=125s)** — magnesium deficiency usually. And this is why when you increase magnesium, you start to make
- **[02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7lSQ2hnycLg&t=130s)** — insulin more sensitive and it starts to work. And of course, insomnia. If you don't have enough,
- **[02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7lSQ2hnycLg&t=135s)** — you'll have a tendency to not be able to sleep. And also low magnesium can raise cortisol. And of
- **[02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7lSQ2hnycLg&t=140s)** — course, your mood is dependent on magnesium too. If you're deficient in magnesium, you may find
- **[02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7lSQ2hnycLg&t=145s)** — that you're a bit on the depressed side. So what is the number one symptom of a magnesium
- **[02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7lSQ2hnycLg&t=150s)** — deficiency? It is fatigue. Now, so many people have fatigue and maybe you right now are sitting
- **[02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7lSQ2hnycLg&t=156s)** — right there and you're tired, right? A lot of people are tired. It could be as simple as not
- **[02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7lSQ2hnycLg&t=160s)** — getting enough magnesium. And I do want to mention what foods to eat for magnesium because
- **[02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7lSQ2hnycLg&t=164s)** — that's ultimately the best way to get your magnesium. But let me just dive into why people
- **[02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7lSQ2hnycLg&t=170s)** — get tired because they don't have enough magnesium. Remember I mentioned that magnesium
- **[02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7lSQ2hnycLg&t=176s)** — is necessary for 350 different enzymes. Well, a lot of those enzymes are in the
- **[03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7lSQ2hnycLg&t=182s)** — mitochondria and specifically the creation of ATP. ATP is the energy currency that the body
- **[03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7lSQ2hnycLg&t=190s)** — uses to power all the different functions. And magnesium powers something else that I talked
- **[03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7lSQ2hnycLg&t=198s)** — about in other videos, the sodium potassium pumps. These are the little pumps in every single
- **[03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7lSQ2hnycLg&t=204s)** — cell that power your muscles to work and your nervous system to work. That little pump
- **[03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7lSQ2hnycLg&t=211s)** — creates the voltage because your cells are like batteries. Well, guess what? Magnesium provides
- **[03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7lSQ2hnycLg&t=215s)** — the energy to allow for that pump to pump. So this is why you might have cramps. There's just
- **[03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7lSQ2hnycLg&t=221s)** — not enough power to allow that sodium potassium pump to work in the muscles. And things start
- **[03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7lSQ2hnycLg&t=228s)** — shutting down and you cramp. This is why the electricity cannot be traveled through the pacemaker
- **[03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7lSQ2hnycLg&t=235s)** — of your heart correctly. And if that can't work, you start getting arrhythmias or palpitations
- **[04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7lSQ2hnycLg&t=240s)** — or your heart starts to skip because you don't have the energy because there's no magnesium
- **[04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7lSQ2hnycLg&t=244s)** — to power that sodium potassium pump in the nervous system. Magnesium is also needed to
- **[04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7lSQ2hnycLg&t=250s)** — make proteins, protein synthesis. Also needed to make DNA and RNA, the building blocks
- **[04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7lSQ2hnycLg&t=256s)** — of everything. Now, most people are deficient because they're just not eating
- **[04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7lSQ2hnycLg&t=260s)** — enough of the right food to prevent this problem. And the food that will give you the
- **[04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7lSQ2hnycLg&t=265s)** — most magnesium is leafy greens, vegetables, big salads. The cool thing it will also give you
- **[04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7lSQ2hnycLg&t=274s)** — at a restaurant or at home and you have this little side salad that's just like
- **[04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7lSQ2hnycLg&t=280s)** — one cup. It's just not going to be enough. You need to beef up your salads, no pun intended,
- **[04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7lSQ2hnycLg&t=286s)** — to the point where if you're doing like two meals a day, I would say, you know, have like
- **[04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7lSQ2hnycLg&t=290s)** — five cups or just get it out of the way and eat like seven cups of salad just one time a
- **[04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7lSQ2hnycLg&t=297s)** — day. Now, ideally, if you go a little bit more, it's a little bit better. But I think you
- **[05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7lSQ2hnycLg&t=301s)** — should work on a nice gradual increase in your salad. But the point is that most people don't
- **[05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7lSQ2hnycLg&t=307s)** — consume enough salad, even associates, friends, family members around myself. I see what they're
- **[05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7lSQ2hnycLg&t=313s)** — eating and they just don't have enough salad. So when I go to a social activity and they
- **[05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7lSQ2hnycLg&t=318s)** — bring out the meals, right, they have a big salad bowl and you'll put your salad on the
- **[05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7lSQ2hnycLg&t=323s)** — plate with all the other food. Now, you need an extra bowl in addition to your plate to
- **[05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7lSQ2hnycLg&t=329s)** — put that huge salad. Of course, I'm usually the only one that does that in my circles. But the
- **[05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7lSQ2hnycLg&t=335s)** — point is that I don't have any arrhythmias. I don't get any cramps. I have tons of energy
- **[05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7lSQ2hnycLg&t=340s)** — because I have enough magnesium. If you don't do that or can't do that, well, definitely
- **[05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7lSQ2hnycLg&t=344s)** — start using a supplement. I would recommend magnesium glycinate. It's a good one. But there's
- **[05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7lSQ2hnycLg&t=350s)** — three types of magnesium I would not recommend. Okay, the magnesium oxide, the magnesium
- **[05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7lSQ2hnycLg&t=357s)** — hydroxide, and the magnesium carbonate. Those might be okay maybe as a laxative, but other than
- **[06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7lSQ2hnycLg&t=365s)** — that, I wouldn't take them because they're not very absorbable. The other ways that people are
- **[06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7lSQ2hnycLg&t=368s)** — deficient are they eat too many refined foods, especially fructose, which is in table sugar.
- **[06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7lSQ2hnycLg&t=375s)** — It's in honey. It's in high fructose corn syrup. It's in a lot of other things as well. But
- **[06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7lSQ2hnycLg&t=379s)** — fructose can deplete magnesium. Alcohol. And what is alcohol made from? Sugar. The more inflammation
- **[06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7lSQ2hnycLg&t=385s)** — you have, the less magnesium you're going to have in your body. If you want to know a good biomarker
- **[06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7lSQ2hnycLg&t=390s)** — on a blood test for a magnesium deficiency, look at something called C-reactive protein. That's an
- **[06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7lSQ2hnycLg&t=397s)** — inflammatory biomarker and it usually means that you need more magnesium. Also certain
- **[06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7lSQ2hnycLg&t=403s)** — medications like especially diuretics can create a magnesium deficiency as well as antibiotics.
- **[06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7lSQ2hnycLg&t=408s)** — When you have this alteration in your microbiome, probably from a combination of
- **[06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7lSQ2hnycLg&t=414s)** — what happens is there's a certain thing that will start binding up and locking up a lot of
- **[06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7lSQ2hnycLg&t=419s)** — magnesium. And a lot of people start developing musculoskeletal issues like fibromyalgia,
- **[07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7lSQ2hnycLg&t=426s)** — painful trigger points, a lot of muscular problems because you need magnesium for that
- **[07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7lSQ2hnycLg&t=432s)** — normal relaxation phase of the contraction and relaxation cycle. Now, if you wanted a

- **[00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qt1OoCX3_0Y&t=0s)** — Let's talk about the best meal to actually clean out your arteries.
- **[00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qt1OoCX3_0Y&t=5s)** — And I'm talking about atherosclerotic plucking.
- **[00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qt1OoCX3_0Y&t=9s)** — This is some new information that I think will actually blow you away.
- **[00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qt1OoCX3_0Y&t=13s)** — And you can apply this to a lot of different body problems.
- **[00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qt1OoCX3_0Y&t=17s)** — And since heart attacks are the number one killer,
- **[00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qt1OoCX3_0Y&t=19s)** — I think you're going to be glad that you watch this.
- **[00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qt1OoCX3_0Y&t=21s)** — I was studying some research involving germ-free mice
- **[00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qt1OoCX3_0Y&t=26s)** — because they do a lot of experiments on animals that are germ-free.
- **[00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qt1OoCX3_0Y&t=30s)** — And like, what does this germ-free thing, right?
- **[00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qt1OoCX3_0Y&t=33s)** — Well, there's a way to grow an animal without any microbes living on or inside them.
- **[00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qt1OoCX3_0Y&t=40s)** — And so they're really kind of a sterile animal.
- **[00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qt1OoCX3_0Y&t=43s)** — And that way they can do various experiments and keep the microbiome out of the picture.
- **[00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qt1OoCX3_0Y&t=49s)** — Now, the question is, can an animal live germ-free?
- **[00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qt1OoCX3_0Y&t=53s)** — Well, yes, they can survive, but I think they don't survive very well.
- **[00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qt1OoCX3_0Y&t=57s)** — First of all, they require a lot more nutrient-dense foods to survive
- **[01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qt1OoCX3_0Y&t=62s)** — because they don't have the help from the microbes.
- **[01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qt1OoCX3_0Y&t=65s)** — They have stunted growth, underdeveloped hearts, lungs, and their liver is smaller.
- **[01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qt1OoCX3_0Y&t=70s)** — They even have low cardiac output, so their heart doesn't work as well.
- **[01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qt1OoCX3_0Y&t=74s)** — The lining on their intestine is thinner, and they also have a lot of GI problems.
- **[01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qt1OoCX3_0Y&t=80s)** — And their immune system doesn't develop fully, and they have a lot of inflammatory conditions.
- **[01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qt1OoCX3_0Y&t=84s)** — And there's even atrophy of their lymph nodes.
- **[01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qt1OoCX3_0Y&t=87s)** — But other than that, they do quite well.
- **[01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qt1OoCX3_0Y&t=89s)** — So, now, how does this relate to your arteries?
- **[01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qt1OoCX3_0Y&t=92s)** — Well, I started looking into the connection between germ-free mice research
- **[01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qt1OoCX3_0Y&t=99s)** — and what kind of effects that can create on your arteries.
- **[01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qt1OoCX3_0Y&t=102s)** — I wanted to see if there's any connection between this lack of microbiome or dysbiosis
- **[01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qt1OoCX3_0Y&t=108s)** — and your arteries. And I found all sorts of amazing, amazing data.
- **[01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qt1OoCX3_0Y&t=113s)** — When you start to destroy the microbes in the gut, actually in mice studies,
- **[01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qt1OoCX3_0Y&t=116s)** — or basically have a germ-free mouse,
- **[01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qt1OoCX3_0Y&t=119s)** — they develop a lot of inflammation throughout the entire body, including the arteries,
- **[02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qt1OoCX3_0Y&t=122s)** — which is the kind of the trigger of this whole cascade of effects
- **[02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qt1OoCX3_0Y&t=127s)** — that happens in the arteries with plucking.
- **[02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qt1OoCX3_0Y&t=129s)** — And some people still have this concept that our blood is sterile.
- **[02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qt1OoCX3_0Y&t=133s)** — Okay, we have no microbes in our blood. It's completely sterile. It's not.
- **[02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qt1OoCX3_0Y&t=137s)** — There are microorganisms living in your blood.
- **[02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qt1OoCX3_0Y&t=140s)** — In fact, there are pathogens living inside your plaque in the arteries.
- **[02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qt1OoCX3_0Y&t=146s)** — Yes, pathogens. I'm talking about Chlamydia, H. pylori, Staphylococcus.
- **[02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qt1OoCX3_0Y&t=152s)** — Those pathogenic microbes are living inside that plaque.
- **[02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qt1OoCX3_0Y&t=155s)** — And you have a lot of other microbes inside the arteries, too.
- **[02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qt1OoCX3_0Y&t=158s)** — I mean, think about how many microbes we have in our guts living on our skin.
- **[02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qt1OoCX3_0Y&t=162s)** — Why wouldn't we have them throughout our organs? Well, we do.
- **[02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qt1OoCX3_0Y&t=166s)** — And so apparently, if there's an imbalance in the microorganisms in our body,
- **[02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qt1OoCX3_0Y&t=171s)** — it can lead to all sorts of problems in our arteries.
- **[02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qt1OoCX3_0Y&t=173s)** — Now, the other piece of this puzzle that I want to bring up now is
- **[02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qt1OoCX3_0Y&t=176s)** — there's this one very specific important nutrient.
- **[03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qt1OoCX3_0Y&t=180s)** — Okay, it's a vitamin that has this responsibility
- **[03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qt1OoCX3_0Y&t=184s)** — of keeping the calcium build up out of the arteries.
- **[03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qt1OoCX3_0Y&t=188s)** — Because when you have plucking, you have inflammation,
- **[03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qt1OoCX3_0Y&t=191s)** — you have calcium and you have cholesterol plaques, right?
- **[03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qt1OoCX3_0Y&t=193s)** — Well, this vitamin, which you may already know, is called vitamin K2.
- **[03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qt1OoCX3_0Y&t=197s)** — And its job is to keep the calcium out of the arteries.
- **[03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qt1OoCX3_0Y&t=201s)** — Okay, it directs the calcium back into the bone.
- **[03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qt1OoCX3_0Y&t=204s)** — And if you're deficient in vitamin K2,
- **[03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qt1OoCX3_0Y&t=206s)** — you could actually build up this calcium in the arteries.
- **[03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qt1OoCX3_0Y&t=209s)** — Now, the reason I'm bringing up K2 is because guess what makes vitamin K2?
- **[03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qt1OoCX3_0Y&t=214s)** — Microbes. Your own gut makes vitamin K2.
- **[03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qt1OoCX3_0Y&t=219s)** — It has the ability to convert the vitamin K1
- **[03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qt1OoCX3_0Y&t=221s)** — from leafy greens to vitamin K2.
- **[03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qt1OoCX3_0Y&t=224s)** — Vitamin K2 is in fermented foods because the microbes,
- **[03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qt1OoCX3_0Y&t=228s)** — the bacteria in those fermented foods can make vitamin K2.
- **[03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qt1OoCX3_0Y&t=233s)** — Especially fatty fermented foods like fatty cheese,
- **[03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qt1OoCX3_0Y&t=237s)** — okay, which is a fermented product.
- **[04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qt1OoCX3_0Y&t=240s)** — The fattier the cheese, the more vitamin K2 you're going to get.
- **[04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qt1OoCX3_0Y&t=243s)** — And other fatty things too, like fatty meats.
- **[04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qt1OoCX3_0Y&t=246s)** — You can get it from salmon, salami, which is a fermented product.
- **[04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qt1OoCX3_0Y&t=250s)** — Certain sausages, especially fatty pork sausage,
- **[04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qt1OoCX3_0Y&t=254s)** — has vitamin K2.
- **[04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qt1OoCX3_0Y&t=256s)** — Up to five times other types of sausage.
- **[04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qt1OoCX3_0Y&t=260s)** — Even certain hot dogs and even bacon can have K2 in it.
- **[04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qt1OoCX3_0Y&t=264s)** — Now, of course, you also have sauerkraut
- **[04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qt1OoCX3_0Y&t=266s)** — is loaded with vitamin K2 and yogurt.
- **[04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qt1OoCX3_0Y&t=269s)** — This is interesting because what does the mainstream medicine tell you to do
- **[04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qt1OoCX3_0Y&t=274s)** — to prevent this plucking?
- **[04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qt1OoCX3_0Y&t=276s)** — Avoid saturated fats.
- **[04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qt1OoCX3_0Y&t=278s)** — Avoid all these cholesterol foods that have apparently K2,
- **[04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qt1OoCX3_0Y&t=283s)** — which is like the antidote to this calcium buildup.
- **[04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qt1OoCX3_0Y&t=286s)** — And there's a great test that you can do. It's called a CAC test.
- **[04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qt1OoCX3_0Y&t=289s)** — It stands for coronary artery calcification test.
- **[04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qt1OoCX3_0Y&t=294s)** — And it is one of the best predictors of heart failure.
- **[04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qt1OoCX3_0Y&t=298s)** — Okay, it's the amount of calcium in your arteries.
- **[05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qt1OoCX3_0Y&t=300s)** — It's a relatively inexpensive test.
- **[05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qt1OoCX3_0Y&t=302s)** — You can go get it done and it'll actually give you a good idea
- **[05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qt1OoCX3_0Y&t=305s)** — of where you are on the stage of this problem.
- **[05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qt1OoCX3_0Y&t=309s)** — If you were going to take vitamin K2 as a supplement,
- **[05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qt1OoCX3_0Y&t=312s)** — it works better with vitamin D3.
- **[05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qt1OoCX3_0Y&t=314s)** — Okay, you want to take those together.
- **[05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qt1OoCX3_0Y&t=316s)** — And the ratio would be this.
- **[05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qt1OoCX3_0Y&t=318s)** — Every 100 micrograms of K2, you want 10,000 IUs of vitamin D3.
- **[05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qt1OoCX3_0Y&t=324s)** — But this is what you need to know.
- **[05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qt1OoCX3_0Y&t=326s)** — Probiotics are atheroprotective.
- **[05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qt1OoCX3_0Y&t=329s)** — They protect you against this hearting of the arteries
- **[05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qt1OoCX3_0Y&t=333s)** — and this calcium buildup and this plaque information.
- **[05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qt1OoCX3_0Y&t=336s)** — Your friendly microbes are your natural probiotics.
- **[05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qt1OoCX3_0Y&t=340s)** — The microbes in your gut actually can eat fiber
- **[05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qt1OoCX3_0Y&t=342s)** — from your vegetables and make certain things as a byproduct.
- **[05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qt1OoCX3_0Y&t=347s)** — And one of the things they make is small chain fatty acids,
- **[05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qt1OoCX3_0Y&t=350s)** — which basically is a type of fat that helps lower insulin
- **[05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qt1OoCX3_0Y&t=354s)** — and helps regulate your blood sugars,
- **[05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qt1OoCX3_0Y&t=356s)** — which can also help decrease the inflammation in the arteries.
- **[06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qt1OoCX3_0Y&t=360s)** — Now, the whole point of this video is to take a look at your diet
- **[06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qt1OoCX3_0Y&t=365s)** — from the viewpoint of, are you living on germ-free sterile foods?
- **[06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qt1OoCX3_0Y&t=372s)** — Okay, I'm talking about pasteurized foods.
- **[06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qt1OoCX3_0Y&t=375s)** — You have pasteurized milk, you have pasteurized juice.
- **[06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qt1OoCX3_0Y&t=378s)** — Everything is cooked for shelf life.
- **[06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qt1OoCX3_0Y&t=380s)** — We eat foods from boxes, right, on the shelf.
- **[06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qt1OoCX3_0Y&t=384s)** — Canned foods, radiated foods.
- **[06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qt1OoCX3_0Y&t=386s)** — That's right, they use radiation to kill off microbes
- **[06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qt1OoCX3_0Y&t=389s)** — so they will last longer on the shelf.
- **[06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qt1OoCX3_0Y&t=391s)** — I mean, just go to the grocery store and just look on the shelves.
- **[06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qt1OoCX3_0Y&t=394s)** — You will find so many sterilized foods.
- **[06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qt1OoCX3_0Y&t=398s)** — It's insane.
- **[06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qt1OoCX3_0Y&t=399s)** — And also we cook our foods.
- **[06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qt1OoCX3_0Y&t=400s)** — We cook the heck out of our foods
- **[06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qt1OoCX3_0Y&t=402s)** — and we basically kill off all the microbes.
- **[06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qt1OoCX3_0Y&t=404s)** — We don't eat a lot of raw foods anymore.
- **[06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qt1OoCX3_0Y&t=406s)** — And on top of that, we're eating animals that had antibiotics.
- **[06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qt1OoCX3_0Y&t=411s)** — You have to realize that one of the big side effects
- **[06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qt1OoCX3_0Y&t=413s)** — from antibiotics is that now you have this dysbiosis.
- **[06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qt1OoCX3_0Y&t=417s)** — When you kill off microbes, you kill off the good microbes
- **[07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qt1OoCX3_0Y&t=421s)** — with the bad microbes.
- **[07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qt1OoCX3_0Y&t=423s)** — And the microbes that survive become now resistant.
- **[07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qt1OoCX3_0Y&t=427s)** — And now you have all sorts of additional side effects,
- **[07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qt1OoCX3_0Y&t=429s)** — one being inflammation.
- **[07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qt1OoCX3_0Y&t=430s)** — And if you're eating animals that have antibiotics,
- **[07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qt1OoCX3_0Y&t=433s)** — could that have an effect on your body?
- **[07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qt1OoCX3_0Y&t=434s)** — I think to some degree, it can.
- **[07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qt1OoCX3_0Y&t=436s)** — When you eat raw foods, and I'm talking about like plants,
- **[07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qt1OoCX3_0Y&t=440s)** — like microgreens that have been grown on soil
- **[07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qt1OoCX3_0Y&t=442s)** — or really healthy plants from your garden,
- **[07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qt1OoCX3_0Y&t=446s)** — there are a lot of microbes in those raw plants
- **[07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qt1OoCX3_0Y&t=449s)** — that you're getting as well.
- **[07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qt1OoCX3_0Y&t=451s)** — And they can be considered almost like a probiotic as well.
- **[07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qt1OoCX3_0Y&t=454s)** — And if someone really understands that concept,
- **[07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qt1OoCX3_0Y&t=456s)** — they're gonna start eating more fermented foods, right?
- **[07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qt1OoCX3_0Y&t=459s)** — And there are a lot of different fermented foods.
- **[07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qt1OoCX3_0Y&t=462s)** — Fermented vegetables is a great source
- **[07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qt1OoCX3_0Y&t=464s)** — of these friendly microbes,
- **[07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qt1OoCX3_0Y&t=466s)** — because not only are you getting more microbes
- **[07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qt1OoCX3_0Y&t=469s)** — as an inoculation to your existing microbiome,
- **[07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qt1OoCX3_0Y&t=473s)** — but you're getting kind of this pre-digested food
- **[07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qt1OoCX3_0Y&t=476s)** — that's easier to digest.
- **[07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qt1OoCX3_0Y&t=478s)** — And the worse off your digestive system is,
- **[08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qt1OoCX3_0Y&t=480s)** — the more you should have those types of foods.
- **[08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qt1OoCX3_0Y&t=482s)** — So let's circle back and take a look
- **[08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qt1OoCX3_0Y&t=485s)** — at what would be a really good meal
- **[08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qt1OoCX3_0Y&t=486s)** — that would help with your arteries, okay?
- **[08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qt1OoCX3_0Y&t=489s)** — And also this meal that I'm gonna talk about
- **[08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qt1OoCX3_0Y&t=491s)** — is pretty counterintuitive if you match it up
- **[08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qt1OoCX3_0Y&t=495s)** — against mainstream medicine for this problem.
- **[08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qt1OoCX3_0Y&t=498s)** — Because we're gonna pack this meal with the fattiest cheese,
- **[08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qt1OoCX3_0Y&t=500s)** — talking about brie cheese,
- **[08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qt1OoCX3_0Y&t=503s)** — combined with fatty pork sausage,
- **[08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qt1OoCX3_0Y&t=506s)** — and of course, sauerkraut,
- **[08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qt1OoCX3_0Y&t=507s)** — which I'm sure that's acceptable
- **[08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qt1OoCX3_0Y&t=509s)** — by the mainstream medicine.
- **[08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qt1OoCX3_0Y&t=511s)** — These other two ingredients probably are not,
- **[08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qt1OoCX3_0Y&t=513s)** — but just think about what you're getting
- **[08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qt1OoCX3_0Y&t=515s)** — when you have these three things together.
- **[08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qt1OoCX3_0Y&t=517s)** — First of all, each one of them
- **[08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qt1OoCX3_0Y&t=519s)** — is loaded with vitamin K2.
- **[08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qt1OoCX3_0Y&t=520s)** — Secondly, you're getting something else.
- **[08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qt1OoCX3_0Y&t=523s)** — All three of these are fermented,
- **[08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qt1OoCX3_0Y&t=525s)** — which means bacteria has acted on these foods
- **[08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qt1OoCX3_0Y&t=529s)** — to enhance the availability of nutrients.
- **[08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qt1OoCX3_0Y&t=533s)** — The digestibility of these products
- **[08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qt1OoCX3_0Y&t=535s)** — are much better because they're fermented,
- **[08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qt1OoCX3_0Y&t=536s)** — and each one of them are not sterile.
- **[08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qt1OoCX3_0Y&t=538s)** — They have microbes that you can use in your own body.
- **[09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qt1OoCX3_0Y&t=542s)** — So the next time you're at the grocery store,
- **[09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qt1OoCX3_0Y&t=543s)** — start looking at the foods from the viewpoint of
- **[09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qt1OoCX3_0Y&t=546s)** — how many foods are actually sterile,
- **[09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qt1OoCX3_0Y&t=549s)** — pasteurized, over-processed,
- **[09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qt1OoCX3_0Y&t=550s)** — and make a shift to start buying foods
- **[09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qt1OoCX3_0Y&t=552s)** — that are more alive, more fermented,
- **[09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qt1OoCX3_0Y&t=555s)** — more enhanced with this fermentation process.
- **[09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qt1OoCX3_0Y&t=557s)** — So since we're on the topic of plucking,
- **[09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qt1OoCX3_0Y&t=559s)** — there's more to learn about this.
- **[09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qt1OoCX3_0Y&t=561s)** — And I put this video up right here.
- **[09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qt1OoCX3_0Y&t=564s)** — Check it out.

- **[00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3mVUO1LiqE8&t=0s)** — Today we are going to talk about the relationship between heavy metal toxicity and changes in your skin.
- **[00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3mVUO1LiqE8&t=7s)** — And I want to focus on four main heavy metals. And really it's the dose that determines the poison.
- **[00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3mVUO1LiqE8&t=15s)** — We are all exposed to various toxins and definitely heavy metals in certain amounts.
- **[00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3mVUO1LiqE8&t=19s)** — And if they are low enough, they won't affect our bodies. In fact, there is some really
- **[00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3mVUO1LiqE8&t=24s)** — interesting information that you might find quite shocking.
- **[00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3mVUO1LiqE8&t=29s)** — Certain experiments with animals have indicated that even a deficiency of some of these heavy metals
- **[00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3mVUO1LiqE8&t=35s)** — can create problems in growth and reproduction. So apparently some of these heavy metals act as
- **[00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3mVUO1LiqE8&t=43s)** — essential trace minerals. Interesting. But let's just start with this thing called arsenic.
- **[00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3mVUO1LiqE8&t=48s)** — Now you're normally going to find arsenic in pressurized wood, maybe in the water supply,
- **[00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3mVUO1LiqE8&t=55s)** — maybe in an insecticide that ends up on your food. But too much arsenic can create either a
- **[01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3mVUO1LiqE8&t=61s)** — hyper or hypo pigmentation. That means that your skin can start to look a little bit darker
- **[01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3mVUO1LiqE8&t=67s)** — or lighter. I'm talking about little dark spots or little white spots. And primarily you
- **[01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3mVUO1LiqE8&t=74s)** — might see this on your torso, the mid part of your body. You may also notice a hard surface
- **[01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3mVUO1LiqE8&t=80s)** — on the palms of your hand and the soles of your feet. This is called keratosis. And this is
- **[01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3mVUO1LiqE8&t=86s)** — another indication that potentially it could be arsenic. Now just because you have these
- **[01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3mVUO1LiqE8&t=91s)** — symptoms does not mean you have this problem. You have to look at the whole picture.
- **[01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3mVUO1LiqE8&t=95s)** — But I think it's important to understand the connection so maybe you can evaluate it deeper
- **[01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3mVUO1LiqE8&t=99s)** — and see if there is a problem or not. The thing about arsenic is it depletes glutathione. And so
- **[01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3mVUO1LiqE8&t=105s)** — there are certain things that you can take or make sure you have in your body in sufficient
- **[01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3mVUO1LiqE8&t=112s)** — amounts to protect you against arsenic. And that would be selenium. One Brazil nut will
- **[01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3mVUO1LiqE8&t=118s)** — give you a good amount of selenium. Selenium is also naturally in seafood. But selenium is one.
- **[02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3mVUO1LiqE8&t=125s)** — Zinc is number two. Folate, which is one of the B vitamins. And carotenoids, which is an
- **[02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3mVUO1LiqE8&t=131s)** — antioxidant in a lot of vegetables. One remedy for arsenic is spirulina. That can be protective
- **[02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3mVUO1LiqE8&t=138s)** — against arsenic. Now the next one I want to talk about is cadmium. Cadmium is in spray paints,
- **[02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3mVUO1LiqE8&t=145s)** — tobacco if you smoke cigarettes. And it's also in shellfish. If someone is exposed to
- **[02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3mVUO1LiqE8&t=151s)** — much cadmium, they're going to notice a yellowing of the skin. And this is not jaundice. And
- **[02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3mVUO1LiqE8&t=157s)** — sometimes a tanning of your skin when you actually have no reason to be tanned. You're also
- **[02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3mVUO1LiqE8&t=164s)** — susceptible to getting skin cancer if you have too much cadmium. There's some protection
- **[02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3mVUO1LiqE8&t=169s)** — against cadmium. And that is making sure you have enough zinc in your body. Zinc is going
- **[02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3mVUO1LiqE8&t=174s)** — to be a common thread with all four of these heavy metals. And the best source of zinc would
- **[03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3mVUO1LiqE8&t=180s)** — be red meat, shellfish, beef liver. But any of the antioxidants will help. And that's in a lot
- **[03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3mVUO1LiqE8&t=187s)** — of raw vegetables and sprouts and microgreens. But also a remedy called NAC, which is a very
- **[03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3mVUO1LiqE8&t=195s)** — powerful antioxidant. It's like a precursor to glutathione. Let's go to lead. Lead is in
- **[03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3mVUO1LiqE8&t=200s)** — paint or it used to be in paint. It can be in our water supply. It can be in our soils.
- **[03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3mVUO1LiqE8&t=206s)** — But the distinct indication that you might have lead poisoning is a blue line on your gums,
- **[03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3mVUO1LiqE8&t=214s)** — okay, in your mouth. It's called a lead line. Some of the things that can protect you against
- **[03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3mVUO1LiqE8&t=219s)** — lead is having enough calcium in the body, having enough iron in the body, a remedy called
- **[03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3mVUO1LiqE8&t=225s)** — calcium EDTA, which is like a chelator that can help pull these heavy metals out, and
- **[03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3mVUO1LiqE8&t=237s)** — it's also in fish and thymirisal, which is in certain vaccines. Now the next heavy metal would
- **[04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3mVUO1LiqE8&t=243s)** — be mercury. But mercury poisoning can create a graying of the skin and a very interesting
- **[04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3mVUO1LiqE8&t=249s)** — pink color on your palms of your hands and the soles of your feet. The seafood or fish
- **[04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3mVUO1LiqE8&t=255s)** — lowest mercury include anchovies, catfish, clam, crab, crawfish, flounder, herring, oyster,
- **[04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3mVUO1LiqE8&t=264s)** — sardines, scallops. Also make sure that you have at least one Brazil nut every single day.
- **[04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3mVUO1LiqE8&t=270s)** — That will give you enough selenium to counter mercury toxicity. So these are just very
- **[04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3mVUO1LiqE8&t=276s)** — distinct symptoms relating to heavy metal toxicity. Now there's a lot of other symptoms
- **[04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3mVUO1LiqE8&t=280s)** — but I think it's just good to be aware of these four toxic metals. One thing that's really good
- **[04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3mVUO1LiqE8&t=288s)** — for any type of toxicity, especially heavy metal toxicity, is to start drinking distilled
- **[04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3mVUO1LiqE8&t=295s)** — water. And then adding in the minerals that you want. But distilled water acts like a
- **[04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3mVUO1LiqE8&t=299s)** — vacuum and it can help pull out these heavy metals. But remember the poison is in the dose
- **[05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3mVUO1LiqE8&t=305s)** — so just because you're exposed to a little bit doesn't mean anything.
- **[05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3mVUO1LiqE8&t=309s)** — Now if you have not seen my video on distilled water it's pretty interesting. I put it up
- **[05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3mVUO1LiqE8&t=313s)** — right here. Check it out.

- **[00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MUGEckqWsQ&t=0s)** — The big mistake most people are making regarding magnesium. Your blood levels show normal magnesium levels.
- **[00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MUGEckqWsQ&t=7s)** — What a lot of people don't know is only 1% of all your magnesium in your body is inside your blood.
- **[00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MUGEckqWsQ&t=12s)** — 99% is deep in your cells. When your body is deficient in magnesium, it will rob magnesium from your bone, your muscle, and put it in the blood.
- **[00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MUGEckqWsQ&t=20s)** — Giving you the illusion that you have enough magnesium if you are just relying on the blood test.
- **[00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MUGEckqWsQ&t=25s)** — There are more sophisticated advanced ways to determine if you are magnesium deficient. But I am going to give you this simple way to figure it out.
- **[00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MUGEckqWsQ&t=31s)** — If you have any muscle spasms in your body. Muscle twitch underneath the eyelid. Anxiety, poor sleep, sugar cravings, and definitely charlie horses.
- **[00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MUGEckqWsQ&t=40s)** — Are all clues that you are deficient in magnesium. Typically with the diet you need about 400mg of magnesium every single day.
- **[00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MUGEckqWsQ&t=46s)** — Almonds are high in magnesium, but you would have to consume 5 cups of almonds to get that 400mg.
- **[00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MUGEckqWsQ&t=52s)** — Or you can get your magnesium from spinach, but you would have to consume 5 big handfuls of spinach just to get 400mg.
- **[01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MUGEckqWsQ&t=61s)** — What about chocolate? Isn't that high in magnesium? It is sort of high, but you would still need about 4 bars of chocolate to get your daily amount of magnesium.
- **[01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MUGEckqWsQ&t=68s)** — On top of that, there are many things that don't allow us to absorb even the magnesium from the food that you eat.
- **[01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MUGEckqWsQ&t=74s)** — For example, if you have inflammation in the gut, that is going to greatly reduce your absorption rates by up to 60-70%.
- **[01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MUGEckqWsQ&t=81s)** — Grains in your diet, refined foods like refined sugar, starches, that is depleting your magnesium.
- **[01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MUGEckqWsQ&t=87s)** — And then other things will deplete your magnesium like alcohol, caffeine, and also many medications.
- **[01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MUGEckqWsQ&t=92s)** — And of course the top selling magnesium products are not the best ones to take because not only do they create diarrhea,
- **[01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MUGEckqWsQ&t=99s)** — because they are laxative, but you really don't absorb much. Like with magnesium oxide, you only absorb 3-4%.
- **[01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MUGEckqWsQ&t=104s)** — The one I would recommend is magnesium glycinate because that is the one that you absorb 80% and it doesn't create a laxative effect.
- **[01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MUGEckqWsQ&t=112s)** — And the glycinate part of it will help you sleep. Magnesium is one of the master controllers over calcium.
- **[02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MUGEckqWsQ&t=120s)** — You see calcium has other purposes other than just making your bones strong.
- **[02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MUGEckqWsQ&t=124s)** — Calcium is also used in the body as the main communication signal between cells.
- **[02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MUGEckqWsQ&t=130s)** — And far too often we accumulate too much calcium inside the cell.
- **[02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MUGEckqWsQ&t=134s)** — And if there is too much calcium in the cell, those calcium crystals start damaging certain parts of the cell.
- **[02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MUGEckqWsQ&t=140s)** — Literally we calcify as we get older. And you may have heard of the vitamin K2 being the antidote for that.
- **[02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MUGEckqWsQ&t=149s)** — Because vitamin K2 helps to keep the calcium from accumulating in the arteries.
- **[02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MUGEckqWsQ&t=153s)** — But magnesium is even more important in helping to regulate excess amounts of calcium.
- **[02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MUGEckqWsQ&t=158s)** — Another thing that magnesium is really good at is preventing kidney stones.
- **[02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MUGEckqWsQ&t=162s)** — It has 100 times more binding force to the oxalates than calcium.
- **[02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MUGEckqWsQ&t=168s)** — And then let's talk about muscle. It's the calcium that causes muscle to contract and magnesium to relax.
- **[02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MUGEckqWsQ&t=175s)** — So anytime you have a tight muscle, that means you have way too much calcium.
- **[03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MUGEckqWsQ&t=180s)** — But really it's low magnesium. It's preventing heart attacks but also preventing any type of problem with the rhythm of the heart.
- **[03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MUGEckqWsQ&t=188s)** — You can correct atrial fibrillation by taking enough magnesium over a period of time.
- **[03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MUGEckqWsQ&t=192s)** — But sometimes it might take months before you really correct that deficiency.
- **[03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MUGEckqWsQ&t=196s)** — You can't correct a very severe deficiency of magnesium by just taking the maintenance dose.
- **[03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MUGEckqWsQ&t=203s)** — Sometimes you have to increase it to 1000 to 1500 or more milligrams every single day.
- **[03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MUGEckqWsQ&t=211s)** — Over a period of months.
- **[03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MUGEckqWsQ&t=213s)** — And this also includes dealing with things like migraine headaches, pain problems like fibromyalgia or pain syndromes.
- **[03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MUGEckqWsQ&t=220s)** — They require a lot more magnesium. And also mood disorders, people that are depressed or even have diabetes.
- **[03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MUGEckqWsQ&t=225s)** — Magnesium greatly helps blood sugar. Probably because of the demand that a high blood sugar situation creates on magnesium.
- **[03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MUGEckqWsQ&t=233s)** — It depletes magnesium. So the requirement of magnesium is much higher for a diabetic.
- **[03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MUGEckqWsQ&t=238s)** — Now let's get to the three secrets. Number one is we used to get a lot of our magnesium from hard water.
- **[04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MUGEckqWsQ&t=246s)** — Whether it's from a spring, a well. And then we decided to filter the water like in city water.
- **[04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MUGEckqWsQ&t=252s)** — Or send the water through a water softener which actually removes the calcium and magnesium and replaces it with sodium and potassium.
- **[04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MUGEckqWsQ&t=259s)** — To make the water less corrosive on the piping and less harsh in washing your clothes.
- **[04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MUGEckqWsQ&t=265s)** — People don't consume hard water anymore. In areas in the country where they don't soften the water, they have much less risk of getting heart attacks.
- **[04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MUGEckqWsQ&t=273s)** — And then if you compare that with areas that do use a lot of water softeners, their risk of heart attacks go up.
- **[04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MUGEckqWsQ&t=278s)** — Okay, secret number two. Vitamin D won't work without magnesium. If you're increasing your magnesium, also increase your vitamin D.
- **[04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MUGEckqWsQ&t=286s)** — And that way they will both work. And just as one side note, vitamin B1, which is really important in reducing stress.
- **[04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MUGEckqWsQ&t=293s)** — And gets depleted when you consume a lot of carbohydrates. That also is dependent on magnesium.
- **[04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MUGEckqWsQ&t=299s)** — So when you take more B1, you need magnesium to allow that to work.
- **[05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MUGEckqWsQ&t=302s)** — And then the last and most important secret. Magnesium has a super important role in some of your biochemistry.
- **[05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MUGEckqWsQ&t=309s)** — Deep in the cell, you have all sorts of motors that do the work of the cell.
- **[05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MUGEckqWsQ&t=314s)** — Like the one in the mitochondria that literally spins 200 to 400 times a second.
- **[05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MUGEckqWsQ&t=321s)** — It generates ATP. ATP is the energy currency of the body. And so your energy levels, your fatigue is related to how much magnesium you have.
- **[05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MUGEckqWsQ&t=332s)** — So yes, magnesium helps lower cortisol, helps you sleep, but it also gives you energy.
- **[05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MUGEckqWsQ&t=337s)** — And if you have any type of fatigue, it could be because you're deficient in magnesium.
- **[05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MUGEckqWsQ&t=340s)** — And because magnesium is so important, if you have not watched my other video, magnesium, I'll put it up right here. Check it out.

- **[00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUY90EaVgXg&t=0s)** — There are some big mistakes people are making when they are taking magnesium.
- **[00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUY90EaVgXg&t=3s)** — And this is very important because of several reasons.
- **[00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUY90EaVgXg&t=5s)** — Number one, magnesium is hands down the most important mineral of the entire body.
- **[00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUY90EaVgXg&t=11s)** — It's involved in hundreds of different biochemical reactions.
- **[00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUY90EaVgXg&t=14s)** — Everything from atrial fibrillation, high blood pressure, insomnia, heart disease, leg cramps, and especially fatigue.
- **[00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUY90EaVgXg&t=22s)** — And it's so important, but it's almost impossible to test.
- **[00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUY90EaVgXg&t=24s)** — Because the majority of magnesium is not in your blood.
- **[00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUY90EaVgXg&t=27s)** — Only 1% is in the blood, the rest is inside your cells.
- **[00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUY90EaVgXg&t=31s)** — So unless you do a biopsy or a very specialized test, you're not going to know that you're deficient in magnesium.
- **[00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUY90EaVgXg&t=36s)** — Based on what we eat and other factors, most people are deficient in magnesium.
- **[00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUY90EaVgXg&t=41s)** — And if they don't know this information, they might stop taking it and go off into a different direction.
- **[00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUY90EaVgXg&t=46s)** — And never solve the magnesium deficiency problem.
- **[00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUY90EaVgXg&t=48s)** — Magnesium is a co-factor. It's a helper nutrient in so many different areas of the biochemistry of your body.
- **[00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUY90EaVgXg&t=54s)** — But first I want to talk about why people are deficient in the first place.
- **[00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUY90EaVgXg&t=57s)** — One big problem is a genetic weakness with the absorption of magnesium.
- **[01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUY90EaVgXg&t=61s)** — But honestly, that's actually very, very rare.
- **[01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUY90EaVgXg&t=63s)** — The likelihood of you having a genetic problem with magnesium is going to be low.
- **[01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUY90EaVgXg&t=67s)** — Magnesium is dependent on vitamin D.
- **[01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUY90EaVgXg&t=71s)** — And the amount of people with genetic problems with vitamin D is off the charts.
- **[01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUY90EaVgXg&t=76s)** — What I think is happening is the average person is so deficient in vitamin D,
- **[01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUY90EaVgXg&t=80s)** — that puts them in a situation where magnesium can't work because magnesium is dependent on vitamin D.
- **[01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUY90EaVgXg&t=87s)** — And realize this, the amount of vitamin D you actually need, minimally, is 10,000 IUs.
- **[01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUY90EaVgXg&t=92s)** — And that's just as a maintenance.
- **[01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUY90EaVgXg&t=93s)** — If you're on like 600 international units or a thousand IUs,
- **[01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUY90EaVgXg&t=97s)** — you're not going to be able to absorb much magnesium if you have inflammation in the gut.
- **[01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUY90EaVgXg&t=101s)** — Another reason is low stomach acid.
- **[01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUY90EaVgXg&t=103s)** — You need that acidic stomach to absorb minerals, especially magnesium.
- **[01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUY90EaVgXg&t=107s)** — How does one know if they don't have enough stomach acid?
- **[01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUY90EaVgXg&t=111s)** — Indigestion, bloating, heartburn.
- **[01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUY90EaVgXg&t=112s)** — All of those indicators mean that they need more acid to help you absorb magnesium.
- **[01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUY90EaVgXg&t=117s)** — If you're a pre-diabetic or a diabetic or you've been eating a lot of carbs for a period of time,
- **[02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUY90EaVgXg&t=121s)** — you have a problem with insulin.
- **[02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUY90EaVgXg&t=123s)** — And that could be the reason why you're not absorbing magnesium.
- **[02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUY90EaVgXg&t=125s)** — Because a lot of nutrients depend on normal insulin working in the body.
- **[02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUY90EaVgXg&t=130s)** — The best source of magnesium is magnesium glycinate.
- **[02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUY90EaVgXg&t=134s)** — You get absorption like 80% with that glycinate.
- **[02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUY90EaVgXg&t=136s)** — Plus the glycinate helps people sleep and it helps them calm down, helps them relax.
- **[02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUY90EaVgXg&t=140s)** — If you have too much calcium in the body and not enough magnesium,
- **[02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUY90EaVgXg&t=143s)** — you're going to get cramping in your calves.
- **[02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUY90EaVgXg&t=146s)** — You're going to get high blood pressure.
- **[02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUY90EaVgXg&t=148s)** — You're going to get arrhythmias.
- **[02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUY90EaVgXg&t=149s)** — Because magnesium controls calcium.
- **[02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUY90EaVgXg&t=153s)** — Too much calcium causes contraction.
- **[02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUY90EaVgXg&t=157s)** — It raises blood pressure.
- **[02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUY90EaVgXg&t=158s)** — And check out what happened to this person with blood pressure problems when they took magnesium.
- **[02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUY90EaVgXg&t=164s)** — I have to say that the first time I've actually had any meaningful relief from the pain
- **[02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUY90EaVgXg&t=169s)** — is taking this high dose of magnesium and vitamin D.
- **[02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUY90EaVgXg&t=173s)** — So it's made a huge difference.
- **[02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUY90EaVgXg&t=176s)** — And that wasn't even really what it was intended.
- **[02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUY90EaVgXg&t=179s)** — It was intended for the blood pressure.
- **[03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUY90EaVgXg&t=180s)** — But I think when your pain is alleviated, then your blood pressure will go down.
- **[03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUY90EaVgXg&t=185s)** — And now I've reduced the dose.
- **[03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUY90EaVgXg&t=188s)** — So I don't take 800, I take 600 of the magnesium.
- **[03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUY90EaVgXg&t=191s)** — And I take 20,000 of the vitamin D.
- **[03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUY90EaVgXg&t=195s)** — And the bonus to the whole thing as the magnesium and vitamin D
- **[03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUY90EaVgXg&t=200s)** — has had this calming effect on the inflammation of my body.
- **[03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUY90EaVgXg&t=204s)** — So it's still there, but nowhere near the levels as what they were before I did this test.
- **[03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUY90EaVgXg&t=212s)** — So I'm thrilled.
- **[03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUY90EaVgXg&t=213s)** — Interesting, isn't it?
- **[03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUY90EaVgXg&t=214s)** — Okay, let's continue.
- **[03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUY90EaVgXg&t=217s)** — Smoking, alcohol, block magnesium in a significant way.
- **[03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUY90EaVgXg&t=221s)** — If you're consuming too much sodas, which are loaded with phosphoric acid,
- **[03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUY90EaVgXg&t=226s)** — that can cause deficiency in magnesium.
- **[03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUY90EaVgXg&t=228s)** — All the refined sugars and refined starches in junk food
- **[03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUY90EaVgXg&t=231s)** — deplete you of magnesium.
- **[03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUY90EaVgXg&t=232s)** — And of course, the real big blocker of magnesium is with medications.
- **[03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUY90EaVgXg&t=237s)** — Another big mistake that doctors make with magnesium
- **[03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUY90EaVgXg&t=239s)** — is the fact that you cannot determine your magnesium levels from your blood.
- **[04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUY90EaVgXg&t=245s)** — The best way is just to understand what magnesium does
- **[04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUY90EaVgXg&t=247s)** — and to look at the various symptoms and just start to eat more magnesium-rich foods.
- **[04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUY90EaVgXg&t=253s)** — Leafy greens will give you magnesium, pumpkin seeds have magnesium,
- **[04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUY90EaVgXg&t=256s)** — chocolate has magnesium, make sure you get the kind without sugar,
- **[04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUY90EaVgXg&t=259s)** — and also certain nuts.
- **[04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUY90EaVgXg&t=261s)** — Another mistake that people make with magnesium
- **[04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUY90EaVgXg&t=263s)** — is not taking magnesium long enough to see the change.
- **[04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUY90EaVgXg&t=268s)** — They're going to need to take magnesium at least one to three months
- **[04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUY90EaVgXg&t=272s)** — before they even start seeing a change
- **[04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUY90EaVgXg&t=274s)** — because it takes time to fix the biochemistry in the body.
- **[04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUY90EaVgXg&t=278s)** — The same thing with arrhythmias.
- **[04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUY90EaVgXg&t=280s)** — That could take four to six months before you start to see changes.
- **[04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUY90EaVgXg&t=285s)** — It does take time for this magnesium to really create an effect on the body.
- **[04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUY90EaVgXg&t=289s)** — If someone has leg cramps, it could be a little bit quicker, like three days,
- **[04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUY90EaVgXg&t=293s)** — but they should keep taking the magnesium because just by getting rid of a cramp
- **[04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUY90EaVgXg&t=297s)** — or like a twitch called tetany on your skin can happen pretty quick,
- **[05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUY90EaVgXg&t=302s)** — but to fully resolve it, it could take weeks.
- **[05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUY90EaVgXg&t=305s)** — Insomnia could take four weeks before a person starts seeing change.
- **[05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUY90EaVgXg&t=310s)** — If you don't see immediate change with magnesium,
- **[05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUY90EaVgXg&t=313s)** — don't think it's not working. It's just taking more time.
- **[05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUY90EaVgXg&t=316s)** — If you have any digestive problems, constipation, diarrhea,
- **[05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUY90EaVgXg&t=319s)** — that means you don't have the right microbiome
- **[05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUY90EaVgXg&t=321s)** — and that can greatly affect your ability to absorb magnesium.
- **[05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUY90EaVgXg&t=324s)** — If you go through a lot of chronic stress,
- **[05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUY90EaVgXg&t=326s)** — that could be the reason why the need for magnesium is very, very high.
- **[05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUY90EaVgXg&t=329s)** — If you do a lot of exercise and you're an athlete,
- **[05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUY90EaVgXg&t=331s)** — you need a lot more magnesium than the average person.
- **[05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUY90EaVgXg&t=334s)** — The normal RDAs for magnesium, like 400 milligrams,
- **[05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUY90EaVgXg&t=338s)** — might not be enough to create a therapeutic effect.
- **[05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUY90EaVgXg&t=341s)** — You might need a lot more to penetrate some of the barriers that are in your body,
- **[05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUY90EaVgXg&t=346s)** — 800, 1200, or even 1600 milligrams every single day.
- **[05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUY90EaVgXg&t=352s)** — Especially if you're dealing with something that's affecting you right now
- **[05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUY90EaVgXg&t=355s)** — and you want to see change.
- **[05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUY90EaVgXg&t=356s)** — What you can do is take it in a powder or a tablet
- **[05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUY90EaVgXg&t=359s)** — and then spread it out through the entire day.
- **[06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUY90EaVgXg&t=362s)** — Don't just take 1600 and one sitting,
- **[06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUY90EaVgXg&t=364s)** — because your body can only absorb a certain amount.
- **[06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUY90EaVgXg&t=367s)** — Take it and spread it out through the day.
- **[06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUY90EaVgXg&t=369s)** — It'll be much better absorbed.
- **[06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUY90EaVgXg&t=370s)** — And it wouldn't hurt to at least one of the times that when you take it
- **[06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUY90EaVgXg&t=372s)** — is to take it with a tablespoon of alpacite of vinegar and water with a straw
- **[06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUY90EaVgXg&t=377s)** — and then use that liquid to acidify the stomach
- **[06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUY90EaVgXg&t=380s)** — so you get better absorption.
- **[06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUY90EaVgXg&t=381s)** — All right. Thanks for watching.
- **[06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUY90EaVgXg&t=382s)** — And if you haven't seen this video on magnesium, check it out.

- **[00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2no13WwLAmo&t=0s)** — So there's one really big regret that I have in practice. That I wish I had the information that I had now back then.
- **[00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2no13WwLAmo&t=9s)** — Because the advice I gave on this one topic was very bad advice. I used to recommend 1200mg of calcium to people, especially postmenopausal women, for bone health.
- **[00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2no13WwLAmo&t=21s)** — Especially if they had any type of osteopenia or osteoporosis.
- **[00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2no13WwLAmo&t=27s)** — Check this out. If you have someone with osteoporosis, obviously they're missing calcium in the bone. That's true.
- **[00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2no13WwLAmo&t=35s)** — Almost every osteoporotic person without exception also at the same time has excess calcium outside their bone.
- **[00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2no13WwLAmo&t=47s)** — In 15 independent clinical trials, they found an increased risk, 30% for heart attacks, a 20% increase in strokes just by taking an extra 500mg of calcium per day.
- **[01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2no13WwLAmo&t=62s)** — In another study involving 61,000 people over 19 years, there was a pretty strong correlation between people taking over 1400mg of calcium per day and a 114% increase in dying from heart attacks.
- **[01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2no13WwLAmo&t=81s)** — You just go to the store and look at the vitamin bottles, right? Look at the one a day. What's the first ingredient? Calcium carbonate.
- **[01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2no13WwLAmo&t=88s)** — Notice how heavy that bottle is. Because most of that product is calcium carbonate. You're basically eating rocks.
- **[01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2no13WwLAmo&t=95s)** — I mean, when you think about it, how is that affecting the heart? How is it affecting the tissues with all this calcium?
- **[01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2no13WwLAmo&t=100s)** — One third of all adults in America over the age of 45 have some type of calcification in their arteries.
- **[01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2no13WwLAmo&t=107s)** — So this idea that if we just take calcium, it'll go right to the bones is not true.
- **[01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2no13WwLAmo&t=113s)** — Yes, we have the calcium in the bone, but also calcium has other functions, especially all the different communication between the cells.
- **[02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2no13WwLAmo&t=121s)** — You use calcium. You have the intracellular calcium and you have the extracellular calcium outside.
- **[02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2no13WwLAmo&t=127s)** — In fact, you have a lot more extracellular calcium. You have a thousand to ten thousand times more extracellular calcium right here than inside your cell.
- **[02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2no13WwLAmo&t=137s)** — And so when this cell builds up too much intracellular calcium, it commits suicide.
- **[02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2no13WwLAmo&t=143s)** — And check out this next point. Calcium accumulation is an independent factor of risk of all cause mortality.
- **[02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2no13WwLAmo&t=152s)** — And check this out. People that are taking calcium channel blockers. Normally you probably know they're taking it for high blood pressure.
- **[02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2no13WwLAmo&t=158s)** — But did you know that it creates other effects? It can also help improve chronic diseases, including ALS,
- **[02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2no13WwLAmo&t=168s)** — Parkinson's, Alzheimer's. It can decrease the risk from coronary artery spasm and Jina.
- **[02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2no13WwLAmo&t=174s)** — There's one study that shows that taking calcium channel blockers decreases the risk of all cause mortality.
- **[03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2no13WwLAmo&t=183s)** — What does this tell you about calcium in our bodies? But the point is that this drug has multiple effects that go beyond just blood pressure, which is very interesting.
- **[03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2no13WwLAmo&t=192s)** — So since we're on the topic of osteoporosis or bone loss, and what should you do instead of taking massive amounts of just calcium to try to fix that?
- **[03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2no13WwLAmo&t=202s)** — If you ever look up the condition called scurvy, which is an advanced vitamin C deficiency, and you read all of the side effects of scurvy, you're going to see one of them called bone resorption.
- **[03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2no13WwLAmo&t=218s)** — So in other words, a severe vitamin C deficiency causes calcium to leach out from your bone.
- **[03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2no13WwLAmo&t=226s)** — Another symptom of scurvy is decreased synthesis of collagen. Synthesis means the production of something.
- **[03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2no13WwLAmo&t=235s)** — I mean, think about what bone really is. A lot of it's collagen protein. And so if you don't have enough vitamin C, you can't make that collagen.
- **[04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2no13WwLAmo&t=243s)** — Another symptom of scurvy is something called osteolysis. What does that mean? That means the destruction of bone.
- **[04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2no13WwLAmo&t=253s)** — Another symptom is osteonecrosis. That's a similar thing that means death of your bone.
- **[04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2no13WwLAmo&t=259s)** — As I continued down the list of scurvy, I also found osteopenia as well as osteoporosis.
- **[04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2no13WwLAmo&t=267s)** — I also found another side effect of oxidative stress, aka a lot of inflammation.
- **[04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2no13WwLAmo&t=274s)** — And the last side effect that I found, which was very revealing, is calcification outside the bone.
- **[04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2no13WwLAmo&t=284s)** — And so what would be the remedy for osteopenia or osteoporosis? Well, one big thing that I would recommend is therapeutic doses of vitamin C.
- **[04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2no13WwLAmo&t=293s)** — And as I did a deep dive into this topic, you're not going to be able to fix your osteoporosis or osteopenia just by normal amounts of vitamin C.
- **[05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2no13WwLAmo&t=303s)** — You're not going to even create a dent into that problem. You may need to use another type of vitamin C.
- **[05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2no13WwLAmo&t=310s)** — So you can use ascorbic acid or another one that might be good is magnesium ascorbate. Why?
- **[05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2no13WwLAmo&t=316s)** — Because the magnesium is really good to help lower the pathogenic calcification problem that we're trying to deal with here.
- **[05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2no13WwLAmo&t=325s)** — And the amounts that I would recommend of this vitamin C would be minimally 6,000 milligrams per day.
- **[05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2no13WwLAmo&t=331s)** — Now, there's a lot of research on this, not just for osteoporosis, for other things, but 6,000 plus.
- **[05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2no13WwLAmo&t=340s)** — So some people need to go a lot higher. Okay. Now, I would recommend breaking it up into two or four doses.
- **[05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2no13WwLAmo&t=347s)** — And one way to determine if you're taking too much is if you have diarrhea. Okay, because that's one of the side effects.
- **[05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2no13WwLAmo&t=353s)** — So you want to take a certain amount until maybe your stools are loose and then back off a little bit.
- **[05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2no13WwLAmo&t=358s)** — Having enough vitamin C can suppress the cells that break down your bone. And those cells are called osteoclasts.
- **[06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2no13WwLAmo&t=366s)** — And having enough vitamin C can help the absorption of calcium in your bone.
- **[06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2no13WwLAmo&t=372s)** — And this is that regret when I used to recommend these calcium supplements. I don't recommend that. Okay.
- **[06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2no13WwLAmo&t=378s)** — Now, you can get enough calcium just from a little bit of cheese.
- **[06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2no13WwLAmo&t=382s)** — But the point is, if you have excess soft tissue calcium, you don't want to be guzzling gallons of milk all day long.
- **[06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2no13WwLAmo&t=390s)** — Definitely not the calcium supplements. Ant acids. Now, I'm not telling you not to take your antacids,
- **[06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2no13WwLAmo&t=395s)** — but antacids a lot of times involve taking calcium. And then you're going to neutralize the stomach acid, which helps you absorb calcium.
- **[06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2no13WwLAmo&t=403s)** — Check with your doctor to see if you really need to take that antacid.
- **[06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2no13WwLAmo&t=406s)** — It may be contributing to your extracellular extra calcium problem that you have.
- **[06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2no13WwLAmo&t=413s)** — And don't forget about the magnesium. Magnesium is a natural calcium channel blocker. Also vitamin K2.
- **[06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2no13WwLAmo&t=419s)** — A K2 deficiency is the most reliable predictor of vascular calcification.
- **[07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2no13WwLAmo&t=427s)** — And of course, if you're dealing with osteopenia or osteoporosis, a good trace mineral complex would be good.
- **[07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2no13WwLAmo&t=433s)** — So you get all the different trace minerals as well as consuming high quality protein in your diet like red meat.
- **[07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2no13WwLAmo&t=441s)** — Very, very healthy. Eggs are good. But red meat is going to be the best protein to build bone.
- **[07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2no13WwLAmo&t=448s)** — Now if you haven't seen my video related to calcium, milk, and phosphorus, I put that up right here. Check it out.

- **[00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XbKqWWHE-zw&t=0s)** — Today I'd like to discuss the myth around metabolic syndrome. They call it syndrome X.
- **[00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XbKqWWHE-zw&t=7s)** — And that's a combination of several conditions. Central abdominal fat, blood pressure, glucose
- **[00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XbKqWWHE-zw&t=14s)** — levels are starting to go up. We have high triglycerides with insulin resistance for sure.
- **[00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XbKqWWHE-zw&t=19s)** — And also we have higher levels of insulin in the blood. It's called hyperinsulinemia,
- **[00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XbKqWWHE-zw&t=24s)** — an association with an increased amount of uric acid. We automatically associate
- **[00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XbKqWWHE-zw&t=29s)** — metabolic syndrome with something really, really bad. It's a disease that you get and doctors are
- **[00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XbKqWWHE-zw&t=33s)** — going to put you a lot of medications. There's going to be a lot of testing and it's very
- **[00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XbKqWWHE-zw&t=37s)** — complex and no one really knows what causes it. But today I'm going to give you a completely
- **[00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XbKqWWHE-zw&t=41s)** — new viewpoint on metabolic syndrome as it relates to a type of sugar called fructose.
- **[00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XbKqWWHE-zw&t=50s)** — Now what I believe metabolic syndrome really is, it's a protective mechanism. Now if we
- **[00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XbKqWWHE-zw&t=59s)** — humans did eat fruit and they did eat honey, not very often, which has a really good amount of
- **[01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XbKqWWHE-zw&t=67s)** — fructose. So I want to just talk about fructose for a second. It's a unique type of sugar.
- **[01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XbKqWWHE-zw&t=73s)** — And when you consume glucose, there's receptors all over your body that can metabolize glucose.
- **[01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XbKqWWHE-zw&t=79s)** — But fructose is different. The liver is really the only place where your body can metabolize
- **[01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XbKqWWHE-zw&t=84s)** — And there's some very unique things about fructose that relate to this topic that I'm going to talk
- **[01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XbKqWWHE-zw&t=90s)** — about. Number one, it's a lot more lipogenic, which means that it produces more fat than other
- **[01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XbKqWWHE-zw&t=97s)** — types of sugar. Also fructose enhances the fat genes much more than glucose and other sugars.
- **[01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XbKqWWHE-zw&t=104s)** — If you just think about fructose for a minute and what would be the survival benefit of
- **[01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XbKqWWHE-zw&t=110s)** — consuming some fructose? You know infrequently in the past, as we're trying to survive in our
- **[01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XbKqWWHE-zw&t=116s)** — environment, food did not come very easily and anytime that you had some fruit or honey,
- **[02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XbKqWWHE-zw&t=123s)** — it was a survival thing. And so this really aligns with what fructose does in the body.
- **[02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XbKqWWHE-zw&t=128s)** — Number one, it retains sodium. Now what would be the survival mechanism for that? Well way
- **[02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XbKqWWHE-zw&t=135s)** — back in time we did not have a lot of salt available in our diets. We had animal meat,
- **[02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XbKqWWHE-zw&t=142s)** — there were some plants, we pretty much ate anything we could. And apparently if we look at
- **[02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XbKqWWHE-zw&t=147s)** — some interesting differences between way back then and now, we ate a lot less salt back
- **[02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XbKqWWHE-zw&t=153s)** — then or sodium because it just wasn't available. And so sodium does help retain fluid and water
- **[02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XbKqWWHE-zw&t=159s)** — and prevents dehydration. And so one thing that fructose does is it helps you retain
- **[02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XbKqWWHE-zw&t=165s)** — sodium and sodium chloride salt which connects to sodium. So way back then when we had fruit and
- **[02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XbKqWWHE-zw&t=170s)** — honey, we could retain more fluid and prevent dehydration. In fact fructose stimulates this
- **[02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XbKqWWHE-zw&t=175s)** — hormone called vasopressin which is called the anti-diuretic hormone. So it prevents the
- **[03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XbKqWWHE-zw&t=181s)** — loss of fluid from the body. It helps you retain fluid. So this is a survival mechanism.
- **[03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XbKqWWHE-zw&t=186s)** — Now if we take a look at what else we did way back then compared to now, we consumed a
- **[03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XbKqWWHE-zw&t=190s)** — potassium from just vegetation, plants, things like that. Compared to now, the average person
- **[03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XbKqWWHE-zw&t=198s)** — consumes about one and a half cups of vegetables. So that doesn't give us much potassium. So
- **[03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XbKqWWHE-zw&t=204s)** — nowadays we have a lot of sodium and very low amounts of potassium. Very different from
- **[03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XbKqWWHE-zw&t=211s)** — in the past. Another interesting thing about fructose is it causes sodium sensitivity. What's
- **[03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XbKqWWHE-zw&t=219s)** — the advantage of that survival wise? Well if you can make sodium more sensitive, you can absorb
- **[03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XbKqWWHE-zw&t=224s)** — it more. It goes in your body. It can be retained more. And another benefit of holding this
- **[03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XbKqWWHE-zw&t=230s)** — sodium is to help you increase blood pressure. Because one of the really important things in
- **[03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XbKqWWHE-zw&t=235s)** — the past was you don't want to end up with low blood pressure because you don't have enough
- **[03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XbKqWWHE-zw&t=239s)** — sodium. Because we need to maintain the same amount of pressure to push the nutrients and
- **[04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XbKqWWHE-zw&t=244s)** — oxygen throughout our body, including our brain. Next thing is abdominal obesity. What would be the
- **[04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XbKqWWHE-zw&t=250s)** — survival mechanism of that? Well we're storing fuel for another day. That's what fat is. It's
- **[04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XbKqWWHE-zw&t=256s)** — a survival mechanism and we have a lot of extra space in our bellies. It's almost an
- **[04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XbKqWWHE-zw&t=262s)** — unlimited amount of space. Well it's not completely unlimited, but you can store a
- **[04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XbKqWWHE-zw&t=266s)** — tremendous amount of stored energy in your midsection. So that would be a survival mechanism
- **[04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XbKqWWHE-zw&t=270s)** — during lean times. Now of course nowadays we consume a bit more fructose than we did in the
- **[04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XbKqWWHE-zw&t=277s)** — past. I mean fruits are available 24-7 every day of the year. Honey is also available.
- **[04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XbKqWWHE-zw&t=284s)** — And also other types of fructose in the form of high fructose corn syrup. We're actually
- **[04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XbKqWWHE-zw&t=288s)** — drinking our fructose now. I mean even table sugar is like 50 percent fructose. So fructose is
- **[04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XbKqWWHE-zw&t=295s)** — pretty much everywhere. Now what about this other thing with insulin resistance? Is there
- **[05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XbKqWWHE-zw&t=300s)** — any survival mechanism with that? There sure is. Number one, insulin resistance helps protect
- **[05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XbKqWWHE-zw&t=306s)** — against the toxicity of glucose because it makes receptors for insulin very resistant.
- **[05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XbKqWWHE-zw&t=312s)** — So you can't absorb as much glucose into the cell because if there's too much glucose that's
- **[05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XbKqWWHE-zw&t=318s)** — going to be toxic and it's a way to protect you against both glucose and insulin. And along
- **[05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XbKqWWHE-zw&t=324s)** — with insulin resistance, there's another thing that happens that helps you survive. And that's
- **[05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XbKqWWHE-zw&t=331s)** — gluconeogenesis. That's the production of new sugar that doesn't involve a carbohydrate. So when
- **[05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XbKqWWHE-zw&t=336s)** — people are a pre-diabetic and they have insulin resistance, they actually make more glucose.
- **[05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XbKqWWHE-zw&t=344s)** — But it's not coming from the diet. Their liver is just making more glucose from other sources.
- **[05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XbKqWWHE-zw&t=349s)** — And this is behind the dawn phenomena. This is where you wake up in the morning and all of a
- **[05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XbKqWWHE-zw&t=353s)** — sudden you have high blood glucose. But maybe you didn't have any glucose tonight before.
- **[05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XbKqWWHE-zw&t=356s)** — It just means that you have insulin resistance and the liver makes more glucose because of it.
- **[06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XbKqWWHE-zw&t=364s)** — And this is what you see in diabetes as well. You have a diabetic with high blood glucose.
- **[06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XbKqWWHE-zw&t=369s)** — A certain portion of that is not coming from the sugar they're eating. It's coming from
- **[06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XbKqWWHE-zw&t=374s)** — the liver producing a lot of sugar. What is the survival mechanism of gluconeogenesis?
- **[06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XbKqWWHE-zw&t=379s)** — Well, number one, it helps you protect against hypoglycemia because your brain depends
- **[06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XbKqWWHE-zw&t=386s)** — partially on glucose which can be made by your body. And in times when there's not a
- **[06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XbKqWWHE-zw&t=392s)** — lot of glucose available, this extra added gluconeogenesis can help the brain during
- **[06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XbKqWWHE-zw&t=397s)** — survival modes. But of course nowadays it's gotten out of control because we're having
- **[06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XbKqWWHE-zw&t=402s)** — way too much sugar and we have way too much gluconeogenesis. Now the next point I want
- **[06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XbKqWWHE-zw&t=406s)** — to bring up is uric acid. You probably already know that when you consume fructose,
- **[06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XbKqWWHE-zw&t=413s)** — you spike your uric acid. Now what is the connection survival-wise with uric acid? Well,
- **[06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XbKqWWHE-zw&t=419s)** — number one, it's a potent antioxidant. So from that viewpoint, it protects you against
- **[07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XbKqWWHE-zw&t=426s)** — oxidation. Oxidation of what? Well, fructose which is a type of sugar that oxidizes the
- **[07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XbKqWWHE-zw&t=434s)** — insulin arteries and it creates a lot of damage unless there's some protective factors
- **[07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XbKqWWHE-zw&t=439s)** — that are connected to it, one being uric acid. But uric acid is a good predictor of high blood
- **[07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XbKqWWHE-zw&t=447s)** — pressure and heart disease. So uric acid tends to increase blood pressure. What's the survival
- **[07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XbKqWWHE-zw&t=452s)** — mechanism of that? Well, like I said before, when you don't have enough sodium, we're
- **[07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XbKqWWHE-zw&t=458s)** — going to end up with low blood pressure and that is not a good survival mix. So the uric
- **[07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XbKqWWHE-zw&t=465s)** — acid comes in there to help increase the blood pressure under conditions of low sodium.
- **[07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XbKqWWHE-zw&t=474s)** — So in the past, uric acid was one way to raise the blood pressure. Of course, nowadays,
- **[08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XbKqWWHE-zw&t=480s)** — when you have a lot of fructose and a lot of salt, that creates a huge problem with uric
- **[08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XbKqWWHE-zw&t=485s)** — acid. Very pathogenic. Uric acid also directly makes salt more sensitive. Nowadays, when
- **[08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XbKqWWHE-zw&t=492s)** — we're all so sensitive, we tell people to restrict their salt. But what they really
- **[08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XbKqWWHE-zw&t=496s)** — should do is restrict their fructose and increase that other mineral that I mentioned
- **[08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XbKqWWHE-zw&t=501s)** — called potassium. Potassium is something that our body has evolved with way back in the past.
- **[08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XbKqWWHE-zw&t=508s)** — We used to eat a lot more of it than we do now. And so as long as you have higher
- **[08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XbKqWWHE-zw&t=512s)** — amounts of potassium, you can handle a lot more sodium. And it just happens that more
- **[08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XbKqWWHE-zw&t=519s)** — potassium lowers blood pressure very, very nicely. So when we talk about blood pressure,
- **[08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XbKqWWHE-zw&t=527s)** — we're not necessarily avoiding fructose. What do we do? We avoid salt diets. So very simply,
- **[08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XbKqWWHE-zw&t=533s)** — just understanding these mechanisms, you can very easily control your blood pressure by
- **[08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XbKqWWHE-zw&t=538s)** — increasing potassium, getting rid of the sugars, especially fructose. And as far as
- **[09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XbKqWWHE-zw&t=545s)** — as long as you have enough potassium, you have like a two to one ratio, twice as much potassium
- **[09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XbKqWWHE-zw&t=551s)** — to sodium, you're going to be totally fine. Another thing about uric acid, it's involved with
- **[09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XbKqWWHE-zw&t=557s)** — the immune inflammation reaction as it can help fight off infections, things like that. In the
- **[09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XbKqWWHE-zw&t=564s)** — past, we used that as a survival mechanism. Nowadays, if we have too much uric acid,
- **[09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XbKqWWHE-zw&t=569s)** — we get inflammation throughout our bodies, especially in the big toe, and that's called
- **[09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XbKqWWHE-zw&t=573s)** — another really interesting survival thing is just the storage of fat and the storage of glucose
- **[09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XbKqWWHE-zw&t=580s)** — as glycogen. Glycogen is stored glucose. What's interesting about this as it relates to water
- **[09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XbKqWWHE-zw&t=589s)** — in times of survival, when we didn't have enough water, believe it or not, as we burned
- **[09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XbKqWWHE-zw&t=594s)** — our fat, glycogen can make water. In fact, just a little over one gram, like 1.1 gram of
- **[10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XbKqWWHE-zw&t=600s)** — when it's burned produces one gram of water, which is interesting. That's going to be a survival
- **[10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XbKqWWHE-zw&t=606s)** — mechanism to help against dehydration, but also glycogen. If you envision these
- **[10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XbKqWWHE-zw&t=614s)** — string of glucose molecules connected together, they're connected together with a lot of water.
- **[10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XbKqWWHE-zw&t=620s)** — For every one gram of glucose that you burn, you release 3.5 grams of water. You're
- **[10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XbKqWWHE-zw&t=629s)** — releasing a lot of available water when you burn up this glucose as glycogen. Now, in the past,
- **[10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XbKqWWHE-zw&t=636s)** — when we consumed fructose, it always came with a bunch of antioxidants because we ate fruit.
- **[10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XbKqWWHE-zw&t=644s)** — And of course, the fruit wasn't as sweet as it is now, but fruit generally has antioxidants,
- **[10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XbKqWWHE-zw&t=650s)** — and antioxidants protect against the oxidative damage of the fructose. It gets rid of the
- **[10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XbKqWWHE-zw&t=656s)** — complications of just high sugar. This is why a diabetic will have much less problems if they
- **[11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XbKqWWHE-zw&t=663s)** — actually also have the antioxidants connected with that sugar versus the refined sugars where
- **[11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XbKqWWHE-zw&t=669s)** — you're just doing high fructose corn syrup and you're drinking it. Related to antioxidants,
- **[11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XbKqWWHE-zw&t=674s)** — I'm going to just touch on vitamin C, which is interesting. Vitamin C has a
- **[11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XbKqWWHE-zw&t=678s)** — very similar chemistry to both glucose and fructose. And so the more glucose and fructose
- **[11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XbKqWWHE-zw&t=686s)** — you consume, the more vitamin C is required. One is it helps protect the immune system.
- **[11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XbKqWWHE-zw&t=692s)** — Another is it helps to get rid of oxidative damage from the high glucose. Vitamin C can
- **[11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XbKqWWHE-zw&t=698s)** — even inhibit the burning of fat as well. So it can actually help you survive because it slows
- **[11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XbKqWWHE-zw&t=705s)** — down to a certain degree, fat oxidation or fat burning. Now what I'm not saying is avoiding
- **[11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XbKqWWHE-zw&t=710s)** — vitamin C because it's going to help you lose weight. That's not how it works. The point
- **[11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XbKqWWHE-zw&t=714s)** — I'm making is the vitamin C in the fruit is protective against that fructose. So when you
- **[12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XbKqWWHE-zw&t=721s)** — study metabolic syndrome and you look at what they say is the cause, they said overeating.
- **[12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XbKqWWHE-zw&t=727s)** — It could be obesity, stress, a lack of exercise, age. And when you really understand
- **[12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XbKqWWHE-zw&t=733s)** — this, you're going to be less susceptible to just going, oh, let's just treat each part of this
- **[12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XbKqWWHE-zw&t=737s)** — with a different drug, which makes no sense whatsoever. So if you have problems with sodium,
- **[12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XbKqWWHE-zw&t=743s)** — if you have problems with your midsection, if you have problems with high blood pressure,
- **[12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XbKqWWHE-zw&t=748s)** — if you have problems with uric acid, fructose is what you need to avoid and in all forms
- **[12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XbKqWWHE-zw&t=754s)** — as well. Now if you want a complete diet to know exactly what to eat, to reverse a lot of

- **[00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMEDTX3JqOs&t=0s)** — Today I want to talk about the difference between hormone therapy and glandular therapy, right?
- **[00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMEDTX3JqOs&t=7s)** — I know the name for glandular therapy is organotherapy, using organ extracts from animals,
- **[00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMEDTX3JqOs&t=14s)** — whether it's a sheep, pig or cow. And this therapy was used in even hospitals in the late
- **[00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMEDTX3JqOs&t=19s)** — 1800s, early 1900s, I think up to like in the 30s it was used. But then we started isolating
- **[00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMEDTX3JqOs&t=26s)** — hormones in the gland tissue and then making them synthetic. And that's what we have now.
- **[00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMEDTX3JqOs&t=32s)** — You can get growth hormone, you can get thyroxine, which is T4 in the form of
- **[00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMEDTX3JqOs&t=38s)** — Synthroid. You can get estradiol, testosterone, insulin, cortisol, adrenaline. And so this is
- **[00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMEDTX3JqOs&t=45s)** — what our treatment for the endocrine system has become. You know, when someone has a hormonal
- **[00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMEDTX3JqOs&t=51s)** — imbalance or hormonal deficiency, I always want to ask a question, why? Why are your
- **[00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMEDTX3JqOs&t=57s)** — hormones deficient in the first place? There are a lot of complications and side effects
- **[01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMEDTX3JqOs&t=62s)** — that occur when you start to do hormonal therapy. If we talk about the endocrine system
- **[01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMEDTX3JqOs&t=67s)** — and look at it from a very simplistic viewpoint, you have the gland, you have the hormone,
- **[01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMEDTX3JqOs&t=72s)** — and you have the connection or receptor where it goes, right? And so what you're looking at
- **[01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMEDTX3JqOs&t=78s)** — is a very rudiment communication network. The gland is kind of like the thing that makes the
- **[01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMEDTX3JqOs&t=84s)** — hormone. The hormone is the communication. This hormone communication travels through the
- **[01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMEDTX3JqOs&t=88s)** — blood and it gets received by a receptor on the other end. And so it's the receptor
- **[01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMEDTX3JqOs&t=95s)** — that activates certain functions through genes and certain proteins. And when that activation
- **[01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMEDTX3JqOs&t=103s)** — occurs, there's also something else that's very, very important in this communication
- **[01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMEDTX3JqOs&t=107s)** — mechanism. And it's the feedback loop that's connected with this communication. In other
- **[01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMEDTX3JqOs&t=114s)** — words, it's a control mechanism that's controlled by the receptor. Something is sent back
- **[02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMEDTX3JqOs&t=120s)** — to that gland to turn it off. If we're dealing with a negative feedback loop, it's
- **[02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMEDTX3JqOs&t=125s)** — very similar to in your house, you have a thermostat that adjusts to certain temperature,
- **[02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMEDTX3JqOs&t=131s)** — and then it turns off at that temperature. The same exact thing happens with the endocrine
- **[02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMEDTX3JqOs&t=135s)** — system. And so when someone does hormonal therapy and they're giving you a hormone,
- **[02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMEDTX3JqOs&t=141s)** — the question is, how do you adjust for this feedback loop? How do you know how much exactly
- **[02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMEDTX3JqOs&t=147s)** — to give the person and when to give the person? Hormones are created and sent through a
- **[02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMEDTX3JqOs&t=153s)** — very complex wave pattern, a circadian rhythm. And a lot of these hormones, especially the
- **[02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMEDTX3JqOs&t=159s)** — metabolic ones that actually build things up, are produced and sent mostly in the middle
- **[02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMEDTX3JqOs&t=164s)** — of the night when you're sleeping. So when you take this hormone in the day, does that
- **[02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMEDTX3JqOs&t=170s)** — complicate things? And so we're trying to mimic this very complex machinery when we actually
- **[02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMEDTX3JqOs&t=175s)** — take a hormone. And especially because the hormone we're taking is usually not a natural
- **[02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMEDTX3JqOs&t=179s)** — hormone, it's a synthesized isolate of that hormone. And there are many side effects,
- **[03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMEDTX3JqOs&t=184s)** — which I'm going to go through. The first thing you need to know is when you take these
- **[03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMEDTX3JqOs&t=187s)** — hormones as hormone therapy, you actually inactivate the gland that produces that
- **[03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMEDTX3JqOs&t=193s)** — hormone. So you basically put that gland asleep because you're bypassing the whole mechanism
- **[03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMEDTX3JqOs&t=197s)** — and you can cause atrophy of that gland. As in one of the side effects from testosterone
- **[03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMEDTX3JqOs&t=205s)** — therapy, right? You actually cause testicular atrophy. Or even when you take Synthroid T4,
- **[03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMEDTX3JqOs&t=212s)** — you actually cause atrophy of that gland. So now your body is dependent on that external supply.
- **[03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMEDTX3JqOs&t=219s)** — You should just be aware of that. I'm not telling you not to do it, but you should just
- **[03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMEDTX3JqOs&t=222s)** — know that going into this therapy. Like let's take growth hormone. Are there any complications?
- **[03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMEDTX3JqOs&t=228s)** — Yeah, big time. Carbal tunnel syndrome, insulin resistance, type two diabetes,
- **[03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMEDTX3JqOs&t=235s)** — edema, increased breast tissue, increased risk of cancer. Now what about when you're taking
- **[04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMEDTX3JqOs&t=241s)** — hormones? Well, insomnia, headache, tremor, chest pain, increased pulse rate, fatigue and heat
- **[04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMEDTX3JqOs&t=248s)** — intolerance. And then what about estradiol like estrogen? Well, there's a lot of bad effects
- **[04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMEDTX3JqOs&t=255s)** — that occur from that hormone. One is breast cancer, ovarian cancer, uterine cancer,
- **[04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMEDTX3JqOs&t=263s)** — stroke, blood clots, gallstones. But other than that, you can be perfectly fine.
- **[04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMEDTX3JqOs&t=267s)** — Now with testosterone therapy, it doesn't come without problems too. Acne, testicular atrophy,
- **[04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMEDTX3JqOs&t=274s)** — aggression, deeper voice, hoarseness, mood swings, insomnia, et cetera, et cetera.
- **[04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMEDTX3JqOs&t=281s)** — Now what about insulin therapy? Is there any complications? Yeah, I think the majority of
- **[04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMEDTX3JqOs&t=285s)** — the population right now is doing an experiment with insulin therapy. Of course, it's through
- **[04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMEDTX3JqOs&t=289s)** — eating a lot of refined carbs. But when you actually take insulin, it doesn't come without
- **[04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMEDTX3JqOs&t=296s)** — effects. Number one, you're going to get weight gain, mood issues, low potassium, swelling,
- **[05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMEDTX3JqOs&t=303s)** — heart problems, heart failure even. And if someone takes too much, they can end up in a coma.
- **[05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMEDTX3JqOs&t=309s)** — In fact, that was one of the therapies early on in the 1900s, giving people insulin shock
- **[05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMEDTX3JqOs&t=315s)** — therapy, where they give them insulin, put them in a coma, and they wake up greatly over
- **[05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMEDTX3JqOs&t=319s)** — weight. But apparently that was used for all sorts of mental problems. Well, but right now,
- **[05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMEDTX3JqOs&t=324s)** — don't do that. They use electric shock therapy, which is definitely a lot worse.
- **[05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMEDTX3JqOs&t=329s)** — All right. What about the adrenal hormones? Right? Is there any problems with taking cortisol
- **[05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMEDTX3JqOs&t=333s)** — in the form of prednisone, which is a synthetic type of cortisol? Well, I'm a perfect example
- **[05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMEDTX3JqOs&t=338s)** — that I had to take steroid shots every year for probably, I don't know, 12, maybe 15 years
- **[05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMEDTX3JqOs&t=345s)** — because of poison ivy. Now I'm resistant to it. It created a lot of problems for me. It
- **[05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMEDTX3JqOs&t=354s)** — affects from cortisol are diabetes, a very lowered immune system, cortisol resistance,
- **[06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMEDTX3JqOs&t=362s)** — which means now it doesn't really work. Just the same thing with insulin. You can get insulin
- **[06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMEDTX3JqOs&t=365s)** — resistance too. And now it doesn't work anymore. And so when you have cortisol
- **[06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMEDTX3JqOs&t=369s)** — resistance or even insulin resistance, you get now a deficiency of that hormone. So if you
- **[06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMEDTX3JqOs&t=375s)** — don't have enough cortisol, okay, you'll get a lot of inflammatory conditions, a lot of skin
- **[06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMEDTX3JqOs&t=381s)** — problems. This is why one of the common treatments for dermatitis and skin problems
- **[06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMEDTX3JqOs&t=387s)** — is steroid creams. But other symptoms would be insomnia. That was me. Mood problems,
- **[06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMEDTX3JqOs&t=394s)** — agitation, and anxiety. So as you can see, there's a lot of side effects from this
- **[06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMEDTX3JqOs&t=399s)** — hormonal therapy. Okay. A much better strategy, which I would recommend, would be using
- **[06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMEDTX3JqOs&t=408s)** — glandular therapy, right? Using glandular extracts. Now, what would that do that's
- **[06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMEDTX3JqOs&t=413s)** — different than hormonal therapy? Well, you're supporting the entire endocrine system as a
- **[07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMEDTX3JqOs&t=420s)** — whole. When you take a glandular, you're getting a lot of things in that gland.
- **[07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMEDTX3JqOs&t=424s)** — You're getting nutrition. I mean, just take a look at glands as far as out of all the
- **[07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMEDTX3JqOs&t=430s)** — foods that people eat. And, you know, people are focused on eating muscle meat and
- **[07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMEDTX3JqOs&t=433s)** — that, but what about the rest of the animal? Right? We used to eat glands early on. And out
- **[07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMEDTX3JqOs&t=440s)** — of all the things that you can eat, your glands and organ meats are the most nutrient dense.
- **[07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMEDTX3JqOs&t=446s)** — So number one, we're going to support the endocrine system with a super nutrient dense
- **[07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMEDTX3JqOs&t=450s)** — substance. But you also have other things. You have growth factors, you have proteins,
- **[07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMEDTX3JqOs&t=456s)** — certain amino acids, peptides, which are chains of amino acids, cofactors, minerals,
- **[07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMEDTX3JqOs&t=463s)** — enzymes. You have the whole package, especially if it's freeze dried,
- **[07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMEDTX3JqOs&t=467s)** — glandulars. Now, I think the big reason why we don't use glandulars anymore is because
- **[07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMEDTX3JqOs&t=472s)** — apparently it's not practical. That's kind of expensive. If you can take a look at what it
- **[07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMEDTX3JqOs&t=477s)** — would take to synthesize a hormone, you can do it at a much higher scale. You can refine
- **[08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMEDTX3JqOs&t=482s)** — it, you can synthesize it. But the question is, is it a better treatment? Well, you judge,
- **[08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMEDTX3JqOs&t=487s)** — but there's a lot of history on glandulars. For example, in 1891, there was a doctor named
- **[08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMEDTX3JqOs&t=494s)** — Dr. George Murray, and he demonstrated that mixed edema in hypothyroid cases.
- **[08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMEDTX3JqOs&t=501s)** — Mixed edema is that kind of that puffiness that you would get that looks like fat,
- **[08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMEDTX3JqOs&t=504s)** — that it's not really fat. It's kind of a waste product from metabolism.
- **[08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMEDTX3JqOs&t=508s)** — Well, this doctor demonstrated that by taking thyroid extract from a sheep,
- **[08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMEDTX3JqOs&t=513s)** — he can resolve that problem. Other doctors were using extracts of the parathyroid gland
- **[08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMEDTX3JqOs&t=518s)** — in treating tetany or muscle problems after someone had surgery. Now, tetany is at twitching.
- **[08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMEDTX3JqOs&t=525s)** — The parathyroid regulates calcium. So somehow taking the parathyroid gland helped that.
- **[08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMEDTX3JqOs&t=531s)** — I know when I was in practice, I use whole desiccated adrenal a lot. So I would use
- **[08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMEDTX3JqOs&t=536s)** — the adrenal gland for all sorts of things related to the adrenal. And I would see quite
- **[09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMEDTX3JqOs&t=542s)** — good results. But of course, you're not going to probably see a lot of money invested into
- **[09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMEDTX3JqOs&t=546s)** — doing double-blinded placebo controlled clinical trials on glandulars because
- **[09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMEDTX3JqOs&t=550s)** — you can't really patent them. But you can still get like armor thyroid. Okay. That's using
- **[09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMEDTX3JqOs&t=557s)** — the whole gland instead of just one hormone. People lose more weight on armor than just
- **[09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMEDTX3JqOs&t=562s)** — synthroid. One study showed that they lost an additional three pounds of weight when they
- **[09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMEDTX3JqOs&t=568s)** — took armor versus synthroid. There was also additional benefits of just feeling a much
- **[09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMEDTX3JqOs&t=573s)** — better sense of wellbeing when taking armor versus synthroid. When you take the whole gland
- **[09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMEDTX3JqOs&t=579s)** — as a unit, you're getting a very complex, it's like a whole food vitamin versus some isolated
- **[09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMEDTX3JqOs&t=586s)** — vitamin. But anyway, I wanted to introduce you to yet another possibility. If you're
- **[09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMEDTX3JqOs&t=591s)** — suffering with certain type of endocrine problems, there are glandulars that you could
- **[09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMEDTX3JqOs&t=595s)** — take that potentially could help you. And unfortunately, when you're trying to find
- **[10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMEDTX3JqOs&t=600s)** — answers in other viewpoints, other than traditional medical care, it's difficult.
- **[10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMEDTX3JqOs&t=607s)** — But sometimes you just have to understand, for example, like growth hormone, what gland
- **[10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMEDTX3JqOs&t=612s)** — produces that? That's the pituitary. What other hormones are made by the pituitary that you
- **[10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMEDTX3JqOs&t=617s)** — could support so you're not necessarily taking a specific hormone. You can just take the
- **[10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMEDTX3JqOs&t=624s)** — extract to support the whole thing. You can even get like the hypothalamus as an extract.
- **[10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMEDTX3JqOs&t=631s)** — And since we're on the topic, that's not necessarily glandular tissue, but there's also
- **[10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMEDTX3JqOs&t=636s)** — other organs and tissues that can benefit you. For example, like liver, there's probably no
- **[10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMEDTX3JqOs&t=642s)** — other nutrient dense organ than the liver with iron and B12 and vitamin A. But you also have
- **[10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMEDTX3JqOs&t=650s)** — glean that can help the immune system and the thymus gland, which is a gland, but that would
- **[10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMEDTX3JqOs&t=655s)** — be something to take for the immune system. And then you even have something like the trachea
- **[11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMEDTX3JqOs&t=660s)** — tissue, right? Which is apparently really good for joint issues or connective tissue or
- **[11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMEDTX3JqOs&t=664s)** — cartilage. I've seen some good results myself. Now, since we're on the topic of the endocrine
- **[11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMEDTX3JqOs&t=669s)** — system, I think the next thing to watch would be my video on what to eat to support
- **[11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMEDTX3JqOs&t=676s)** — your endocrine system. I put that right here. Check it out.

- **[00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=89jJ1JlNZlg&t=0s)** — There is one very important nutrient that prevents a lot of health problems.
- **[00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=89jJ1JlNZlg&t=5s)** — Vitamin K2. If you have calcium in your arteries, Vitamin K2's job is to remove it.
- **[00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=89jJ1JlNZlg&t=11s)** — But you have other soft tissues as well. So this is the hip joint. Vitamin K2 tells the joints
- **[00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=89jJ1JlNZlg&t=16s)** — to release the soft tissue, whether it's arthritis, calcium deposits. It tells it to be released
- **[00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=89jJ1JlNZlg&t=23s)** — into the blood. The other function of Vitamin K2 is to make sure calcium goes from that blood
- **[00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=89jJ1JlNZlg&t=28s)** — into the bone. And it binds very tightly to your bones and your teeth. So when you don't have enough
- **[00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=89jJ1JlNZlg&t=35s)** — of this Vitamin K2, you get a lot of soft tissue calcification. And you also get a lot of bone
- **[00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=89jJ1JlNZlg&t=40s)** — corrosion like osteoporosis as well as cavities. And the reason why we have Vitamin K2 is
- **[00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=89jJ1JlNZlg&t=46s)** — because it's very, very dangerous to have too much calcium in the soft tissues. We're supposed
- **[00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=89jJ1JlNZlg&t=51s)** — to have it directed into the bone and your teeth, but it's not normal to have it in
- **[00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=89jJ1JlNZlg&t=55s)** — So our body has this whole mechanism of keeping it in the right place. And so the question is,
- **[01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=89jJ1JlNZlg&t=61s)** — where does Vitamin K2 come from? It can either come from our foods or it can be
- **[01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=89jJ1JlNZlg&t=66s)** — converted by certain microbes in our gut from another vitamin called Vitamin K1. And Vitamin
- **[01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=89jJ1JlNZlg&t=71s)** — K1 comes from leafy greens. And so of course, if you're not eating a lot of leafy greens,
- **[01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=89jJ1JlNZlg&t=75s)** — you're probably not getting enough K1. So the next question is, what type of foods are very
- **[01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=89jJ1JlNZlg&t=80s)** — Vitamin K2? One is called natto. That's fermented soybeans. This is something they consume in
- **[01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=89jJ1JlNZlg&t=87s)** — Japan, maybe areas of China. Natto has the most Vitamin K2. A lot of people take it if they
- **[01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=89jJ1JlNZlg&t=92s)** — have a heart problem and they're at risk for a stroke. And what's interesting is that here we
- **[01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=89jJ1JlNZlg&t=97s)** — have this natto. It's very high in K2, but it also seems to counter the effects of Vitamin
- **[01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=89jJ1JlNZlg&t=103s)** — K1. The next highest food with Vitamin K2 is goose liver. It's also high in chicken liver,
- **[01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=89jJ1JlNZlg&t=109s)** — beef liver. I cannot consume liver. I do have cod liver, but other types of liver I can't consume
- **[01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=89jJ1JlNZlg&t=115s)** — because I just don't like it. Next food it's in, eel. When's the last time you had some eel?
- **[02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=89jJ1JlNZlg&t=121s)** — Probably never. So those are the foods that have the most Vitamin K2. Okay, there's a lot
- **[02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=89jJ1JlNZlg&t=126s)** — of other ones I'm going to get to. But what's interesting about this is that a lot of people
- **[02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=89jJ1JlNZlg&t=130s)** — are deficient in Vitamin K2 because they don't eat certain foods that are high in K2. However,
- **[02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=89jJ1JlNZlg&t=137s)** — you may have eaten these foods which do have some Vitamin K2. Butter, cheese, primarily from
- **[02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=89jJ1JlNZlg&t=143s)** — grass-fed animals, salami. There's a small amount in pork chops, and there's also some
- **[02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=89jJ1JlNZlg&t=148s)** — in fermented vegetables as in raw sauerkraut. Now what's really ironic is that here we have
- **[02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=89jJ1JlNZlg&t=153s)** — this vitamin that has the potential to keep our arteries completely clean of calcium. Yet
- **[02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=89jJ1JlNZlg&t=158s)** — it's in the fatty foods, which we've been told to stay away from. So it's really ironic
- **[02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=89jJ1JlNZlg&t=163s)** — we're told not to consume the very food that has the antidote to a really big problem that
- **[02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=89jJ1JlNZlg&t=169s)** — people have. Also as a side note, Vitamin K2 is a fat soluble vitamin. If you don't have a
- **[02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=89jJ1JlNZlg&t=174s)** — gallbladder, if you have a bad liver, you might not have the bile to help you absorb
- **[02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=89jJ1JlNZlg&t=179s)** — Vitamin K2. Now, I mentioned another way to get Vitamin K2 from K1, but only if you have
- **[03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=89jJ1JlNZlg&t=186s)** — the microbes that are needed to make that conversion. There's a microbe called B. subtilis.
- **[03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=89jJ1JlNZlg&t=191s)** — This is the main microbe that helps you convert K1 to K2. Unfortunately, this microbe is very
- **[03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=89jJ1JlNZlg&t=198s)** — easily destroyed when you consume broad spectrum antibiotics. Only like 30% of the population
- **[03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=89jJ1JlNZlg&t=205s)** — have this microbe in their gut. And so if you don't have the microbe and you're not eating
- **[03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=89jJ1JlNZlg&t=209s)** — the foods with Vitamin K2, you're more at risk for developing this calcification in your
- **[03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=89jJ1JlNZlg&t=214s)** — soft tissues. But you need to know there are certain things that really destroy the gut's
- **[03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=89jJ1JlNZlg&t=220s)** — to make Vitamin K2. That's antibiotics, steroids, as in prednisone, PPIs or antacids,
- **[03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=89jJ1JlNZlg&t=229s)** — consuming GMO foods because the glyphosate acts as an antibiotic, alcohol, junk food, eating a
- **[03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=89jJ1JlNZlg&t=236s)** — lot of sugar, blood thinners, liver disease, and also being on a low-fat diet. As I said
- **[04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=89jJ1JlNZlg&t=242s)** — before, Vitamin K2 is in fatty foods. Now, one of the toxic effects of way, way too much
- **[04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=89jJ1JlNZlg&t=248s)** — Vitamin D is too much calcium in the arteries. The toxicity effect from Vitamin D causing too
- **[04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=89jJ1JlNZlg&t=255s)** — much calcium in the blood is so rare, you'd have to take hundreds of thousands of Vitamin D3
- **[04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=89jJ1JlNZlg&t=261s)** — for months for that to occur. But guess what? Vitamin K2 can come to the rescue and help
- **[04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=89jJ1JlNZlg&t=267s)** — keep that calcium on the low side. Vitamin K2 is dependent on another nutrient. And this
- **[04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=89jJ1JlNZlg&t=276s)** — won't work. So think about this. If you have kidney stones or arthritis or you have calcium
- **[04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=89jJ1JlNZlg&t=285s)** — in your arteries and you're even taking Vitamin K2, but it's not working, it could be you're
- **[04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=89jJ1JlNZlg&t=290s)** — just low in magnesium. And a lot of people are low in magnesium. And it's very difficult
- **[04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=89jJ1JlNZlg&t=295s)** — to test for it because most of the magnesium is inside the cell, not inside your blood. Only
- **[05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=89jJ1JlNZlg&t=300s)** — 1% is in your blood. So unless you do a biopsy or some sophisticated test, you're not
- **[05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=89jJ1JlNZlg&t=304s)** — going to be able to determine your true levels. So when we're talking about calcium being in
- **[05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=89jJ1JlNZlg&t=309s)** — the wrong place, whether it's in the soft tissue or wherever, magnesium and Vitamin K2 together
- **[05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=89jJ1JlNZlg&t=315s)** — are a great combo solution to solve those problems. If you're taking Vitamin K2,
- **[05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=89jJ1JlNZlg&t=320s)** — you have to realize there's two different kinds. There's the form that's called the MK4.
- **[05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=89jJ1JlNZlg&t=325s)** — And then you also have MK7. It's natural, whereas the MK4 is made synthetically. I usually
- **[05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=89jJ1JlNZlg&t=331s)** — recommend using the MK7 version. I would also recommend taking 100 micrograms for every 10,000
- **[05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=89jJ1JlNZlg&t=340s)** — I use of Vitamin D3. That would be the ratio. So if you're doing 20,000 I use of Vitamin D3,
- **[05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=89jJ1JlNZlg&t=346s)** — you would take 200 micrograms of Vitamin K2, the MK7 form. So I really wanted to put this
- **[05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=89jJ1JlNZlg&t=352s)** — Vitamin K2 on your radar, in your awareness, so you can make sure that you consume the foods
- **[05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=89jJ1JlNZlg&t=359s)** — high in Vitamin K2. And because Vitamin K2 is usually associated with Vitamin D,
- **[06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=89jJ1JlNZlg&t=363s)** — if you haven't seen this video, you should check it out. I put it up right here.

- **[00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YyMY7_T094&t=0s)** — Today I'm going to talk about the hidden source of anemia, both B12 and iron anemia,
- **[00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YyMY7_T094&t=6s)** — that you probably have never heard before. And this involves a microbe called H. pylori.
- **[00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YyMY7_T094&t=14s)** — And H. pylori is a fascinating bacteria that the majority of the population have already in their
- **[00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YyMY7_T094&t=21s)** — stomach. And when the timing in the environment is just right, it can come out of remission
- **[00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YyMY7_T094&t=25s)** — and create all sorts of problems, primarily with gastritis, inflammation of the stomach,
- **[00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YyMY7_T094&t=32s)** — ulcers, as well as atrophy of your stomach. So the stomach starts shrinking. Out of all the
- **[00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YyMY7_T094&t=39s)** — places to exist, why would you want to live in an acid stomach? Right? And also it actually
- **[00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YyMY7_T094&t=44s)** — eats iron, right? That's one of the things it eats. Now, typically what causes this microbe to
- **[00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YyMY7_T094&t=50s)** — out of remission and create problems is when the stomach pH loses the acidity. Okay? So the more
- **[01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YyMY7_T094&t=60s)** — alkaline your stomach becomes, the more that that microbe can survive and potentially come
- **[01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YyMY7_T094&t=64s)** — out of remission. And when the pH becomes more alkaline, as well as in individuals that are
- **[01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YyMY7_T094&t=71s)** — susceptible, like their immune system is weaker. As a survival mechanism, it also has
- **[01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YyMY7_T094&t=77s)** — an enzyme called urease, which basically causes the breakdown of urea. And then that turns into
- **[01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YyMY7_T094&t=84s)** — ammonia. Now this is a survival mechanism because ammonia is that it's extremely alkaline. It has
- **[01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YyMY7_T094&t=91s)** — a pH of like 11. I mean, think about this. We have the stomach, which has a pH between 1.5 to
- **[01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YyMY7_T094&t=95s)** — 3, which is like battery acid. So you have a pH of 11 for ammonia. It's super alkaline. And
- **[01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YyMY7_T094&t=105s)** — there's also another component, molecular mimicry. Okay. What is that? That is another survival
- **[01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YyMY7_T094&t=111s)** — mechanism where that microbe can mimic your own stomach cells. And so it's trying to go
- **[01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YyMY7_T094&t=119s)** — underneath the radar. And for the most part, your immune system is tricked by that, but
- **[02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YyMY7_T094&t=124s)** — not a hundred percent. A lot of times there's an immune reaction. Okay. And then what that
- **[02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YyMY7_T094&t=129s)** — immune reaction does is it starts attacking your own stomach cells, as well as something
- **[02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YyMY7_T094&t=134s)** — called the intrinsic factor. And both of those situations lead you to a very severe B12 deficiency.
- **[02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YyMY7_T094&t=143s)** — And then when the stomach atrophies because of this microbe, now you're going to get what's
- **[02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YyMY7_T094&t=148s)** — called pernicious anemia, which is a B12 condition. In the first phase, when you have
- **[02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YyMY7_T094&t=152s)** — gastritis, you have a lot of inflammation and you have a lot more acid. And that quickly
- **[02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YyMY7_T094&t=158s)** — decreases as there's more and more damage to the stomach. And you start having atrophy and
- **[02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YyMY7_T094&t=163s)** — you lose the function of these little gastric cells. And then the stomach becomes more alkaline.
- **[02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YyMY7_T094&t=169s)** — So you start off being too acid and then it goes over here to alkaline. Okay. And that's
- **[02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YyMY7_T094&t=175s)** — just a survival mechanism. And when your stomach is not alkaline, now we lose the ability
- **[03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YyMY7_T094&t=180s)** — to absorb iron. We can't activate iron that's inactive to the active form. We can't absorb
- **[03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YyMY7_T094&t=186s)** — iron. So now we become iron deficient. So we have both an iron deficiency and the B12
- **[03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YyMY7_T094&t=192s)** — deficiency. Not a good situation. So here you are taking all this iron, taking all this B12
- **[03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YyMY7_T094&t=198s)** — and wondering why it's not working. You're trying to fix this thing, but there's something
- **[03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YyMY7_T094&t=202s)** — else going on completely underneath it. And of course, once you're diagnosed with H.
- **[03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YyMY7_T094&t=207s)** — parlori, the treatment is at least two months of antibiotics. Okay. Usually multiple antibiotics.
- **[03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YyMY7_T094&t=215s)** — And the real unfortunate problem with that is that a lot of people end up with antibiotic
- **[03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YyMY7_T094&t=221s)** — resistance to this H. pylori microbe. So now the antibiotics won't work anymore.
- **[03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YyMY7_T094&t=228s)** — Okay. Because the microbes quickly counter that mechanism. So here you are two months of therapy.
- **[03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YyMY7_T094&t=234s)** — Right. You have all these side effects of the condition, as well as all the side effects
- **[03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YyMY7_T094&t=238s)** — from the antibiotic in your gut and other places. This is why the treatment for H. pylori
- **[04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YyMY7_T094&t=245s)** — with antibiotics is not very successful long-term because they're not looking down the road of
- **[04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YyMY7_T094&t=251s)** — what's really happening. They're thinking that this microbe is the problem. And so they just need
- **[04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YyMY7_T094&t=255s)** — to wipe it out and then the problem is solved. When in fact, it's just the tip of the iceberg.
- **[04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YyMY7_T094&t=259s)** — There's a lot more to do with the pH of your stomach, the strength of your immune system,
- **[04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YyMY7_T094&t=263s)** — which now you just weaken because of the antibiotics. Now we still have gastritis.
- **[04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YyMY7_T094&t=268s)** — We might have ulcers and we have atrophy of the stomach. We also now can't protect ourselves
- **[04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YyMY7_T094&t=274s)** — against microbes that are coming in from our food. So now we have an increased tendency to
- **[04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YyMY7_T094&t=278s)** — get infections to the body, viruses, bacteria, fungal, you name it. We also can't absorb
- **[04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YyMY7_T094&t=284s)** — minerals too well. We also can't break down protein too well. So you can see this problem
- **[04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YyMY7_T094&t=288s)** — goes from bad to worse. What can we do about this? I would recommend taking something that is
- **[04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YyMY7_T094&t=294s)** — more of a natural antibiotic that is not as potent. You have to take it longer, but there's
- **[05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YyMY7_T094&t=302s)** — minimal side effects. One of the best things they've researched on this is sulfurophane,
- **[05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YyMY7_T094&t=309s)** — which is interesting because it's not really a plant. It's a chemical in a plant. It's
- **[05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YyMY7_T094&t=313s)** — in broccoli sprouts, sauerkraut. It's in the cruciferous vegetables. So sulfurophane is a
- **[05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YyMY7_T094&t=318s)** — compound, is a potent antimicrobial. And the extra cool thing about this is this,
- **[05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YyMY7_T094&t=323s)** — it can work against antibiotic resistant microorganisms and infections. So if you have
- **[05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YyMY7_T094&t=330s)** — this antibiotic resistant microbe, well, sulfurophane can actually still work on that,
- **[05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YyMY7_T094&t=335s)** — whereas an antibiotic won't work on that. So we're taking a natural remedy, not as potent,
- **[05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YyMY7_T094&t=342s)** — but we're taking longer to make sure that we do this without the side effects. So that's
- **[05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YyMY7_T094&t=348s)** — step one. You may also want to add another natural antibiotic called wormwood, okay? Wormwood
- **[05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YyMY7_T094&t=355s)** — extract. And you don't have to take much. You just take a small amount over a long period
- **[05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YyMY7_T094&t=359s)** — of time. And I'm talking about three to four months. Now you can get your sulfurophane from a
- **[06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YyMY7_T094&t=364s)** — supplement, or I would recommend, better yet, get it from microgreens or sprouts, broccoli sprouts
- **[06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YyMY7_T094&t=371s)** — or broccoli microgreens, right? And have a little bit of that every day in your salad.
- **[06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YyMY7_T094&t=377s)** — That's what I would recommend. The next thing I'm going to recommend as a solution is zinc.
- **[06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YyMY7_T094&t=382s)** — There's many different forms of zinc you can take, but it's more important to just get zinc
- **[06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YyMY7_T094&t=386s)** — than to focus on what type of form of zinc. But zinc can be very effective against ulcers,
- **[06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YyMY7_T094&t=394s)** — gastritis, as well as healing the stomach and helping you build up your hydrochloric acid.
- **[06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YyMY7_T094&t=399s)** — And so once the gastritis has settled down and the ulcer is healed, then we want to
- **[06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YyMY7_T094&t=404s)** — add betaine hydrochloride or apple cider vinegar to your stomach, but not until
- **[06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YyMY7_T094&t=408s)** — the ulcer is gone and the inflammation is gone. The other thing that you want to do that
- **[06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YyMY7_T094&t=414s)** — can greatly help put things back in the balance is to either take a really good probiotic,
- **[07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YyMY7_T094&t=421s)** — or better yet, start consuming a little sauerkraut or even some pickles. There are
- **[07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YyMY7_T094&t=426s)** — certain microbes in sauerkraut and pickles that are very beneficial to help counter
- **[07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YyMY7_T094&t=432s)** — this H. pylori. Because remember, we have the good bacteria and the bad bacteria, right?
- **[07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YyMY7_T094&t=436s)** — So we want to increase the good from this probiotic or the sauerkraut and help counter
- **[07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YyMY7_T094&t=440s)** — the situation. And plus sauerkraut also has sulfurophane and it's really good for the digestion
- **[07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YyMY7_T094&t=447s)** — if someone has gastritis or for that matter, any digestive issues. All right, so now that you know
- **[07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YyMY7_T094&t=453s)** — this other source of anemia, which is very valuable if you have anemia, it's probably
- **[07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YyMY7_T094&t=458s)** — important to show you the other causes of anemia. Okay, and I put that up right here. Check

- **[00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ykPs8tberw&t=0s)** — So there's this hidden source of heart attacks that rarely does anyone know about. And this is a book by Thomas Levy, MD.
- **[00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ykPs8tberw&t=11s)** — And so I'll put the link down below, but it was actually quite fascinating because I have personal experience with what I'm going to talk about.
- **[00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ykPs8tberw&t=18s)** — Let me first jump to the smoking gun, okay? I'm going to tell you what he states in his book.
- **[00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ykPs8tberw&t=24s)** — In 78% of 101 patients with myocardial infarctions, that's heart attacks, and occluded coronary arteries,
- **[00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ykPs8tberw&t=36s)** — they found DNA of pathogens typical for infections in root canal treated teeth. Now this is pretty wild.
- **[00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ykPs8tberw&t=46s)** — I've talked about this briefly in another video, but the big question is what are these pathogenic biofilm microorganisms
- **[00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ykPs8tberw&t=53s)** — doing in your heart? How do they get there? And what's the relationship to your teeth? Now they also found
- **[01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ykPs8tberw&t=61s)** — these microbes also in the clots in certain stroke victims too. Just a quick story. I went to the dentist
- **[01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ykPs8tberw&t=70s)** — a while ago, and they're just doing a routine checkup and he had this really cool...
- **[01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ykPs8tberw&t=76s)** — so I think it was called a 3D cone beam imaging system where they basically can scan all the
- **[01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ykPs8tberw&t=82s)** — teeth and look deep inside for potential cavitations or like infections underneath the teeth. Now
- **[01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ykPs8tberw&t=88s)** — I was also an x-ray tech before I was a chiropractor, so I was interested in to see
- **[01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ykPs8tberw&t=93s)** — what was going on. And so when I was looking at my teeth, I noticed there was this like
- **[01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ykPs8tberw&t=97s)** — huge dark little circle around one of my tooth roots. Of course he looked at it and said
- **[01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ykPs8tberw&t=103s)** — yeah, you have a you have an infection going on in your tooth. Now I had no symptoms whatsoever.
- **[01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ykPs8tberw&t=108s)** — So basically this infection, which is an abscess underneath a tooth, was eating away my bone. And
- **[01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ykPs8tberw&t=115s)** — so based on this book, it's the chronic long-term infection that can become a problem for people,
- **[02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ykPs8tberw&t=121s)** — not just for heart problems, but for arthritis and many other issues. Apparently it's quite
- **[02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ykPs8tberw&t=127s)** — common. If you look up the condition's name, it's called chronic apical periodontitis that
- **[02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ykPs8tberw&t=134s)** — many times doesn't have any symptoms. So basically as you're chewing in things, you're
- **[02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ykPs8tberw&t=138s)** — pushing this bacteria deeper into the lymphatic system in your jaw and throughout the body. And
- **[02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ykPs8tberw&t=144s)** — Dr. Levy points out some really interesting data. There's basically between 15 and 25 million
- **[02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ykPs8tberw&t=150s)** — people a year that get root canals. Okay. And his theory is that the root canal is where the
- **[02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ykPs8tberw&t=158s)** — problem is because when they do a root canal, they go in there, they take out some of the
- **[02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ykPs8tberw&t=162s)** — and they try to sterilize it and then they seal it. The problem is they also at the same time
- **[02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ykPs8tberw&t=169s)** — take out a lot of the tubules. You have like one or two miles of these small little tubes.
- **[02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ykPs8tberw&t=175s)** — And so as you scrape away this, you take away the immune system as well. So here we have
- **[03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ykPs8tberw&t=180s)** — this potential for pathogens to create problems because it's nearly impossible to get rid of all
- **[03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ykPs8tberw&t=187s)** — the pathogens when they do this procedure. And so there's a high incidence of people with a
- **[03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ykPs8tberw&t=192s)** — mental abscesses and chronic inflammation of the root of the tooth or the gums and people who have
- **[03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ykPs8tberw&t=199s)** — heart attacks, which is actually very, very interesting. And many times this is missed on
- **[03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ykPs8tberw&t=204s)** — routine dental x-rays. One way that some people might pick it up is through a blood
- **[03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ykPs8tberw&t=209s)** — test looking at the C-reactive protein, which is just like a biomarker of inflammation.
- **[03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ykPs8tberw&t=213s)** — This infection could be in the tooth, it could be in the gums, it could be deeper into
- **[03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ykPs8tberw&t=217s)** — jaw, and it can even be in the tonsils. It's the chronic exposure to these pathogens that create
- **[03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ykPs8tberw&t=224s)** — the problem, especially if your immune system is not strong enough to counter it because these
- **[03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ykPs8tberw&t=230s)** — pathogens are creating a lot of what's called oxidative stress. Okay, now oxidative stress is
- **[03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ykPs8tberw&t=237s)** — basically a situation where you have a lot of free radical damage, but we don't have enough
- **[04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ykPs8tberw&t=242s)** — oxidant reserve to counter that situation. I mean, think about how dirty the mouth is.
- **[04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ykPs8tberw&t=248s)** — You have over 500 different strains of bacteria, viruses and fungus growing in your mouth. And
- **[04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ykPs8tberw&t=256s)** — then you also have this byproduct of the microbe, which is toxins that can then create
- **[04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ykPs8tberw&t=264s)** — more immune reaction, more inflammation in different parts of your body. Apparently,
- **[04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ykPs8tberw&t=270s)** — one of the ways the body reacts to this situation is by developing clots. And so over time,
- **[04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ykPs8tberw&t=277s)** — when this becomes more chronic, a person is going to generally feel fatigue, chronic
- **[04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ykPs8tberw&t=282s)** — inflammation, jaw problems and sensitivity of the teeth. In my situation, I did notice
- **[04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ykPs8tberw&t=288s)** — when he removed the tooth, I immediately noticed my inflammation in my upper back and neck just
- **[04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ykPs8tberw&t=295s)** — disappeared. So that was fascinating. But if I didn't get that x-ray and see that cavitation,
- **[05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ykPs8tberw&t=301s)** — I never would have guessed that would be the cause. But basically we're dealing with a leaky
- **[05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ykPs8tberw&t=308s)** — bacterial overload situation that causes a compromise to your immune system. But let's
- **[05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ykPs8tberw&t=314s)** — just say, for example, someone has this infection and they feel a little tired,
- **[05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ykPs8tberw&t=319s)** — but they don't really know if it's coming from this area or not. You feel like your
- **[05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ykPs8tberw&t=323s)** — immune system is compromised and you are wondering if you have this oxidative stress
- **[05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ykPs8tberw&t=328s)** — overload situation. What you could do is just take one or two grams of liposomal vitamin C.
- **[05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ykPs8tberw&t=338s)** — It's not the vitamin C complex to fulfill a vitamin C deficiency. We're primarily using it
- **[05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ykPs8tberw&t=344s)** — as an antioxidant to lower the oxidative stress. And what's unique about this specific
- **[05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ykPs8tberw&t=350s)** — type of vitamin C is that it's one of the only ones that can go intracellular. I'd recommend
- **[05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ykPs8tberw&t=356s)** — taking maybe 500 milligrams several times a day. And this is because vitamin C is water
- **[06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ykPs8tberw&t=362s)** — soluble, so we just want to keep it flowing through your body. And the last point about
- **[06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ykPs8tberw&t=365s)** — this type of vitamin C is that it won't create diarrhea when you're taking large amounts like
- **[06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ykPs8tberw&t=371s)** — other types of ascorbic acid. But that would at least change the ratio of this antioxidant to
- **[06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ykPs8tberw&t=376s)** — the stress level to see if that might help you. And if it does and you feel a little bit better
- **[06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ykPs8tberw&t=382s)** — and you feel like your symptoms might improve, then you can start to dive deeper into why you
- **[06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ykPs8tberw&t=389s)** — might have this problem. Is it related to diet? Is it related to not sleeping? Is it related
- **[06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ykPs8tberw&t=393s)** — to over exercising? Is it related to a potential tooth infection? But this is just a
- **[06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ykPs8tberw&t=399s)** — short overview of this topic. I would highly recommend getting this book. It's filled with a
- **[06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ykPs8tberw&t=404s)** — lot more data. It's actually quite fascinating. So I'll put the link down below. And also, if you
- **[06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ykPs8tberw&t=410s)** — haven't seen my other video on atherosclerosis and this biofilm mechanism, I put that video

- **[00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p9LrMx1LmCw&t=8s)** — Wow, that's fascinating. This is mostly ignored or neglected by doctors when they're dealing with heart conditions.
- **[00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p9LrMx1LmCw&t=18s)** — My grandfather died of a heart problem in his 50s. My father developed atrial fibrillation.
- **[00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p9LrMx1LmCw&t=23s)** — Then he had an ablation where they destroyed the pacemaker of the heart. And now he's on permanent medication.
- **[00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p9LrMx1LmCw&t=28s)** — So because heart problems run in my family, I wanted to know everything there is to know about heart problems so I can then prevent it myself.
- **[00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p9LrMx1LmCw&t=35s)** — And of course share it with other people. There are four really common heart problems out there.
- **[00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p9LrMx1LmCw&t=40s)** — Number one, plaqueing. Where you get this inflammation, the body comes as a band-aid, starts forming calcium and cholesterol deposits.
- **[00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p9LrMx1LmCw&t=48s)** — The artery becomes obstructed, you no longer get oxygen to the heart muscle. Your heart muscle cramps. You get sangina, which is a lack of oxygen, and then you get a heart attack.
- **[00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p9LrMx1LmCw&t=56s)** — Number two is blood clots. This is different because now you're getting a blood clot that gets lodged in the heart, obstructing the artery, which you then also get a lack of oxygen, and you can potentially get a heart attack.
- **[01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p9LrMx1LmCw&t=67s)** — Or if it mobilizes throughout the rest of the body, it can end up in your brain, you can end up getting a stroke.
- **[01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p9LrMx1LmCw&t=72s)** — Number three, we can get atrial fibrillation. And so in this condition you get pooling in certain parts of the heart or the vascular system.
- **[01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p9LrMx1LmCw&t=79s)** — And then you can get a clot that develops and that can turn into a heart attack.
- **[01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p9LrMx1LmCw&t=84s)** — And then number four, you have hypertension, high blood pressure. In this situation you have this high level of pressure that can make the arteries very stiff, harden.
- **[01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p9LrMx1LmCw&t=94s)** — And if you have chronic hypertension that really destroys the kidney as well because the kidneys cannot tolerate that much pressure for a long period of time.
- **[01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p9LrMx1LmCw&t=101s)** — Now, what's fascinating is all four of these problems involve this one common thing, a magnesium deficiency.
- **[01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p9LrMx1LmCw&t=110s)** — Now, the very interesting thing about a magnesium deficiency is that it's almost impossible to test.
- **[01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p9LrMx1LmCw&t=116s)** — When you check the magnesium in your blood, you're only looking at 1% of your body's magnesium.
- **[02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p9LrMx1LmCw&t=121s)** — The great majority of magnesium, 99%, is inside the cells, not in your blood.
- **[02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p9LrMx1LmCw&t=127s)** — This is why a magnesium blood test is not a reliable way to know if you have magnesium or not.
- **[02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p9LrMx1LmCw&t=131s)** — Now, if we just take a step back and look at some of the common medications for the heart and how they work and the mechanisms,
- **[02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p9LrMx1LmCw&t=139s)** — they directly relate to magnesium. So let's start with the medications called the calcium channel blockers.
- **[02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p9LrMx1LmCw&t=146s)** — Okay, these calcium channel blockers. Now, what are those? Well, they block calcium.
- **[02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p9LrMx1LmCw&t=149s)** — Now, why would you want to take a medication that blocks calcium? Too much calcium in the wrong place can cause too much contraction.
- **[02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p9LrMx1LmCw&t=156s)** — So it's the calcium that causes the contraction and the magnesium that causes the relaxation.
- **[02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p9LrMx1LmCw&t=161s)** — So magnesium is a natural calcium channel blocker without the side effects that some of these drugs create.
- **[02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p9LrMx1LmCw&t=169s)** — What a lot of doctors don't know is that magnesium regulates calcium.
- **[02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p9LrMx1LmCw&t=174s)** — Any condition you have where there's too much calcium, think magnesium.
- **[02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p9LrMx1LmCw&t=178s)** — I mean, even in other symptoms, if you have this like little tetany or twitching, that's too much calcium because I don't have enough magnesium.
- **[03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p9LrMx1LmCw&t=184s)** — All right, let's look at another type of medication, beta blockers.
- **[03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p9LrMx1LmCw&t=187s)** — Beta blockers block adrenaline relaxing the arteries, allowing more blood flow to the heart muscle.
- **[03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p9LrMx1LmCw&t=193s)** — And they also use them for heart rhythm problems as well.
- **[03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p9LrMx1LmCw&t=196s)** — Well, did you know that magnesium naturally lowers adrenaline and cortisol?
- **[03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p9LrMx1LmCw&t=201s)** — This is why so many people take magnesium before they go to bed so they can sleep and they can feel relaxed.
- **[03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p9LrMx1LmCw&t=207s)** — Number three, warfarin. This is the medication that my father's on because he had atrial fib.
- **[03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p9LrMx1LmCw&t=211s)** — And then they put a pacemaker. They want to make sure that there's no extra clotting going on.
- **[03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p9LrMx1LmCw&t=216s)** — So he cannot have any foods with high vitamin K1 because that creates clotting and they're trying to keep his blood thin.
- **[03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p9LrMx1LmCw&t=222s)** — Now, what's interesting about this whole clotting mechanism is that calcium is involved in clotting.
- **[03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p9LrMx1LmCw&t=229s)** — And so, like I said before, magnesium helps control the excess calcium.
- **[03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p9LrMx1LmCw&t=235s)** — And number four, you have a lot of different medications to help lower blood pressure.
- **[03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p9LrMx1LmCw&t=239s)** — The arteries have a layer of muscle and magnesium is a natural vasodilator.
- **[04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p9LrMx1LmCw&t=245s)** — This is why magnesium helps people with high blood pressure.
- **[04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p9LrMx1LmCw&t=248s)** — Why don't more doctors use magnesium when treating the heart?
- **[04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p9LrMx1LmCw&t=252s)** — Well, number one, it's almost impossible to test. Number two, they're not taught nutrition in school.
- **[04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p9LrMx1LmCw&t=256s)** — They get like 12 to 24 hours of nutrition training in an entire medical school.
- **[04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p9LrMx1LmCw&t=261s)** — And the other really interesting thing is a lot of this research on magnesium is mixed as far as what it can do for the heart.
- **[04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p9LrMx1LmCw&t=269s)** — A lot of the studies are done with a type of magnesium that you only absorb three to four percent of the magnesium.
- **[04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p9LrMx1LmCw&t=276s)** — They're using magnesium oxide.
- **[04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p9LrMx1LmCw&t=278s)** — So if you're taking like, I don't know, 400 milligrams and you're only absorbing three to four percent, are you really going to see any results?
- **[04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p9LrMx1LmCw&t=285s)** — Chances are no. Versus another type of magnesium is magnesium glycinate, where you absorb 80 percent.
- **[04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p9LrMx1LmCw&t=292s)** — And that's going to reduce greatly your chance of getting a kidney stone.
- **[04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p9LrMx1LmCw&t=295s)** — Now, I personally had a kidney stone. It was so severe.
- **[05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p9LrMx1LmCw&t=300s)** — I told my wife, finally understand the pain of what you went through giving birth.
- **[05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p9LrMx1LmCw&t=304s)** — She strongly objected to that. She said, you have no idea what it's like to be pregnant.
- **[05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p9LrMx1LmCw&t=309s)** — I agreed. And I was magnesium deficient at that time.
- **[05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p9LrMx1LmCw&t=313s)** — I wish I would have known about magnesium because that is the ultimate antidote.
- **[05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p9LrMx1LmCw&t=316s)** — Now, what about the calcium building up in your arteries? Right.
- **[05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p9LrMx1LmCw&t=320s)** — Have you ever heard of the coronary artery calcification test?
- **[05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p9LrMx1LmCw&t=324s)** — It's a good test to do to be able to see how much calcium you have in your arteries.
- **[05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p9LrMx1LmCw&t=328s)** — It's relatively inexpensive and it's a great predictor of mortality.
- **[05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p9LrMx1LmCw&t=333s)** — Now, in other videos, I talk about another vitamin involved with keeping calcium out of the arteries.
- **[05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p9LrMx1LmCw&t=338s)** — And that would be vitamin K2. Vitamin K2 is dependent on magnesium to work.
- **[05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p9LrMx1LmCw&t=345s)** — Now, I want to shift to something very interesting about a heart attack.
- **[05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p9LrMx1LmCw&t=349s)** — When someone has a heart attack and the oxygen that supplies the heart muscle is diminished or cut off, that's called ischemia.
- **[05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p9LrMx1LmCw&t=355s)** — You then get a precipitation of calcium crystals.
- **[05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p9LrMx1LmCw&t=359s)** — Now, when you think precipitation, you probably think it's raining from the clouds, right?
- **[06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p9LrMx1LmCw&t=363s)** — Well, just think about calcium crystals coming out of something that are going right into the heart muscle itself.
- **[06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p9LrMx1LmCw&t=369s)** — These crystals, which can be seen here, gather within the mitochondria.
- **[06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p9LrMx1LmCw&t=373s)** — The mitochondria generates energy by using oxygen.
- **[06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p9LrMx1LmCw&t=377s)** — These crystals cause irreversible damage to the heart tissue itself.
- **[06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p9LrMx1LmCw&t=381s)** — Here we see large calcium crystals visible by the naked eye grown in a petri dish.
- **[06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p9LrMx1LmCw&t=386s)** — These crystals have the same general shape as the ones that can be seen microscopically within the tiny structures of the mitochondria of patients who suffered a heart attack when the oxygen supply to the heart muscle was diminished or cut off.
- **[06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p9LrMx1LmCw&t=401s)** — The next image shows a different outcome for patients who received magnesium prior or during a heart attack.
- **[06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p9LrMx1LmCw&t=408s)** — The administration of magnesium prior to a heart attack or even during a heart attack would prevent and protect the heart muscle from forming destructive internal crystals.
- **[07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p9LrMx1LmCw&t=421s)** — Wow, that's fascinating. I don't know if you've heard about this research that shows that when women take too much calcium, especially if they're menopausal, this also puts them at risk for heart attacks.
- **[07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p9LrMx1LmCw&t=434s)** — Now you know why. Because there's not enough magnesium to help regulate all this calcium that comes in the body.
- **[07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p9LrMx1LmCw&t=440s)** — I would be very cautious about taking too much calcium. I would actually recommend trying to get your calcium from food.
- **[07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p9LrMx1LmCw&t=446s)** — Now I talked before about magnesium relaxing muscles and calcium causing contraction, not just the arteries, not just the heart muscle itself, but in any muscle at all, including leg cramps.
- **[07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p9LrMx1LmCw&t=459s)** — Now I used to have leg cramps and foot cramps in the early morning and I always wondered why. Magnesium is on a circadian rhythm.
- **[07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p9LrMx1LmCw&t=468s)** — In other words, the lowest magnesium occurs in the early morning. So if you're going into this problem with a subclinical magnesium deficiency, so you're low, you're going to start expressing some of the magnesium symptoms.
- **[08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p9LrMx1LmCw&t=481s)** — Probably the most important function of magnesium is in what it does to energy. In other words, when you eat food, it gets digested, it goes into the cells, it goes into a specialized cell called the mitochondria.
- **[08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p9LrMx1LmCw&t=493s)** — And our mitochondria actually burn off that energy until the last step of this whole chain involves a motor which is converting the inactive energy to the active energy.
- **[08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p9LrMx1LmCw&t=504s)** — This is why when people are deficient in magnesium, they get tired, especially if they're exercising.
- **[08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p9LrMx1LmCw&t=509s)** — If you're deficient in magnesium, another problem that you'll have is migraine headaches. And just as a side note with migraines, in order to get rid of some people's migraine headaches, you have to take more than even 400 milligrams.
- **[08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p9LrMx1LmCw&t=522s)** — Then we get to another very important piece of this puzzle, and that is vitamin D3. If you don't have magnesium, vitamin D cannot work.
- **[08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p9LrMx1LmCw&t=533s)** — Let's say, for example, you're taking a lot of vitamin D without magnesium. Guess what? You're not going to see the results. So just make sure if you take vitamin D, also take magnesium, so they both work together.
- **[09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p9LrMx1LmCw&t=544s)** — I do want to mention how we become deficient in magnesium. There's a couple things. 48 to 57 percent of the population consumes less than the RDA.
- **[09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p9LrMx1LmCw&t=552s)** — If you were to get your magnesium from bananas, you'd have to have 11 cups per day. Almonds are a good source of magnesium, like five ounces would give you enough. But the problem is it has oxalates, which create another problem.
- **[09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p9LrMx1LmCw&t=564s)** — Then we have spinach is a good source of magnesium. You only need a one and a half cups. But of course, spinach also has oxalates. Dark chocolate, six ounces would give you enough magnesium. But of course, dark chocolate also has oxalates.
- **[09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p9LrMx1LmCw&t=576s)** — And then avocados. You need seven cups, right? That's that's quite a few. Fish. You need 15 ounces. Beef. You'd have to eat four pounds. Kale, four cups. The pumpkin seeds, five point six ounces. And sunflower seeds, four point five ounces.
- **[09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p9LrMx1LmCw&t=591s)** — On the flip side, there are things that can deplete your magnesium. Alcohol, it'll deplete it. Refined sugar, starches. Also, certain genetics can create a problem with your ability to absorb magnesium.
- **[10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p9LrMx1LmCw&t=603s)** — Stress, if you don't have enough stomach acid. Certain drugs, antibiotics, if you're doing whole grains, right? Out of all these things, the ultra processed foods, okay, highly refined foods, basically have virtually no nutrition at all, especially not magnesium.
- **[10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p9LrMx1LmCw&t=621s)** — And so if we're digesting all these ultra processed foods, the demand for magnesium goes way up. I mean, even little toddlers, like two and under, consume 45% of their calories as ultra processed food. Teenagers consume 67% of all of their calories ultra processed foods.
- **[10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p9LrMx1LmCw&t=640s)** — Adults consume 57% of their calories as ultra processed food calories. So you can imagine how deficient in magnesium as a population we are. And like I mentioned before, one of the reasons why the doctors are not all over this is because in the literature, in the research, there's a lot of mixed reviews with magnesium.
- **[10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p9LrMx1LmCw&t=658s)** — Well, if you really look deeper, they're using magnesium oxide. In a lot of these studies, which you're only going to absorb a tiny bit and you're not going to really see the results like you really should. Now at this point, I think it's really important to know the different types of magnesium and what they do. And for that information, you should watch this video right here.

- **[00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J9SjqPQL6WM&t=0s)** — This is going to blow you away. To be able to look inside your foods to identify the source of most
- **[00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J9SjqPQL6WM&t=7s)** — chronic health problems. So check this out. Let's start with some granola bars. Do a little scan.
- **[00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J9SjqPQL6WM&t=12s)** — Wow! 28% sugar, 15% seed oil, and 41% starch. Let's go with Cheetos. Do a little scan. Boom!
- **[00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J9SjqPQL6WM&t=21s)** — Oh, look at that! Zero sugar, but 35% seed oils and 52% starch. Let's see what's in Coca-Cola.
- **[00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J9SjqPQL6WM&t=29s)** — Do a little scan. It's all sugar. No surprises there. And of course, high fructose corn syrup
- **[00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J9SjqPQL6WM&t=35s)** — sugar. Let's try some healthy cereal. Lucky charms. Do a little scan on the barcode and
- **[00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J9SjqPQL6WM&t=40s)** — wow! 40% sugar, 40% starch. And by the way, starch is hidden sugar. Let's look at mayonnaise.
- **[00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J9SjqPQL6WM&t=49s)** — Do a little scan. Yeah, I'm not surprised. 82% seed oils. Let's check out Nature's Own
- **[00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J9SjqPQL6WM&t=56s)** — White bread. Do a little scan. 57% starch, 4% seed oils, and 6% sugar. The biggest realization
- **[01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J9SjqPQL6WM&t=64s)** — I had in this project was that the great majority of all junk food, this stuff right
- **[01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J9SjqPQL6WM&t=69s)** — here, mostly is three simple ingredients. Sugar right here. Okay, sugar. Then we have
- **[01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J9SjqPQL6WM&t=75s)** — the starches, right? But not just any starch. Highly industrial processed corn starch. And
- **[01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J9SjqPQL6WM&t=82s)** — my favorite is seed oils. These are the three ingredients. And we're not talking like really
- **[01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J9SjqPQL6WM&t=89s)** — healthy seed oils. We're talking about seed oils that are so rancid, so oxidized,
- **[01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J9SjqPQL6WM&t=94s)** — they're going to go into your cell membranes and create a lot of inflammation. And if you
- **[01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J9SjqPQL6WM&t=98s)** — were to eat this right now, this disgusting mixture, you would probably vomit. What they
- **[01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J9SjqPQL6WM&t=103s)** — had to do was they had to add artificial flavors. Then they would have to add
- **[01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J9SjqPQL6WM&t=108s)** — to it. And then they have to put some chemicals to preserve it. And then more chemicals to make
- **[01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J9SjqPQL6WM&t=113s)** — you keep eating it called MSG. And what's interesting about this slop is there's barely
- **[01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J9SjqPQL6WM&t=119s)** — any protein. And one reason they don't put protein is that protein is satisfying. But
- **[02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J9SjqPQL6WM&t=123s)** — without protein, it's going to make you want to keep eating it over and over and over again.
- **[02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J9SjqPQL6WM&t=126s)** — But to get you to buy this, we have to create incredible packaging. Look at how amazing.
- **[02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J9SjqPQL6WM&t=131s)** — Look at the colors. Look at how beautiful that is. Beautiful rainbow colors. Look at little
- **[02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J9SjqPQL6WM&t=137s)** — Wow, that looks good. I used to live on these. In order to be food, it has to be able to sustain
- **[02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J9SjqPQL6WM&t=143s)** — life. The big problem with processed foods, ultra processed foods, junk foods, is that they're
- **[02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J9SjqPQL6WM&t=147s)** — just basically dead. There's no longer any phytonutrients or vitamins or minerals. They
- **[02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J9SjqPQL6WM&t=152s)** — have to add some of those in later. And they're basically synthetic. They just put a
- **[02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J9SjqPQL6WM&t=156s)** — couple more vitamins in there because if they didn't, you would develop all sorts of diseases.
- **[02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J9SjqPQL6WM&t=160s)** — Like a vitamin B3 deficiency is called polygara, where your skin looks like leprosy. Junk food
- **[02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J9SjqPQL6WM&t=166s)** — does not fit the definition of actual food. There's another thing that I think a person needs
- **[02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J9SjqPQL6WM&t=170s)** — to put on the radar and that has to do with starches. Starch is a chain of sugar molecules.
- **[02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J9SjqPQL6WM&t=178s)** — And when you process it, heating it, grinding it, putting chemicals in it, that starch now
- **[03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J9SjqPQL6WM&t=184s)** — that has become severely altered or manipulated will act worse than sugar. In this app that you
- **[03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J9SjqPQL6WM&t=196s)** — And just to point on this heart healthy seed oils, the problem with these oils is they actually
- **[03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J9SjqPQL6WM&t=202s)** — get lodged in your membranes. It's in the organs. It's in your brain. The problem is,
- **[03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J9SjqPQL6WM&t=206s)** — is now it's going to take about a year and a half to get that out of the body.
- **[03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J9SjqPQL6WM&t=209s)** — If you were to use this app to identify these three things in your pantry and your
- **[03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J9SjqPQL6WM&t=214s)** — refrigerator and avoid them, your health benefits would be amazing. The average person
- **[03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J9SjqPQL6WM&t=219s)** — consumes over a hundred pounds of starch, refined starches in the form of modified food
- **[03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J9SjqPQL6WM&t=225s)** — starch, maltodextrin, modified corn starch. They feed this stuff to babies in infant formula.
- **[03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J9SjqPQL6WM&t=231s)** — It's in your pet food. It makes up a huge percentage, over 60% of your teenager's calories.
- **[03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J9SjqPQL6WM&t=237s)** — And when we talk about seed oils, an average person consumes 70 pounds of seed oils every
- **[04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J9SjqPQL6WM&t=243s)** — single year. Unfortunately, it's the last thing to be evaluated when you go to the doctor.
- **[04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J9SjqPQL6WM&t=248s)** — They don't look at what you are eating. It's the missing piece of the puzzle. Yes,
- **[04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J9SjqPQL6WM&t=252s)** — we have alcohol and smoking, but when you get into the quantity of sugar,
- **[04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J9SjqPQL6WM&t=256s)** — starches and seed oils, the magnitude of what that does to our bodies compared to everything
- **[04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J9SjqPQL6WM&t=260s)** — else is off the charts. Simply download this free app, start using it. Give me feedback.
- **[04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J9SjqPQL6WM&t=265s)** — Tell me how you like it. We're going to be doing phase two and phase three. We're going
- **[04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J9SjqPQL6WM&t=268s)** — to add a lot of cool things to it. There will also be a link to another page that
- **[04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J9SjqPQL6WM&t=273s)** — allow you to see the substitute foods of the junk foods. That way you can replace them.
- **[04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J9SjqPQL6WM&t=277s)** — I gave you a lot of options that you can get at any grocery store. So check this out.
- **[04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J9SjqPQL6WM&t=281s)** — The single worst advice that I think we were given is this concept of everything in moderation.
- **[04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J9SjqPQL6WM&t=287s)** — There is no one bad food. That was like the absolute worst advice because there's certain
- **[04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J9SjqPQL6WM&t=291s)** — foods that are much worse than others. We're going to help you understand the three terrible
- **[04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J9SjqPQL6WM&t=296s)** — foods that you must avoid to get healthy. I did this video with a neighbor friend named
- **[05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J9SjqPQL6WM&t=300s)** — Bill, which I did not release yet, where I went inside his house and evaluated all of his
- **[05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J9SjqPQL6WM&t=305s)** — food. We then looked at every single ingredient on each food item and I had to manually
- **[05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J9SjqPQL6WM&t=310s)** — teach him the difference between junk food and real food, which took a very long time.
- **[05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J9SjqPQL6WM&t=315s)** — I mean, memorizing every single ingredient is just overwhelming for the average person.
- **[05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J9SjqPQL6WM&t=320s)** — So I created this intuitive app that makes the process super simple. Almost like having me,

- **[05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J9SjqPQL6WM&t=330s)** — avoid. The goal with this app is to make everyone aware of the three deadly ingredients.
- **[05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J9SjqPQL6WM&t=335s)** — And to get people off industrial processed foods and get them on whole food, download the app

- **[00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kx-G6ucSsyw&t=0s)** — Today I'm going to talk about the only sugar that won't raise your blood sugar. Now I see you're
- **[00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kx-G6ucSsyw&t=6s)** — getting pretty excited about this, but before you get too excited, let me explain. Sugar is classified
- **[00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kx-G6ucSsyw&t=12s)** — in a certain way. You have something called a monosaccharide and you have disaccharides.
- **[00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kx-G6ucSsyw&t=18s)** — So let's just talk about those first. So a monosaccharide is like one individual sugar
- **[00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kx-G6ucSsyw&t=24s)** — glucose. That would be a monosaccharide. Mono meaning one, saccharide means sugar.
- **[00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kx-G6ucSsyw&t=30s)** — And you also have another monosaccharide called fructose. And if you combine these different
- **[00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kx-G6ucSsyw&t=35s)** — monosaccharides together, you have different types of sugar. For example, table sugar
- **[00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kx-G6ucSsyw&t=40s)** — is about 50% fructose and 50% glucose. And then you have honey, which is 30% fructose
- **[00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kx-G6ucSsyw&t=50s)** — and 70% glucose. Then you have other sugars like lactose. That's like milk sugar. That would be
- **[00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kx-G6ucSsyw&t=57s)** — glucose plus another type of monosaccharide called galactose. And then you have something
- **[01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kx-G6ucSsyw&t=63s)** — called high fructose corn syrup because it's a combination of glucose and fructose. It could
- **[01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kx-G6ucSsyw&t=68s)** — range anywhere between 55 to 90% fructose. And then you have agave nectar, which is combined
- **[01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kx-G6ucSsyw&t=75s)** — glucose and fructose. And fructose in agave nectar is about 85%. So it's a lot of fructose.
- **[01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kx-G6ucSsyw&t=83s)** — Then you have fruit. Fruit is a combination of glucose plus fructose. But the fructose and
- **[01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kx-G6ucSsyw&t=90s)** — fruit can vary between 1% and 30%. Now you're probably saying like, what would be 1%? Well,
- **[01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kx-G6ucSsyw&t=96s)** — it could be like avocados. That would be considered a fruit or maybe olives. That
- **[01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kx-G6ucSsyw&t=105s)** — is interesting. What's interesting about fructose is that it's the only sugar that does not
- **[01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kx-G6ucSsyw&t=112s)** — activate the beta cells. That's the cells in the pancreas that release insulin.
- **[01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kx-G6ucSsyw&t=117s)** — It does not increase your blood sugars, at least initially. When you think about it,
- **[02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kx-G6ucSsyw&t=124s)** — when you go to the doctor to get your blood sugar tested, they're not going to be checking
- **[02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kx-G6ucSsyw&t=128s)** — how much fructose that's in the blood. They're going to be checking how much glucose is in
- **[02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kx-G6ucSsyw&t=134s)** — blood. Two completely different monosaccharides. And fructose as a sugar is like twice as sweet
- **[02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kx-G6ucSsyw&t=141s)** — as table sugar. And this is another reason why manufacturing companies might be putting
- **[02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kx-G6ucSsyw&t=147s)** — fructose in our food because it's just sweeter. If you take artificial sweeteners,
- **[02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kx-G6ucSsyw&t=151s)** — you're talking about a factor of like 10,000 to 100,000 times sweeter than sugar. So that's
- **[02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kx-G6ucSsyw&t=158s)** — why you need just a tiny bit. And humans lack the enzyme to convert fructose into glucose.
- **[02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kx-G6ucSsyw&t=166s)** — So when this was studied and realized that, wow, fructose does not increase your blood sugar,
- **[02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kx-G6ucSsyw&t=171s)** — they started to recommend it for diabetics. But let me explain the other half of the story,
- **[02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kx-G6ucSsyw&t=176s)** — okay? Because fructose follows a different biochemical pathway than glucose. Glucose is
- **[03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kx-G6ucSsyw&t=184s)** — by all the cells, but fructose is only really absorbed by the liver. Some of it passes
- **[03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kx-G6ucSsyw&t=190s)** — through the intestine because it's not easily absorbed and it can get into the colon,
- **[03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kx-G6ucSsyw&t=195s)** — where your microbes have a frenzy, okay? It's kind of like crack to your microbes and they
- **[03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kx-G6ucSsyw&t=200s)** — will start eating this up and start growing rapidly. And you'll get a lot of gas and
- **[03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kx-G6ucSsyw&t=204s)** — sometimes diarrhea and a lot of digestive bloating and all sorts of digestive problems.
- **[03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kx-G6ucSsyw&t=209s)** — This is why a lot of people cannot do fruit or just fructose in general. But what about
- **[03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kx-G6ucSsyw&t=215s)** — the stuff that's absorbed to the liver? I want to talk about that because that fructose in your
- **[03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kx-G6ucSsyw&t=220s)** — liver, that can be converted to glucose and stored as glycogen. Now, if there's enough
- **[03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kx-G6ucSsyw&t=226s)** — glycogen stored in the liver, then the body will instantly start making triglycerides,
- **[03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kx-G6ucSsyw&t=232s)** — which are blood fats and cholesterol. It's been well documented that fructose will make a
- **[03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kx-G6ucSsyw&t=238s)** — very fatty liver very quickly if you consume enough of it, right? But we don't consume very
- **[04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kx-G6ucSsyw&t=242s)** — much of it. Well, it just so happens that kids, for example, 25% of their calories
- **[04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kx-G6ucSsyw&t=250s)** — are in the form of fructose on average. That is crazy. So we're consuming a massive amount
- **[04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kx-G6ucSsyw&t=258s)** — of fructose in many different forms. The other problem with your liver becoming fatty
- **[04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kx-G6ucSsyw&t=264s)** — and you producing all these triglycerides is that will now create insulin resistance
- **[04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kx-G6ucSsyw&t=270s)** — in a bad way, more potently than glucose. So now we're going to actually go right into diabetes
- **[04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kx-G6ucSsyw&t=277s)** — a lot quicker. And now the body is going to produce more insulin indirectly. So just because
- **[04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kx-G6ucSsyw&t=282s)** — fructose is low on the glycemic index and it won't raise your blood sugars, it will do
- **[04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kx-G6ucSsyw&t=287s)** — indirectly and create problems way worse than glucose, but in a different way. I'm sorry,
- **[04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kx-G6ucSsyw&t=294s)** — you just kind of got excited there, right? You thought maybe you could start consuming fructose.
- **[04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kx-G6ucSsyw&t=298s)** — Well, you don't want to do that. That fructose will also be converted to uric acid, right? So
- **[05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kx-G6ucSsyw&t=302s)** — now your gout increases as well. And the more uric acid you have in the kidney, the less
- **[05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kx-G6ucSsyw&t=309s)** — vitamin D you're going to activate because the activation of vitamin D happens mainly in the
- **[05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kx-G6ucSsyw&t=313s)** — kidney. So that could be another problem. And we're going to end up with more inflammation
- **[05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kx-G6ucSsyw&t=317s)** — and also profound atherosclerosis. That's right. It leads right to the clogging or the
- **[05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kx-G6ucSsyw&t=324s)** — plucking of your arteries. Now in certain mice studies, and by the way, like mice and humans
- **[05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kx-G6ucSsyw&t=329s)** — don't have that enzyme to convert fructose to glucose, there is shown a spike in homocysteine
- **[05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kx-G6ucSsyw&t=336s)** — by 72%. Also, you're going to get low leptin levels and that has everything to do with your
- **[05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kx-G6ucSsyw&t=342s)** — appetite. So you're naturally going to not get satisfied and you're going to overeat when you
- **[05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kx-G6ucSsyw&t=347s)** — consume fructose. Probably another reason why they use high fructose curds syrup in so many
- **[05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kx-G6ucSsyw&t=353s)** — drinks is to get you to drink more and more because you're not going to be satisfied.
- **[05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kx-G6ucSsyw&t=359s)** — Given that information, you can have alternative sugars. Okay, these are called sugar alcohols.
- **[06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kx-G6ucSsyw&t=366s)** — And for that information, you should watch this video right here.

- **[00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNnUeeAiJko&t=0s)** — You know, a lot of people love wheat products, right? Breads, pasta, cereal, crackers, biscuits,
- **[00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNnUeeAiJko&t=6s)** — waffles, pancakes, things like that. And so, if there is a way that you can actually eat wheat
- **[00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNnUeeAiJko&t=12s)** — without any side effects at all, and you can have as much as you want, wouldn't that be great?
- **[00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNnUeeAiJko&t=17s)** — And the answer is yes. There is a type of wheat that you can have as much as you want.
- **[00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNnUeeAiJko&t=22s)** — And you're going to be really excited about this. Well, I think I'm a little bit sarcastic,
- **[00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNnUeeAiJko&t=27s)** — but you can have wheat in the form of wheatgrass. That's right, wheatgrass. Well, you're probably not
- **[00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNnUeeAiJko&t=35s)** — too excited about that. But today I'm going to talk about some really interesting benefits of
- **[00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNnUeeAiJko&t=41s)** — wheatgrass and what it can do for your health. Now, full disclosure, I do sell wheatgrass juice
- **[00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNnUeeAiJko&t=47s)** — powder. Okay, I'm just telling you that before I start this video. And secondly, I'm not
- **[00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNnUeeAiJko&t=51s)** — going to make any claims that consuming wheatgrass juice can do anything for your health,
- **[00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNnUeeAiJko&t=55s)** — prevent anything, help reduce the risk of any diseases. I just want to explain some of the
- **[01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNnUeeAiJko&t=61s)** — research and there's some really interesting things about wheatgrass that I want to share
- **[01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNnUeeAiJko&t=64s)** — with you. So what is the difference between wheat that you would use in making breads
- **[01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNnUeeAiJko&t=70s)** — and pastas and things like that versus the wheat and the wheatgrass juice? Well, with all
- **[01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNnUeeAiJko&t=76s)** — the breads and pastas and cereals and crackers, that is made with the seed of the plant. Okay,
- **[01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNnUeeAiJko&t=83s)** — the grain. And wheatgrass is without the seed. It's the actual plant that the seed grows on.
- **[01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNnUeeAiJko&t=90s)** — And so you're consuming this in the microgreen phase, which is usually about seven to eight to
- **[01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNnUeeAiJko&t=95s)** — nine or 10 days. A lot of different opinions about wheatgrass juice. Like it's the new
- **[01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNnUeeAiJko&t=101s)** — age espresso. People use it in different cleansing detox programs. But I think the
- **[01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNnUeeAiJko&t=107s)** — health of the wheatgrass is dependent on what it's grown on. So if you're going to the
- **[01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNnUeeAiJko&t=113s)** — health food store and you're buying wheatgrass in trays that's grown on like this fiber,
- **[02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNnUeeAiJko&t=120s)** — coconut or nothing at all versus it grown on actual soil, I think there's a big difference
- **[02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNnUeeAiJko&t=126s)** — in nutrition. Also you have products that are wheatgrass powder products versus wheatgrass
- **[02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNnUeeAiJko&t=132s)** — juice powder. Very, very different. The wheatgrass juice powder is way more concentrated
- **[02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNnUeeAiJko&t=138s)** — because it doesn't have any fiber in it. And it takes a tremendous amount of wheatgrass
- **[02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNnUeeAiJko&t=142s)** — to make just a little bit of that wheatgrass juice powder. And there is several advantage
- **[02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNnUeeAiJko&t=146s)** — of doing the wheatgrass juice powder because especially if you have irritable bowel,
- **[02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNnUeeAiJko&t=151s)** — inflammation in your gut, you can't do fiber. I mean it's pretty bizarre to think
- **[02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNnUeeAiJko&t=157s)** — Celiac disease, right, which is a severe intestinal inflammatory condition where
- **[02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNnUeeAiJko&t=164s)** — you're getting destruction of the lining of your colon comes from gluten, which is in
- **[02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNnUeeAiJko&t=170s)** — wheat products and other grains. Yet if you did the wheatgrass juice powder,
- **[02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNnUeeAiJko&t=175s)** — it would not create that effect because there's no gluten in wheatgrass
- **[02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNnUeeAiJko&t=178s)** — at all. So that's interesting. It's like opposite ends of the spectrum. The gluten
- **[03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNnUeeAiJko&t=183s)** — is contained in the grain, which occurs later in the plant's cycle. If you capture
- **[03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNnUeeAiJko&t=190s)** — a baby plant when it's very small, you avoid any of the grains. But it also means that you
- **[03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNnUeeAiJko&t=197s)** — avoid a lot of the other things that are bad too, like the anti-nutrients, like phytic acid,
- **[03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNnUeeAiJko&t=203s)** — which blocks the absorption of certain minerals. So there's very, very low, if any, phytic
- **[03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNnUeeAiJko&t=210s)** — acid in wheatgrass. But there's a lot in the grain because it's in that bran portion of the
- **[03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNnUeeAiJko&t=216s)** — seed. Then you also have a great reduction of the tannins, which are also kind of toxic to
- **[03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNnUeeAiJko&t=221s)** — people. And there is a much, much lower amount of oxlets, which can lead to kidney stones and
- **[03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNnUeeAiJko&t=227s)** — can create arthritis or inflammation into the body. So with the wheatgrass juice, you have
- **[03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNnUeeAiJko&t=231s)** — this interesting, very low anti-nutrients, no gluten. It's actually low carb and you get
- **[03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNnUeeAiJko&t=239s)** — higher levels of nutrients. Okay, vitamin C, the precursor of vitamin A, beta carotene. You have
- **[04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNnUeeAiJko&t=245s)** — a lot of the trace minerals, the minerals. And of course that depends on what it's grown on as
- **[04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNnUeeAiJko&t=249s)** — well. You get the B vitamins, you get folate. And what's interesting, we had our wheatgrass
- **[04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNnUeeAiJko&t=254s)** — juice powder tested and there were high levels of B12. Now, first of all, plants don't make
- **[04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNnUeeAiJko&t=262s)** — B12. So apparently that B12 was created from a microorganism that lives within that plant.
- **[04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNnUeeAiJko&t=269s)** — Because one of the things that the farm that grows the wheatgrass juice powder that I use,
- **[04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNnUeeAiJko&t=274s)** — they don't sterilize. So nothing is heated over 106 degrees. So you have microorganisms
- **[04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNnUeeAiJko&t=281s)** — living that can survive that temperature. And so that can add an additional benefit. There's
- **[04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNnUeeAiJko&t=290s)** — a lot of different things that you can do to make B12. I don't even consume it for the
- **[04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNnUeeAiJko&t=291s)** — vitamins. I consume it for two other things. One is the chlorophyll, which 70% of wheatgrass
- **[05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNnUeeAiJko&t=300s)** — juice is chlorophyll. And secondly, for all the phytonutrients, there are hundreds, if not
- **[05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNnUeeAiJko&t=305s)** — thousands of phytonutrients in this microgreen and other microgreens that have all sorts of
- **[05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNnUeeAiJko&t=312s)** — cool properties, which I'm going to talk about. But first let me just mention this chlorophyll
- **[05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNnUeeAiJko&t=317s)** — compound. I don't know if you knew this, but chlorophyll is identical to your own blood,
- **[05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNnUeeAiJko&t=323s)** — except for one little thing. Instead of iron, it contains magnesium. I mean, it's pretty wild
- **[05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNnUeeAiJko&t=332s)** — that when someone consumes that green liquid from a plant, they're consuming something that
- **[05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNnUeeAiJko&t=338s)** — so close to your blood, but with magnesium. It's pretty wild. And there's also studies that
- **[05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNnUeeAiJko&t=344s)** — shows that chlorophyll can stimulate the production of your own red blood cells if you
- **[05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNnUeeAiJko&t=351s)** — have anemia. And it also has the ability to stimulate the blood stem cells as well. But
- **[05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNnUeeAiJko&t=358s)** — I'm not making any claims that it'll do anything for you. Just read the research on
- **[06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNnUeeAiJko&t=362s)** — this yourself. Now let's just talk a little bit about the phytonutrients. Phytonutrients
- **[06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNnUeeAiJko&t=367s)** — help to reduce the complications of a lot of different health problems. They have anti-inflammatory
- **[06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNnUeeAiJko&t=373s)** — properties, antioxidant properties, antimicrobial properties. But the phytonutrients that I want
- **[06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNnUeeAiJko&t=379s)** — to talk about today relate to a condition that I found some interesting research on,
- **[06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNnUeeAiJko&t=386s)** — and that's thalassemia. That is a genetic blood disorder where the person is not making
- **[06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNnUeeAiJko&t=394s)** — hemoglobin, which is the protein that carries oxygen in your blood. So it's a type of anemia.
- **[06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNnUeeAiJko&t=400s)** — There's also some other problems with this disorder. You're not making enough
- **[06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNnUeeAiJko&t=404s)** — white blood cells, leukocytes, and also you have a deficiency of thrombocytes. So we have
- **[06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNnUeeAiJko&t=410s)** — low red blood cells, low white blood cells, and low thrombocytes, which actually have to do
- **[06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNnUeeAiJko&t=417s)** — with the clotting factors. And so the problem is the treatment for this disorder
- **[07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNnUeeAiJko&t=421s)** — has a lot of side effects. I mean one of the treatments is like a bone marrow replacement.
- **[07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNnUeeAiJko&t=428s)** — Other treatments involve bone marrow stimulants, blood transfusions, etc. etc. But there's some
- **[07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNnUeeAiJko&t=435s)** — alternative treatments that they're trying with some pretty good effectiveness, and that has to
- **[07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNnUeeAiJko&t=439s)** — do with wheatgrass. And they found through a research experiment, which I'll put down below,
- **[07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNnUeeAiJko&t=444s)** — that there's something in wheatgrass juice that can increase your white blood cells,
- **[07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNnUeeAiJko&t=449s)** — that can increase your red blood cells, that can also increase your thrombocytes. And so it's
- **[07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNnUeeAiJko&t=454s)** — very good for anemia. But I want to mention again, this is just educational. I'm not making
- **[07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNnUeeAiJko&t=458s)** — any claims it's going to do anything for you at all. Now it's very very inexpensive to make
- **[07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNnUeeAiJko&t=463s)** — your own wheatgrass juice just by growing it. I highly recommend that you grow it in a tray
- **[07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNnUeeAiJko&t=469s)** — of soil. Okay? And it only takes like seven days to grow it. So you can actually juice
- **[07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNnUeeAiJko&t=474s)** — your own and use that tray to juice and then take your own shots. That would be a very
- **[07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNnUeeAiJko&t=479s)** — inexpensive yet super healthy way to get these phytonutrients. And since we're talking about
- **[08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNnUeeAiJko&t=485s)** — concentrated phytonutrients, if you have not seen this video, you should check it out.
- **[08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNnUeeAiJko&t=490s)** — I put it up right here.

*Click any timestamp to jump to that moment in the video*

- **[00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PB_Ln5HXkwQ&t=0s)** — I have something very interesting to share with you regarding tremors. I found something that's
- **[00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PB_Ln5HXkwQ&t=7s)** — quite fascinating. A lot of times tremors are misdiagnosed with Parkinson's when you don't
- **[00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PB_Ln5HXkwQ&t=12s)** — necessarily have to have Parkinson's to have tremors. There's a type of tremor called a
- **[00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PB_Ln5HXkwQ&t=16s)** — central tremor which is more progressive into a bigger problem over time and that's aggravated
- **[00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PB_Ln5HXkwQ&t=23s)** — when you move versus a resting tremor which you're resting and you're having this tremor
- **[00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PB_Ln5HXkwQ&t=29s)** — and I found the author of this patent was a neurologist. So obviously they knew something
- **[00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PB_Ln5HXkwQ&t=36s)** — about tremors and so I studied it and I found something fascinating I want to share with you.
- **[00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PB_Ln5HXkwQ&t=42s)** — If you take high doses of vitamin B2 and high doses of coenzyme Q10, apparently you can improve
- **[00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PB_Ln5HXkwQ&t=53s)** — the symptom greatly. But in this document I could not find the mechanism of why
- **[01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PB_Ln5HXkwQ&t=60s)** — that would help someone. So that was just the start of my research in this area and I did a
- **[01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PB_Ln5HXkwQ&t=65s)** — whole deep dive into it and I found something even more interesting. I found the mechanism of
- **[01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PB_Ln5HXkwQ&t=70s)** — why these two nutrients would work and what amounts you would need to take to create
- **[01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PB_Ln5HXkwQ&t=77s)** — a positive effect. There's a high correlation between mitochondrial diseases. Okay,
- **[01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PB_Ln5HXkwQ&t=83s)** — mitochondria is the energy factor of the body and movement disorders. You see your nervous
- **[01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PB_Ln5HXkwQ&t=89s)** — system requires a tremendous amount of energy so it requires very healthy mitochondria and when
- **[01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PB_Ln5HXkwQ&t=97s)** — someone has neurodegenerative diseases or pathologies or anything related to that,
- **[01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PB_Ln5HXkwQ&t=104s)** — they're usually going to have a dysfunction in the mitochondria. And so the question is what
- **[01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PB_Ln5HXkwQ&t=110s)** — does vitamin B2 and coenzyme Q10 have to do with the mitochondria? Well, a lot. The
- **[01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PB_Ln5HXkwQ&t=118s)** — mitochondria is all about turning food into energy, ATP. ATP is like a battery. In the
- **[02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PB_Ln5HXkwQ&t=125s)** — process of breaking down food into energy, there is a compound, like a carrier thing on
- **[02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PB_Ln5HXkwQ&t=133s)** — the assembly line that extracts energy out of food. It extracts electrons. It helps carry
- **[02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PB_Ln5HXkwQ&t=141s)** — electrons through this assembly line. And so both coenzyme Q10 and B2 are essential for the
- **[02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PB_Ln5HXkwQ&t=150s)** — carrier of electrons. The name of the carrier of this is called FAD. What's interesting about
- **[02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PB_Ln5HXkwQ&t=157s)** — FAD is like there's not a lot of people talking about FAD, but there are a lot of
- **[02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PB_Ln5HXkwQ&t=162s)** — talking about NAD. You can even get that as a supplement and that helps the mitochondria work
- **[02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PB_Ln5HXkwQ&t=169s)** — better. It's good for anti-aging. It's good for fixing the mitochondria. It's good for
- **[02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PB_Ln5HXkwQ&t=174s)** — giving you energy. It's good for a lot of things. And people take NAD all the time.
- **[02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PB_Ln5HXkwQ&t=179s)** — And the precursor for that is vitamin B3. But this FAD needs vitamin B2. And then if
- **[03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PB_Ln5HXkwQ&t=186s)** — you look deeper into what vitamin B2 really does, other than help the mitochondria work
- **[03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PB_Ln5HXkwQ&t=191s)** — better, it has everything to do with supporting fatty acids, the membrane around the nervous
- **[03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PB_Ln5HXkwQ&t=198s)** — system called the myelin sheath. And when people are grossly deficient in B2, they have all sorts
- **[03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PB_Ln5HXkwQ&t=205s)** — of neurodegeneration problems. They have neuropathologies. They have swelling in the
- **[03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PB_Ln5HXkwQ&t=212s)** — nervous system. They start losing the myelin sheath around the nervous system. Another condition
- **[03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PB_Ln5HXkwQ&t=218s)** — called MS. They can have exaggerated reflexes. And they can also have dementia. Now if you've
- **[03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PB_Ln5HXkwQ&t=224s)** — ever heard of a B2 deficiency and like what it creates, a lot of times people might associate
- **[03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PB_Ln5HXkwQ&t=230s)** — like taking B2 for migraine headaches and stuff like that. But anything neurological would be
- **[03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PB_Ln5HXkwQ&t=236s)** — another reason to take it. This B2 acts as a precursor to help protect the mitochondria.
- **[04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PB_Ln5HXkwQ&t=243s)** — That is why vitamin B2 is necessary to help correct tremors. Now what about coenzyme Q10?
- **[04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PB_Ln5HXkwQ&t=251s)** — Well coenzyme Q10 does the same thing. It helps to transport these electrons, helps you build
- **[04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PB_Ln5HXkwQ&t=256s)** — the battery, helps more energy in the mitochondria. But when someone actually takes something like
- **[04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PB_Ln5HXkwQ&t=260s)** — statins, which is something that blocks cholesterol, they're going to be deficient in
- **[04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PB_Ln5HXkwQ&t=265s)** — coenzyme Q10. And they're going to have all sorts of neurological and muscular symptoms
- **[04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PB_Ln5HXkwQ&t=271s)** — because of it. So if someone is on a statin, boy they better take coenzyme Q10 because if
- **[04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PB_Ln5HXkwQ&t=278s)** — they don't they're going to have a lot of side effects. But what I did is I did a deep dive
- **[04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PB_Ln5HXkwQ&t=282s)** — into all the side effects from statins and take a wild guess what other symptom I found from
- **[04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PB_Ln5HXkwQ&t=287s)** — taking statins. Tremors. This is what I want you to try. And then after you try this,
- **[04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PB_Ln5HXkwQ&t=294s)** — go ahead and comment down below and tell me how it worked out. You're going to take
- **[04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PB_Ln5HXkwQ&t=299s)** — high amounts of vitamin B2. I would recommend you take about 800 milligrams per day, split it up into
- **[05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PB_Ln5HXkwQ&t=307s)** — two portions. 400 in the morning, 400 before you go to sleep. What about coenzyme Q10? I
- **[05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PB_Ln5HXkwQ&t=314s)** — recommend taking higher amounts of that as well. You want a thousand milligrams per day. Maybe
- **[05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PB_Ln5HXkwQ&t=319s)** — take 500 in the morning, 500 in the afternoon. So go ahead and try that and comment down below.

- **[00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11qN7GUuoy0&t=0s)** — I like to talk about the risks of taking 10,000 IUs of vitamin D3. Sounds like a lot, 10,000,
- **[00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11qN7GUuoy0&t=7s)** — but is it really that much? Just so you know very briefly, IUs stand for International Units. Okay?
- **[00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11qN7GUuoy0&t=15s)** — So 10,000 international units of vitamin D is equivalent to not even one milligram,
- **[00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11qN7GUuoy0&t=22s)** — not even a half a milligram. It's actually one quarter of one milligram, .25 milligrams,
- **[00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11qN7GUuoy0&t=30s)** — which is 250 micrograms. Okay? That's 10,000 international units of vitamin D3.
- **[00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11qN7GUuoy0&t=37s)** — So is there a risk of taking that much? I think there's a bigger risk of not taking that much.
- **[00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11qN7GUuoy0&t=43s)** — Let me explain. I recently found some information that literally blew me away, and I think it's
- **[00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11qN7GUuoy0&t=52s)** — just a little foundation of what we're talking about. The great majority of us are deficient
- **[00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11qN7GUuoy0&t=58s)** — in vitamin D. Now, I guess the conflicting information is that the RDAs of vitamin D
- **[01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11qN7GUuoy0&t=65s)** — is between 600 to 800 international units. Okay? And now we're talking about taking 10,000.
- **[01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11qN7GUuoy0&t=73s)** — It sounds like a huge gap, but what you have to realize is that 600 to 800 IUs
- **[01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11qN7GUuoy0&t=79s)** — is based on old research relating to preventing osteoporosis, bone loss. It's not updated and
- **[01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11qN7GUuoy0&t=87s)** — correlated with all the new information related to the benefit of vitamin D for your immune
- **[01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11qN7GUuoy0&t=93s)** — system. What's even more wild is that vitamin D is not really even a vitamin. It's a hormone,
- **[01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11qN7GUuoy0&t=99s)** — and it acts very similar to cortisol as an anti-inflammatory, but without the side effects.
- **[01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11qN7GUuoy0&t=103s)** — Every cell in your body has receptors for vitamin D. The functions of vitamin D are very,
- **[01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11qN7GUuoy0&t=109s)** — very vast, but I want this video to focus mainly on why you need as a maintenance dose,
- **[01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11qN7GUuoy0&t=116s)** — 10,000 IUs. It really has to do with the barriers of absorption. You have a lot of
- **[02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11qN7GUuoy0&t=122s)** — things that are stopping vitamin D from going into your body, right? You have the sun, like
- **[02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11qN7GUuoy0&t=129s)** — sun exposure to their skin. They don't go outside as much. And if they're going outside
- **[02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11qN7GUuoy0&t=135s)** — with a shirt on and just getting exposure to their face, you're not going to even get close
- **[02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11qN7GUuoy0&t=140s)** — to the amount that you need. And also it's almost impossible to get enough vitamin D from
- **[02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11qN7GUuoy0&t=144s)** — the foods that we eat. Even if you eat fatty fish and cod liver oil and egg yolks, which
- **[02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11qN7GUuoy0&t=151s)** — are higher in vitamin D3, you're still not going to reach the levels that you need. Then
- **[02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11qN7GUuoy0&t=156s)** — you have people that are overweight. The more fat right beneath your skin, the harder it is for
- **[02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11qN7GUuoy0&t=164s)** — the sun to penetrate to create the vitamin D necessary. Then we have metabolic syndrome.
- **[02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11qN7GUuoy0&t=169s)** — If you have diabetes or you have insulin resistance, vitamin D doesn't go in that well.
- **[02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11qN7GUuoy0&t=175s)** — The older you are, the skin becomes thicker and it's harder to get your vitamin D. The
- **[03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11qN7GUuoy0&t=180s)** — more pigment you have, in other words, the darker your skin, the less vitamin D absorption
- **[03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11qN7GUuoy0&t=184s)** — you're going to have. And also the more problem you have with the gallbladder or the liver. Let's
- **[03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11qN7GUuoy0&t=189s)** — see if a fatty liver, the less absorption of vitamin D you're going to have. Because you
- **[03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11qN7GUuoy0&t=194s)** — need bile to help you absorb vitamin D from the food, as well as from a supplement because
- **[03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11qN7GUuoy0&t=198s)** — it's a fat soluble vitamin. And the more kidney problems you have, the less vitamin D
- **[03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11qN7GUuoy0&t=203s)** — you're going to have as well. So the way it works is you have these precursor or inactive
- **[03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11qN7GUuoy0&t=209s)** — vitamin D compounds that have to be converted to the active form of vitamin D. And they go
- **[03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11qN7GUuoy0&t=216s)** — through various steps, but there's two primary steps. One through the liver and one through
- **[03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11qN7GUuoy0&t=221s)** — the kidney to eventually get this active form of vitamin D3. It then has to be absorbed
- **[03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11qN7GUuoy0&t=226s)** — in your receptors. And those receptors are called vitamin D receptors. And if you have an
- **[03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11qN7GUuoy0&t=232s)** — like a viral infection, these viruses can trick your body by downgrading the receptors
- **[03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11qN7GUuoy0&t=239s)** — and preventing you from absorbing vitamin D3. So that's another barrier. If you're
- **[04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11qN7GUuoy0&t=245s)** — immune compromised or you have an immune system problem, the amount of vitamin D
- **[04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11qN7GUuoy0&t=249s)** — you're going to need is going to have to be a lot more to penetrate that resistance that
- **[04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11qN7GUuoy0&t=254s)** — the virus has strategically created for you. And when they do a blood test for vitamin D,
- **[04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11qN7GUuoy0&t=260s)** — they're not testing the active form of vitamin D. They're testing the inactive
- **[04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11qN7GUuoy0&t=264s)** — form. And the reason why is because if they tested the active form, there's a lot of
- **[04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11qN7GUuoy0&t=270s)** — problems with that. Number one being that it has a very short half-life. Like I think it's
- **[04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11qN7GUuoy0&t=277s)** — four to six hours compared to two to three weeks for the inactive vitamin D3. And also the
- **[04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11qN7GUuoy0&t=290s)** — apparently have a lot of inactive vitamin D sitting there waiting to be converted. And also
- **[04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11qN7GUuoy0&t=296s)** — when you're deficient in the inactive version of vitamin D3, your body will then compensate
- **[05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11qN7GUuoy0&t=303s)** — and make more of the active vitamin D3. So if you tested the active vitamin D3 and it shows
- **[05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11qN7GUuoy0&t=310s)** — up normal, it doesn't really give you a lot of information. So this is why the inactive
- **[05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11qN7GUuoy0&t=316s)** — form is tested. But this next thing is going to blow your way. Okay. And this relates to your
- **[05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11qN7GUuoy0&t=323s)** — genes. I've been recently involved in a lot of research in genetics looking at what's called
- **[05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11qN7GUuoy0&t=332s)** — polymorphisms, which are alterations in certain genes that make you more susceptible
- **[05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11qN7GUuoy0&t=337s)** — to having problems with certain illnesses. But there's three polymorphisms that are routinely
- **[05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11qN7GUuoy0&t=344s)** — tested when you do your DNA test that I need to talk about because in the last, I would say,
- **[05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11qN7GUuoy0&t=351s)** — several months, I tested their DNA. They're mainly friends and family members. And I wanted
- **[05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11qN7GUuoy0&t=356s)** — to just get experience in this topic. And testing real people is a very good way to do that.
- **[06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11qN7GUuoy0&t=362s)** — And check this out. This is just related to vitamin D. Out of the 21 people that I tested,
- **[06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11qN7GUuoy0&t=367s)** — 100% of them had at least one problem with vitamin D absorption. In other words, they had
- **[06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11qN7GUuoy0&t=374s)** — at least one genetic issue with their vitamin D, which is another barrier that I don't think
- **[06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11qN7GUuoy0&t=381s)** — is really acknowledged or even known. It could be the next 21 people I test don't have a
- **[06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11qN7GUuoy0&t=387s)** — problem with vitamin D. But with this small sample, there was 21 out of 21 people that had
- **[06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11qN7GUuoy0&t=392s)** — relating to vitamin D genes. In the first gene, it was called the CYP2R1. And out of all the 21
- **[06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11qN7GUuoy0&t=401s)** — people tested, 90% of them had a problem with this gene. And 38% of that group had a major
- **[06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11qN7GUuoy0&t=409s)** — problem with that polymorphism or mutation. And this gene is one of the two steps in the
- **[06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11qN7GUuoy0&t=416s)** — conversion from the inactive to the active and occurs in the liver. So in other words, if you
- **[07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11qN7GUuoy0&t=421s)** — have a problem with this gene, you're going to have a problem in converting the inactive form to
- **[07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11qN7GUuoy0&t=426s)** — the active form. Now let's talk about the other two genes. These other two genes were involved
- **[07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11qN7GUuoy0&t=431s)** — with transportation, like binding to a protein and transporting this vitamin D throughout your
- **[07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11qN7GUuoy0&t=437s)** — circulation. And out of all 21, in the first transporter gene, there was like 61% of the
- **[07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11qN7GUuoy0&t=445s)** — people that had a problem with that one. And then with that second transporter, there was
- **[07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11qN7GUuoy0&t=449s)** — 76% of the people that had a problem with that gene. So a lot of people didn't have a problem
- **[07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11qN7GUuoy0&t=455s)** — just with one gene. It was all three genes. So if we take this genetic alteration on top of
- **[07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11qN7GUuoy0&t=462s)** — all these other barriers, now we can see 10,000 IUs is not going to be toxic at all. In
- **[07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11qN7GUuoy0&t=470s)** — fact, it's going to be necessary to penetrate some of these big barriers that people are up
- **[07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11qN7GUuoy0&t=476s)** — That being said, how much vitamin D does create a toxicity effect? Well, that's still in debate,
- **[08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11qN7GUuoy0&t=483s)** — but based on all the research that I looked at, it would take hundreds of thousands of
- **[08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11qN7GUuoy0&t=489s)** — international units of vitamin D for months before it created a toxic effect. And that toxic
- **[08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11qN7GUuoy0&t=495s)** — effect is primarily hypercalcemia. And the risk of that problem is mainly kidney stones.
- **[08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11qN7GUuoy0&t=501s)** — So just as a precautionary step, if you're drinking two and a half liters of fluid a day,
- **[08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11qN7GUuoy0&t=506s)** — that decreases your risk big time of getting a kidney stone because you're going to keep the
- **[08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11qN7GUuoy0&t=510s)** — urine diluted. And then on top of that, if you take some of the supporting nutrients that
- **[08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11qN7GUuoy0&t=515s)** — allows vitamin D absorption, as well as the function of it, and also factors that protect
- **[08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11qN7GUuoy0&t=521s)** — you against hypercalcemia like vitamin K2, magnesium, B6, zinc, then that puts you even in
- **[08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11qN7GUuoy0&t=529s)** — And one last point about getting your blood tested with vitamin D. To date, there's still no
- **[08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11qN7GUuoy0&t=537s)** — consensus from the entire medical community on what those values should be. But most doctors
- **[09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11qN7GUuoy0&t=544s)** — is between 150 to 200 nanograms per milliliter. But again, when they do a blood test,
- **[09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11qN7GUuoy0&t=550s)** — they're looking at the inactive vitamin D. They're not looking at the active vitamin D.
- **[09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11qN7GUuoy0&t=555s)** — They're also not looking at what happens in the vitamin D receptor absorption into your cells.
- **[09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11qN7GUuoy0&t=561s)** — We're not looking at that level. If you also have a genetic problem in the vitamin D
- **[09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11qN7GUuoy0&t=566s)** — receptor, or you have an infection, some virus that's downgrading that vitamin D receptor,
- **[09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11qN7GUuoy0&t=572s)** — or even you have an autoimmune disease that has this downgraded vitamin D receptor,
- **[09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11qN7GUuoy0&t=577s)** — you might need much, much higher levels of vitamin D3 than 10,000 I use. Now, I created
- **[09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11qN7GUuoy0&t=583s)** — another really interesting video on the toxicity effect. And I looked at more of the percentages
- **[09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11qN7GUuoy0&t=589s)** — based on all the research out there of what could happen, what cofactors you need to take.
- **[09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11qN7GUuoy0&t=595s)** — If you haven't seen this video, you should check it out. It's really interesting.

- **[00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zMIHzJ6bGnU&t=0s)** — There is one really important nutrient deficiency involved in Lyme disease that you absolutely
- **[00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zMIHzJ6bGnU&t=5s)** — need to know about. And you can do all these regular conventional treatments and even
- **[00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zMIHzJ6bGnU&t=10s)** — alternative treatments. But without this one nutrient, you are going to have a hard time
- **[00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zMIHzJ6bGnU&t=15s)** — recovering 100%. And I am going to show you a simple solution that you can do to overcome this.
- **[00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zMIHzJ6bGnU&t=21s)** — The nutrient deficiency in Lyme is Vitamin D. Now the big question is why? Well, that
- **[00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zMIHzJ6bGnU&t=30s)** — Spirochetes in Lyme disease, this very specific microbe, has a very sneaky trick of blocking
- **[00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zMIHzJ6bGnU&t=38s)** — your ability to receive Vitamin D. In other words, you can have normal Vitamin D levels
- **[00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zMIHzJ6bGnU&t=45s)** — in your blood and be severely deficient of Vitamin D deep in your tissues. The way Vitamin D
- **[00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zMIHzJ6bGnU&t=51s)** — actually works, typically from sun, the sun hits your skin that then goes through several
- **[00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zMIHzJ6bGnU&t=58s)** — changes within your liver and your kidneys to eventually turn into the active form of Vitamin D.
- **[01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zMIHzJ6bGnU&t=65s)** — But it then has to be received by the Vitamin D receptor, which is deep inside your cells
- **[01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zMIHzJ6bGnU&t=72s)** — in the nucleus of the cell. But the unique thing with this microorganism in Lyme,
- **[01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zMIHzJ6bGnU&t=78s)** — and what it does to your Vitamin D receptor, is it downgrades that receptor by 50 to 80x.
- **[01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zMIHzJ6bGnU&t=85s)** — The ability of your immune system to fight back is pretty much nullified. So all these
- **[01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zMIHzJ6bGnU&t=90s)** — remedies and antibiotics are going to try to kill it, but your immune system is still weakened.
- **[01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zMIHzJ6bGnU&t=96s)** — Now I'm going to show you how to fix this problem, but I really want you to understand
- **[01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zMIHzJ6bGnU&t=100s)** — why so many people with Lyme are suffering for years and years and years unnecessarily.
- **[01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zMIHzJ6bGnU&t=107s)** — Other microbes also do the same thing, especially viruses like Epstein-Barr virus,
- **[01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zMIHzJ6bGnU&t=113s)** — and even certain types of cancer also downgrade the receptor for Vitamin D. This is their dirty
- **[02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zMIHzJ6bGnU&t=120s)** — little trick to overcome the defenses of your own immune system. It's basically like being in
- **[02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zMIHzJ6bGnU&t=125s)** — this battle between you and another army and having the ability to remove the weapons on the
- **[02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zMIHzJ6bGnU&t=133s)** — other side. You know, the problem is there's no routine blood test that you're going to
- **[02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zMIHzJ6bGnU&t=137s)** — be able to test this Vitamin D receptor problem. You really can't go by what's in the
- **[02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zMIHzJ6bGnU&t=141s)** — blood. You have to do a specialized Vitamin D receptor test, and I will put that link down
- **[02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zMIHzJ6bGnU&t=146s)** — below if you want a couple options. So here you are, you're at the doctor, you get a Lyme test,
- **[02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zMIHzJ6bGnU&t=152s)** — becomes positive, you check your Vitamin D, it's normal, but it's not really normal deep
- **[02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zMIHzJ6bGnU&t=158s)** — inside. I mean just think about how many other conditions are related to a Vitamin D
- **[02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zMIHzJ6bGnU&t=163s)** — deficiency. Autoimmune diseases, cardiovascular diseases, certain cognitive problems. So there's
- **[02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zMIHzJ6bGnU&t=170s)** — estimations up to 30% of the entire population has a problem with this Vitamin D receptor,
- **[02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zMIHzJ6bGnU&t=175s)** — but a huge portion of people that are overweight have resistance to Vitamin D
- **[03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zMIHzJ6bGnU&t=181s)** — at the receptor level. Other microorganisms also have this nasty trick like chlamydia,
- **[03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zMIHzJ6bGnU&t=188s)** — mycoplasmas. So basically there's this hijacking occurring at your Vitamin D
- **[03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zMIHzJ6bGnU&t=192s)** — receptor, and it basically usually gets unnoticed because it's not on a routine blood
- **[03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zMIHzJ6bGnU&t=197s)** — toxic mold aspergillus also can downgrade this Vitamin D receptor. When you get a blood test
- **[03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zMIHzJ6bGnU&t=204s)** — for Vitamin D, usually they test the inactive version for various reasons I'm not going to
- **[03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zMIHzJ6bGnU&t=209s)** — get into, but if you ever check your active version of Vitamin D, sometimes that's actually
- **[03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zMIHzJ6bGnU&t=214s)** — even higher just because of the compensation of what your body is trying to do to push
- **[03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zMIHzJ6bGnU&t=220s)** — through and override this Vitamin D receptor resistance. And so if you ever get that blood
- **[03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zMIHzJ6bGnU&t=226s)** — test done and the doctor sees that your Vitamin D levels are high, what are they going to tell
- **[03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zMIHzJ6bGnU&t=232s)** — you? Make sure you don't take Vitamin D. So wherever you are in the stage of this Lyme disease,
- **[03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zMIHzJ6bGnU&t=239s)** — Vitamin D is going to be really important to turn this thing around, but how are we going to
- **[04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zMIHzJ6bGnU&t=243s)** — override this resistance to Vitamin D? Well, I'm going to give you a bunch of things to do
- **[04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zMIHzJ6bGnU&t=249s)** — because the darker your skin is, the more Vitamin D you're going to need and the less
- **[04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zMIHzJ6bGnU&t=253s)** — you're going to get from the sun. The older they are, the less absorption of Vitamin D you can
- **[04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zMIHzJ6bGnU&t=258s)** — have. The lower your cholesterol is, or let's say for example you have liver problems or kidney
- **[04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zMIHzJ6bGnU&t=262s)** — problems or let's say you had your gallbladder removed or you're on a statin. All of these
- **[04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zMIHzJ6bGnU&t=266s)** — are additional barriers to Vitamin D. So you need certain things like zinc, magnesium
- **[04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zMIHzJ6bGnU&t=272s)** — to allow Vitamin D to work. If you're also consuming seed oils, that can block your
- **[04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zMIHzJ6bGnU&t=279s)** — for Vitamin D. And of course if you're a smoker, that could also be an issue.
- **[04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zMIHzJ6bGnU&t=284s)** — How do we increase Vitamin D? Well, number one, you start taking large amounts of Vitamin D,
- **[04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zMIHzJ6bGnU&t=289s)** — but I wouldn't take it every day. If we want to get more penetration to override this
- **[04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zMIHzJ6bGnU&t=295s)** — resistance, you want to take a lot of Vitamin D, like 50,000 IUs sporadically,
- **[05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zMIHzJ6bGnU&t=302s)** — maybe once a week. Now of course being out in the sun is going to help. Omega-3 fatty
- **[05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zMIHzJ6bGnU&t=306s)** — acids are also important. Risveratrol is another thing you can take to help increase
- **[05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zMIHzJ6bGnU&t=312s)** — the receptiveness of the Vitamin D receptor. Intense exercise will also help. The
- **[05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zMIHzJ6bGnU&t=319s)** — phytonutrient quercetin can help as well. And zinc and boron and even progesterone
- **[05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zMIHzJ6bGnU&t=326s)** — and sulforaphane are all compounds that help override this problem. But there's one more
- **[05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zMIHzJ6bGnU&t=332s)** — thing you can do that actually can help you. Titka is a type of bile salt that also activates
- **[05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zMIHzJ6bGnU&t=338s)** — the Vitamin D receptor. I did some research on this and I was looking at all the alternative
- **[05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zMIHzJ6bGnU&t=344s)** — ways to kind of allow that Vitamin D receptor to work better. And bile salts came up,
- **[05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zMIHzJ6bGnU&t=352s)** — which is fascinating. Now you know one of the most important nutrients involved in lime
- **[05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zMIHzJ6bGnU&t=357s)** — that could potentially take your problems that you have right now and put them right straight
- **[06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zMIHzJ6bGnU&t=361s)** — into remission. Now there's more to learn about your immune system. If you have not seen this
- **[06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zMIHzJ6bGnU&t=366s)** — video, check it out. I put it up right here.

- **[00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzLGUM1hpUA&t=0s)** — Now, there's no way you can build up your bones, okay, if you have osteoporosis, with calcium.
- **[00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzLGUM1hpUA&t=7s)** — It's not going to happen. What's going to happen if you attempt to do that is you're going to get
- **[00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzLGUM1hpUA&t=12s)** — calcification of your arteries. So in this video, I'm going to show you
- **[00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzLGUM1hpUA&t=18s)** — some insights on osteoporosis as well as osteopenia. What is osteoporosis? Osteoporosis
- **[00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzLGUM1hpUA&t=25s)** — is a loss of bone density and bone mass. And so the problem with that is you're at risk for a
- **[00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzLGUM1hpUA&t=32s)** — fracture. Now, the purpose of bone is to give you structure, to have a place where ligaments can
- **[00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzLGUM1hpUA&t=39s)** — attach, and it's also a reserve for minerals. So if you need more calcium or phosphorus,
- **[00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzLGUM1hpUA&t=48s)** — bone is that reserve. And so many people just focus on the calcium aspect of bone, but
- **[00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzLGUM1hpUA&t=54s)** — phosphorus, like 85% of phosphorus is stored in your bone, yet we ignore phosphorus. And the
- **[01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzLGUM1hpUA&t=60s)** — thing you need to know about phosphorus is that you can have problems with your bone if you have
- **[01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzLGUM1hpUA&t=65s)** — too little phosphorus or too much. Because if you have too much phosphorus, as in if you
- **[01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzLGUM1hpUA&t=70s)** — drink a lot of sodas or things with phosphoric acid or junk foods, that can cause
- **[01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzLGUM1hpUA&t=76s)** — bone loss as well. But just so you know, phosphorus is in a lot of foods. It's in meats,
- **[01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzLGUM1hpUA&t=81s)** — fish, eggs, it's even in dairy, it's in vegetables. So most people have enough phosphorus unless
- **[01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzLGUM1hpUA&t=87s)** — they're doing things to deplete phosphorus, like I said, consuming junk foods or drinking the sodas,
- **[01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzLGUM1hpUA&t=92s)** — or they have a kidney problem or they're taking certain medications that are interfering with
- **[01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzLGUM1hpUA&t=97s)** — phosphorus. Osteoporosis is severe bone loss, putting you at risk for fractures. Osteopenia
- **[01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzLGUM1hpUA&t=104s)** — is kind of a subclinical or a stage that comes before osteoporosis. And what's interesting about
- **[01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzLGUM1hpUA&t=111s)** — osteopenia is over 50% of women over the age of 50 have some degree of osteopenia. And a significant
- **[01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzLGUM1hpUA&t=119s)** — amount of men have it as well. But osteopenia doesn't really put you at risk for fractures.
- **[02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzLGUM1hpUA&t=124s)** — It's just a good indicator that you're going down a road that you could end up with
- **[02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzLGUM1hpUA&t=128s)** — osteoporosis. But typically a lot of people are told, here take these medications,
- **[02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzLGUM1hpUA&t=133s)** — exercise, maybe you should start chewing those chocolate calcium bone building things, which are
- **[02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzLGUM1hpUA&t=141s)** — just a joke. But there's a paradox involved with calcification. What they found with this
- **[02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzLGUM1hpUA&t=146s)** — paradox is that people that have osteoporosis have a much higher degree of calcification in
- **[02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzLGUM1hpUA&t=153s)** — the arteries and the joints. So that's kind of weird that you're having all this excess
- **[02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzLGUM1hpUA&t=157s)** — calcium, but it's not going in the right place. The other point I want to bring up
- **[02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzLGUM1hpUA&t=161s)** — bone is that in the bone marrow you have an entire factory that is making blood, red blood
- **[02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzLGUM1hpUA&t=167s)** — cells, white blood cells, and platelets. So bone is composed of not just calcium, a lot of
- **[02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzLGUM1hpUA&t=176s)** — minerals. Also 35% of bone is protein, mostly in the form of collagen. So let's go through
- **[03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzLGUM1hpUA&t=184s)** — the key nutrients that are needed to either reverse osteopenia and osteoporosis. And even
- **[03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzLGUM1hpUA&t=191s)** — other thing called osteomalacia. Let me just tell you what that is. Osteomalacia is kind of
- **[03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzLGUM1hpUA&t=197s)** — soft bones in adults, and that is primarily from a vitamin D deficiency. When this occurs in
- **[03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzLGUM1hpUA&t=204s)** — children, we call that rickets. When we're dealing with osteoporosis or osteopenia, we're
- **[03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzLGUM1hpUA&t=208s)** — not just looking at a loss of calcium. We're looking at a vitamin K2 deficiency, a vitamin D3
- **[03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzLGUM1hpUA&t=215s)** — deficiency usually, which works with K2 together. So let's just start out with vitamin K2. Vitamin
- **[03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzLGUM1hpUA&t=222s)** — K2 is a fairly recently discovered vitamin. It's a fat soluble vitamin. It comes from fatty
- **[03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzLGUM1hpUA&t=229s)** — foods. It also can come from fermented foods. In Asia, they have something called Neda,
- **[03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzLGUM1hpUA&t=236s)** — which is fermented soybeans, and that is very high in vitamin K2. Vitamin K2 is also a raw
- **[04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzLGUM1hpUA&t=242s)** — sour crowd, but mainly it's in like a fatty sausage. It's in fatty cheese. It's even in
- **[04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzLGUM1hpUA&t=249s)** — egg yolks. It's in liver. And so what you need to know about that is that if you're on a low
- **[04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzLGUM1hpUA&t=254s)** — fat diet or you're taking certain medications that block vitamin K2 like statins, if you're
- **[04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzLGUM1hpUA&t=262s)** — on a blood thinner, or even antidepressants and acids, certain medications for high blood
- **[04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzLGUM1hpUA&t=266s)** — pressure, or even medications for erectile dysfunction, you're not going to get enough
- **[04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzLGUM1hpUA&t=272s)** — vitamin K2. So vitamin K2 is a really, really important, if not the most important
- **[04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzLGUM1hpUA&t=277s)** — vitamin for making your bones really, really solid and hard. But you also need vitamin D3
- **[04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzLGUM1hpUA&t=283s)** — with it. And vitamin D3 helps the absorption of calcium by a factor of 20x in the small
- **[04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzLGUM1hpUA&t=289s)** — intestine. And so vitamin D helps absorb calcium into the blood from the digestive system. And
- **[04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzLGUM1hpUA&t=296s)** — and drives it into the bone. So it's really important to understand what K2 does and to
- **[05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzLGUM1hpUA&t=302s)** — make sure either you get it in your diet or you're taking it as a supplement. If you're
- **[05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzLGUM1hpUA&t=306s)** — taking it as a supplement, I recommend the form that's called MK7, okay, versus other forms
- **[05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzLGUM1hpUA&t=313s)** — like MK4. MK7 is a natural form and it lasts about 48 times longer in your body versus
- **[05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzLGUM1hpUA&t=322s)** — the half life of MK4 with about 20,000 IUs of vitamin D3. Now another key vitamin for bone
- **[05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzLGUM1hpUA&t=330s)** — is vitamin A. Vitamin A. And I'm not talking about the precursor beta carotene. Retinol,
- **[05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzLGUM1hpUA&t=335s)** — which is the bioavailable true form of vitamin A, is really high in egg yolks. This is why
- **[05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzLGUM1hpUA&t=342s)** — eggs are just so important in many different ways in your diet, but especially to get
- **[05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzLGUM1hpUA&t=347s)** — enough vitamin A. Vitamin A is not just going to help you build bone, but it's also
- **[05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzLGUM1hpUA&t=350s)** — going to prevent some of the toxicities that potentially could occur from vitamin D, even
- **[05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzLGUM1hpUA&t=356s)** — though those would be very rare. I don't recommend getting your vitamin A from a
- **[06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzLGUM1hpUA&t=360s)** — supplement. Just get it from your food. Egg yolks, liver, or other organ meats. Vitamin
- **[06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzLGUM1hpUA&t=365s)** — A is in cheese, also in butter, and cow liver oil as well. And so vitamin D3, K2,
- **[06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzLGUM1hpUA&t=372s)** — and A are all fat soluble vitamins. So another thing to look out for or understand
- **[06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzLGUM1hpUA&t=378s)** — is that you need a good gallbladder and a good liver to produce the bile to absorb these
- **[06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzLGUM1hpUA&t=385s)** — nutrients. So if you had your gallbladder out or you have some type of problem with your liver,
- **[06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzLGUM1hpUA&t=390s)** — as in fatty liver, these reasons could be why you're not getting these nutrients. In
- **[06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzLGUM1hpUA&t=396s)** — which case you should probably just take some bile salts to help with the absorption. So we
- **[06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzLGUM1hpUA&t=400s)** — have to make sure that we're getting these nutrients from the diet. We have to make sure
- **[06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzLGUM1hpUA&t=404s)** — that nothing's countering those vitamins. We have to make sure we absorb them with the
- **[06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzLGUM1hpUA&t=409s)** — right things, like the bile salts. But we also have other things that help build your bone,
- **[06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzLGUM1hpUA&t=414s)** — like minerals. Yes, I would be taking some form of calcium if I had osteoporosis or
- **[06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzLGUM1hpUA&t=419s)** — osteopenia, but not as a standalone. I would make sure we would take all these other things
- **[07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzLGUM1hpUA&t=424s)** — as well. But I would not take the form of calcium that is not very bioavailable. That's
- **[07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzLGUM1hpUA&t=430s)** — calcium carbonate. And so many people are taking this type. Basically, it's like limestone.
- **[07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzLGUM1hpUA&t=435s)** — You'd be better off chewing on the cement outside your house because that's really what it
- **[07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzLGUM1hpUA&t=441s)** — is. It's just the form of calcium that has to go through like 12 different biochemical steps
- **[07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzLGUM1hpUA&t=447s)** — before it gets absorbed in your body. And if you're getting older, you may find that you
- **[07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzLGUM1hpUA&t=453s)** — don't have enough stomach acid to absorb this calcium. So that's another barrier. If
- **[07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzLGUM1hpUA&t=458s)** — you don't have the acid in the stomach, you're not going to be able to absorb the calcium,
- **[07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzLGUM1hpUA&t=463s)** — magnesium, phosphorus, and the trace minerals that I'm going to talk about next. And so the
- **[07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzLGUM1hpUA&t=467s)** — way you would know that you wouldn't have enough stomach acid is usually you have indigestion,
- **[07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzLGUM1hpUA&t=471s)** — bloating, or acid reflux. So the type of calcium I would take is like a calcium magnesium
- **[07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzLGUM1hpUA&t=477s)** — supplement. But try to get your calcium mostly from food. Dairy, sardines, deep leafy green
- **[08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzLGUM1hpUA&t=486s)** — vegetables all have a good amount of calcium and magnesium. And magnesium helps activate vitamin D.
- **[08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzLGUM1hpUA&t=495s)** — Also potassium is really important too. So you can get your magnesium and potassium from
- **[08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzLGUM1hpUA&t=501s)** — leafy greens like large salads. Now as far as the trace minerals, zinc, copper, and boron
- **[08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzLGUM1hpUA&t=509s)** — are the top trace minerals, but there's other ones too. So if you were to take like a
- **[08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzLGUM1hpUA&t=513s)** — trace mineral complex, that would be the best thing with emphasis with the zinc, boron,
- **[08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzLGUM1hpUA&t=520s)** — and the copper. These can activate certain proteins in bone. So those are really,
- **[08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzLGUM1hpUA&t=528s)** — really important as well. And boron helps you balance out the calcium and magnesium. It just
- **[08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzLGUM1hpUA&t=535s)** — helps you absorb those two minerals, as well as the activators of the proteins that help you
- **[09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzLGUM1hpUA&t=543s)** — make sure you have the best bioavailable type of protein. And that would be animal proteins.
- **[09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzLGUM1hpUA&t=549s)** — Eggs are the top protein. And then you have fish. Shellfish would be really, really important.
- **[09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzLGUM1hpUA&t=556s)** — Oysters, clams, shrimp are really good because that will not only give you high quality
- **[09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzLGUM1hpUA&t=562s)** — protein, but the trace minerals as well. But you might be saying, well, what about all the
- **[09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzLGUM1hpUA&t=566s)** — cholesterol? Well, guess what? Biles salts are made out of cholesterol. And you need cholesterol
- **[09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzLGUM1hpUA&t=571s)** — to make bile salts to help you absorb these fat soluble nutrients. And you also need cholesterol
- **[09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzLGUM1hpUA&t=577s)** — to help build hormones, sex hormones, specifically estrogen. It's not very surprising
- **[09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzLGUM1hpUA&t=585s)** — that many women after menopause end up with their bones becoming osteoporotic. And that has
- **[09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzLGUM1hpUA&t=592s)** — to do with this sudden drop or shift in this estrogen dropping down. So how do you build that
- **[09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzLGUM1hpUA&t=598s)** — up? Well, make sure you have all the precursors to making these hormones. And that would be
- **[10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzLGUM1hpUA&t=603s)** — like cholesterol. So as you approach menopause, you want to increase more cholesterol. Okay. And
- **[10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzLGUM1hpUA&t=609s)** — cholesterol does not come from plant foods. It comes from animal foods, eggs, butter,
- **[10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzLGUM1hpUA&t=616s)** — meats, things like that. And if you complement those foods with a large salad or vegetables
- **[10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzLGUM1hpUA&t=623s)** — each day, it can really help you regulate and moderate the amount of cholesterol going
- **[10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzLGUM1hpUA&t=627s)** — through the body. Not that you're concerned with that or not, but I think the balance of both of
- **[10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzLGUM1hpUA&t=633s)** — those types of foods, plant-based and animal-based are really important. Exercise would be an
- **[10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzLGUM1hpUA&t=639s)** — important thing to add into this program to stimulate the bone growth, which will also
- **[10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzLGUM1hpUA&t=647s)** — indirectly reduce stress because cortisol is very destructive on your bones. So if you're
- **[10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzLGUM1hpUA&t=657s)** — on top of the menopause situation where the adrenals have to back up your ovaries,
- **[11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzLGUM1hpUA&t=662s)** — that could be a big trigger for osteopenia or then osteoporosis. The other thing you need to
- **[11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzLGUM1hpUA&t=667s)** — know about osteoporosis is that that's a pretty severe situation and it's going to take a good
- **[11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzLGUM1hpUA&t=672s)** — amount of time to fix this problem. And it could take actually up to six years of healthy
- **[11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzLGUM1hpUA&t=678s)** — eating. But I wanted to give you this background information so you have all the
- **[11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzLGUM1hpUA&t=682s)** — different pieces to this puzzle. What's very interesting too about medication for osteoporosis
- **[11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzLGUM1hpUA&t=687s)** — is that some of these medications, real popular medications, increase the risk for
- **[11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzLGUM1hpUA&t=693s)** — fractures, which we're trying to avoid. Now since we emphasize probably the most important
- **[11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzLGUM1hpUA&t=699s)** — piece of this puzzle, which is K2, there's some additional information that you should
- **[11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzLGUM1hpUA&t=703s)** — know about that. And I put that video up right here. Check it out.

- **[00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d9XiDJCG4zs&t=0s)** — Big Pharma is terrified of vitamin D3. They have great influence over universities, especially Harvard University.
- **[00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d9XiDJCG4zs&t=7s)** — Harvard will not publish anything positive about vitamin D. The question is why? Because it competes directly with Big Pharma.
- **[00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d9XiDJCG4zs&t=15s)** — Many, many, many conditions that Big Pharma treats can be inexpensively corrected with vitamin D.
- **[00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d9XiDJCG4zs&t=21s)** — Let's just start with the precursor for vitamin D, cholesterol. The precursor to make vitamin D has also been attacked.
- **[00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d9XiDJCG4zs&t=27s)** — This is seed oils, right? Heart healthy. Why? Because it doesn't have any cholesterol. It's cholesterol free.
- **[00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d9XiDJCG4zs&t=34s)** — What about the sun? Has anyone ever told you to stay out of the sun? You're going to get skin cancer.
- **[00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d9XiDJCG4zs&t=38s)** — I want to share some interesting data with you. There's two main Big Pharma companies, Leo Pharma and another one that's called El Miro.
- **[00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d9XiDJCG4zs&t=45s)** — Both of these pharmaceutical companies specialize in dermatology, skin related issues.
- **[00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d9XiDJCG4zs&t=51s)** — Both of these companies have developed products in the past that had the ingredients of synthetic vitamin D.
- **[00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d9XiDJCG4zs&t=58s)** — One drug they combined vitamin D with corticosteroid cream. Another drug was just vitamin D.
- **[01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d9XiDJCG4zs&t=63s)** — And what were these for? Skin problems. These are the two companies that started this sun phobia, stay out of the sun campaign.
- **[01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d9XiDJCG4zs&t=70s)** — While they sell you their vitamin D products. Out of all the remedies that you can do for eczema and psoriasis, the sun is one of the best remedies.
- **[01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d9XiDJCG4zs&t=80s)** — And it causes the cholesterol in your skin to turn into vitamin D.
- **[01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d9XiDJCG4zs&t=85s)** — The most dangerous skin cancer, really stemming from a vitamin D deficiency.
- **[01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d9XiDJCG4zs&t=89s)** — It usually originates in areas that are not exposed to the sun.
- **[01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d9XiDJCG4zs&t=93s)** — You really need at least 10,000 IUs every single day to maintain a healthy vitamin D level.
- **[01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d9XiDJCG4zs&t=100s)** — Every aspect of your immune system has receptors for vitamin D.
- **[01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d9XiDJCG4zs&t=104s)** — Back in the early 1900s, we had sanitariums all over the world to get sunbathing, sun treatment.
- **[01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d9XiDJCG4zs&t=111s)** — They would basically lay out the sun to prevent TB and to handle various health conditions.
- **[01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d9XiDJCG4zs&t=117s)** — Until we developed something called antibiotics. And then you saw those sanitariums go away.
- **[02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d9XiDJCG4zs&t=123s)** — The amount of corruption and influence of big pharma has been widespread ever since that period of time.
- **[02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d9XiDJCG4zs&t=129s)** — I want you to hear a very short clip by Dr. William Grant, who has done extensive research in the area of vitamin D.
- **[02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d9XiDJCG4zs&t=137s)** — It's interesting to look at the number of papers published on vitamin D to give you an idea of how important vitamin D is.
- **[02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d9XiDJCG4zs&t=145s)** — According to PubMed.gov, there have been 84,532 papers published with vitamin D in the title on or abstract as of February 18, 2024, including 4668 in 2024.
- **[02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d9XiDJCG4zs&t=157s)** — The rate of publication has been greater than 4,000 papers per year starting in 2014.
- **[02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d9XiDJCG4zs&t=163s)** — Thus, it is the most studied bioactive molecule. Despite this record, there's still controversy regarding its health benefits.
- **[02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d9XiDJCG4zs&t=170s)** — Why the controversy? Well, big pharma and the medical system are not happy with vitamin D because it reduces their income and profits.
- **[03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d9XiDJCG4zs&t=180s)** — I listened to a presentation about the disinformation playbook by a representative of the Union Concerned Scientists and learned about the five pillars of the playbook.
- **[03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d9XiDJCG4zs&t=191s)** — These pillars include the fake, where counterfeit science is conducted and is tried to be passed off as legitimate research.
- **[03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d9XiDJCG4zs&t=201s)** — The main example of this for vitamin D is all the government-sponsored vitamin D randomized controlled trials, which are designed based on guidelines for pharmaceutical drugs, not nutrients.
- **[03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d9XiDJCG4zs&t=214s)** — And as a result, they don't show any benefit of vitamin D.
- **[03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d9XiDJCG4zs&t=218s)** — Then there's the blitz, harassing scientists who speak out with results reviews inconvenient for industry.
- **[03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d9XiDJCG4zs&t=225s)** — Back in 2018, there was a big hit piece on Michael Hollick in the New York Times saying, well, you can't be trusted because you took money from indoor tanning industry and the supplement industry.
- **[03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d9XiDJCG4zs&t=236s)** — Come on, give me a break.
- **[03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d9XiDJCG4zs&t=237s)** — The diversion, manufacturing uncertainty about science where little or none exists, again using the results from clinical trials to counter the results from observational studies.
- **[04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d9XiDJCG4zs&t=249s)** — Fourth, the screen. They buy credibility through alliances with academia or professional societies.
- **[04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d9XiDJCG4zs&t=256s)** — Well, Big Pharma funds all the medical universities to fund clinical trials, gives them lots of money and encourages them to ignore vitamin D.
- **[04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d9XiDJCG4zs&t=266s)** — And all your disease organizations take money from Big Pharma and of course represent their interests and are more interested in maintaining a membership base of people with disease rather than curing them.
- **[04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d9XiDJCG4zs&t=283s)** — Finally, there is the fix, manipulating government officials or processes to influence policy inappropriately.
- **[04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d9XiDJCG4zs&t=289s)** — As is well known, the Centers for Disease Control in the United States, the Food and Drug Administration and the National Institutes of Health have had major influence from Big Pharma.
- **[04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d9XiDJCG4zs&t=299s)** — That has changed in 2024 and this should result in changes regarding the acceptance of vitamin D.
- **[05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d9XiDJCG4zs&t=308s)** — There's tens of thousands of research studies on what vitamin D can do for cancer.
- **[05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d9XiDJCG4zs&t=313s)** — I mean, it's not a trickle of research, it's a flood of research and that's just cancer.
- **[05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d9XiDJCG4zs&t=319s)** — Vitamin D doesn't just help cancer one way, it's many different ways.
- **[05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d9XiDJCG4zs&t=322s)** — A lot of the research that shows that vitamin D doesn't help are on purpose.
- **[05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d9XiDJCG4zs&t=328s)** — In other words, I think Big Pharma has influenced a lot of the research on these topics.
- **[05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d9XiDJCG4zs&t=334s)** — All you have to do to sort that out is to look at the studies that don't show a favorable outcome.
- **[05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d9XiDJCG4zs&t=339s)** — And almost in every one of the studies, the amount of vitamin D that they use is so tiny.
- **[05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d9XiDJCG4zs&t=345s)** — And when you use just small amounts of vitamin D, you're not going to be able to create the effects.
- **[05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d9XiDJCG4zs&t=349s)** — Dr. Coimbra from Brazil, who developed the Coimbra protocol for autoimmune diseases, the results of using high doses of vitamin D3, it's in the 90 percentile as far as effectiveness.
- **[06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d9XiDJCG4zs&t=360s)** — And in a recent interview, which I will post, he told me this, that there's something called vitamin D resistance.
- **[06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d9XiDJCG4zs&t=366s)** — And this has to do with a genetic issue with vitamin D.
- **[06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d9XiDJCG4zs&t=371s)** — If your genes have some type of problem, you are vulnerable to having a vitamin D deficiency because there really is no test that you can know for sure if the vitamin D in your blood is going deep into the tissues, into the cells.
- **[06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d9XiDJCG4zs&t=387s)** — You may be seriously deficient or vulnerable to having an immune problem like some autoimmune disease.
- **[06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d9XiDJCG4zs&t=394s)** — This is also why it's so important to make sure that your vitamin D is at least 50 nanograms per milliliter.
- **[06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d9XiDJCG4zs&t=401s)** — I'll put the link down below where you can order a kit and you do a little blood spot on a piece of paper, send it in, and you can find out your vitamin D levels.
- **[06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d9XiDJCG4zs&t=408s)** — I think a lot of people have a problem with vitamin D just because their genetics are not allowing them to absorb vitamin D.
- **[06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d9XiDJCG4zs&t=416s)** — Even from the standpoint of what vitamin D does for inflammation, it can greatly reduce inflammation.
- **[07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d9XiDJCG4zs&t=423s)** — It's one of the most potent anti-inflammatories to protect you from getting cancer as well as viruses and things like that.
- **[07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d9XiDJCG4zs&t=429s)** — Cod liver oil also has a good amount of vitamin D.
- **[07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d9XiDJCG4zs&t=431s)** — One tablespoon of cod liver oil can give you 10,000 IUs of vitamin D3.
- **[07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d9XiDJCG4zs&t=436s)** — That's 20 minutes in the sun. If you haven't had your vitamin D tested, it's probably a good idea to get it tested.
- **[07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d9XiDJCG4zs&t=441s)** — And if you want more information about doing a home test, I will put that link down below.
- **[07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d9XiDJCG4zs&t=444s)** — But ideally, I would recommend to make sure your levels are above 50 nanograms per milliliter.

## Video 99: These Vitamin D Mistakes Are Bad

- **[00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdJDzdJjXXM&t=0s)** — I'd like to discuss the common mistakes people make when they're taking vitamin D. Vitamin D is
- **[00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdJDzdJjXXM&t=5s)** — the most important vitamin because it's involved in over 10% of all of our genetics. It's a fat
- **[00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdJDzdJjXXM&t=11s)** — soluble vitamin, which means that it absorbs better when you consume it with fat, whether it's
- **[00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdJDzdJjXXM&t=17s)** — MCT oil or olive oil or something like that. The absolute most important thing to know about
- **[00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdJDzdJjXXM&t=21s)** — vitamin D is that it won't work unless you have enough magnesium. The thing about magnesium,
- **[00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdJDzdJjXXM&t=26s)** — it's the second most important nutrient because it's involved with 300 different enzymes. Magnesium
- **[00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdJDzdJjXXM&t=33s)** — regulates excess amount of calcium that builds up in your arteries. You don't want to just take
- **[00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdJDzdJjXXM&t=38s)** — any old magnesium because the one called magnesium oxide, you do not want to take that. It only
- **[00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdJDzdJjXXM&t=43s)** — absorbs like 3-4%. And you're going to get diarrhea usually if you take more than that.
- **[00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdJDzdJjXXM&t=48s)** — A better one would be magnesium glycinate. You take that in the evening, it'll help you
- **[00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdJDzdJjXXM&t=53s)** — You get like an 80% absorption. If you take magnesium citrate, okay, that's fine too. The
- **[00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdJDzdJjXXM&t=59s)** — other side note I want to mention about magnesium is that the more vitamin D that you take,
- **[01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdJDzdJjXXM&t=65s)** — the more magnesium is going to be required. Some people that take vitamin D, they react,
- **[01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdJDzdJjXXM&t=70s)** — they get a symptom from it, whether it's nausea, heart palpitations, muscle cramps,
- **[01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdJDzdJjXXM&t=76s)** — sometimes it's a headache. Realize that's probably just a magnesium deficiency because
- **[01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdJDzdJjXXM&t=81s)** — the more vitamin D you take without magnesium, the more magnesium your body is going to have to
- **[01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdJDzdJjXXM&t=86s)** — pull from the reserves. And if you're already deficient, you're going to be really deficient
- **[01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdJDzdJjXXM&t=90s)** — now, thereby giving you more symptoms, which might happen more in the early morning when you
- **[01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdJDzdJjXXM&t=95s)** — wake up because that's when you have the lowest amount of magnesium in the body. Other
- **[01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdJDzdJjXXM&t=99s)** — mistake that people make with vitamin D is they don't take it with vitamin K2. Vitamin K2
- **[01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdJDzdJjXXM&t=105s)** — is another cold factor. Very, very important because think about it, vitamin D helps you
- **[01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdJDzdJjXXM&t=109s)** — absorb calcium in the blood, right? Well, K2 takes that calcium in the blood, drives it into
- **[01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdJDzdJjXXM&t=116s)** — the bone and your teeth. It keeps the calcium out of the soft tissues. What type of K2 do
- **[02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdJDzdJjXXM&t=123s)** — we need? The MKV7 version is really good if you have a lot of calcium buildup in your
- **[02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdJDzdJjXXM&t=128s)** — arteries. And it's also really good for cancer, believe it or not. And the amount that I
- **[02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdJDzdJjXXM&t=134s)** — would recommend would be 100 micrograms for every 10,000 I use of vitamin D3. Next point is
- **[02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdJDzdJjXXM&t=142s)** — another cold factor, zinc. And one of the things it does is it helps you convert cholesterol
- **[02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdJDzdJjXXM&t=147s)** — into vitamin D. I would recommend if you're taking 10,000 I use of vitamin D3 to take like
- **[02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdJDzdJjXXM&t=152s)** — 20 milligrams of zinc, zinc does a lot. In fact, it's a cold factor for all sex hormones.
- **[02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdJDzdJjXXM&t=157s)** — Next point I want to bring up is the mistake of not taking enough vitamin D3. If you take
- **[02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdJDzdJjXXM&t=162s)** — the typical recommended amount, which is between 600 to 800 I use, it's not going to
- **[02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdJDzdJjXXM&t=168s)** — do anything. You need daily vitamin D3 of at least 6,000 to 8,000 to 10,000 I use every
- **[02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdJDzdJjXXM&t=177s)** — single day. And that data is not really understood by some of these researchers. And
- **[03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdJDzdJjXXM&t=182s)** — so when they do studies, they might give the people in the study vitamin D once a week,
- **[03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdJDzdJjXXM&t=187s)** — or once a month, or even once a year. You're not going to see a lot of great results with that.
- **[03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdJDzdJjXXM&t=193s)** — On top of the fact that they don't like to publish positive things about vitamin D
- **[03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdJDzdJjXXM&t=198s)** — that are literally free. You can get from the sun, Dr. Michael Hollick, one of the pioneers
- **[03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdJDzdJjXXM&t=204s)** — in vitamin D research, recommends 10,000 I use every single day. And he talks about this,
- **[03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdJDzdJjXXM&t=209s)** — you're not going to get any toxic effects from that. Dr. Bruce Hollis also personally
- **[03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdJDzdJjXXM&t=214s)** — takes 10,000 I use of vitamin D3 every single day. A big part of the medical profession
- **[03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdJDzdJjXXM&t=219s)** — scares people about taking too much vitamin D3. They talk about the toxic effect. All it takes
- **[03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdJDzdJjXXM&t=224s)** — is a little fear like that to make someone hesitant. But if you look at the actual data,
- **[03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdJDzdJjXXM&t=229s)** — and I've done a serious dive into this topic, you would have to take hundreds of thousands
- **[03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdJDzdJjXXM&t=234s)** — of vitamin D3 every single day for months to develop a toxic effect. The point is that when
- **[04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdJDzdJjXXM&t=242s)** — we're talking about just 10,000 I use, or even up to 50,000 I use, and you're taking also the
- **[04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdJDzdJjXXM&t=247s)** — cofactors, magnesium, K2, the zinc, all three protect against the toxicity because it helps
- **[04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdJDzdJjXXM&t=253s)** — control calcium. And just as a side note on that, if you're taking high doses of vitamin D3
- **[04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdJDzdJjXXM&t=258s)** — and you're drinking the water, and you're taking the cofactors, one more thing you could
- **[04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdJDzdJjXXM&t=262s)** — do, you could actually just avoid taking calcium supplements and also foods that are high in
- **[04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdJDzdJjXXM&t=268s)** — calcium like dairy. These are all just precautionary things if someone needs to take high doses
- **[04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdJDzdJjXXM&t=274s)** — of vitamin D3. Now when I'm talking about high doses, I'm really talking about maybe doses over
- **[04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdJDzdJjXXM&t=280s)** — 30, 40, 50,000 I use up to 100,000 I use per day. Now make note of this. I didn't say
- **[04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdJDzdJjXXM&t=288s)** — toxic doses. Okay, I said high amounts. There's a big difference. And of course,
- **[04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdJDzdJjXXM&t=294s)** — I'm just giving you data to research. I'm not telling you to do it. Check with your doctor
- **[04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdJDzdJjXXM&t=298s)** — before implementing any of the things I am mentioning. Another mistake that people make
- **[05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdJDzdJjXXM&t=302s)** — with vitamin D is taking vitamin D2. Vitamin D2 does not even come close to working like
- **[05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdJDzdJjXXM&t=309s)** — vitamin D3. You're going to need a lot more of D2 to achieve the effects of D3. The other
- **[05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdJDzdJjXXM&t=314s)** — important thing to do is to actually get a vitamin D test. And when you get a test,
- **[05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdJDzdJjXXM&t=319s)** — make sure you take your last vitamin D like three days before the test. So that way we
- **[05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdJDzdJjXXM&t=323s)** — get more of an accurate blood level of vitamin D3. The vitamin D in the blood is not the active
- **[05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdJDzdJjXXM&t=329s)** — form. So in other words, you could have this so-called normal vitamin D level and be extremely
- **[05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdJDzdJjXXM&t=335s)** — deficient in the active form of vitamin D deep into the cells. Other points about vitamin D,
- **[05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdJDzdJjXXM&t=340s)** — if you're on statins, if you're on steroids, both of those things are going to inhibit
- **[05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdJDzdJjXXM&t=348s)** — your ability to make vitamin D and allow vitamin D to work in your body. Just think about statins,
- **[05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdJDzdJjXXM&t=353s)** — right? That's going to lower cholesterol. Well, where does vitamin D come from? It comes from
- **[05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdJDzdJjXXM&t=357s)** — cholesterol. If you're going to get your vitamin D from the sun, realize that you're going to
- **[06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdJDzdJjXXM&t=361s)** — get it if you expose yourself between 10 a.m. and 2 p.m. in the summer. Also, you're not
- **[06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdJDzdJjXXM&t=367s)** — going to get a lot of vitamin D in the early morning or the late afternoon. You really
- **[06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdJDzdJjXXM&t=372s)** — have to expose a good portion of your body. If you do that and everything is right, you
- **[06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdJDzdJjXXM&t=376s)** — might get 10,000 IU's of vitamin D3 in maybe like 20 minutes to a half hour. Make sure you
- **[06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdJDzdJjXXM&t=381s)** — don't let yourself get burned. Get slightly pink, go in the shade, and then the next day keep
- **[06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdJDzdJjXXM&t=386s)** — working on a tan. A tan is really just an increase in melanin that allows this pigment
- **[06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdJDzdJjXXM&t=392s)** — to then protect you against the UV. Another thing not to take with vitamin D3 is iron.
- **[06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdJDzdJjXXM&t=397s)** — They compete. If you're going to take iron, take it at a different time. The other thing is
- **[06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdJDzdJjXXM&t=401s)** — sunblockers or sunscreen. What happens is that most of the sunblockers will block a type
- **[06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdJDzdJjXXM&t=406s)** — of ultraviolet radiation called UVB, which is the type that you need to make vitamin D. But
- **[06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdJDzdJjXXM&t=412s)** — those sunscreens don't block the UVA, which is the stuff that ages your skin. So here you are
- **[06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdJDzdJjXXM&t=418s)** — protecting your skin by rubbing on this sunscreen when it's not filtering out the entire spectrum
- **[07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdJDzdJjXXM&t=425s)** — of ultraviolet light. It's only blocking your ability to produce vitamin D3, unfortunately. I
- **[07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdJDzdJjXXM&t=431s)** — hope you learned some of the mistakes and some of the things that you can do to correct
- **[07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdJDzdJjXXM&t=434s)** — those mistakes with vitamin D3. And if you have not seen my video I did when I interviewed
- **[07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdJDzdJjXXM&t=439s)** — Dr. Bruce Hollis, you should check that out. It was fascinating. And I'll put that up right here.

- **[00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yEzFQzm0H40&t=0s)** — The number one vitamin deficiency in high blood pressure, aka hypertension, is what we're going
- **[00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yEzFQzm0H40&t=6s)** — to talk about. This is not just for high blood pressure, it's for anything related to the
- **[00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yEzFQzm0H40&t=10s)** — arteries. Black in the arteries, calcium in the arteries, this information is so vitally important.
- **[00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yEzFQzm0H40&t=17s)** — Your doctors will not tell you this because they're simply not trained. Despite massive
- **[00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yEzFQzm0H40&t=23s)** — If you have high blood pressure, the doctors should always check for vitamin D levels. Vitamin D is
- **[00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yEzFQzm0H40&t=32s)** — the most important vitamin for the inside of the artery, yet it's completely ignored. A person
- **[00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yEzFQzm0H40&t=38s)** — instead is put on medication. I mean, if you look up the actual cause of hypertension,
- **[00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yEzFQzm0H40&t=43s)** — 90% of it is called essential. What does that mean? It means unknown cause. I'm going to be
- **[00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yEzFQzm0H40&t=48s)** — tell you that that essential hypertension is a vitamin D deficiency. If we take a look at an
- **[00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yEzFQzm0H40&t=54s)** — artery, you have a very thin single cell layer of tissue called the endothelial layer. That is
- **[01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yEzFQzm0H40&t=63s)** — inside the artery, just constantly reacting with things that are in the artery itself.
- **[01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yEzFQzm0H40&t=68s)** — Whether there's too much sugar or junk food or whatever, that little layer is going to
- **[01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yEzFQzm0H40&t=74s)** — do something. And if a person is deficient in vitamin D, they lose massive protection against
- **[01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yEzFQzm0H40&t=81s)** — that little layer of cells. And now the person is very susceptible to the start of many problems.
- **[01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yEzFQzm0H40&t=88s)** — You have to realize that vitamin D is one of the most potent natural substances in existence.
- **[01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yEzFQzm0H40&t=93s)** — There was one study that I found that evaluated over a thousand different compounds to see which
- **[01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yEzFQzm0H40&t=100s)** — most potently affected this endothelial layer. And guess what? It was vitamin D. And you're about
- **[01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yEzFQzm0H40&t=107s)** — to learn why vitamin D is so important. Number one, it's a potent anti-inflammatory. Number
- **[01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yEzFQzm0H40&t=112s)** — two, it's a potent antioxidant. And number three, it directly increases something called
- **[01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yEzFQzm0H40&t=117s)** — nitric oxide. Nitric oxide is something that keeps the arteries in a state of vasodilation
- **[02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yEzFQzm0H40&t=124s)** — relaxation. When you don't have enough nitric oxide, the artery starts getting tight and your
- **[02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yEzFQzm0H40&t=130s)** — blood pressure starts going up. Just think about nitric oxide as something that lowers
- **[02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yEzFQzm0H40&t=135s)** — blood pressure. When that little layer, the endothelial layer becomes dysfunctional,
- **[02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yEzFQzm0H40&t=140s)** — you don't produce nitric oxide anymore. The whole thing is controlled by vitamin D.
- **[02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yEzFQzm0H40&t=145s)** — Vitamin D helps increase calcium absorption in the intestine by 20 times so it can support
- **[02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yEzFQzm0H40&t=154s)** — your bone health. Calcium has another very important purpose in the body of providing
- **[02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yEzFQzm0H40&t=160s)** — communication signaling between cells. This is why the body has all these different systems
- **[02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yEzFQzm0H40&t=165s)** — to keep calcium very regulated and keep it in the blood at all costs. Our bodies are not
- **[02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yEzFQzm0H40&t=175s)** — that controls calcium in the bone or in the blood. What happens if you don't have enough
- **[03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yEzFQzm0H40&t=180s)** — vitamin D to calcium in the blood? You might absorb some of the calcium from the food you
- **[03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yEzFQzm0H40&t=185s)** — eat, but not very much. When you have low vitamin D, you're going to also have low
- **[03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yEzFQzm0H40&t=191s)** — amounts of calcium and your body does not like that. It has a plan B. I got to bring
- **[03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yEzFQzm0H40&t=196s)** — up something new that a lot of people don't know about, but it's something called the
- **[03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yEzFQzm0H40&t=201s)** — parathyroid. There's four glands that are on your thyroid gland. The parathyroid hormone
- **[03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yEzFQzm0H40&t=207s)** — is a backup to vitamin D. If you're low in vitamin D, the parathyroid hormone is going to
- **[03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yEzFQzm0H40&t=214s)** — increase and grab calcium from your bone and put it into your blood to make sure that there's
- **[03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yEzFQzm0H40&t=223s)** — always calcium in the blood. What happens if you're chronically low in vitamin D, like the
- **[03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yEzFQzm0H40&t=229s)** — majority of the population, you're going to get a dysfunction of the parathyroid hormone. It's
- **[03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yEzFQzm0H40&t=235s)** — robbing a lot of calcium from that bone and creating osteoporosis, which is a lack of
- **[04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yEzFQzm0H40&t=241s)** — certain minerals in the bone. And now the bone is going to be very porous. It's going to
- **[04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yEzFQzm0H40&t=245s)** — have holes in it. But at the same time, you're going to have a lot of calcification
- **[04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yEzFQzm0H40&t=250s)** — in the arteries, in the soft tissue, all because the parathyroid hormone is working like
- **[04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yEzFQzm0H40&t=256s)** — in excess. They call this a secondary hyperparathyroidism, excess secretion
- **[04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yEzFQzm0H40&t=261s)** — of the parathyroid hormone by the parathyroid gland in response to low calcium. Your joints
- **[04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yEzFQzm0H40&t=266s)** — are filling up with this calcium. Other causes can stem from a vitamin D deficiency. Low
- **[04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yEzFQzm0H40&t=272s)** — vitamin D causes low calcium and causes the parathyroid to co-haywire. Why am I making such
- **[04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yEzFQzm0H40&t=286s)** — a big mistake? I'm not going to give too much vitamin D to a person. It's going to develop
- **[04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yEzFQzm0H40&t=290s)** — a toxic effect. This is another confusion. First of all, I haven't found any type of clinical
- **[04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yEzFQzm0H40&t=296s)** — data to show that's true. I've talked to Professor Bruce Hollis, who is a pioneer in
- **[05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yEzFQzm0H40&t=301s)** — vitamin D research, and he told me that he's never seen a case where vitamin D in higher
- **[05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yEzFQzm0H40&t=306s)** — amounts caused this toxic hypercalcemia effect. But a chronic vitamin D deficiency
- **[05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yEzFQzm0H40&t=314s)** — causing this calcium problem is way, way more common, and that's what we should be focusing
- **[05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yEzFQzm0H40&t=319s)** — on. Plus, if we add this additional data of adding vitamin K2 to help mobilize calcium
- **[05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yEzFQzm0H40&t=324s)** — from the arteries, and more importantly, adding magnesium when we take vitamin D3,
- **[05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yEzFQzm0H40&t=329s)** — because magnesium is literally the regulator of this excess calcium. Magnesium alone prevents
- **[05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yEzFQzm0H40&t=335s)** — so many cardiovascular problems. Magnesium removes excessive calcium to allow the normal
- **[05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yEzFQzm0H40&t=340s)** — contraction relaxation, and your arteries have contractile tissue, and they're able to relax as
- **[05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yEzFQzm0H40&t=346s)** — well. I want to circle back to this vitamin K2 for a second, because vitamin K2 actually helps
- **[05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yEzFQzm0H40&t=350s)** — remove calcium from the arteries as well. It then removes the calcium and puts it deep into
- **[05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yEzFQzm0H40&t=356s)** — the teeth, into the bone. It makes the bones really, really solid. But you better take
- **[06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yEzFQzm0H40&t=360s)** — vitamin D with K2. Why? If someone is chronically low in vitamin D3, what's going to
- **[06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yEzFQzm0H40&t=367s)** — is the arteries are going to be more susceptible to inflammation, plaque hardening of the arteries.
- **[06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yEzFQzm0H40&t=373s)** — And I'm not even talking about the arteries of the heart. I'm talking about peripheral arteries
- **[06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yEzFQzm0H40&t=376s)** — through the entire body. That's one of the biggest risks for amputation of the lower part
- **[06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yEzFQzm0H40&t=382s)** — of your extremities, your feet. Vitamin D can potently protect the arteries. They'll help
- **[06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yEzFQzm0H40&t=387s)** — the arteries become less inflamed. They will support the vascular cells for nitric oxide.
- **[06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yEzFQzm0H40&t=392s)** — Combined with vitamin K2 and magnesium, you can really keep that calcium from developing in
- **[06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yEzFQzm0H40&t=397s)** — the wrong place, the soft tissues. If I personally had high blood pressure, I would be taking
- **[06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yEzFQzm0H40&t=401s)** — 30,000 IUs of vitamin D3 every single day. The best source of vitamin D is the sun, but of
- **[06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yEzFQzm0H40&t=407s)** — course it's hard to get enough sun. In the summer, when you can get sun, make sure a good
- **[06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yEzFQzm0H40&t=412s)** — part of your body is exposed to sun. About 40 minutes in the sun will give you 20,000 IUs
- **[06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yEzFQzm0H40&t=417s)** — which is not a significant amount if you look at the toxicity of just that sun exposure.
- **[07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yEzFQzm0H40&t=423s)** — Because even some lifeguards that are exposed to the sun, they'll get about 100,000 IUs of
- **[07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yEzFQzm0H40&t=429s)** — vitamin D3 in a given day. The whole point is to get as much sun as you can without
- **[07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yEzFQzm0H40&t=433s)** — burning yourself. Get slightly pink and then come out of the sun so you can develop a tan. But
- **[07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yEzFQzm0H40&t=439s)** — that regular exposure is really really important, especially in preventing high blood pressure. If
- **[07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yEzFQzm0H40&t=443s)** — you already have high blood pressure, you should try the combination of vitamin D3 with the
- **[07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yEzFQzm0H40&t=447s)** — magnesium and K2 and just see what happens. Check with your doctor before implementing anything
- **[07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yEzFQzm0H40&t=452s)** — that I have to say because I'm not trying to bypass your doctor. I'm just trying to educate
- **[07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yEzFQzm0H40&t=456s)** — you on some additional things that I think are really really important. Thanks for watching.

- **[00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxZiBTWxSU&t=9s)** — I'm going to sort all that out. On one hand, they'll tell you, keep your vitamin D not over 4000 IUs to keep everything safe.
- **[00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxZiBTWxSU&t=16s)** — But on the other hand, if you need a therapeutic dosage to correct a major illness, you're going to have to use amounts much, much higher than that.
- **[00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxZiBTWxSU&t=25s)** — But the problem with that is the medical institutions will tell you those levels are toxic. They're dangerous.
- **[00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxZiBTWxSU&t=32s)** — Vitamin D is the most important vitamin. Why? Because it's involved with 2500 different genes.
- **[00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxZiBTWxSU&t=41s)** — No other nutrient that is in our food is involved with even close to that many different things.
- **[00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxZiBTWxSU&t=48s)** — The other thing to know is there's no agreed upon blood level of vitamin D. It's all over the place.
- **[00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxZiBTWxSU&t=54s)** — Some doctors say that you'll be fine with 20 to 30 nanograms per milliliter.
- **[00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxZiBTWxSU&t=59s)** — Yet other doctors will say you can go up to 150 nanograms per milliliter.
- **[01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxZiBTWxSU&t=65s)** — The interesting thing about the blood level of vitamin D is that it's not very well correlated with the vitamin D inside your cells.
- **[01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxZiBTWxSU&t=73s)** — Most medical journals do not like to publish anything positive about vitamin D. Why?
- **[01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxZiBTWxSU&t=79s)** — It competes with Big Pharma because you can get vitamin D for free from the sun.
- **[01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxZiBTWxSU&t=84s)** — So don't expect a lot of vitamin D research in the future, especially using higher amounts.
- **[01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxZiBTWxSU&t=89s)** — Their goal is to make vitamin D very, very dangerous and toxic at low amounts.
- **[01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxZiBTWxSU&t=96s)** — It's also virtually impossible to get your vitamin D levels from your food. It's just not in our diet.
- **[01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxZiBTWxSU&t=102s)** — So to start this presentation, let's give you a little foundation on my whiteboard.
- **[01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxZiBTWxSU&t=106s)** — Check this out. It looks complex. It's really simple. Up here you have the vitamin D starting source.
- **[01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxZiBTWxSU&t=112s)** — You have the sun, food, or supplements.
- **[01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxZiBTWxSU&t=116s)** — And most doctors know the pathway to turn this type of vitamin D through the liver, through the kidney, into the cell to control bone, the skeletal system.
- **[02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxZiBTWxSU&t=127s)** — But what most doctors don't know is there's two different systems for vitamin D.
- **[02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxZiBTWxSU&t=132s)** — One system is all about calcium and bone, and that is all the non-calcium functions of vitamin D, especially the immune system, the prostate, other glands, the skin, the gut, the brain, the muscles.
- **[02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxZiBTWxSU&t=145s)** — This other system of vitamin D that controls all this other stuff is separate from this system right here.
- **[02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxZiBTWxSU&t=151s)** — In other words, it doesn't have to go through the liver and the kidney and all that.
- **[02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxZiBTWxSU&t=155s)** — And just to make this really simple, let's pretend this is vitamin D coming into the body.
- **[02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxZiBTWxSU&t=160s)** — It goes to the liver. It attaches to a protein. Now, why would it attach to a protein?
- **[02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxZiBTWxSU&t=164s)** — So it can actually stay in the blood for a longer period of time because the half-life of this right here is 24 hours.
- **[02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxZiBTWxSU&t=172s)** — So to increase the half-life to three to four weeks, you need to connect it to a protein.
- **[02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxZiBTWxSU&t=177s)** — Okay, so it can be stored in the blood. And then when you need it, it goes through the kidney and it detaches.
- **[03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxZiBTWxSU&t=183s)** — So this vitamin D can go into the cell and eventually into the bone.
- **[03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxZiBTWxSU&t=187s)** — But with this other system right here, what you need to know is that the blood vitamin D that's attached to that protein is not going to be going into this system.
- **[03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxZiBTWxSU&t=196s)** — Only a tiny bit of the vitamin D in your blood is going to go into this system if you have damage to the liver, if you're pregnant, if you're on birth control pills, hormonal placement therapy, if you have cancer or viruses.
- **[03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxZiBTWxSU&t=210s)** — The more that this protein is stuck really hard to that vitamin D and it takes a lot more of it to release.
- **[03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxZiBTWxSU&t=218s)** — And this is why you only get just tiny amounts from the blood into all these other sources.
- **[03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxZiBTWxSU&t=224s)** — So then the big question is, where is the vitamin D coming from? It's coming from either vitamin D in your food or the supplements or the sun.
- **[03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxZiBTWxSU&t=233s)** — Most of the research done on vitamin D is done on this system.
- **[03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxZiBTWxSU&t=238s)** — And so everything revolves around these low numbers, 600 to 800 IU, as well as the blood levels of vitamin D being between 25 and 30 nanograms per milliliter.
- **[04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxZiBTWxSU&t=250s)** — That might be sufficient for the bones, but not for this system right here.
- **[04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxZiBTWxSU&t=253s)** — Now, on top of everything, you have other things that can block the sun and other supplements, air pollution, sunscreens.
- **[04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxZiBTWxSU&t=263s)** — And it's interesting how a lot of health problems started to increase right after that very stupid recommendation.
- **[04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxZiBTWxSU&t=271s)** — The more gut inflammation you have, the less you're going to be able to absorb vitamin D.
- **[04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxZiBTWxSU&t=274s)** — If you have a magnesium deficiency, which most people do, you're not going to get this right through in here.
- **[04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxZiBTWxSU&t=280s)** — The majority of people have some type of genetic problem that prevents them from absorbing vitamin D.
- **[04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxZiBTWxSU&t=286s)** — Also, depending on your latitude, how close do you live to the equator versus living further up in northern America where you're going to get less sun.
- **[04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxZiBTWxSU&t=296s)** — Also, your altitude matters. If you live in Colorado, you'll get more vitamin D because you're very high altitudes in the mountains versus somewhere at sea level, you're going to get less vitamin D.
- **[05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxZiBTWxSU&t=308s)** — Also, depending on the season, in the winter, you don't get virtually any vitamin D from the sun.
- **[05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxZiBTWxSU&t=313s)** — Obesity can also disperse your vitamin D. The older you are, the less vitamin D you're going to absorb.
- **[05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxZiBTWxSU&t=319s)** — If you have insulin resistance, that's a pre-diabetic situation. If you don't have enough cholesterol, let's say, for example, you're on a statin drug which blocks cholesterol.
- **[05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxZiBTWxSU&t=328s)** — Did you know that you need cholesterol to make vitamin D3?
- **[05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxZiBTWxSU&t=331s)** — Also, if you don't have a gallbladder, you need the bile to help you extract this fat-soluble nutrient vitamin D3.
- **[05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxZiBTWxSU&t=337s)** — So, if someone is fairly healthy and they don't have any of these problems, they would need between 6,000 and 10,000 IUs of vitamin D3 to maintain this system right here. Just to maintain it.
- **[05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxZiBTWxSU&t=350s)** — Alright, now let's go back to where I left off from.
- **[05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxZiBTWxSU&t=353s)** — So now you know there's two different systems of vitamin D. One for the bone, one for everything else.
- **[05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxZiBTWxSU&t=358s)** — The other really important point I want to emphasize is when you take vitamin D, it should be daily, not weekly.
- **[06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxZiBTWxSU&t=364s)** — Because the lion's share of vitamin D that feeds this other non-calcium system comes from the diet, sun, or supplements that you would have to get exposed to from the sun or take supplements every single day.
- **[06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxZiBTWxSU&t=375s)** — And the more problems you have, the more vitamin D you need to take to create this therapeutic dosage.
- **[06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxZiBTWxSU&t=381s)** — One really important thing to know is that a therapeutic dosage, which is higher amounts, does not mean it's a toxic dosage.
- **[06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxZiBTWxSU&t=389s)** — There's some fascinating information by an ophthalmologist out of Germany who wrote a book on high doses of vitamin D and glaucoma.
- **[06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxZiBTWxSU&t=398s)** — He has found amazing results by giving his patients high doses of vitamin D3 and getting results with glaucoma and many other different eye abnormalities.
- **[06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxZiBTWxSU&t=409s)** — He said to create a therapeutic range, you have to get the blood levels between 60 and 80 nanograms per milliliter.
- **[06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxZiBTWxSU&t=415s)** — And what you're going to get is a remodeling of the eye.
- **[06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxZiBTWxSU&t=419s)** — You have to realize that your immune system already has the ability to kill cancer and viruses if it has enough vitamin D.
- **[07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxZiBTWxSU&t=428s)** — These viruses and cancer even create an environment where vitamin D doesn't work too well.
- **[07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxZiBTWxSU&t=432s)** — They can even make that protein that's involved with binding to vitamin D extremely tight.
- **[07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxZiBTWxSU&t=439s)** — So how do we counter this? Well, the only way is to increase your vitamin D3, especially for autoimmune issues, for cancer, for infections.
- **[07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxZiBTWxSU&t=447s)** — But on the flip side, you've been told that vitamin D is toxic in certain amounts.
- **[07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxZiBTWxSU&t=452s)** — Vitamin D3 toxicity is extremely rare, and you would have to take hundreds of milligrams of vitamin D3 for months to create this hypercalcemia.
- **[07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxZiBTWxSU&t=466s)** — Personally, from looking at this information, I think that the real problem from toxicity of vitamin D3 comes when you don't take the cofactors.
- **[07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxZiBTWxSU&t=475s)** — Vitamin K2 and zinc also indirectly affects calcium.
- **[07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxZiBTWxSU&t=479s)** — I mean, if you think about it, magnesium also greatly reduces the chance of getting kidney stones, which usually comes with hypercalcemia.
- **[08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxZiBTWxSU&t=486s)** — What you'd have to do is you'd have to drink more water to keep it diluted and keep it from being saturated.
- **[08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxZiBTWxSU&t=492s)** — Also, magnesium greatly decreases the saturation of calcium stones.
- **[08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxZiBTWxSU&t=498s)** — And if someone's going to take a maintenance dosage of 10,000 I use, that would be equivalent to being out in the sun for 20 minutes.
- **[08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxZiBTWxSU&t=508s)** — 20,000 is being on the sun for 40 minutes.
- **[08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxZiBTWxSU&t=512s)** — Another interesting point that Bruce Hollis talked about is called the Vital Study.
- **[08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxZiBTWxSU&t=516s)** — This was a bogus study that cost the taxpayers $30 million.
- **[08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxZiBTWxSU&t=523s)** — And this research, based on what Bruce Hollis told me, was done to invalidate vitamin D, not support it.
- **[08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxZiBTWxSU&t=530s)** — It's obvious that Big Pharma was probably involved with this study indirectly because the odds of the medical industry doing more research in vitamin D are greatly diminished after that study.
- **[09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxZiBTWxSU&t=541s)** — So with this knowledge, I think that you don't have to worry about the toxicity effects.
- **[09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxZiBTWxSU&t=546s)** — And if you haven't seen this video on vitamin D, I think you're really going to enjoy it. Check it out.

- **[00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sYMKOVAIcUg&t=0s)** — Now, you've probably heard of the vagus nerve and the importance of it. And there's all sorts of videos on it. There are certain types of therapy that people do for the vagus nerve. But I think in this video, it's going to be very important for you to understand the number one reason why your vagus nerve might not be working, as well as a very important function of the vagus nerve that you also might not be aware of, which is the production of hydrochloric acid. The acid in your stomach is regulated by the tone
- **[00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sYMKOVAIcUg&t=29s)** — of your vagus nerve. So this leads to a huge chain of a lot of bad things that can happen to your digestion. But if you know the simplicity of how to fix it, boy, you can turn things around real quick and improve a lot of digestive problems. Okay. All right. So what is the main neurotransmitter involved in the vagus nerve? Acetylcholine. And acetylcholine needs vitamin B1. Okay, very, very important. And B1 is a very
- **[00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sYMKOVAIcUg&t=59s)** — common deficiency with so many people because they're doing too many carbohydrates, they're going through too much stress, they might drink a lot of coffee or tea. There's a whole series of reasons why you might be deficient in B1. If you don't have enough B1, that vagus nerve cannot make the hydrochloric acid that you need. And so just hear me out on what happens when you don't have enough hydrochloric acid. Now there's other reasons why you might not have hydrochloric acid. Let's say you're getting older, or you take an antacid,
- **[01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sYMKOVAIcUg&t=89s)** — or you're on antibiotics, or you don't have enough salt in your diet. Regardless of the cause, that hydrochloric acid is very, very, very important. It should be between one and three, extremely acidic. If it's not the correct pH, the valve in the top of the stomach won't close. So you're going to get acid reflux, you're going to get GERD, you're going to have heartburn. Okay, that's number one. And you may have also the hoarseness in the throat as well because of the acid and enzymes that are leaking up or regurgitating up into your esophagus.
- **[01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sYMKOVAIcUg&t=119s)** — Literally dissolving your tissue. You can't digest protein too well. So the protein you eat doesn't break down into amino acids, and that can increase your risk of getting allergies and give you bloating and constipation. And by the way, a really good remedy for constipation is vitamin B1. Why? Because it not only increases the digestion because it increases acid in your stomach, it also increases something called peristalsis or the pumping action of your colon. So without this hydrochloric acid,
- **[02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sYMKOVAIcUg&t=149s)** — you don't digest protein, you don't absorb minerals like iron, like calcium, like magnesium, like potassium. So you become anemic. You also are more susceptible to getting H. pylori, right? Which then can create gastritis or an ulcer. Just as a side note, if you have H. pylori, a really good remedy is sulfurofane. Okay, and just what happens is that sulfurofane is in cabbage, it's in broccoli sprouts, it's in a lot of the cruciferous vegetables. The other thing you're at risk for when you don't have
- **[02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sYMKOVAIcUg&t=179s)** — enough stomach acid is stomach cancer, as well as an increase in pathogens going right through the stomach into the small intestine. And what happens next is you start to get microbes in the small intestine, you shouldn't have a lot of bacteria, and because then you get this thing called small intestinal bacterial overgrowth. And then those microbes compete for food. So they start stealing nutrition, and you have a lot of bloating and gas. And the more fiber you eat, the worse
- **[03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sYMKOVAIcUg&t=209s)** — it is because you're getting this abnormal fermentation. And then the more probiotics you have, the worse things get. And this is all because you don't have that acid in your stomach to kill off the microbes. The acid in the stomach also triggers the release of bile. The bile also helps to act as a detergent to kill off microbes in the small intestine. That's why the only part of the small intestine that can help you reabsorb these bile salts. It's the very last part before it goes into the large intestine.
- **[03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sYMKOVAIcUg&t=239s)** — It gets absorbed and it gets recycled. So you recycle like 95% of your bile salts because you need them as a detergent to kill off microbes in the small intestine, as well as extract nutrients from your food, which you're not going to do if you don't have enough bile because you don't have enough acid because you don't have enough B1. So now all this undigested material ends up in the large intestine. Boy, there's a lot of issues that occur there because your large intestine is not necessarily meant for
- **[04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sYMKOVAIcUg&t=269s)** — a complete digestion of proteins and these other things. 90% of all your digestion occurs in the small intestine. Large intestine is more for fermentation of fiber or recycling of these electrolytes. So you can imagine that the now the large intestine is stuck with this big job of trying to digest things. And you just have all sorts of digestive problems. You might have gas, diarrhea, constipation, and then you might get inflammation. Okay, that then leads to leaky gut. And then you have immune problems and
- **[04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sYMKOVAIcUg&t=299s)** — allergies and food allergies and potentially autoimmune problems. But other than that, you'll be perfectly fine except for anything going on negative in your digestive system instantly translates to problems up in your head. Okay, because there's something called the gut brain access. And if you're not digesting, if you have these problems in the gut, you're going to also have cognitive problems and mood issues and not feel good mentally. Take natural B1 immediately. You can give
- **[05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sYMKOVAIcUg&t=329s)** — it from nutritional yeast, you can find a supplement that has natural B1. But that would be the first thing to do. And that just might solve all of these problems. Okay. Now chances are you might be very depleted with this hydrochloric acid. So you're probably going to have to replenish that because of how long this has gone on. So the way to do that is start to take the taint hydrochloride. Okay, then you can get that in a supplement and you take, don't just take one take like at least five, and then you want to increase it up to maybe even 10.
- **[05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sYMKOVAIcUg&t=359s)** — Right? For a meal, because you might need a lot to create this effect. And you might have to take it for a period of time to build up the acid in your stomach. There's some other things you might want to take if you have gastritis or an ulcer, like zinc, carnosine. If you have SIBO, small intestinal bacterial overgrowth, you might want to add garlic to the mix. And if you have inflammation in the lower part of your gut, you may need to do a carnivore for a while because fiber from vegetables won't work. I only talked about
- **[06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sYMKOVAIcUg&t=388s)** — one purpose of vitamin B1 to increase the tone of the vagus nerve. But B1 does a lot more. And if you have not seen my video that I did at one of my summits, okay, I put that up right here. Check it out.

*Click any timestamp to jump to that moment in the video*

- **[00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEsPN-9ekiA&t=0s)** — You know, what's really fascinating about the statistics on what type of health conditions people get, like cardiovascular is number one, cancer is number two.
- **[00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEsPN-9ekiA&t=11s)** — But there's some fascinating information to show that there's another epidemic condition that's even higher than both of those combined.
- **[00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEsPN-9ekiA&t=20s)** — And that is autoimmune diseases. And so today I brought in a very competent doctor, Dr. Dimitri, to discuss this topic because he has a lot of experience in there.
- **[00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEsPN-9ekiA&t=33s)** — So welcome, Dr. Dimitri. Hello, Eric. Hello, Dr. Berg. How are you? I appreciate you taking the time.
- **[00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEsPN-9ekiA&t=41s)** — I interviewed you before because you're actually my doctor. So I wanted to tap into your knowledge base.
- **[00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEsPN-9ekiA&t=46s)** — But you even mentioned this and this is like mind blowing. There's so many people that have autoimmune diseases nowadays.
- **[00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEsPN-9ekiA&t=54s)** — I mean, it's like it dwarfs some of these other conditions, which is crazy.
- **[00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEsPN-9ekiA&t=59s)** — But what I want to ask you is out of all of the autoimmune conditions that people are getting, what is at the top of the list?
- **[01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEsPN-9ekiA&t=66s)** — The number one condition. OK, let me give a picture.
- **[01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEsPN-9ekiA&t=71s)** — Can I show a picture of some stats that could help? OK. Autoimmune disease is the number one cause of chronic disease.
- **[01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEsPN-9ekiA&t=83s)** — And now I'm going to refer a few statistics about the US population.
- **[01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEsPN-9ekiA&t=88s)** — So while in the US there are nine million people suffering from cancer and 22 from cardiovascular disease,
- **[01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEsPN-9ekiA&t=96s)** — there are 50 million, probably more people suffering from a type of autoimmune diseases.
- **[01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEsPN-9ekiA&t=101s)** — Autoimmune diseases are conditions where the immune system does not recognize its tissues or organs ourselves.
- **[01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEsPN-9ekiA&t=109s)** — So it attacks them, considers them as being a straneous particles or tissues and attacks them.
- **[01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEsPN-9ekiA&t=118s)** — This creates a chronic inflammation and gradually leads to the destruction of the organ.
- **[02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEsPN-9ekiA&t=126s)** — Now, from all these diseases, the number one, the most common one is Hashimoto disease, which is an autoimmune thyroid autoimmune condition.
- **[02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEsPN-9ekiA&t=138s)** — Yeah, this is interesting because, you know, if you take a look at hypothyroidism, which, you know, you just assume that the thyroid is not working that well.
- **[02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEsPN-9ekiA&t=149s)** — It's a thyroid problem. But isn't the majority of hypothyroidism Hashimoto's?
- **[02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEsPN-9ekiA&t=156s)** — Yes, the great majority. It's the number one cause of hypothyroidism. It's Hashimoto's disease.
- **[02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEsPN-9ekiA&t=161s)** — So in reality, would you say that this Hashimoto's is not necessarily a thyroid disease, it's more of an immune disease?
- **[02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEsPN-9ekiA&t=173s)** — Would you clarify that with me? Of course, Hashimoto's thyroiditis is an autoimmune condition.
- **[03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEsPN-9ekiA&t=180s)** — It's a chronic inflammatory condition of the thyroid that is caused from the immune system itself.
- **[03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEsPN-9ekiA&t=187s)** — The immune system attacks the thyroid gland and gradually destroy it.
- **[03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEsPN-9ekiA&t=192s)** — When the destruction of the gland is above a certain percentage and influences the function of the organ itself, we go into hypothyroidism, a lower function of the thyroid gland.
- **[03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEsPN-9ekiA&t=204s)** — At this moment in the US, it's calculated that 26 million of the population are suffering from Hashimoto's thyroiditis.
- **[03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEsPN-9ekiA&t=215s)** — If you consider that nine out of ten of these patients are women, it's a huge part of the women population that is suffering from this disease.
- **[03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEsPN-9ekiA&t=229s)** — And it's pretty wild that you... I know when I was in practice, people would come in with hypothyroidism and they would just think,
- **[03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEsPN-9ekiA&t=236s)** — Oh, I have low thyroid hormones, so I just need to take my thyroid hormones and that's going to correct the problem. But this is a little different.
- **[04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEsPN-9ekiA&t=245s)** — This is a little bit different.
- **[04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEsPN-9ekiA&t=248s)** — The problem here is that since the thyroid gland is not recognized from the immune system, it produces antibodies.
- **[04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEsPN-9ekiA&t=259s)** — They are called autoantibodies, which attack the thyroid gland and then these antibodies get attached to thyroid cells and then cells of the immune system are guided towards these antibodies and destroy the gland itself.
- **[04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEsPN-9ekiA&t=279s)** — So we have a chronic inflammation of the thyroid, but in order to arrive at that point where the body produces these antibodies and destruction and chronic inflammation of the gland,
- **[04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEsPN-9ekiA&t=292s)** — there must be some prior metabolic dysfunctions and deficiencies that brought to that.
- **[04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEsPN-9ekiA&t=299s)** — So it's a small... this diagnosis, it's a small part of the whole problem in the whole picture.
- **[05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEsPN-9ekiA&t=309s)** — So basically, there's a cascade of things and this is usually late on the chain of events. Tell me some of the potential triggers or causes that precede this condition.
- **[05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEsPN-9ekiA&t=323s)** — Yes. First of all, while we said that there are 26 million people with Hashimoto's and 9 out of 10 of these people are women, 9 of 10 that are diagnosed with Hashimoto's thyroid disease are women.
- **[05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEsPN-9ekiA&t=343s)** — And this is caused mainly because women have a lot of hormonal adaptations and changes during their lifetime. They start having menstruation, they have menstruation every month, they get pregnant, they stop menstruating and so on.
- **[05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEsPN-9ekiA&t=358s)** — And all these changes in and out and changes in the balance to progesterone and estrogen create adaptations of the immune system and the thyroid has to adapt also.
- **[06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEsPN-9ekiA&t=370s)** — And these changes when there are the body is not in an optimal condition guide dysfunction of the immune system and the inflammation that causes the disease.
- **[06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEsPN-9ekiA&t=383s)** — Wow. So 18% of the US population, US adults, which is more than 60 million, have is calculated they have autoantibodies against the thyroid.
- **[06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEsPN-9ekiA&t=399s)** — The Hashimoto's is not the one, the autoantibodies against the disease are one part of the diagnosis. In order to make the diagnosis of Hashimoto's thyroid disease, the actual is with the biopsy.
- **[06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEsPN-9ekiA&t=412s)** — But usually we don't make biopsy to everyone. So we measure the TSH, which is a hormone secret to regulate the thyroid function. We measure the thyroid hormones like T3 and T4.
- **[07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEsPN-9ekiA&t=428s)** — We also see through ultrasound test the form, the structure of the thyroid and all this data contribute to make a diagnosis.
- **[07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEsPN-9ekiA&t=442s)** — But let's say that the final diagnosis, the Hashimoto's is a biopsy diagnosis.
- **[07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEsPN-9ekiA&t=450s)** — So, okay, so then now you have a very large clinic in both Rome and also Greece. So what are you seeing as far as the common things to be able to reverse this? And first of all, is it reversible? And then what are you finding that you have to change to make things better?
- **[07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEsPN-9ekiA&t=475s)** — Okay, yes, this is a very often question we have if this is reversible from patients also. There are various points we can intervene and this in relation to reversibility.
- **[08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEsPN-9ekiA&t=492s)** — When we ask about the reversibility, we mean we stop the destruction of the thyroid. We mean the inversion of the damage of the thyroid.
- **[08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEsPN-9ekiA&t=500s)** — Or we mean stopping taking medication because all these are different points where the disease has arrived. And if we answer the first question, so stopping the immune system destroying the thyroid gland and lowering the autoadenobitis, this is almost in 90% of cases where we have the thyroid.
- **[08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEsPN-9ekiA&t=520s)** — So we can do that. It's usually in six months to a year. This is something that can cure. Reversing the destruction of the thyroid is probably the most important for me and for the patients because we salvage the thyroid, which is vital for the quality of life and the health of the patients.
- **[09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEsPN-9ekiA&t=546s)** — And then reversing also the inflammation of the gland. Also, this is possible if it's in the starting stages of the disease.
- **[09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEsPN-9ekiA&t=559s)** — But if the person has started taking medication and T4 usually to supplement the thyroid hormones, this is not, in most of the cases, this we cannot do.
- **[09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEsPN-9ekiA&t=574s)** — We cannot reverse and stop taking the medication because thyroid gland is a gland that is very slow in regenerating. Its tissue in our body has a different time of regeneration. For example, our blood cells regenerate in a few months, three, four months.
- **[09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEsPN-9ekiA&t=593s)** — The skin cells in a few days and so on. But the thyroid cells regenerate in, they have a time of regeneration of seven years. So it's a very slow process. We had some cases that we follow them for many years and it happens that they had they managed to stop taking the medication.
- **[10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEsPN-9ekiA&t=615s)** — But it's not something we can say for every case or this is going to happen. So reversing the disease means initially the first target should be to lower the autoantibodies. So this means that the body stops destroying the gland.
- **[10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEsPN-9ekiA&t=631s)** — It means also managing and stopping the inflammation at the level of thyroid. So the cells that have remained, they can function the best possible ways. So this can bring gradually to a diminishing of the dose of the supplementation of the hormone through a medication.
- **[10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEsPN-9ekiA&t=651s)** — But stopping completely the medication once the treatment has started, it's not something that we can see that it's possible for everybody.
- **[11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEsPN-9ekiA&t=663s)** — And as far as, you know, we know the thyroid hormones go into almost every actually probably every single cell in the body. So they can they directly affect the metabolism and so many different things. What are some of the common symptoms that someone gets with a hypothyroid Hashimoto's type condition?
- **[11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEsPN-9ekiA&t=685s)** — The first symptom that manifests is it's one of the prime symptoms. It's low energy. So the person doesn't have the energy it used to have in prior years.
- **[11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEsPN-9ekiA&t=700s)** — Usually the people often think that this is due to because they get older, which is not true. It's a mitochondrial dysfunction. The energy of the body is lower.
- **[11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEsPN-9ekiA&t=714s)** — And I need to clarify this point that the thyroid gland is a hormone that actually regulates metabolism, regulates the rate of metabolism. So our body doesn't function in the same condition.
- **[12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEsPN-9ekiA&t=732s)** — Actually, these conditions change continuously. We are indoors and it's hot. We go outside and it's cold. We can be hungry. We can be relaxed. We can eat. We can do physical exercise. All these conditions need a different metabolic rate.
- **[12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEsPN-9ekiA&t=752s)** — So our body has to adapt to the needs of energy. And this, the major adaptation mechanism of these metabolic rates that change is regulated through the thyroid gland.
- **[12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEsPN-9ekiA&t=767s)** — So thyroid increases the rate of metabolism, of decreases based on the needs. When we sleep, we need lower energy and makes that possible for the body to have the optimum output of energy.
- **[13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEsPN-9ekiA&t=782s)** — So when the thyroid dysfunctions, this means that our body cannot adapt. And this, when we speak about adapting, means about the function of every organ, almost every cell in the body is influenced by the thyroid hormones.
- **[13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEsPN-9ekiA&t=797s)** — So by losing this ability to adapt and respond to change the environment influences our health and the function of the body as a whole. One of the first things so that people know is the lower of the energy levels because the body cannot adapt to that.
- **[13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEsPN-9ekiA&t=821s)** — Then the second is difficulty in modulating, regulating the body weight. People that usually have problems with weight problems, increased weight, sometimes even they cannot get increased their weight because they have a higher metabolic rate than needed because from the dysfunction of the thyroid.
- **[14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEsPN-9ekiA&t=845s)** — But the most common thing is that people cannot adapt, cannot regulate their body weight. They are overweight. They have more weight than they should because the metabolic rate is low and the body stores fat instead of being able to burn it and use it as energy.
- **[14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEsPN-9ekiA&t=864s)** — One other thing is hormonal imbalances. So in women that also most of the patients that suffer from the disease are women, we have dysregulated hormonal cycles. We have pain, we have inflammation, we have infertility, so many problems.
- **[14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEsPN-9ekiA&t=888s)** — Migraines correlated with the hormonal cycle and hormonal imbalances. Another symptom which also influences a lot the quality of life of these patients is emotional instability.
- **[15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEsPN-9ekiA&t=906s)** — These people who have motor can experience within the same day a lot of changes at the emotional level. They can be tense, they can be exhausted, they can be angry, they can cry. They have so many changes.
- **[15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEsPN-9ekiA&t=921s)** — They often refer that they are overwhelmed from thoughts that come that they cannot control. And often they try to handle that with meditation or other means, believing that these are due to mental causes.
- **[15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEsPN-9ekiA&t=940s)** — But the thing is hormonal and metabolic imbalance that when this is corrected, all these problems get improved a lot, if not handled completely.
- **[15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEsPN-9ekiA&t=953s)** — That's fantastic. As far as things that you found, are there multiple different things that you are finding that certain patients are missing in their nutrition or things? Or have you found like there is only one thing that always causes this problem or is it multiple things?
- **[16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEsPN-9ekiA&t=975s)** — Actually, there are some metabolic dysfunctions that are common to most of the patients with Hashimoto's with some variations. As in regard to deficiency, everybody, I have not found a person with Hashimoto's, have vitamin D deficiency.
- **[16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEsPN-9ekiA&t=994s)** — So this is...
- **[16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEsPN-9ekiA&t=996s)** — Do they have vitamin D deficiencies?
- **[16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEsPN-9ekiA&t=998s)** — Yes, they have. Every patient at the moment they are diagnosed with Hashimoto's, they have vitamin D deficiency. This is 100% or not close, it's 100%. We have made the statistics, we have announced the results and it's 100% of patients with Hashimoto's, they have vitamin D deficiency.
- **[17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEsPN-9ekiA&t=1021s)** — Then one common problem also goes hand in hand with Hashimoto's insulin resistance. Also in this case, everybody with Hashimoto's or more than 90% in this case, they are insulin resistant or have insulin metabolic dysfunction.
- **[17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEsPN-9ekiA&t=1041s)** — Insulin, their cells do not respond to insulin signal. They have lost to a degree the sensitivity to insulin.
- **[17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEsPN-9ekiA&t=1051s)** — Another very vital problem is multiple marginal micronutrient deficiencies. So these marginal deficiencies, along with insulin resistance, also dysbiosis, alteration of the microbiome, they end to disrupt mitochondrial function.
- **[17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEsPN-9ekiA&t=1078s)** — So just to clarify the marginal, you're talking about there's a subclinical or slight deficiency of micronutrients like trace minerals. Is that or is there some other meaning of that?
- **[18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEsPN-9ekiA&t=1091s)** — Okay, when we have a complete deficiency of vitamin, like vitamin D or vitamin C, we have practice, we have a complete manifestation of disease that is completely caused by the lack of this nutrient. When we have lack of vitamin C, we have ______.
- **[18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEsPN-9ekiA&t=1111s)** — So in this case, we don't live in an environment that there is a complete deficiency of a nutrient, but we have multiple marginal, not complete, but deficiencies of micronutrient.
- **[18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEsPN-9ekiA&t=1126s)** — So they lack for zinc, magnesium, omega three, and other minerals, potassium and so on, chromium, B complex vitamins, vitamin E, antioxidants, amino acids.
- **[19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEsPN-9ekiA&t=1143s)** — So the body in order to function needs 166 nutrients and elements, and this they have to be present, all of them, at the same time in a correct equilibrium. And this can vary from person to person in order for the body to function optimally.
- **[19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEsPN-9ekiA&t=1163s)** — And these, in most cases, there are multiple deficiencies, this is not one of these various micronutrients that are necessary for life to function, so our body can function healthily.
- **[19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEsPN-9ekiA&t=1179s)** — The thing is that all these multiple deficiencies end up disrupting the mitochondrial function.
- **[19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEsPN-9ekiA&t=1187s)** — So one common problem here for this patient, probably one of the basic problems that bring to the manifestation, to the development of Hashimoto's theory, that is mitochondrial dysfunction.
- **[20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEsPN-9ekiA&t=1204s)** — Mitochondria are little organelles that are within the cells that 90% of the energy in the body is produced in these organelles.
- **[20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEsPN-9ekiA&t=1213s)** — So all these multiple deficiencies, even though not complete deficiencies, they disrupt the function of the mitochondria, lower energy levels, the efficiency of the body, and then the thyroid has to work more.
- **[20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEsPN-9ekiA&t=1229s)** — So, I got it, so it's a backup.
- **[20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEsPN-9ekiA&t=1231s)** — Let's say that your body has to produce 100% of energy and your mitochondria function at the 50% level.
- **[20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEsPN-9ekiA&t=1239s)** — That's fascinating because, so in this situation, thyroid is just overcompensating for a lack of mitochondrial production.
- **[20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEsPN-9ekiA&t=1249s)** — So one thing that's very unique about what you do versus other doctors, you have a specialized test that you do that really pick up these subtle changes that really are very, very important, almost like you get more of a complete picture.
- **[21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEsPN-9ekiA&t=1265s)** — And I guess that would be called metabolomics, right?
- **[21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEsPN-9ekiA&t=1268s)** — Yes, true. We measure small molecules called metabolites that participate in the chemical reactions within the human body.
- **[21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEsPN-9ekiA&t=1278s)** — So instead of measuring the nutrients in the blood, because this does not reflect the deficiency or the needs of our body, because our body tries to keep the concentration, the consistency of the blood constant.
- **[21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEsPN-9ekiA&t=1293s)** — Because if, for example, someone is missing calcium, even though he has osteoporosis, the levels of calcium in the blood are going to be within normal.
- **[21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEsPN-9ekiA&t=1301s)** — It's even in advanced stages of osteoporosis and lack of calcium, because if the concentrations of calcium go higher or lower, the heart will stop and many functions or cells will die.
- **[21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEsPN-9ekiA&t=1314s)** — So the body tries to keep the consistency of the blood stable.
- **[22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEsPN-9ekiA&t=1321s)** — So when the consistency, the levels of a nutrient in the blood changes, this means it's very late. It's too late.
- **[22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEsPN-9ekiA&t=1332s)** — In order to overcome this problem, we have to measure chemical reactions that are the presence of the nutrient we want to test.
- **[22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEsPN-9ekiA&t=1339s)** — For example, we can measure the transformation of one metabolite to another that needs B12 or needs magnesium or needs glutamine and so on.
- **[22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEsPN-9ekiA&t=1351s)** — So by measuring this chemical reaction, if this is occurring at the normal levels, optimal levels, we can see if the body eats more or less of the nutrient we are testing.
- **[22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEsPN-9ekiA&t=1363s)** — So basically, instead of looking at the RDAs for certain nutrients, we're looking at how these RDAs are really being utilized in the body and seeing if they're sufficient or not, depending on that individual.
- **[22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEsPN-9ekiA&t=1377s)** — So it's a very completely different strategy.
- **[23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEsPN-9ekiA&t=1382s)** — Yes, it's individualized. Yes, personalized.
- **[23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEsPN-9ekiA&t=1386s)** — So for those of you listening, if you have a condition like this and you want to get it evaluated a lot deeper, I'm going to put your link down below where you can get this test, get it evaluated.
- **[23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEsPN-9ekiA&t=1399s)** — I will put that link down below.
- **[23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEsPN-9ekiA&t=1401s)** — And I know that you mentioned that you have a small amount of time to do this interview, so I just wanted to cram as much as I can in this interview and just get the overview of the thyroid.
- **[23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEsPN-9ekiA&t=1412s)** — This is just fascinating information.
- **[23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEsPN-9ekiA&t=1414s)** — So anyway, I want to thank you for spending the time and hopefully clarifying some of these confusions that people have about this thyroid problem Hashimoto's and not to mention just autoimmune in general and how different that is.
- **[23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEsPN-9ekiA&t=1428s)** — So thank you so much.
- **[23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEsPN-9ekiA&t=1430s)** — Thank you. Thank you, Dr. Berg, for the interview.
- **[23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEsPN-9ekiA&t=1433s)** — You're welcome.

- **[00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTOAIP9DfYo&t=0s)** — Unfortunately, in the medical profession, they don't do this. They don't look deeper.
- **[00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTOAIP9DfYo&t=4s)** — Basically, I'm taking one symptom and I'm going to show you how I find out what's underneath
- **[00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTOAIP9DfYo&t=8s)** — the symptom. Because you never want to just treat the symptom without finding the root cause.
- **[00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTOAIP9DfYo&t=12s)** — For example, the ridges on the nail are the tip of the iceberg. They don't ask,
- **[00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTOAIP9DfYo&t=16s)** — why do I have ridges on my nails? There are several connections between ridge nails
- **[00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTOAIP9DfYo&t=22s)** — and a nutrient deficiency. You have to kind of know the potential causes. But the question is,
- **[00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTOAIP9DfYo&t=27s)** — do we know which one of those potential causes is the cause? There's really only three deficiencies
- **[00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTOAIP9DfYo&t=33s)** — that are going to create the vertical ridges. Number one, an iron deficiency. Number two,
- **[00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTOAIP9DfYo&t=39s)** — a zinc deficiency. And number three, a biotin deficiency. Biotin is a B vitamin. Basically,
- **[00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTOAIP9DfYo&t=45s)** — what I do to figure this out is I will start with iron and I'm going to ask them
- **[00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTOAIP9DfYo&t=50s)** — questions to find out if they are iron deficient and if that's the problem. If
- **[00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTOAIP9DfYo&t=55s)** — they're female, are you menstruating too much? Do you have symptoms of anemia? Like, are you
- **[01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTOAIP9DfYo&t=60s)** — tired a lot? Did they get weak easily? Of course, I'll get into the diet too. Are they
- **[01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTOAIP9DfYo&t=65s)** — a vegan? Because vegans never eat red meat and red meat is loaded with iron. And when you
- **[01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTOAIP9DfYo&t=71s)** — consume plants like spinach, there's iron in there, but it's not very bioavailable. I also
- **[01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTOAIP9DfYo&t=76s)** — know that someone could actually have a genetic problem with iron where they have too much
- **[01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTOAIP9DfYo&t=81s)** — iron. This is interesting because if they have too much iron, they're also going to be anemic
- **[01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTOAIP9DfYo&t=85s)** — because it's dysfunctional. Ask them questions about their liver. Do they have a history of
- **[01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTOAIP9DfYo&t=90s)** — cirrhosis of the liver? Do they feel better when they donate blood? Have you ever had a genetic
- **[01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTOAIP9DfYo&t=95s)** — test where they said something about iron looking for an iron deficiency or an iron excess?
- **[01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTOAIP9DfYo&t=100s)** — I might ask a question like, do you crave ice? And even people that crave dirt are
- **[01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTOAIP9DfYo&t=106s)** — deficient in iron. And then I also might ask them, are they cold? Do they have cold feet,
- **[01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTOAIP9DfYo&t=110s)** — cold hands? And that just would kind of give me a clue if it's more of an iron deficiency
- **[01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTOAIP9DfYo&t=114s)** — based on those questions. But of course, I'm not just only going to ask them those questions.
- **[01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTOAIP9DfYo&t=118s)** — I'm going to shift also to some other questions to rule out. Is it a zinc deficiency? Do they
- **[02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTOAIP9DfYo&t=123s)** — ever have a problem with getting sick frequently and taking a long time to overcome
- **[02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTOAIP9DfYo&t=128s)** — an infection? I'm going to ask them about testosterone because zinc definitely helps increase
- **[02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTOAIP9DfYo&t=134s)** — testosterone. And let's say they have a libido issue or rectal dysfunction or a loss
- **[02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTOAIP9DfYo&t=139s)** — of muscle mass that could help me kind of associate those symptoms with the cause. I will
- **[02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTOAIP9DfYo&t=143s)** — also ask them when they're driving at night, do they have a difficult time seeing in the dark?
- **[02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTOAIP9DfYo&t=148s)** — Night blindness is usually a vitamin A deficiency, but zinc is also necessary for vitamin A to
- **[02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTOAIP9DfYo&t=155s)** — work. And this is all related to a certain pigment in the eye that allows you to see
- **[02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTOAIP9DfYo&t=160s)** — in dim light. As far as hair goes, alopecia would be one symptom of a zinc deficiency. I'm
- **[02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTOAIP9DfYo&t=169s)** — rashes inflammation of the skin is definitely related to zinc. I might also ask them, did they
- **[02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTOAIP9DfYo&t=174s)** — drink a lot of alcohol or do they eat junk foods, which will really deplete you of zinc.
- **[02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTOAIP9DfYo&t=179s)** — Then I also might ask them about the foods related to zinc, because you're going to get
- **[03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTOAIP9DfYo&t=183s)** — a lot of zinc if you have red meat, but also shellfish, seafood, things like that. After I
- **[03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTOAIP9DfYo&t=188s)** — have those questions, I'll shift to the biotin deficiency questions. What's unique about
- **[03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTOAIP9DfYo&t=193s)** — biotin is that a good percentage of your biotin is made by your own microbes. I will ask
- **[03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTOAIP9DfYo&t=198s)** — do you have a history of a lot of antibiotics because that's going to destroy the microbes that
- **[03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTOAIP9DfYo&t=203s)** — make biotin. Then I'll ask them about their hair. Does their hair break easily? Is their
- **[03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTOAIP9DfYo&t=209s)** — nail thin? That's going to give me a huge clue on if it's a biotin deficiency. Sometimes when
- **[03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTOAIP9DfYo&t=214s)** — people just bang their nail on something and it just breaks, it could be a biotin deficiency
- **[03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTOAIP9DfYo&t=219s)** — as well. If someone's very severely deficient in biotin, they're going to have neurological
- **[03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTOAIP9DfYo&t=223s)** — problems. It's called peripheral neuropathy in their feet. So that would be something I would
- **[03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTOAIP9DfYo&t=227s)** — look for. But what you need to know is biotin, zinc, and iron all control collagen. And if
- **[03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTOAIP9DfYo&t=233s)** — you're deficient in those, you're not going to make the collagen necessary for the nail to be
- **[03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTOAIP9DfYo&t=239s)** — formed correctly. After assessing all these questions, it's going to be very easy for me
- **[04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTOAIP9DfYo&t=242s)** — to isolate the real underlying cause, the most likely cause, which then I will either recommend
- **[04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTOAIP9DfYo&t=249s)** — eating more of that food or I will recommend consuming it as a supplement. As far as iron
- **[04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTOAIP9DfYo&t=254s)** — I never like recommending an iron supplement because it's very harsh and I don't like the
- **[04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTOAIP9DfYo&t=260s)** — types of iron that they give people. I might recommend grass-fed liver pills or spleen extract
- **[04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTOAIP9DfYo&t=266s)** — pills. They work great. Or just consume more red meat. That's for iron. And of course with zinc,
- **[04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTOAIP9DfYo&t=272s)** — the best source of zinc is shellfish. Oysters are the top of the list, but you could also
- **[04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTOAIP9DfYo&t=279s)** — get a good amount of zinc in grass-fed beef. As far as a zinc supplement, I would recommend
- **[04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTOAIP9DfYo&t=283s)** — taking probably 50 milligrams of zinc in a blend of other trace minerals that include copper.
- **[04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTOAIP9DfYo&t=290s)** — Because anytime you take zinc in higher amounts over a long period of time, it can deplete you
- **[04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTOAIP9DfYo&t=294s)** — of copper. I like my zinc to be in a blend of trace minerals with copper. You always want to
- **[04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTOAIP9DfYo&t=299s)** — have 10 times as much zinc as copper. So it would be like a one to 10 ratio. And this is
- **[05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTOAIP9DfYo&t=304s)** — a very rough estimate. So if you're doing 10 milligrams of zinc, you have one milligram
- **[05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTOAIP9DfYo&t=308s)** — of copper. Then we get to biotin. If we need more biotin, I would recommend taking a
- **[05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTOAIP9DfYo&t=312s)** — zinc supplement. But here's the problem. You don't necessarily want to buy the supplement
- **[05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTOAIP9DfYo&t=316s)** — that has the most biotin, because there's bottles of biotin that have like 30,000 times
- **[05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTOAIP9DfYo&t=324s)** — the RDA. So you don't need to go that extreme. But I do know a lot of people take biotin,
- **[05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTOAIP9DfYo&t=330s)** — boy, their nails get really super strong. As far as re-establishing biotin in your body,
- **[05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTOAIP9DfYo&t=335s)** — like consuming foods, it's not necessarily going to be adding certain foods that will
- **[05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTOAIP9DfYo&t=340s)** — increase biotin, because biotin is in so many different foods, as it is to build up your gut
- **[05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTOAIP9DfYo&t=345s)** — microbiome. And for that, you want to take a good probiotic or consume foods that are
- **[05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTOAIP9DfYo&t=349s)** — fermented. One other interesting thing about biotin is if you consume raw egg whites,
- **[05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTOAIP9DfYo&t=356s)** — you can become biotin deficient, because there's something in this raw white of the egg
- **[06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTOAIP9DfYo&t=361s)** — that blocks your ability to absorb biotin. I just wanted to give you a simple example of
- **[06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTOAIP9DfYo&t=367s)** — best way to figure things out is not to treat this tip of the iceberg to find out what's
- **[06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTOAIP9DfYo&t=372s)** — deeper. Really understand that for every effect or symptom, there's a cause. All 5700 videos that
- **[06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTOAIP9DfYo&t=378s)** — I have are all about making these connections. And this is a huge gap within our healthcare
- **[06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTOAIP9DfYo&t=384s)** — system. They don't make these connections. They just treat the symptom as a problem.
- **[06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTOAIP9DfYo&t=390s)** — And it covers up the real problem. Thank you for watching and I will see you in the next
- **[06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTOAIP9DfYo&t=394s)** — video.

- **[00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nm15-Tftb8E&t=0s)** — Is it possible you might be overdosing on the wrong vitamin E? Vitamin E is very interesting
- **[00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nm15-Tftb8E&t=6s)** — because you'll see reports that, oh yeah, vitamin E causes cancer. It causes cardiovascular
- **[00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nm15-Tftb8E&t=13s)** — damage. Now, how can that be? We will talk about that and I'm going to clear up the
- **[00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nm15-Tftb8E&t=16s)** — confusion so it'll all make sense. In 1964, it was discovered that there is another vitamin
- **[00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nm15-Tftb8E&t=23s)** — E compound. Vitamin E is not just one thing. It's many things in two different groups.
- **[00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nm15-Tftb8E&t=31s)** — We're just going to compare tocotrinols to tocopherols as far as antioxidants, as
- **[00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nm15-Tftb8E&t=35s)** — far as the potency. Tocotrinols, hands down, are so much more powerful. Let's say, for
- **[00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nm15-Tftb8E&t=40s)** — example, you just take one isolated part of the vitamin E complex, alpha-tocopherol,
- **[00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nm15-Tftb8E&t=45s)** — and you're taking it synthetically or even naturally. It's going to be more of a pro-oxidant
- **[00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nm15-Tftb8E&t=49s)** — and create more damage. This is why you see mixed reviews on vitamin E. Like, wow, one
- **[00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nm15-Tftb8E&t=55s)** — study will show that it creates some damage. Another study shows that it can actually help
- **[01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nm15-Tftb8E&t=60s)** — someone in some way. But you're not looking at the whole picture because in nature, antioxidants
- **[01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nm15-Tftb8E&t=64s)** — never come like that. Let's talk a little bit more about these tocotrinols because
- **[01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nm15-Tftb8E&t=68s)** — this might be new to you. I really like the tocotrinols, which just happens to
- **[01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nm15-Tftb8E&t=73s)** — have an anti-cancer effect. It also is a very potent anti-inflammatory as well.
- **[01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nm15-Tftb8E&t=77s)** — In animal studies, they found that the tocotrinol can even increase lifespan by 19%. Some people
- **[01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nm15-Tftb8E&t=83s)** — might correlate that over to humans, probably just because of the antioxidant effect.
- **[01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nm15-Tftb8E&t=87s)** — It's very powerful, protecting something against oxidation. That leads us to the
- **[01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nm15-Tftb8E&t=92s)** — next thing that tocotrinols are really good at. Neuroprotection. Let's say, for
- **[01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nm15-Tftb8E&t=97s)** — example, someone had a stroke and they need some quick repair. Tocotrinols would
- **[01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nm15-Tftb8E&t=103s)** — be the answer for that. It definitely protects the neurons in the brain against oxidative
- **[01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nm15-Tftb8E&t=107s)** — damage. It's really good for any type of neurodegenerative diseases. That includes
- **[01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nm15-Tftb8E&t=112s)** — Parkinson's, Alzheimer's, dementia. Tocotrinols also have a similar effect to statins as
- **[01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nm15-Tftb8E&t=119s)** — far as what they can do to oxidative LDL, which is behind inflammation inside the arteries.
- **[02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nm15-Tftb8E&t=126s)** — In one study, within six months, dramatically decreased atherosclerotic lesions. And over
- **[02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nm15-Tftb8E&t=133s)** — time, 18 months, they could barely find those lesions. All the things that vitamin
- **[02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nm15-Tftb8E&t=138s)** — E can help you with, it's the arteries. The arteries that are involved in blood
- **[02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nm15-Tftb8E&t=143s)** — flow to the heart, as well as what tocotrinols can do to the heart muscle itself. People
- **[02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nm15-Tftb8E&t=149s)** — can have heart attacks, not from a clogged artery, but just the muscle just doesn't
- **[02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nm15-Tftb8E&t=153s)** — have the oxygen and just cramps up and then you have a heart attack. If someone adds intense
- **[02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nm15-Tftb8E&t=157s)** — exercise on top of that, you can imagine the level of oxidative stress is like
- **[02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nm15-Tftb8E&t=161s)** — off the charts. I think after a workout, a person should take tocotrinols. Tocotrinols
- **[02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nm15-Tftb8E&t=166s)** — can actually increase the oxygen carrying capacity. If they took that after they
- **[02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nm15-Tftb8E&t=170s)** — worked out, they would see a great improvement in recovery. A lot of people that do high
- **[02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nm15-Tftb8E&t=176s)** — altitude training or even climb mountains take more vitamin E because when you're
- **[03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nm15-Tftb8E&t=181s)** — at high altitudes, there's definitely a lot more oxidative stress. I probably personally
- **[03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nm15-Tftb8E&t=186s)** — would not take a tocophora. I would take tocotrinols because they're more potent.
- **[03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nm15-Tftb8E&t=191s)** — You want to take like maybe smaller amounts and spread them out through the day. Anyone
- **[03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nm15-Tftb8E&t=195s)** — with age-related cognitive decline should be on a good tocotrinol supplement. There's
- **[03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nm15-Tftb8E&t=201s)** — also some interesting data on using tocotrinols to help reverse some of the damage from
- **[03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nm15-Tftb8E&t=206s)** — radiation. Even the military is studying that as well because they found in my
- **[03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nm15-Tftb8E&t=210s)** — studies that even lethal doses of radiation can be mitigated with these tocotrinols.
- **[03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nm15-Tftb8E&t=218s)** — There's also a pretty potent scar tissue protection benefit. If you have inflammation
- **[03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nm15-Tftb8E&t=224s)** — in your liver, for example, and you take tocotrinols, it can slow down the
- **[03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nm15-Tftb8E&t=228s)** — progression going into the scar tissue, which I'm talking about cirrhosis. What
- **[03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nm15-Tftb8E&t=233s)** — about tocopherols? Should we take them at all? Do they work better for certain
- **[03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nm15-Tftb8E&t=237s)** — There are several advantages for taking tocopherol. Number one, widespread availability.
- **[04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nm15-Tftb8E&t=244s)** — They're in a lot more foods. Green vegetables that have chlorophyll, in seeds, in nuts.
- **[04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nm15-Tftb8E&t=251s)** — They're in olives, olive oil. Another thing about tocopherols is that there's a lot more
- **[04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nm15-Tftb8E&t=256s)** — research on tocopherols as an antioxidant and what it can do. It's good for overall
- **[04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nm15-Tftb8E&t=260s)** — protection of the cell membranes and oxidative stress. But tocotrinols are more potent.
- **[04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nm15-Tftb8E&t=266s)** — They're a lot more expensive. Tocopherols you can get in a lot of different foods.
- **[04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nm15-Tftb8E&t=270s)** — It's easy to get it. But tocotrinols, it's harder to get tocotrinols. There's a
- **[04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nm15-Tftb8E&t=275s)** — source called aneto, but I don't think many people consume aneto. You'd have
- **[04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nm15-Tftb8E&t=279s)** — to get that as a supplement. Probably the biggest source of tocotrinols is in palm oil.
- **[04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nm15-Tftb8E&t=285s)** — I'm not talking about the refined version, but sometimes you can find a red palm oil or
- **[04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nm15-Tftb8E&t=291s)** — unrefined palm oil. It's loaded with tocotrinols. It's also a good source of tocopherols as well.
- **[04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nm15-Tftb8E&t=297s)** — It's like 70% tocotrinols and 30% tocopherols. There is some data, I don't know if this is true,
- **[05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nm15-Tftb8E&t=304s)** — where if you take both tocotrinols and tocopherols together, they tend to compete.
- **[05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nm15-Tftb8E&t=309s)** — I don't know if that's true. I think over time we're going to see a lot more interesting
- **[05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nm15-Tftb8E&t=313s)** — things about these tocotrinols. There's more research being done on this. There's research
- **[05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nm15-Tftb8E&t=317s)** — heavy into the areas of helping unblock arteries. What you also have to realize too, in nature,
- **[05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nm15-Tftb8E&t=324s)** — vitamin E doesn't just work by itself. It works together with vitamin C. It works with
- **[05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nm15-Tftb8E&t=329s)** — other nutrition. These antioxidants are recycled over and over again. For example, you're really
- **[05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nm15-Tftb8E&t=336s)** — focused on vitamin E, but you're deficient in vitamin C. You can create a problem with that
- **[05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nm15-Tftb8E&t=340s)** — because they both need each other to help recharge each other. I know sometimes people
- **[05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nm15-Tftb8E&t=346s)** — want to know what brand you recommend. I don't have a brand. I take a high-quality tocotrinol
- **[05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nm15-Tftb8E&t=352s)** — blend. I usually take it right after I work out. I definitely feel a difference from that.
- **[05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nm15-Tftb8E&t=357s)** — A lot of times when people take vitamins, they don't necessarily feel a difference because
- **[06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nm15-Tftb8E&t=361s)** — they're working a lot deeper. That's why a better understanding about nutrition helps you
- **[06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nm15-Tftb8E&t=366s)** — understand what you should be taking or what you shouldn't be taking based on
- **[06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nm15-Tftb8E&t=370s)** — your particular weaknesses or problems you're trying to solve. I have a lot of inflammatory
- **[06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nm15-Tftb8E&t=375s)** — genes going on. I'm always trying to mitigate that. Anyway, thanks for watching and I will see you in the next video.

- **[00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m32KS2eeuvY&t=0s)** — There are so many videos about removing tonsil stones, but I haven't seen any video on how to correct
- **[00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m32KS2eeuvY&t=6s)** — the deeper underlying cause of a tonsil stone, because a tonsil stone is really a symptom
- **[00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m32KS2eeuvY&t=11s)** — of something else. And I totally understand that tonsil stones can be pretty bad because they
- **[00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m32KS2eeuvY&t=16s)** — give you chronic halitosis, like really bad breath. Apparently the microbes that are involved
- **[00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m32KS2eeuvY&t=22s)** — produce what's called volatile sulfur compounds. And this is like a sulfur gas,
- **[00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m32KS2eeuvY&t=28s)** — kind of like rotten eggs, which is also involved in the smell of like a swamp or a sewage. And
- **[00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m32KS2eeuvY&t=35s)** — these microbes are making this gas in the back of your throat, so it can be pretty devastating.
- **[00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m32KS2eeuvY&t=40s)** — And the gas is called hydrogen sulfide. And so what you have is you have these microbes in these
- **[00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m32KS2eeuvY&t=44s)** — little tiny indentations in the back of your tonsils that are basically creating pus and mucus,
- **[00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m32KS2eeuvY&t=52s)** — and eventually it turns into this calcium little stone. So let's first just kind of
- **[00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m32KS2eeuvY&t=59s)** — set up the tonsils. You have tonsils a little bit higher up in the back of the nasal area,
- **[01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m32KS2eeuvY&t=64s)** — which you can't really see. And then you have the one that you can see called the palatine
- **[01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m32KS2eeuvY&t=67s)** — tonsils. And the word palatine is from the palatine bone, because it's the posterior part or
- **[01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m32KS2eeuvY&t=73s)** — the back part of your throat. So basically what a tonsil it is, it's kind of like a lymphatic
- **[01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m32KS2eeuvY&t=78s)** — tissue that acts as the first line of the defense against pathogens. So the tonsils are
- **[01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m32KS2eeuvY&t=84s)** — there to pick up information from these pathogens and send it to the rest of the immune system.
- **[01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m32KS2eeuvY&t=90s)** — It's kind of like, okay, body, we have the pathogens in the house, we have to do something
- **[01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m32KS2eeuvY&t=94s)** — about it. Start turning up the immune system. So they're kind of like the guard at the front
- **[01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m32KS2eeuvY&t=99s)** — door to protect against pathogens going into the lung, as well as in the digestive system.
- **[01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m32KS2eeuvY&t=107s)** — And a lot of times people have their tonsils removed, right? Problem over. Well,
- **[01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m32KS2eeuvY&t=111s)** — when you remove the first line of defense, there could be some complications, possibly,
- **[01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m32KS2eeuvY&t=116s)** — not always, but they have found increased risk of lower respiratory tract infections,
- **[02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m32KS2eeuvY&t=122s)** — infections of the lung, increased risk of Hodgkin's lymphoma, and also an enhancement
- **[02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m32KS2eeuvY&t=129s)** — in susceptibility to developing certain types of autoimmune conditions,
- **[02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m32KS2eeuvY&t=134s)** — probably because most of the autoimmune conditions originate in the gut. And so then
- **[02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m32KS2eeuvY&t=140s)** — invades it bypasses immigration. Now, as far as the pathogens that this tonsil is exposed to,
- **[02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m32KS2eeuvY&t=148s)** — they've calculated that if you look at the difference between viruses and bacteria,
- **[02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m32KS2eeuvY&t=152s)** — the viruses are roughly about between 50 and 80% of tonsil infections. And the bacteria is
- **[02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m32KS2eeuvY&t=161s)** — only between five and 17%. And also remember that antibiotics only work on bacterial infections. So
- **[02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m32KS2eeuvY&t=169s)** — if you're automatically taking antibiotic, it's going to be hit or miss because if it's a viral
- **[02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m32KS2eeuvY&t=173s)** — thing, it's not going to do anything. The Epstein-Barr virus is notoriously known to
- **[02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m32KS2eeuvY&t=179s)** — infect the tonsils. But here's the big picture of the tonsils. You need to be able to
- **[03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m32KS2eeuvY&t=184s)** — stimulate and train your immune system to become stronger. And so we're born with an
- **[03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m32KS2eeuvY&t=192s)** — innate immune system from our mother, but we develop what's called the acquired immune system
- **[03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m32KS2eeuvY&t=198s)** — through training being exposed to certain pathogens. So when they do studies on mice that
- **[03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m32KS2eeuvY&t=203s)** — are germ-free and don't have this training system, they don't develop certain parts of
- **[03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m32KS2eeuvY&t=209s)** — the immune system later in life. And that can weaken the immune system. And the reason I'm
- **[03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m32KS2eeuvY&t=213s)** — bringing this up is because sometimes when you have kids and they have swollen tonsils,
- **[03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m32KS2eeuvY&t=217s)** — you might immediately start giving them some type of anti-inflammatory ibuprofen or something
- **[03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m32KS2eeuvY&t=223s)** — to get rid of the inflammation or the symptom. When in fact, it may be a good idea just to let
- **[03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m32KS2eeuvY&t=228s)** — them go through the infection to develop this acquired immunity. This is interesting. And I'm
- **[03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m32KS2eeuvY&t=233s)** — going to put the research down below in the description. I found something fascinating in
- **[03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m32KS2eeuvY&t=238s)** — relationship to vitamin D deficiencies. There's a significant association between low vitamin D
- **[04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m32KS2eeuvY&t=245s)** — and an inflamed tonsil, as in tonsillitis. I did find another study that showed a zinc
- **[04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m32KS2eeuvY&t=252s)** — deficiency can also create an inflamed tonsil as well as an iron deficiency. And we do know that
- **[04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m32KS2eeuvY&t=258s)** — zinc and vitamin D and also iron influence the immune system. And vitamin D is like seriously
- **[04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m32KS2eeuvY&t=265s)** — powerful in helping create antimicrobial effects within your immune system. I found another
- **[04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m32KS2eeuvY&t=273s)** — interesting paper and one very specific thing about that paper that's kind of stood out.
- **[04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m32KS2eeuvY&t=277s)** — One of the risk factors of having tonsil problems is lack of sun exposure. Ding ding ding,
- **[04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m32KS2eeuvY&t=287s)** — vitamin D. There's more incidence of inflamed tonsils during the winter versus the summer.
- **[04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m32KS2eeuvY&t=294s)** — Here's the problem. It's very difficult to get enough vitamin D from our diet.
- **[04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m32KS2eeuvY&t=298s)** — And many times if you're thinking about kids and tonsil problems and large tonsil issues,
- **[05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m32KS2eeuvY&t=305s)** — first of all they don't get out in the sun as much and many times they don't consume salmon,
- **[05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m32KS2eeuvY&t=311s)** — coliver oil, things like that. And if they're drinking soda with high phosphates,
- **[05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m32KS2eeuvY&t=317s)** — that alone can deplete the vitamin D. The underlying predisposing factor really is vitamin D
- **[05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m32KS2eeuvY&t=324s)** — and probably throw some zinc in there too. And if you have small children, you can even get
- **[05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m32KS2eeuvY&t=329s)** — the liquid vitamin D as well. Now another point I want to bring up when I was in practice,
- **[05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m32KS2eeuvY&t=333s)** — I would have kids come in all the time with these huge tonsils and that affects the breathing and
- **[05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m32KS2eeuvY&t=338s)** — creates snoring. And back then I didn't really know about vitamin D but what I did do,
- **[05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m32KS2eeuvY&t=344s)** — which was successful, is get them off milk because many times they had a milk allergy and
- **[05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m32KS2eeuvY&t=349s)** — they didn't know it. And it could just automatically create enlargement or inflammation
- **[05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m32KS2eeuvY&t=354s)** — of your tonsils. Now as far as the amount of vitamin D, as far as a maintenance dose,
- **[05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m32KS2eeuvY&t=359s)** — I would recommend 10,000 IUs. If you're trying to therapeutically correct something,
- **[06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m32KS2eeuvY&t=363s)** — I would increase it to 20, maybe 30,000 IUs. But also make sure you take vitamin K2,
- **[06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m32KS2eeuvY&t=370s)** — especially since calcium is involved. And one of the points about calcium is vitamin K2
- **[06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m32KS2eeuvY&t=378s)** — removes the calcium from the soft tissues, not just the arteries and the joints. So for
- **[06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m32KS2eeuvY&t=384s)** — every 10,000 IUs of vitamin D3, you want 100 micrograms of vitamin K2. That would be a
- **[06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m32KS2eeuvY&t=392s)** — good ratio. Now since we're on the topic of tonsils, I have another video on this which has
- **[06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m32KS2eeuvY&t=396s)** — been very popular. If you haven't seen this one, check it out. I put it up right here.

- **[00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IUGVoT9IwAI&t=0s)** — I wanted to do this quick FAQ on a new product called Clean Lather Shampoo, as well as another
- **[00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IUGVoT9IwAI&t=6s)** — product called Clean Shine Conditioner. Now personally, my wife Karen, who has wonderful
- **[00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IUGVoT9IwAI&t=12s)** — hair, is very, very picky about her shampoos as well as her conditioners. And we don't use the
- **[00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IUGVoT9IwAI&t=20s)** — sulfate-based shampoos or conditioners that are basically using like dishwashing liquid in
- **[00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IUGVoT9IwAI&t=27s)** — your shampoo. That chemical literally destroys the protein in your hair. It also dries out the
- **[00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IUGVoT9IwAI&t=34s)** — hair and it just makes your hair looking really dull. So we came up with some really high-quality
- **[00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IUGVoT9IwAI&t=40s)** — ingredients that are different oils, that are different ingredients in plants, that create
- **[00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IUGVoT9IwAI&t=45s)** — some really cool effects to your hair. But not only that, I put ingredients in there
- **[00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IUGVoT9IwAI&t=50s)** — that revive the hair, that rejuvenate the hair, that give the hair nutrition, that can help
- **[00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IUGVoT9IwAI&t=56s)** — stimulate hair growth. So it's not just about cleaning the hair. Now the one thing about the
- **[01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IUGVoT9IwAI&t=61s)** — shampoo is I did not put a lot of the chemicals that make this huge lathering effect.
- **[01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IUGVoT9IwAI&t=68s)** — So it's slightly different than the average shampoo. But when you use it, you're going to
- **[01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IUGVoT9IwAI&t=73s)** — add a little bit more water to it and you're going to find that it leaves a really nice
- **[01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IUGVoT9IwAI&t=77s)** — effect on your hair. Nothing in this product is harmful in any way, shape, or form. The oils
- **[01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IUGVoT9IwAI&t=83s)** — in these products are just top-notch. Now the conditioner is very interesting. My wife is
- **[01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IUGVoT9IwAI&t=89s)** — extremely picky with conditioners and she said that this is the best conditioner she's ever
- **[01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IUGVoT9IwAI&t=96s)** — used on her hair. And I would agree. It just makes your hair very, very silky and very
- **[01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IUGVoT9IwAI&t=102s)** — smooth and you'll notice it when you apply it. So if you want a really good high-quality
- **[01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IUGVoT9IwAI&t=106s)** — shampoo and conditioner, you definitely want to check this out.

## Video 108: Vitamin D and the Magnesium Deficiency: IMPORTANT

**Watch on YouTube:** [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtGinb8VWxc](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtGinb8VWxc)

- **[00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtGinb8VWxc&t=0s)** — Today I want to talk about vitamin D and a magnesium deficiency.
- **[00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtGinb8VWxc&t=3s)** — There's a very interesting relationship between vitamin D and magnesium
- **[00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtGinb8VWxc&t=7s)** — that I think you should know about. Especially since most of the population
- **[00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtGinb8VWxc&t=10s)** — is deficient in both vitamin D and magnesium.
- **[00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtGinb8VWxc&t=13s)** — I think it's 75% of the population has low vitamin D levels
- **[00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtGinb8VWxc&t=17s)** — and 45% has low magnesium levels.
- **[00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtGinb8VWxc&t=22s)** — And here's what you need to know. All of the enzymes
- **[00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtGinb8VWxc&t=24s)** — involving the conversion of vitamin D
- **[00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtGinb8VWxc&t=28s)** — to the active form of vitamin D
- **[00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtGinb8VWxc&t=31s)** — are magnesium dependent. That means if you're completely
- **[00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtGinb8VWxc&t=35s)** — zero with magnesium, vitamin D will not work. Period.
- **[00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtGinb8VWxc&t=40s)** — And we know how important vitamin D is for bone, for bone pain,
- **[00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtGinb8VWxc&t=45s)** — for insulin resistance, for your immune system
- **[00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtGinb8VWxc&t=48s)** — to prevent muscle cramps, cardiovascular problems
- **[00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtGinb8VWxc&t=52s)** — with blood pressure and fatigue. So magnesium allows vitamin D
- **[00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtGinb8VWxc&t=56s)** — to work. And vitamin D also allows magnesium to be absorbed
- **[01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtGinb8VWxc&t=63s)** — by a factor of 30%. So they're both synergistically helping each other.
- **[01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtGinb8VWxc&t=68s)** — Now there's another mineral involved and it's calcium.
- **[01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtGinb8VWxc&t=71s)** — If you're low in magnesium, you're going to have problems with that calcium because
- **[01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtGinb8VWxc&t=75s)** — not only does vitamin D help the absorption of calcium by 20%
- **[01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtGinb8VWxc&t=80s)** — in your gut, but magnesium also helps regulate calcium.
- **[01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtGinb8VWxc&t=84s)** — Magnesium helps prevent calcium from building up
- **[01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtGinb8VWxc&t=87s)** — inside your arteries. Magnesium is really good for blood pressure
- **[01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtGinb8VWxc&t=91s)** — and just having elastic arteries to adapt to exercise
- **[01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtGinb8VWxc&t=94s)** — and bounce back from stress. Things like that. And it helps lower cortisol
- **[01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtGinb8VWxc&t=98s)** — and it will help you sleep. So there's a certain ratio of calcium to
- **[01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtGinb8VWxc&t=102s)** — magnesium that someone needs. And roughly you need like twice as
- **[01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtGinb8VWxc&t=105s)** — much calcium as magnesium. But nowadays this ratio is really like
- **[01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtGinb8VWxc&t=109s)** — three times as much calcium as magnesium.
- **[01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtGinb8VWxc&t=112s)** — And the simple solution is to increase your magnesium.
- **[01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtGinb8VWxc&t=117s)** — But the problem is how do you do that? Because the average person only
- **[02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtGinb8VWxc&t=120s)** — consumes like one and a half cups of salad per day. It's not even
- **[02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtGinb8VWxc&t=124s)** — probably the dark leafy greens that's high in magnesium. And also
- **[02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtGinb8VWxc&t=128s)** — like I think it's 83% of all the calories in the grocery store
- **[02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtGinb8VWxc&t=132s)** — are ultra processed. And that's another way that people are deficient in
- **[02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtGinb8VWxc&t=137s)** — magnesium because our foods are just stripped of all the magnesium.
- **[02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtGinb8VWxc&t=140s)** — And when we have this increase in calcium to a magnesium then we
- **[02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtGinb8VWxc&t=146s)** — start getting, you know, calcification of the arteries. It even
- **[02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtGinb8VWxc&t=150s)** — can increase the risk of different types of cancer. Prostate, colorectal.
- **[02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtGinb8VWxc&t=156s)** — It can increase polyps which potentially could end up going into a
- **[02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtGinb8VWxc&t=161s)** — cancer state. So I just wanted to put this on your radar to make

- **[00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWZrSK4xtXs&t=0s)** — So I guess this is the end of vitamin D research. There is some research done called the vital study
- **[00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWZrSK4xtXs&t=6s)** — that involved 26,000 people and they have found conclusively that vitamin D supplementation is
- **[00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWZrSK4xtXs&t=12s)** — basically worthless. So they don't want to waste any more money in doing research in vitamin D
- **[00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWZrSK4xtXs&t=16s)** — because this is the last nail in the coffin for vitamin D research. So I guess I can stop doing
- **[00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWZrSK4xtXs&t=23s)** — vitamin D videos since I have like over a hundred right now. Probably just have to delete
- **[00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWZrSK4xtXs&t=27s)** — them. So let me share the quick summary of what the study found. Vitamin D supplementation did
- **[00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWZrSK4xtXs&t=33s)** — not reduce the risk of cancer, didn't reduce the risk of major cardiovascular events,
- **[00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWZrSK4xtXs&t=38s)** — stroke, or cardiovascular death. So this data I'm going to share with you came
- **[00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWZrSK4xtXs&t=42s)** — from a recommendation from Dr. Bruce Hollis who is the pioneer of vitamin D research.
- **[00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWZrSK4xtXs&t=49s)** — And he sent me a fascinating summary of this study and some of the holes in the study.
- **[00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWZrSK4xtXs&t=56s)** — In this study, they use the same trial protocols as they use in drugs. Let's say, for example,
- **[01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWZrSK4xtXs&t=63s)** — I'm going to study statin drugs. Okay. And I'm going to take two groups. In one group,
- **[01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWZrSK4xtXs&t=68s)** — I'm going to give them the statin drug. And the other group, I'm not going to give them a
- **[01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWZrSK4xtXs&t=72s)** — statin. I'm going to give them a placebo. And then we're going to compare what this drug did.
- **[01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWZrSK4xtXs&t=77s)** — Right? Now, normally we don't have any statin drugs in our bloodstream naturally. And if
- **[01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWZrSK4xtXs&t=83s)** — you're taking the placebo, you're not going to get the statin. Vitamin D is a little bit
- **[01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWZrSK4xtXs&t=88s)** — different because we naturally get vitamin D from our diet, from the sun. So there was no
- **[01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWZrSK4xtXs&t=95s)** — baseline vitamin D tested during the study. They might have tested it, but they didn't
- **[01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWZrSK4xtXs&t=100s)** — give us the data. So why is that important to get a baseline? Well, let's say, for
- **[01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWZrSK4xtXs&t=103s)** — example, someone is deficient in vitamin D and they take vitamin D. They're going to
- **[01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWZrSK4xtXs&t=109s)** — see a result, right? Versus someone else who has enough vitamin D. Are they going to see
- **[01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWZrSK4xtXs&t=114s)** — more results if you give them vitamin D? Probably not because they weren't deficient
- **[01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWZrSK4xtXs&t=119s)** — in vitamin D. Right off the bat, this study is pretty much null. It shouldn't even have been
- **[02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWZrSK4xtXs&t=126s)** — published. And not only that, everyone in the study, including the group who took the placebo,
- **[02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWZrSK4xtXs&t=132s)** — were permitted to take up to 800 IUs of vitamin D3 every single day. Yes, even the
- **[02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWZrSK4xtXs&t=138s)** — C-bell group. When you take more vitamin D, many times that extra that you don't really need
- **[02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWZrSK4xtXs&t=143s)** — is converted into an inactive form of vitamin D3. And then you also have the fact that this
- **[02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWZrSK4xtXs&t=150s)** — study measured the amount of vitamin D that was in the blood. Now, when they test the
- **[02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWZrSK4xtXs&t=154s)** — vitamin D in the blood, they're always testing the inactive form of vitamin D, kind of the
- **[02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWZrSK4xtXs&t=160s)** — reservoir of vitamin D. That inactive reservoir is mainly for the system of vitamin D that
- **[02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWZrSK4xtXs&t=166s)** — involves skeletal system, bones, and calcium. There's another system of vitamin D that involves
- **[02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWZrSK4xtXs&t=173s)** — the immune system that can help you prevent cancer, inflammation, diabetes, dementia,
- **[03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWZrSK4xtXs&t=181s)** — that does not involve vitamin D in the blood. To measure that, you're going to have to
- **[03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWZrSK4xtXs&t=185s)** — measure the active form in the cells. They're two different forms. And you're assuming that
- **[03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWZrSK4xtXs&t=191s)** — vitamin D in the blood is also acting in this other system, which is a huge error because it's
- **[03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWZrSK4xtXs&t=198s)** — not. You could have normal vitamin D in your blood and be virtually empty in the cells.
- **[03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWZrSK4xtXs&t=204s)** — And then we also have the subject of how much vitamin D was given in this study. And they
- **[03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWZrSK4xtXs&t=209s)** — even called it high amounts of vitamin D3, which is only 2,000 IUs. Now, 2,000 IUs might
- **[03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWZrSK4xtXs&t=217s)** — sound like a very large number, but it's only 50 micrograms, okay? 50 micrograms,
- **[03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWZrSK4xtXs&t=225s)** — not milligrams. That is not enough to affect the rest of the body. Any type of favorable
- **[03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWZrSK4xtXs&t=232s)** — research about vitamin D is not welcomed by the journals. Dr. Hollis also mentioned to me
- **[03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWZrSK4xtXs&t=238s)** — that he was involved in a study called the VDAART, which talked about the prevention of
- **[04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWZrSK4xtXs&t=245s)** — which concluded that if you were to give a woman 4,000 to 6,000 IUs of vitamin D3 in the first
- **[04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWZrSK4xtXs&t=254s)** — trimester of a pregnancy, you would very likely get rid of almost all cases of asthma,
- **[04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWZrSK4xtXs&t=260s)** — but you can't do it with 2,000 IUs of vitamin D3. It needs to be closer to 4,000 to 6,000.
- **[04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWZrSK4xtXs&t=268s)** — And in the Townsend letter, which I'm going to put down below, there were six additional
- **[04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWZrSK4xtXs&t=272s)** — papers that Dr. Hollis mentioned. One that showed that vitamin D decreases autoimmune disease
- **[04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWZrSK4xtXs&t=278s)** — by 22%. Another one shows that vitamin D can decrease the incidence of advanced cancer.
- **[04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWZrSK4xtXs&t=285s)** — Another one says that the more vitamin D in your blood, the lower risk of cancer rate
- **[04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWZrSK4xtXs&t=290s)** — and cancer mortality reduces autism. Another one talks about reducing asthma significantly.
- **[04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWZrSK4xtXs&t=297s)** — And then another one that he was involved with that decreased pregnancy adverse outcomes.
- **[05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWZrSK4xtXs&t=302s)** — And the New England Journal of Medicine would not publish that article, but he eventually got
- **[05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWZrSK4xtXs&t=307s)** — into another publication. So even though the vital study showed that vitamin D was worthless,
- **[05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWZrSK4xtXs&t=312s)** — there's plenty of other research to show that vitamin D can significantly decrease
- **[05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWZrSK4xtXs&t=317s)** — breast cancer, tooth decay, depression, skin disorders, especially psoriasis, prostate
- **[05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWZrSK4xtXs&t=324s)** — cancer, cardiovascular disease, high blood pressure, diabetes, and even colon cancer.
- **[05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWZrSK4xtXs&t=331s)** — This is also interesting. Women who completely avoid the sun have an increased risk of breast
- **[05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWZrSK4xtXs&t=338s)** — cancer by a thousand percent compared to women who get regular sun exposure. Sunbathing itself
- **[05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWZrSK4xtXs&t=346s)** — has shown to decrease blood pressure. Being out in the sun can increase serotonin by up to
- **[05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWZrSK4xtXs&t=352s)** — 80% just in one day without any side effects. So if you have not seen my interview with Dr.
- **[05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWZrSK4xtXs&t=359s)** — Hollis, I put it up right here. Check it out.

- **[00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YROt0Xgr8QE&t=0s)** — Now, someone had a question on one of my comments relating to bugs because...
- **[00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YROt0Xgr8QE&t=5s)** — A recent report says insects are the future of food.
- **[00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YROt0Xgr8QE&t=8s)** — Bugs for dinner? Acing insects?
- **[00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YROt0Xgr8QE&t=11s)** — They want us to all eat bugs by 2050 because of the rise of population. We'll be roughly about
- **[00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YROt0Xgr8QE&t=18s)** — maybe nine billion people on this planet. So how are we going to feed them? I mean,
- **[00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YROt0Xgr8QE&t=21s)** — everyone knows this fact because the climate change and beef is not sustainable. We need
- **[00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YROt0Xgr8QE&t=26s)** — to find other sources of food. I like to say my life's mission is to breed a bug that tastes like
- **[00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YROt0Xgr8QE&t=31s)** — bacon. And yes, they even say the grass-fed regenerative farming type agriculture needs
- **[00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YROt0Xgr8QE&t=36s)** — to go because of all the cow burping and the methane and what that does to the environment
- **[00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YROt0Xgr8QE&t=40s)** — because that's the big problem. And one of the big solutions would be the bugs because they're
- **[00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YROt0Xgr8QE&t=44s)** — so high in protein and they're so nutrient dense. Well, let's do a little breakdown of
- **[00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YROt0Xgr8QE&t=49s)** — topic because if we take a hundred grams of these bugs, in this hundred grams we have about
- **[00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YROt0Xgr8QE&t=57s)** — 12 grams of actual protein and there's about five grams of fat, five grams of carbs,
- **[01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YROt0Xgr8QE&t=62s)** — little iron, a little tiny bit of fat. But is 12 grams enough for our bodies?
- **[01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YROt0Xgr8QE&t=67s)** — Actually, no. If we do the math and look at the actual number of crickets that we're
- **[01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YROt0Xgr8QE&t=71s)** — gonna have to eat to get close to this protein, we're gonna have to 4x that. That's
- **[01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YROt0Xgr8QE&t=77s)** — big. But for a lot of people, they're gonna need to 8x that figure every single day to get
- **[01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YROt0Xgr8QE&t=83s)** — their protein amount. I guess we can mash them up and put them into pizzas and with all these
- **[01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YROt0Xgr8QE&t=88s)** — other different flavorings. We can put them in burgers, sweeten them, and that might be a
- **[01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YROt0Xgr8QE&t=92s)** — solution. But what about the cost? It's gonna be quite expensive, right? But they can bring
- **[01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YROt0Xgr8QE&t=98s)** — the cost down by feeding the crickets cheaper materials like maybe corn, soy, beet sugar,
- **[01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YROt0Xgr8QE&t=104s)** — something like that. The problem with that is the nutrition comes down, you know, and then the
- **[01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YROt0Xgr8QE&t=108s)** — protein level comes down. And that's one little issue. Quite expensive to have healthy insects
- **[01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YROt0Xgr8QE&t=115s)** — to eat. Okay? Number two, we're gonna have to get everyone to give up their traditional
- **[01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YROt0Xgr8QE&t=119s)** — cultural foods. And that might take some work. I think that the first bite is the hardest.
- **[02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YROt0Xgr8QE&t=125s)** — And then after that, people go, well, they taste pretty good. Oh, the crunch. Number
- **[02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YROt0Xgr8QE&t=131s)** — three, and this is probably the biggest one. When you compare an insect with beef, it's not the
- **[02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YROt0Xgr8QE&t=138s)** — same. For anyone to say that it's identical, they're lying through their teeth, it's not
- **[02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YROt0Xgr8QE&t=142s)** — even close. And I'm not just talking about the protein. I'm talking about the quality
- **[02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YROt0Xgr8QE&t=146s)** — of protein. I'm talking about the nutrition, all these other factors that is in beef that is
- **[02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YROt0Xgr8QE&t=152s)** — not in crickets. So don't buy into the it's the same thing. Number four, insects carry
- **[02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YROt0Xgr8QE&t=157s)** — So there's one study in 2019 that evaluated quite a few cricket farms that were developing
- **[02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YROt0Xgr8QE&t=164s)** — edible crickets. And 81% of them had parasites. 30% were potentially pathogenic. There's also a
- **[02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YROt0Xgr8QE&t=172s)** — higher incidence of worms in crickets and viruses and bacteria and funguses. Then we
- **[02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YROt0Xgr8QE&t=178s)** — have the safety studies, right? We have to do all that. Then we're gonna have to probably
- **[03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YROt0Xgr8QE&t=182s)** — and cook these insects to kill off the microbes. But then we're also going to kill off a lot of
- **[03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YROt0Xgr8QE&t=188s)** — the nutrition as well. There's this unregulated field of using pesticides on these insects.
- **[03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YROt0Xgr8QE&t=194s)** — So you can use different chemicals to kind of manage some of these other factors that are
- **[03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YROt0Xgr8QE&t=202s)** — can be growing in these bugs. Then the next thing is that if someone has an allergy to
- **[03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YROt0Xgr8QE&t=207s)** — Okay, because there's a similar protein involved, chances are they'll also have an allergy to bugs
- **[03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YROt0Xgr8QE&t=213s)** — if they start consuming them. And then the next factor is that these bugs have this exoskeleton.
- **[03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YROt0Xgr8QE&t=219s)** — It's like bones outside their body. And the main compound in there is called chitin. It's
- **[03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YROt0Xgr8QE&t=227s)** — an anti-nutrient. It's not digested by our microbiome. And it also blocks vitamin A and
- **[03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YROt0Xgr8QE&t=233s)** — And so this is just another negative. And so now we're doing another human pilot experiment
- **[03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YROt0Xgr8QE&t=239s)** — that will put people on bugs and then see what happens after years. My viewpoint on the future
- **[04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YROt0Xgr8QE&t=245s)** — of food being bugs does not look like it's going to happen. There are too many negative
- **[04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YROt0Xgr8QE&t=250s)** — points about this. Now, if you want to know what I think you should be eating right now
- **[04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YROt0Xgr8QE&t=254s)** — to regain your health and be super healthy, I think it's probably the most healthy food
- **[04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YROt0Xgr8QE&t=259s)** — you can eat. It's right here. Check it out.

- **[00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37tz8sJlbZk&t=0s)** — So what does olive oil do for your body? That's what we're going to talk about today. Now for
- **[00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37tz8sJlbZk&t=5s)** — many years I consumed olive oil but I had no idea it wasn't the real olive oil. It was the fake stuff.
- **[00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37tz8sJlbZk&t=12s)** — It's very bland. It created no itchiness in the back part of my throat like real olive oil does.
- **[00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37tz8sJlbZk&t=19s)** — So it wasn't until I went to Italy where I visited a farm where they actually make olive oil, the
- **[00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37tz8sJlbZk&t=25s)** — real stuff, the extra virgin olive oil. And that was this farm right here. I don't know if you
- **[00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37tz8sJlbZk&t=29s)** — can see it. San Michelle a Tori. So this was an amazing experience because I was blown away at
- **[00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37tz8sJlbZk&t=38s)** — how they really take care of the soil and the process of making this. And everything is
- **[00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37tz8sJlbZk&t=44s)** — cold pressed and extracted without any type of solvents and chemicals. And so after that
- **[00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37tz8sJlbZk&t=49s)** — experience I was hooked on olive oil. I consume a lot of olive oil. So the question is what does
- **[00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37tz8sJlbZk&t=54s)** — olive oil do to the body and what's in the olive oil that creates these effects? We have antioxidant
- **[01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37tz8sJlbZk&t=61s)** — effects. We have anti-inflammatory effects for arthritis, inflammation in the arteries. We have
- **[01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37tz8sJlbZk&t=66s)** — all sorts of cardiovascular benefits, decreasing blood pressure. There's a lot of nerve and brain
- **[01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37tz8sJlbZk&t=71s)** — effects for your cognitive function, memory, and mood as well as anti-cancer effects. There's
- **[01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37tz8sJlbZk&t=84s)** — okay because what's unique about olive oil is the high concentration of
- **[01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37tz8sJlbZk&t=90s)** — monounsaturated fat. Now you might say well okay so it's not saturated fat so it must be
- **[01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37tz8sJlbZk&t=95s)** — healthy because it's a monounsaturated fat. And 80% of olive oil is monounsaturated fat.
- **[01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37tz8sJlbZk&t=102s)** — But that is not where you're getting the benefit. I mean it also has a little bit of
- **[01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37tz8sJlbZk&t=106s)** — vitamin E. It has vitamin K1. But that's not where you're seeing the big benefits.
- **[01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37tz8sJlbZk&t=111s)** — All of the therapeutic benefits of this stuff occur because of a group of plant chemicals.
- **[02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37tz8sJlbZk&t=120s)** — They're called polyphenols. Poly means many. In phenols is a word to describe a certain
- **[02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37tz8sJlbZk&t=126s)** — chemistry or a chemical that is from the plant. It's from the fruit of the olive tree,
- **[02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37tz8sJlbZk&t=132s)** — the actual olive. So what specific polyphenol does all the magic? All we know is that these
- **[02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37tz8sJlbZk&t=138s)** — polyphenols from plants which are developed as a defense mechanism produce a lot of cool effects
- **[02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37tz8sJlbZk&t=144s)** — in our bodies especially in preventing the complications from chronic disease,
- **[02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37tz8sJlbZk&t=150s)** — oxidative stress that destroys our certain cells. And there's a couple things about
- **[02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37tz8sJlbZk&t=155s)** — polyphenols that I'd like to share with you. Number one, they are made from a group of
- **[02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37tz8sJlbZk&t=162s)** — amino acids. What's unique about these aromatic amino acids is they follow a very specific
- **[02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37tz8sJlbZk&t=170s)** — chemical pathway which is called the chiquimate pathway. So this amino acid pathway involving
- **[02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37tz8sJlbZk&t=179s)** — enzymes basically converts these amino acids to polyphenols. And our body doesn't use this
- **[03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37tz8sJlbZk&t=187s)** — but plants and microbes do. And this is how Monsanto came up with glyphosate, the herbicide
- **[03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37tz8sJlbZk&t=195s)** — that is also classified as an antibiotic that blocks this pathway. So it blocks the
- **[03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37tz8sJlbZk&t=202s)** — microbe as well as the plant's ability to utilize or produce these amino acids. So
- **[03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37tz8sJlbZk&t=209s)** — there's no conversion to these polyphenols. So the more glyphosate something has,
- **[03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37tz8sJlbZk&t=215s)** — the less of these phytochemicals that the plant's going to create and the less the
- **[03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37tz8sJlbZk&t=221s)** — microbe can make these amino acids. This is why especially if you're going to get olive oil,
- **[03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37tz8sJlbZk&t=229s)** — you need to do organic because all of the benefits from olive oil occur if you have the
- **[03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37tz8sJlbZk&t=236s)** — polyphenols. And if you don't, chances are you're not going to have the benefits. Now this
- **[04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37tz8sJlbZk&t=241s)** — pathway also is involved in making dopamine, noradrenaline, the thyroid hormones, serotonin,
- **[04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37tz8sJlbZk&t=251s)** — melatonin. It probably explains why a lot of people have problems with sleep, the thyroid,
- **[04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37tz8sJlbZk&t=257s)** — their mood when they're exposed to glyphosate. So there's more and more research that is showing
- **[04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37tz8sJlbZk&t=263s)** — up relating to this affecting your gut microbiome, creating GI problems, creating metabolic problems.
- **[04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37tz8sJlbZk&t=272s)** — But what I find interesting is that the polyphenols are dependent upon those aromatic
- **[04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37tz8sJlbZk&t=279s)** — amino acid turning into these phytochemicals that give you the benefit. The other thing
- **[04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37tz8sJlbZk&t=285s)** — that I want you to know about polyphenols is that they're a little bit difficult to
- **[04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37tz8sJlbZk&t=289s)** — digest and absorb by your own body. So your own microbes are actually involved in breaking them
- **[04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37tz8sJlbZk&t=295s)** — down so they can be absorbed. And the third thing I want you to know, there are polyphenols
- **[05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37tz8sJlbZk&t=301s)** — and a lot of other phytonutrients in your salad that you put this on. And the absorption
- **[05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37tz8sJlbZk&t=307s)** — is also dependent on if there's fat present. And so that monounsaturated oil fat that's in
- **[05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37tz8sJlbZk&t=314s)** — here will greatly help you extract these other phytonutrients from the salad. So in my salads,
- **[05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37tz8sJlbZk&t=321s)** — which I consume every day, I use extra virgin olive oil, I use balsamic vinaigrette,
- **[05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37tz8sJlbZk&t=328s)** — and sometimes I'll use different spices as well. So regarding olive oil, don't go for
- **[05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37tz8sJlbZk&t=333s)** — just the cheap stuff that could be fake. To really know it's real, just the smell of it,
- **[05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37tz8sJlbZk&t=339s)** — as well as what it does to the back of the throat, it'll irritate the back of the throat.
- **[05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37tz8sJlbZk&t=343s)** — That means it has those phytonutrients. If it's too mild or bland, it's not the real stuff.
- **[05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37tz8sJlbZk&t=349s)** — And the last thing you need to know is always make sure you do the organic
- **[05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37tz8sJlbZk&t=352s)** — extra virgin olive oil to avoid any type of extra glyphosate that could end up in a product.
- **[05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37tz8sJlbZk&t=358s)** — Since we're on the topic of olive oil, if you haven't seen my other popular video,
- **[06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37tz8sJlbZk&t=362s)** — I put it up right here. Check it out.

- **[00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E1DZUtY9AGA&t=0s)** — What would actually happen if you consumed celery juice for 7 days?
- **[00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E1DZUtY9AGA&t=4s)** — Now there are 4 things in celery juice that are quite powerful, but most of the things that people
- **[00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E1DZUtY9AGA&t=10s)** — talk about in celery juice are not the things that are contributing to your health. Okay, like,
- **[00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E1DZUtY9AGA&t=15s)** — first of all, it's 95% water. The nutrients in celery juice are not that high. I mean,
- **[00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E1DZUtY9AGA&t=21s)** — it does have folate, which is B9, but that's only like 9%. And then people say, oh yeah,
- **[00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E1DZUtY9AGA&t=26s)** — high in sodium. In one glass, like 16 ounces of celery juice, you're talking about 288 milligrams
- **[00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E1DZUtY9AGA&t=32s)** — of sodium. That's one eighth of what you need every single day. But what is really amazing
- **[00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E1DZUtY9AGA&t=37s)** — in celery juice? There are 4 natural chemicals called phytonutrients. And also there's a book
- **[00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E1DZUtY9AGA&t=45s)** — that states that celery juice is the most powerful medicine of our time. So let's talk
- **[00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E1DZUtY9AGA&t=52s)** — about why that can actually even be true. The medical medium talks about the benefit from the
- **[00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E1DZUtY9AGA&t=58s)** — sodium cluster crystals. And I really couldn't find any data on that, but I have found a lot
- **[01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E1DZUtY9AGA&t=63s)** — of data on these 4 phytonutrients that I'm going to share with you. So the first one is
- **[01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E1DZUtY9AGA&t=67s)** — a long name, 3N-butyl phthalide. Here's what this chemical does. Repair after a stroke,
- **[01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E1DZUtY9AGA&t=75s)** — reconstruct the microcirculation. It has certain neural regenerative properties and its
- **[01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E1DZUtY9AGA&t=81s)** — antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, anti-apoptosis. Now what is apoptosis? It's basically when the cell
- **[01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E1DZUtY9AGA&t=88s)** — commits suicide when it's damaged. Also it has a property of an antithrombosis, so it helps to
- **[01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E1DZUtY9AGA&t=95s)** — prevent clotting. And then the second compound is called apigenin. And apigenin is one of the most
- **[01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E1DZUtY9AGA&t=102s)** — researched and studied polyphenols. It's in parsley, it's in onion, it's in oranges,
- **[01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E1DZUtY9AGA&t=109s)** — it's in thyme, it's in basil, and it's definitely in celery juice. Normally in nature a plant uses
- **[01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E1DZUtY9AGA&t=117s)** — apigenin to protect itself against UV radiation from the sun, as well as acting as an insecticide.
- **[02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E1DZUtY9AGA&t=124s)** — So it's a defense mechanism. But when we consume this compound in small amounts,
- **[02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E1DZUtY9AGA&t=130s)** — it creates an epigenetic effect that actually can benefit us. But apigenin is a good muscle
- **[02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E1DZUtY9AGA&t=136s)** — relaxer. This is why when you consume celery juice you feel calm. If you have high blood
- **[02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E1DZUtY9AGA&t=142s)** — pressure it tends to lower the blood pressure, you can sleep better, and it has anti-diabetic
- **[02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E1DZUtY9AGA&t=149s)** — properties. It's even been used to help people with amnesia, which is interesting.
- **[02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E1DZUtY9AGA&t=154s)** — The third compound is called cumeric acid. This compound is anti-inflammatory, anti-ulcer,
- **[02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E1DZUtY9AGA&t=161s)** — anti-clotting, as well as supporting your blood sugars. It can also help with inflammation
- **[02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E1DZUtY9AGA&t=167s)** — with arthritis. Then the last compound is called camphorol. Camphorol has anti-viral properties,
- **[02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E1DZUtY9AGA&t=174s)** — anti-bacterial properties, anti-fungal properties, as well as being an anti-inflammatory
- **[02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E1DZUtY9AGA&t=179s)** — in general. So is celery juice the most powerful medicine of our time? I don't know about
- **[03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E1DZUtY9AGA&t=185s)** — that, but it's pretty awesome. This is what I recommend you do, and I just got done with
- **[03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E1DZUtY9AGA&t=189s)** — I did this for seven days. I'll probably continue it. You buy celery, wash it off,
- **[03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E1DZUtY9AGA&t=195s)** — make sure it's organic, juice 16 ounces, drink it in the morning, an empty stomach. If you
- **[03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E1DZUtY9AGA&t=202s)** — wanted to add something to it, don't add additional juices. Add a little lemon to it.
- **[03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E1DZUtY9AGA&t=207s)** — But the main benefits come from these four compounds. There could be other compounds that
- **[03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E1DZUtY9AGA&t=211s)** — are creating all sorts of effects, but if you haven't tried it, you might want to try
- **[03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E1DZUtY9AGA&t=215s)** — it. I think you might like it. If you haven't seen my other video on celery, I put that up
- **[03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E1DZUtY9AGA&t=219s)** — here. Check it out.

- **[00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_iJt5AIoCI&t=0s)** — What would happen if you used rice water on your hair for two weeks?
- **[00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_iJt5AIoCI&t=4s)** — This is actually one of those ancient secrets that have been used in Asia for hundreds of years.
- **[00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_iJt5AIoCI&t=9s)** — I'm going to show you the biggest mistake that people make when they do this,
- **[00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_iJt5AIoCI&t=12s)** — as well as the exact way of how to do this to maximize your results.
- **[00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_iJt5AIoCI&t=17s)** — Making your hair stronger, your scalp is going to be much healthier.
- **[00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_iJt5AIoCI&t=20s)** — Big question is, how can the water from rice do anything, really?
- **[00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_iJt5AIoCI&t=24s)** — You're not actually eating the rice and you're not even drinking the water.
- **[00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_iJt5AIoCI&t=28s)** — If you look this up, there's several ways to do this.
- **[00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_iJt5AIoCI&t=30s)** — Some people will take a cup of rice in two cups of water and they'll mix it together
- **[00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_iJt5AIoCI&t=35s)** — and then they'll let it sit for a couple hours.
- **[00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_iJt5AIoCI&t=38s)** — They'll strain off the rice and then use that rice water on their hair.
- **[00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_iJt5AIoCI&t=42s)** — That's really not going to do anything.
- **[00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_iJt5AIoCI&t=43s)** — There's a way to make this rice water that you can turn that into a probiotic.
- **[00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_iJt5AIoCI&t=48s)** — What's interesting is you're not actually adding any microbes at all.
- **[00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_iJt5AIoCI&t=51s)** — The microbes are already on the rice. The microbes are actually in the air.
- **[00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_iJt5AIoCI&t=56s)** — What you're going to do is you're going to create this probiotic liquid,
- **[01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_iJt5AIoCI&t=60s)** — which is going to be made over a period of time of 48 hours,
- **[01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_iJt5AIoCI&t=63s)** — where these microbes are going to eat the starch from the rice
- **[01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_iJt5AIoCI&t=66s)** — and they're going to reproduce at a massive level.
- **[01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_iJt5AIoCI&t=69s)** — You're going to use that probiotic with all the additional byproducts
- **[01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_iJt5AIoCI&t=72s)** — that are created on your hair and your scalp.
- **[01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_iJt5AIoCI&t=75s)** — A lot of great things occur from fermentation.
- **[01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_iJt5AIoCI&t=78s)** — Of course, you have yogurt, kefir, cheese.
- **[01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_iJt5AIoCI&t=81s)** — All these wonderful things occur when you ferment them.
- **[01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_iJt5AIoCI&t=83s)** — Let's first talk about what is in this rice water
- **[01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_iJt5AIoCI&t=85s)** — that's so good for your hair and your scalp.
- **[01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_iJt5AIoCI&t=87s)** — Rice normally has a lot of B vitamins,
- **[01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_iJt5AIoCI&t=90s)** — and B vitamins are essential for the hair.
- **[01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_iJt5AIoCI&t=92s)** — There's amino acids in this solution as well.
- **[01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_iJt5AIoCI&t=95s)** — One of the interesting byproducts of fermentation is called patera.
- **[01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_iJt5AIoCI&t=100s)** — A lot of people use patera on their skin.
- **[01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_iJt5AIoCI&t=102s)** — Patera is the antidote to dull hair,
- **[01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_iJt5AIoCI&t=105s)** — because it's going to make your hair look really bright, shiny, healthy.
- **[01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_iJt5AIoCI&t=109s)** — If you had dandruff, for example, or itchiness,
- **[01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_iJt5AIoCI&t=112s)** — or some type of imbalance in the microbiome on your surface of your skin,
- **[01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_iJt5AIoCI&t=116s)** — that's going to be greatly improved.
- **[01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_iJt5AIoCI&t=118s)** — As soon as you start sterilizing it,
- **[01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_iJt5AIoCI&t=119s)** — or putting shampoos that actually kill the microbiome in your scalp,
- **[02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_iJt5AIoCI&t=123s)** — then you get an overgrowth of unfriendly yeast.
- **[02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_iJt5AIoCI&t=126s)** — And that's why it takes a friendly yeast to help put that back in check.
- **[02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_iJt5AIoCI&t=130s)** — There's another really important thing in this liquid,
- **[02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_iJt5AIoCI&t=133s)** — and it's called lactic acid.
- **[02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_iJt5AIoCI&t=136s)** — That comes from lactic acid bacteria.
- **[02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_iJt5AIoCI&t=138s)** — And I know people are like, oh, the body should be alkaline.
- **[02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_iJt5AIoCI&t=141s)** — And anything that's acidic is unhealthy.
- **[02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_iJt5AIoCI&t=143s)** — No, not when we're dealing with hair in your skin.
- **[02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_iJt5AIoCI&t=145s)** — We need your skin and hair to be on the acid side.
- **[02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_iJt5AIoCI&t=148s)** — And lactic acid is an acid that will help the skin and hair,
- **[02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_iJt5AIoCI&t=151s)** — and decrease that dullness and frizzy hair that you may have.
- **[02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_iJt5AIoCI&t=155s)** — And there's other nutrients in this liquid too,
- **[02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_iJt5AIoCI&t=157s)** — like magnesium and selenium, for example.
- **[02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_iJt5AIoCI&t=158s)** — This liquid also increases something called nitric oxide,
- **[02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_iJt5AIoCI&t=162s)** — which can actually help bring oxygen to the root of the hair.
- **[02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_iJt5AIoCI&t=165s)** — Overall, it can do a lot for your hair, your scalp,
- **[02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_iJt5AIoCI&t=168s)** — and your skin if you want to put on your skin as well.
- **[02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_iJt5AIoCI&t=170s)** — Let me now show you how to make it.
- **[02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_iJt5AIoCI&t=171s)** — So simply add two cups of that rice in a bowl.
- **[02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_iJt5AIoCI&t=174s)** — Add four cups of water.
- **[02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_iJt5AIoCI&t=176s)** — And I recommend taking your hand and massaging a little bit,
- **[02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_iJt5AIoCI&t=178s)** — just so you can clean out any dirt or excess starch.
- **[03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_iJt5AIoCI&t=181s)** — Then you're going to drain the water.
- **[03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_iJt5AIoCI&t=182s)** — So what's left in the bowl is two cups of this wet rice.
- **[03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_iJt5AIoCI&t=185s)** — At this point, add two more cups of fresh water.
- **[03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_iJt5AIoCI&t=188s)** — Mix it up a little bit and let it sit at room temperature for two hours.
- **[03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_iJt5AIoCI&t=192s)** — You're going to drain out the fluid into the glass jar.
- **[03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_iJt5AIoCI&t=197s)** — Cover the jar lightly. That way it has a chance to breathe.
- **[03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_iJt5AIoCI&t=200s)** — And what's happening is the yeast and bacteria from the air
- **[03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_iJt5AIoCI&t=204s)** — and on the rice is starting to eat some of that carbohydrate in that rice water.
- **[03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_iJt5AIoCI&t=209s)** — They're eating it and they're giving all these amazing byproducts,
- **[03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_iJt5AIoCI&t=214s)** — vitamins, minerals, antioxidants.
- **[03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_iJt5AIoCI&t=215s)** — When you're fermenting a solution, you can ferment it for 24 hours
- **[03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_iJt5AIoCI&t=219s)** — and still get some benefit.
- **[03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_iJt5AIoCI&t=220s)** — You'll have a lot of the bacteria that's growing in there.
- **[03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_iJt5AIoCI&t=224s)** — Then in the second 24 hours,
- **[03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_iJt5AIoCI&t=225s)** — you're going to have more of the benefits from the yeast and their byproducts,
- **[03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_iJt5AIoCI&t=228s)** — which are really going to help your scalp and your skin as well as the hair.
- **[03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_iJt5AIoCI&t=232s)** — But here's the thing. You could continue to ferment this for much longer.
- **[03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_iJt5AIoCI&t=237s)** — You can go a week. Some people even go for a month.
- **[04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_iJt5AIoCI&t=240s)** — You may notice that it starts to give some smell or odor that you might not like.
- **[04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_iJt5AIoCI&t=245s)** — And that has to do with some of the overgrowth that can occur in that mixture.
- **[04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_iJt5AIoCI&t=249s)** — You really don't need to go past 48 hours.
- **[04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_iJt5AIoCI&t=252s)** — But if you do, it will still help you.
- **[04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_iJt5AIoCI&t=253s)** — You just might want to add some spearmint essential oils or something to offset the smell.
- **[04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_iJt5AIoCI&t=258s)** — Then at 48 hours, you can take the cheesecloth or paper towel off the top,
- **[04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_iJt5AIoCI&t=263s)** — screw the lid on it, and then put it in the refrigerator
- **[04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_iJt5AIoCI&t=265s)** — so it can then be preserved for a longer period of time.
- **[04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_iJt5AIoCI&t=268s)** — The colder temperature will slow down the bacterial growth.
- **[04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_iJt5AIoCI&t=271s)** — Then you're going to leave it on your hair for about 20 minutes.
- **[04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_iJt5AIoCI&t=274s)** — After 20 minutes, rinse out your hair.
- **[04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_iJt5AIoCI&t=276s)** — And then you can dry it and you're good to go.
- **[04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_iJt5AIoCI&t=278s)** — I would recommend doing it twice a week.
- **[04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_iJt5AIoCI&t=280s)** — Let's say, for example, you're doing it twice a week for two weeks.
- **[04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_iJt5AIoCI&t=284s)** — You're going to need roughly about four cups of this material.
- **[04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_iJt5AIoCI&t=287s)** — Then you have enough for four applications over the next two weeks.
- **[04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_iJt5AIoCI&t=290s)** — This is a great solution to help repair your hair,
- **[04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_iJt5AIoCI&t=293s)** — to put the microbes back into the hair.
- **[04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_iJt5AIoCI&t=296s)** — And like I said before, you can also apply some of this on your face,
- **[04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_iJt5AIoCI&t=299s)** — okay, with a little cotton swab.
- **[05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_iJt5AIoCI&t=301s)** — Apply it to the face, wait 20 minutes, and then rinse it out.
- **[05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_iJt5AIoCI&t=304s)** — Go ahead and try this. I think you're going to be highly impressed.
- **[05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_iJt5AIoCI&t=307s)** — And then please comment down below and tell me how it worked for you.

## Video 114: What Your URINE COLOR Says about Your Health

**Watch on YouTube:** [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7bQGGW3UTg](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7bQGGW3UTg)

- **[00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7bQGGW3UTg&t=0s)** — Today we are going to discuss the color of your urine and what that means. You can use urine as an indicator to determine what is going on deeper inside your body.
- **[00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7bQGGW3UTg&t=8s)** — First question is, what is urine? Well, urine is filtered blood. Now you have these little tiny magical filters in your kidneys called nephrons.
- **[00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7bQGGW3UTg&t=18s)** — And these nephrons are very intelligent. They recycle a lot of good material but they also selectively are able to take out the poisons and the bad stuff and push those out of your body.
- **[00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7bQGGW3UTg&t=29s)** — So today we are going to diagnose or dissect this problem based on just color alone. If you are urinating and the urine is completely clear, this means that you are drinking too much water.
- **[00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7bQGGW3UTg&t=42s)** — Because you are diluting your urine so much, you are losing all these pigments. Now what is interesting about drinking a lot of water to somehow get hydrated,
- **[00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7bQGGW3UTg&t=53s)** — people that drink too much water, they dilute their sodium and they actually become dehydrated. Because the key with hydration is the right amount of electrolytes with the right amount of water.
- **[01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7bQGGW3UTg&t=64s)** — If your urine is clear, you might not want to drink so much. I always like to recommend drinking when you are thirsty. And especially if you are not working out or sweating.
- **[01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7bQGGW3UTg&t=73s)** — Too much water could actually be dangerous.
- **[01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7bQGGW3UTg&t=77s)** — Alright, so the next color is basically yellow or amber. And that color is really coming from a pigment in your blood. I am not going to get into the chemistry of how that happens.
- **[01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7bQGGW3UTg&t=88s)** — But when you see your urine being yellow, amber or straw colored, that means that it is normal.
- **[01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7bQGGW3UTg&t=94s)** — Alright, the next color we are going to talk about in your urine is if the color is red or pink. Usually this means that there is blood involved.
- **[01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7bQGGW3UTg&t=104s)** — Now there are several reasons why you might have blood in your urine.
- **[01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7bQGGW3UTg&t=108s)** — It could be a kidney stone. It could be that you are menstruating and that contaminated the urine.
- **[01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7bQGGW3UTg&t=113s)** — This could also be some type of infection or it could be something more serious. But anytime you have blood you should get it checked out by your doctor.
- **[02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7bQGGW3UTg&t=122s)** — Some people that run a lot like joggers for example, they are doing a lot of pounding on their kidneys. Sometimes that can cause bleeding as well.
- **[02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7bQGGW3UTg&t=131s)** — Okay, now what about if it is like orange or really almost fluorescent type yellow?
- **[02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7bQGGW3UTg&t=138s)** — That usually means that you are taking synthetic vitamins and they are going out through the urine.
- **[02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7bQGGW3UTg&t=144s)** — And especially the B vitamins, it will give that bright fluorescent color.
- **[02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7bQGGW3UTg&t=148s)** — It can also commonly mean that there are certain medications that you are taking that have certain dyes in them.
- **[02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7bQGGW3UTg&t=154s)** — On a rare occasion if your urine is orange it could be something going on with your gallbladder or your liver. But that is not very common.
- **[02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7bQGGW3UTg&t=162s)** — Okay, what about blue-green urine? What is up with that?
- **[02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7bQGGW3UTg&t=165s)** — Well, did you just take something called methylene blue? That will make your urine blue.
- **[02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7bQGGW3UTg&t=169s)** — Are you taking medication that is turning it blue-green?
- **[02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7bQGGW3UTg&t=172s)** — There are a lot of different foods that have artificial colors that will make your urine different colors.
- **[02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7bQGGW3UTg&t=177s)** — Sometimes an asparagus can make the urine green.
- **[03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7bQGGW3UTg&t=182s)** — If it is dark brown, chances are you are dehydrated, you need to add more fluid.
- **[03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7bQGGW3UTg&t=187s)** — As it goes darker into the browns, that is usually a liver problem.
- **[03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7bQGGW3UTg&t=192s)** — Now, what if your urine is normal color but it is foamy, like someone put some soap in it?
- **[03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7bQGGW3UTg&t=199s)** — This could mean several things. It could mean that you are consuming too much protein.
- **[03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7bQGGW3UTg&t=203s)** — It could also mean you have chronic kidney disease and you are usually going to see protein in the urine from that.
- **[03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7bQGGW3UTg&t=209s)** — And it can even occur if you are a diabetic.
- **[03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7bQGGW3UTg&t=211s)** — Because usually with diabetes, with all the sugar coming through, it tends to like rust out different parts of your body, especially the kidneys.
- **[03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7bQGGW3UTg&t=219s)** — The number one cause of kidney damage is diabetes.
- **[03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7bQGGW3UTg&t=223s)** — And this is why we see a high correlation between protein in the urine and diabetes and of course the foaminess in the urine.
- **[03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7bQGGW3UTg&t=231s)** — But probably the first thing you should do is just start cutting down your protein and just see if that handles it.
- **[03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7bQGGW3UTg&t=236s)** — What about if your urine is just cloudy? It is not transparent. It is opaque.
- **[04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7bQGGW3UTg&t=242s)** — This usually means there is an infection. And the most common urinary tract infection is from the microbe E. coli.
- **[04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7bQGGW3UTg&t=250s)** — So if you have that, you might want to get it checked out to see if you do have urinary tract infection.
- **[04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7bQGGW3UTg&t=255s)** — The other thing you need to know about with an infection is that if you are a diabetic, all that sugar that is in your blood spills off into the urine to feed these pathogens.
- **[04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7bQGGW3UTg&t=266s)** — And just as a side note, if someone is excessively thirsty all the time, or and they are excessively urinating a lot, that is usually an indication of diabetes.
- **[04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7bQGGW3UTg&t=278s)** — But it can also be an indication that your calcium is too high in your blood. And that is called hypercalcemia.
- **[04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7bQGGW3UTg&t=286s)** — Now if you have not seen my other video on urine, I put it up right here. Check it out.

## Video 115: What's Really in Cheap Grocery Store Bacon

- **[00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UU8yLdf5meY&t=0s)** — Is expensive bacon really worth it? It's really confusing when you're shopping at the store for
- **[00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UU8yLdf5meY&t=4s)** — bacon because there's all these different types, all these different price points from $3.39 to $5
- **[00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UU8yLdf5meY&t=9s)** — to $9 to $12. Or even in some cases, would you ever spend $283 for a pound of bacon? Well,
- **[00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UU8yLdf5meY&t=18s)** — maybe you would if you understood the bacon from the pigs that I actually raised on my
- **[00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UU8yLdf5meY&t=24s)** — amazing farm, which I'll get into the details a little bit later. When we're talking about the
- **[00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UU8yLdf5meY&t=28s)** — quality of bacon, we have this commodity, extremely cheap bacon. This is what's in most of the grocery
- **[00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UU8yLdf5meY&t=32s)** — stores. Yes, you have a little bit of protein. You have a lot of fat. When a pig is born and
- **[00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UU8yLdf5meY&t=37s)** — weaned off its mother, it's about 40 to 50 pounds, then sent to the feedlot. This new
- **[00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UU8yLdf5meY&t=42s)** — home that this pig is going to live in has a square footage of about 7 to 7.2 square feet.
- **[00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UU8yLdf5meY&t=49s)** — That is the square footage of an average bathtub. It's kind of like you living in a
- **[00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UU8yLdf5meY&t=56s)** — closet. Now they're going to increase the weight of that pig to 250 to 300 pounds in 3 to 4
- **[01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UU8yLdf5meY&t=68s)** — months. Then the question is, what are they feeding this poor animal? 30% of the feed is
- **[01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UU8yLdf5meY&t=74s)** — dent corn, which is GMO. That means it's genetically modified and it has traces of
- **[01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UU8yLdf5meY&t=80s)** — Of course, the other 70% is basically genetically modified corn and soy. Also things like
- **[01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UU8yLdf5meY&t=87s)** — ractopamine. This is a drug that is banned in 90 other countries. And this is a way to ramp up
- **[01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UU8yLdf5meY&t=95s)** — the muscle on this animal in the last 20 days of its life. And what's really fascinating about
- **[01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UU8yLdf5meY&t=100s)** — these factory farms is that they have certain agricultural gag laws. There's laws against
- **[01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UU8yLdf5meY&t=106s)** — can't really reveal what's happening inside some of these farms. Very few people know that that
- **[01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UU8yLdf5meY&t=112s)** — bacon that they buy at the store for $3.33 comes from these factory farms. They don't really
- **[01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UU8yLdf5meY&t=118s)** — think about it. They don't really know about it. I don't want to support that. I want to
- **[02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UU8yLdf5meY&t=121s)** — support the small farmer that's really doing it right. That really cares about the animal's
- **[02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UU8yLdf5meY&t=126s)** — welfare. Now let's talk about the processing of bacon. There's always a smoke flavor with
- **[02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UU8yLdf5meY&t=130s)** — you might think that they're going to roast this pork. But now they're actually going to
- **[02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UU8yLdf5meY&t=135s)** — add liquid smoke or they add this smoke flavoring to the pork. They add some salt water and
- **[02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UU8yLdf5meY&t=141s)** — sometimes sugar and MSG slice it up and take it to the grocery store. Let's contrast that
- **[02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UU8yLdf5meY&t=147s)** — with pasture raised bacon. A really good example of a farmer that does it right. His
- **[02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UU8yLdf5meY&t=151s)** — name is John Arbuckle. John's farm is called Singing Pastures. And I'm going to put a
- **[02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UU8yLdf5meY&t=159s)** — stick on the top of the chart. It takes a lot of work to do that. I've talked to him many
- **[02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UU8yLdf5meY&t=163s)** — times on the phone. I've gotten pictures of his farm and he'll put 20 pigs on an acre of land
- **[02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UU8yLdf5meY&t=170s)** — but then he rotates them to allow the grass to regenerate. We have a really good supportive
- **[02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UU8yLdf5meY&t=176s)** — system with the environment. The super healthy microbes that actually grow and support
- **[03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UU8yLdf5meY&t=182s)** — the plant and give the pig a much better nutrition profile. Plus they're out in the
- **[03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UU8yLdf5meY&t=187s)** — sun so they get a lot more vitamin D. The biggest thing is they get exercise freedom to walk around
- **[03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UU8yLdf5meY&t=192s)** — and navigate through the environment. Then you have these farms in Spain and Italy where these
- **[03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UU8yLdf5meY&t=197s)** — pigs live on acorns. These acorns are one of the best foods for pigs. In Europe they will
- **[03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UU8yLdf5meY&t=205s)** — cure their ham, ferment and enhance the flavor and the quality of the meat. And that
- **[03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UU8yLdf5meY&t=210s)** — curing process could last like 36 months. Now let me shift gears to my little farm operation
- **[03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UU8yLdf5meY&t=216s)** — I'm not selling food on my farm. It's just a hobby. I'm like a farmer wannabe. I'm actually
- **[03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UU8yLdf5meY&t=223s)** — not very skilled at it. I'm just learning how to do it because it's an interesting
- **[03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UU8yLdf5meY&t=227s)** — hobby for me. I have some pigs and I'm only talking about five pigs but those five pigs live
- **[03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UU8yLdf5meY&t=232s)** — on five acres. They get to run around and there's no antibiotics at all. The type of
- **[03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UU8yLdf5meY&t=237s)** — grains that I use are the best grains possible. It's organic. There's no soy. There's no corn.
- **[04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UU8yLdf5meY&t=243s)** — This grain is super expensive. $1,500 per thousand pounds of feed. I calculated the cost
- **[04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UU8yLdf5meY&t=251s)** — of one of my pigs and I was shocked because it was literally around $49,000. Because this
- **[04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UU8yLdf5meY&t=258s)** — is over a course of several years. I'm just feeding them and getting to the point where
- **[04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UU8yLdf5meY&t=262s)** — they're literally like 600 or 700 pounds. If I were to sell one pound of bacon from my pork
- **[04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UU8yLdf5meY&t=269s)** — without even making any profit, my cost is $283.33 per pound. No one in the right mind
- **[04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UU8yLdf5meY&t=277s)** — would spend that amount. I do not know how a small farmer can afford to raise pigs. This is
- **[04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UU8yLdf5meY&t=283s)** — why it's important to support the small farmer especially at the farmers market and
- **[04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UU8yLdf5meY&t=288s)** — other places online. And personally my opinion is it's much better for your health. I want to
- **[04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UU8yLdf5meY&t=292s)** — shift gears to nitrates. Nitrates are a chemical to act as an antibacterial and even
- **[04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UU8yLdf5meY&t=298s)** — enhance the taste a little bit. One of the problems with nitrates is when you add high
- **[05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UU8yLdf5meY&t=302s)** — heats, you can turn the nitrates into another form of nitrates which are cancer causing.
- **[05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UU8yLdf5meY&t=307s)** — There's a big difference between synthetic nitrates and the naturally occurring nitrates
- **[05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UU8yLdf5meY&t=312s)** — that are in certain vegetables like celery. When pork is smoked and you're allowing this to
- **[05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UU8yLdf5meY&t=317s)** — naturally occur with smoke, it actually adds a benefit to that pork. Pork has some of the
- **[05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UU8yLdf5meY&t=328s)** — trace minerals like selenium and zinc. Pork can be very nutrient dense. Over 50% of the fat
- **[05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UU8yLdf5meY&t=335s)** — in pork, I'm talking about lard fat, is a healthy thing. We used to cook with lard long ago. If
- **[05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UU8yLdf5meY&t=341s)** — that pork is raised in the right environment, you can use that lard in cooking and different
- **[05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UU8yLdf5meY&t=346s)** — recipes. Let me shift to the mistakes people make when they're cooking pork. The more
- **[05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UU8yLdf5meY&t=351s)** — overcooked that the meat is, the more the byproducts can be a carcinogen. It's very
- **[05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UU8yLdf5meY&t=356s)** — important when you're frying this bacon not to overdo it. One way is baking. Bake your bacon
- **[06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UU8yLdf5meY&t=362s)** — in the oven. Another way to do it is in an air fryer. Also, if you're frying bacon, if you
- **[06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UU8yLdf5meY&t=367s)** — add a little bit of water to the pan, it can help to reduce the overcooking and the burning
- **[06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UU8yLdf5meY&t=372s)** — effect. Another thing, if you're frying bacon, you can add a little bit of olive oil to
- **[06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UU8yLdf5meY&t=377s)** — the bottom part. You're adding more antioxidants from this extra virgin olive oil. Some other
- **[06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UU8yLdf5meY&t=383s)** — to reduce some of the carcinogenic effect from frying bacon. You can actually add garlic and
- **[06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UU8yLdf5meY&t=390s)** — onions when you're frying the bacon. It can neutralize those carcinogens. The other thing
- **[06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UU8yLdf5meY&t=395s)** — is that when you have bacon, what are you eating with the bacon? A cheeseburger with a
- **[06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UU8yLdf5meY&t=399s)** — bun and eating with fries and stuff. That's really bad. If you eat your bacon on a salad
- **[06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UU8yLdf5meY&t=404s)** — or with other things, at the same time, you can add some antioxidants to counter the effect
- **[06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UU8yLdf5meY&t=409s)** — these nitrates that I talked about. What about microwaving bacon? I am very much against that.
- **[06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UU8yLdf5meY&t=415s)** — It produces this nasty chemical reaction. In fact, I'm leery about cooking any meats
- **[06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UU8yLdf5meY&t=419s)** — in a microwave. So in summary, definitely upgrade your bacon towards a more pasture-raised
- **[07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UU8yLdf5meY&t=426s)** — pork. And that way you can actually have a nutrient-dense food. Now that you know the
- **[07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UU8yLdf5meY&t=431s)** — truth about bacon, we now need to talk about eggs. Sense of the perfect combination and all
- **[07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UU8yLdf5meY&t=436s)** — the reasons why you need to be consuming more eggs on a regular basis. Out of all the important
- **[07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UU8yLdf5meY&t=442s)** — videos that I've done about food, this one is at the top of the list and you're going to
- **[07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UU8yLdf5meY&t=446s)** — find out why. Watch it right now.

- **[00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e7M2oSGwfyU&t=0s)** — So I have a question. Why are there no overweight people in Colorado?
- **[00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e7M2oSGwfyU&t=3s)** — This video is going to solve that mystery. And this is based on a very interesting book that...
- **[00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e7M2oSGwfyU&t=8s)** — presently it's not released yet, but I got an advanced copy. By the time you're watching this,
- **[00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e7M2oSGwfyU&t=13s)** — it's probably being released right now, so I will put a link down below. But today we're
- **[00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e7M2oSGwfyU&t=16s)** — going to dissect this mystery of why there's no fat people in Colorado. So is it that they're
- **[00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e7M2oSGwfyU&t=20s)** — out exercising all day long? Could it be the food they're eating? Or maybe they have more
- **[00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e7M2oSGwfyU&t=25s)** — for health foods? And so this question puzzled the author for quite some time. And so the first
- **[00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e7M2oSGwfyU&t=32s)** — thing he did is he looked at the states where you had the most obesity. And he isolated those.
- **[00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e7M2oSGwfyU&t=37s)** — And he found an interesting correlation between higher concentrations of Black Americans,
- **[00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e7M2oSGwfyU&t=41s)** — Latinos, and he also looked at the American Indian reservations. And that's all interesting,
- **[00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e7M2oSGwfyU&t=46s)** — but it gets even more interesting when you look at what is unique about that. And there's
- **[00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e7M2oSGwfyU&t=51s)** — one thing that's unique, and that has to do with the pigment on someone's skin. It's called
- **[00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e7M2oSGwfyU&t=56s)** — melanin. And melanin happens to be a natural sunblocker. In other words, the darker your skin,
- **[01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e7M2oSGwfyU&t=65s)** — the more protection you have against UV radiation. Now, what does UV radiation have to do with
- **[01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e7M2oSGwfyU&t=73s)** — Well, UV radiation interacts with your skin, and it makes vitamin D. And it is true that if you
- **[01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e7M2oSGwfyU&t=81s)** — look at the levels of vitamin D, vitamin D levels are low in certain populations. And
- **[01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e7M2oSGwfyU&t=86s)** — so that's very interesting. But is there any other data that aligns with this connection
- **[01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e7M2oSGwfyU&t=91s)** — between vitamin D deficiency and obesity? There's a direct relationship. In fact,
- **[01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e7M2oSGwfyU&t=98s)** — I'm going to put the paper down below. I don't know if this was a recent discovery,
- **[01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e7M2oSGwfyU&t=103s)** — or it's been out for a long time and no one really saw it. But vitamin D directly regulates
- **[01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e7M2oSGwfyU&t=111s)** — the oxidation of the fat burning process in your adipose tissue. And so vitamin D increases
- **[01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e7M2oSGwfyU&t=118s)** — the expression of the release of fat from your fat cells. Vitamin D is also intimately involved
- **[02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e7M2oSGwfyU&t=127s)** — in insulin. In other words, a vitamin D deficiency can be something that causes
- **[02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e7M2oSGwfyU&t=134s)** — insulin resistance. And if you have enough vitamin D, it can greatly help you in your
- **[02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e7M2oSGwfyU&t=140s)** — sensitivity with insulin, because insulin has a main function of fat storage. And this also
- **[02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e7M2oSGwfyU&t=146s)** — kind of correlates to in the winter months, right? When we don't get enough sun, we don't
- **[02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e7M2oSGwfyU&t=151s)** — get enough vitamin D, we have more fat storage. And then in the spring and the summer,
- **[02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e7M2oSGwfyU&t=155s)** — people tend to lose more weight, they come out of hibernation, right? Could that be related to
- **[02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e7M2oSGwfyU&t=160s)** — vitamin D? Well, I think so. Women that are pregnant, that are low in vitamin D, these
- **[02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e7M2oSGwfyU&t=165s)** — children later on in life, when they become adults, tend to be more overweight and on
- **[02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e7M2oSGwfyU&t=172s)** — the obese side. And then being overweight in general tends to dilute vitamin D. In other
- **[02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e7M2oSGwfyU&t=178s)** — words, the more weight that you gain, the more vitamin D you're going to need because
- **[03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e7M2oSGwfyU&t=182s)** — a lot of this vitamin D is absorbed in the fat cells. And so there's a very strong link between
- **[03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e7M2oSGwfyU&t=188s)** — vitamin D and your fat cell that I didn't even realize until reading this book. I mean,
- **[03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e7M2oSGwfyU&t=192s)** — even look at the risk factor for metabolic syndrome. Okay, there's always a vitamin D
- **[03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e7M2oSGwfyU&t=197s)** — deficiency. What is metabolic syndrome? It's a combination of high glucose, then you have
- **[03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e7M2oSGwfyU&t=201s)** — high cholesterol, you have high blood pressure, you have abdominal fat. Every single one of those
- **[03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e7M2oSGwfyU&t=208s)** — including insulin resistance relates to low vitamin D levels. And this also could explain
- **[03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e7M2oSGwfyU&t=213s)** — that when someone has high blood pressure and they take vitamin D, their blood pressure
- **[03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e7M2oSGwfyU&t=217s)** — tends to go lower. All right, getting back to the geography of the United States. If you
- **[03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e7M2oSGwfyU&t=223s)** — take a look at the states that have more elderly people, they are more overweight. And
- **[03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e7M2oSGwfyU&t=229s)** — we do know that the age of your skin has a lot to do with the absorption of vitamin D as
- **[03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e7M2oSGwfyU&t=233s)** — well. And so that's another little piece of the puzzle that aligns to this idea. If you look at
- **[03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e7M2oSGwfyU&t=239s)** — the trends of obesity, there's also this big spike of obesity in the United States that goes
- **[04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e7M2oSGwfyU&t=244s)** — up roughly around 1980. And the author points out another interesting observation
- **[04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e7M2oSGwfyU&t=251s)** — in the early 80s. This is when the experts or science started to tell people
- **[04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e7M2oSGwfyU&t=258s)** — to stay out of the sun. To start using sunblock. Both of these actions will block your vitamin D.
- **[04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e7M2oSGwfyU&t=267s)** — I was born in 1965. Through the 70s, I was a kid and I did not observe a lot of overweight
- **[04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e7M2oSGwfyU&t=272s)** — people in my school growing up. And we were outside all day long. We were not afraid of
- **[04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e7M2oSGwfyU&t=278s)** — the sun, yet we were consuming a massive amount of sugar and carbohydrates. But I do know like
- **[04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e7M2oSGwfyU&t=285s)** — the 80s and the 90s, you started seeing more and more people that were overweight. Could it be
- **[04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e7M2oSGwfyU&t=291s)** — this vitamin D connection? Well, it just so happens that Colorado has the highest elevation
- **[04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e7M2oSGwfyU&t=296s)** — of any state in the United States. So this means you're going to get a lot more ultraviolet
- **[05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e7M2oSGwfyU&t=303s)** — radiation and you're going to get a lot more vitamin D. You're going to get way more exposure
- **[05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e7M2oSGwfyU&t=308s)** — like three to five times more if you're higher up closer to the sun than if even if you're
- **[05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e7M2oSGwfyU&t=315s)** — on the beach at sea level. And so if you're born in Colorado and you're living in Colorado
- **[05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e7M2oSGwfyU&t=320s)** — and you have this chronic exposure to more sun and more vitamin D, it's going to greatly
- **[05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e7M2oSGwfyU&t=326s)** — affect your expression of how you burn fat. And I think the key word is chronic exposure,
- **[05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e7M2oSGwfyU&t=331s)** — right? It's how long someone's exposed to the sun or getting vitamin D and in relationship
- **[05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e7M2oSGwfyU&t=338s)** — to what happens to the metabolism. I mean, just as another side note, I had a patient in
- **[05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e7M2oSGwfyU&t=345s)** — who had this huge belly and every time he went down to Florida and got a lot of sun,
- **[05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e7M2oSGwfyU&t=351s)** — he came back. I swear it was like he was flat and he didn't change his diet, by the way,
- **[05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e7M2oSGwfyU&t=357s)** — and he came back and I'm like, wow, that's amazing. But you also have the latitude that
- **[06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e7M2oSGwfyU&t=362s)** — the further you're away from the equator, the less UV you're going to get as well.
- **[06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e7M2oSGwfyU&t=367s)** — Now, what about in the Appalachian mountains? You have white people who don't have a lot
- **[06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e7M2oSGwfyU&t=373s)** — of melanin, but they're obese. They have a much higher rate of obesity and they're in the
- **[06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e7M2oSGwfyU&t=379s)** — mountains. Now, what's interesting about these people living in the Appalachian mountains is
- **[06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e7M2oSGwfyU&t=383s)** — they're not necessarily living on the peak. They're living in the valleys. It's definitely
- **[06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e7M2oSGwfyU&t=387s)** — not as high. And there's a lot of shadowing of these mountains. So they're living in the
- **[06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e7M2oSGwfyU&t=392s)** — shadows, the mountains, which would not give them more vitamin D. Like even vitamin D and
- **[06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e7M2oSGwfyU&t=398s)** — how it affects your sleep cycles. If you're deficient in vitamin D, you don't get enough
- **[06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e7M2oSGwfyU&t=402s)** — your sleep cycles are not going to be as great. In fact, if you have jet lag, for example,
- **[06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e7M2oSGwfyU&t=407s)** — and you take vitamin D, it's one of the best remedies. It'll just kind of reset that
- **[06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e7M2oSGwfyU&t=412s)** — circadian rhythm. And then you have sleep apnea, which is usually always a vitamin D
- **[07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e7M2oSGwfyU&t=420s)** — deficiency. When you get people with sleep apnea, vitamin D, they tend to not snore as
- **[07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e7M2oSGwfyU&t=424s)** — much. They tend to sleep better. And then you have this connection between vitamin D and
- **[07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e7M2oSGwfyU&t=430s)** — cortisol. Cortisol, stress in general, lowers vitamin D. But when you take vitamin D, you
- **[07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e7M2oSGwfyU&t=436s)** — can also help lower cortisol, which is a stress hormone, which can also make you gain weight.
- **[07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e7M2oSGwfyU&t=442s)** — And this cortisol stress hormone can also create insulin resistance. And so if someone
- **[07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e7M2oSGwfyU&t=447s)** — is vitamin D deficient and they get more inflammation, inflammation can directly cause
- **[07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e7M2oSGwfyU&t=453s)** — insulin resistance as well, which is behind obesity. And then when you dive into the
- **[07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e7M2oSGwfyU&t=459s)** — data of how vitamin D affects your mitochondria, if you don't have enough vitamin D, you get a lot
- **[07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e7M2oSGwfyU&t=463s)** — of oxidative stress. The mitochondria doesn't work as well. And the mitochondria is the
- **[07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e7M2oSGwfyU&t=468s)** — energy factory that is behind your metabolism. So this is just one of many of the mysteries
- **[07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e7M2oSGwfyU&t=475s)** — that this author talks about. So I'm going to put the link down below for the book if you

- **[00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hx5vxhx6fsU&t=0s)** — So why are people talking about this? The root cause of autoimmune diseases. I'm not sure if you
- **[00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hx5vxhx6fsU&t=5s)** — know this or not, but autoimmune diseases are surpassing heart disease and cancer. It is
- **[00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hx5vxhx6fsU&t=11s)** — rapidly becoming the number one health problem on planet earth. Check out this chart. Look at the
- **[00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hx5vxhx6fsU&t=17s)** — trends of MS, type 1 diabetes, celiac, thyroid diseases. I'm talking about Hashimoto's, Crohn's.
- **[00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hx5vxhx6fsU&t=24s)** — Now there's a lot of other diseases now that are just exploding, but autoimmune diseases are
- **[00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hx5vxhx6fsU&t=29s)** — straight up and vertical. Yet very few people are talking about something so obvious. Hopefully this
- **[00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hx5vxhx6fsU&t=37s)** — video will inspire certain doctors to start to look into this solution. Your immune system has
- **[00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hx5vxhx6fsU&t=42s)** — an extremely important job of differentiating self from non-self. I'm talking about your own
- **[00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hx5vxhx6fsU&t=49s)** — cells from other things that are not your cells like pathogens, like viruses, bacteria,
- **[00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hx5vxhx6fsU&t=55s)** — things like that. Before I dive right into this, I want to give you just a real quick
- **[00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hx5vxhx6fsU&t=58s)** — foundation. You have two parts of the immune system. You have the part that you were born
- **[01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hx5vxhx6fsU&t=63s)** — with that your mother gave you, and that's called the innate immune system. And then you
- **[01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hx5vxhx6fsU&t=67s)** — also have the acquired immune system. The acquired immune system is created through a series
- **[01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hx5vxhx6fsU&t=74s)** — of infections. So you get infected, you get a bacterial, a virus infection, and then your
- **[01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hx5vxhx6fsU&t=81s)** — immune system reacts and learns from that. So the next time that you get exposed to that
- **[01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hx5vxhx6fsU&t=86s)** — you now have protection. The innate system doesn't have a memory. It's just there waiting to
- **[01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hx5vxhx6fsU&t=92s)** — protect and it's going to instantly react to any type of pathogen. Whereas the acquired immune
- **[01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hx5vxhx6fsU&t=98s)** — system could take hours or even days before it kicks in. So it's slow and adapting. But over
- **[01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hx5vxhx6fsU&t=105s)** — time that acquired immune system learns and becomes stronger, whereas the innate system doesn't.
- **[01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hx5vxhx6fsU&t=111s)** — It actually gets weaker as you get older. And the last point I want to make is that your
- **[01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hx5vxhx6fsU&t=116s)** — innate immune system is not the problem involved with autoimmune diseases. It's the acquired
- **[02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hx5vxhx6fsU&t=122s)** — immune system. What common thread runs through all autoimmune diseases as it relates to the
- **[02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hx5vxhx6fsU&t=129s)** — immune system? One big thing is the regulatory T cells. They call them the T reg
- **[02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hx5vxhx6fsU&t=135s)** — cells. These T reg cells have a very important job in preventing autoimmune diseases.
- **[02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hx5vxhx6fsU&t=141s)** — There's another name for them as well and that's called the suppressor T cells. They're the
- **[02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hx5vxhx6fsU&t=146s)** — peacemakers of your immune system. Another function of these T reg cells is to stop the immune
- **[02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hx5vxhx6fsU&t=152s)** — reaction after the immune system has done its job. But they're there to keep everything in
- **[02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hx5vxhx6fsU&t=156s)** — check. There's certain drugs that they use but prednisone is a common drug that's used with
- **[02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hx5vxhx6fsU&t=162s)** — autoimmune diseases. Now prednisone is a synthetic version of cortisol. That's the stress
- **[02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hx5vxhx6fsU&t=168s)** — So what I want to do is I want to just take a look at prednisone as a treatment for autoimmune
- **[02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hx5vxhx6fsU&t=174s)** — diseases and what it actually is doing and then compare that to something else that has the
- **[03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hx5vxhx6fsU&t=180s)** — largest ability to regulate the immune system of anything and that is vitamin D. So vitamin D
- **[03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hx5vxhx6fsU&t=187s)** — empowers, enhances the immune system depending on what's happening. Both prednisone and vitamin D
- **[03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hx5vxhx6fsU&t=193s)** — have anti-inflammatory effects. A little different mechanism but they both reduce
- **[03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hx5vxhx6fsU&t=198s)** — inflammation. But prednisone suppresses both parts of the immune system, the innate and the
- **[03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hx5vxhx6fsU&t=204s)** — acquired. So if you're having a reaction on your skin like a rash or some inflammation,
- **[03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hx5vxhx6fsU&t=208s)** — it's going to go away. In fact, I used to have prednisone every year for probably 10
- **[03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hx5vxhx6fsU&t=213s)** — years in my 20s because of the darn poison ivy I was exposed to. Now vitamin D shifts
- **[03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hx5vxhx6fsU&t=218s)** — the immune system to increase the T cells. Let's just pause for a second. How important is that
- **[03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hx5vxhx6fsU&t=225s)** — information? It's huge because in autoimmune diseases we have a lowering of the T reg
- **[03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hx5vxhx6fsU&t=231s)** — cells and we have this out of control inflammatory situation. But this is very,
- **[03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hx5vxhx6fsU&t=235s)** — very important information. There are two other immune things that are usually too high
- **[04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hx5vxhx6fsU&t=240s)** — when someone has this autoimmune disease. TH1 and TH17. Those two immune factors are high
- **[04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hx5vxhx6fsU&t=247s)** — autoimmune and the T reg cell is low. Vitamin D suppresses both of those cells that create
- **[04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hx5vxhx6fsU&t=253s)** — that inflammation. Now prednisone and vitamin D have some similar things, but they have a
- **[04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hx5vxhx6fsU&t=259s)** — few things that are different as well. Let's first take blood glucose. Prednisone will mobilize
- **[04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hx5vxhx6fsU&t=265s)** — and break down your protein and turn that into glucose. So it raises blood glucose.
- **[04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hx5vxhx6fsU&t=271s)** — It increases your risk for getting diabetes, but vitamin D does not. Vitamin D enhances the
- **[04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hx5vxhx6fsU&t=276s)** — glucose level of your blood. It's a cell that makes insulin and it helps to regulate your blood
- **[04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hx5vxhx6fsU&t=279s)** — sugars. Prednisone causes a breakdown of your bone. It can cause osteoporosis,
- **[04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hx5vxhx6fsU&t=286s)** — whereas vitamin D helps you absorb calcium and supports bone mineralization. Now as we age,
- **[04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hx5vxhx6fsU&t=293s)** — our immune system goes down, especially because our thymus gland, which is the
- **[04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hx5vxhx6fsU&t=297s)** — master gland right on top of our heart, shrivels up and it's virtually almost
- **[05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hx5vxhx6fsU&t=302s)** — non-existent as we get older. That is the gland that makes all those T cells. Vitamin D helps
- **[05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hx5vxhx6fsU&t=308s)** — to slow down this process, but not if you're using the normal small recommended dosage of
- **[05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hx5vxhx6fsU&t=316s)** — vitamin D that a lot of doctors recommend. You have to use higher doses or doses that
- **[05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hx5vxhx6fsU&t=319s)** — are therapeutic. Now I want to mention just one interesting book. I don't know if you
- **[05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hx5vxhx6fsU&t=324s)** — could see this right here, but this book says What Really Causes MS by Harold Foster.
- **[05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hx5vxhx6fsU&t=330s)** — There's a chapter on sunlight. And in that book, Harold Foster talks about a really
- **[05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hx5vxhx6fsU&t=336s)** — interesting strong association between someone developing MS and where they live on the planet.
- **[05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hx5vxhx6fsU&t=342s)** — The closer they are to the equator, where you get a lot of sun, the less MS you're going to
- **[05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hx5vxhx6fsU&t=348s)** — have. Now that data also correlates with other autoimmune diseases, which I'm not going
- **[05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hx5vxhx6fsU&t=352s)** — to get into in this video, but I'll put a link down below. I do want to also mention
- **[05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hx5vxhx6fsU&t=356s)** — Jeff Bowles' book right here, which is The Cure for and Prevention of All Diseases,
- **[06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hx5vxhx6fsU&t=361s)** — where he talks a lot about using high doses of vitamin D3. But what I like about this book is
- **[06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hx5vxhx6fsU&t=366s)** — he emphasizes the cofactors, okay? Because vitamin D doesn't work without these cofactors
- **[06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hx5vxhx6fsU&t=372s)** — like magnesium, vitamin K2. I interviewed one of the pioneers of vitamin D research,
- **[06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hx5vxhx6fsU&t=377s)** — Dr. Bruce Hollis. Dr. Hollis told me that if there's any positive studies on vitamin D,
- **[06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hx5vxhx6fsU&t=384s)** — it's very unlikely they're going to publish those. And I said, why is that? He said,
- **[06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hx5vxhx6fsU&t=388s)** — because there's no profit in a remedy that is free. The sun. You could, if you expose
- **[06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hx5vxhx6fsU&t=393s)** — yourself to the sun, get all the vitamin D that you need. There's a lot of competing drugs
- **[06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hx5vxhx6fsU&t=397s)** — that do not want that information out there. There are two systems of vitamin D. Vitamin D
- **[06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hx5vxhx6fsU&t=403s)** — affecting your bone and calcium, okay? But there's another system that doesn't involve
- **[06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hx5vxhx6fsU&t=409s)** — calcium. It doesn't involve your bone. It involves supporting your immune system. You see,
- **[06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hx5vxhx6fsU&t=414s)** — bone system can get by with a small amount of vitamin D once every two weeks, but the other
- **[07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hx5vxhx6fsU&t=421s)** — system needs higher amounts in daily amounts. But for cancer, you want to go way up from 10,000.
- **[07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hx5vxhx6fsU&t=426s)** — You want to probably do 50,000 I use every single day with the magnesium, with the K2,
- **[07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hx5vxhx6fsU&t=431s)** — with the zinc. Now at this point, I want to make a disclaimer. I am not telling you that
- **[07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hx5vxhx6fsU&t=435s)** — this is going to cure your cancer. I am just giving you some additional information, especially
- **[07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hx5vxhx6fsU&t=438s)** — since the World Health Organization even acknowledges that vitamin D has anti-carcinogenic
- **[07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hx5vxhx6fsU&t=444s)** — properties. Now I want to talk about some more research by a doctor out of Brazil
- **[07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hx5vxhx6fsU&t=448s)** — called Dr. Coimbra. They call it the Coimbra Protocol. What this protocol is about is to
- **[07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hx5vxhx6fsU&t=454s)** — increase the vitamin D to penetrate the resistance. They start increasing the vitamin D
- **[07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hx5vxhx6fsU&t=459s)** — as you're taking this test to the point where the parathyroid hormone goes to like a low
- **[07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hx5vxhx6fsU&t=465s)** — normal. That means that this vitamin D is penetrating and it's working. So that's just
- **[07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hx5vxhx6fsU&t=470s)** — things they do in this protocol. To me, it's so obvious what the problem is and what the
- **[07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hx5vxhx6fsU&t=474s)** — solution is. And then there's another interesting tactic, which I think was created by Big Pharma,
- **[08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hx5vxhx6fsU&t=480s)** — and that was that vitamin D in high amounts is toxic. Well, there's a difference between
- **[08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hx5vxhx6fsU&t=486s)** — therapeutic dosages and toxicity. And for that information, you should watch this video right here.

- **[00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tqwvm5RsHRM&t=0s)** — There are six main signs that you have low testosterone. Men today have over 50%
- **[00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tqwvm5RsHRM&t=6s)** — less testosterone than they had several decades ago. And the question is why? What the heck is
- **[00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tqwvm5RsHRM&t=13s)** — going on? It's not even just low testosterone. It's low sperm count. It's low fertility. We're
- **[00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tqwvm5RsHRM&t=18s)** — going to get into the causes of this and causes that you probably have never heard before.
- **[00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tqwvm5RsHRM&t=23s)** — Then I'm going to get into the solutions. Let's first start with all the different signs.
- **[00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tqwvm5RsHRM&t=27s)** — Number one is breast tissue. Man boobs. What the heck is going on with extra breast tissue in men?
- **[00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tqwvm5RsHRM&t=34s)** — Well, it's an increase in estrogen as you are decreasing your testosterone. It's basically a
- **[00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tqwvm5RsHRM&t=40s)** — feminization of a man because the ratios of estrogen are just way too much. Number two,
- **[00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tqwvm5RsHRM&t=46s)** — shrinking testicles. I know the name for this is hypogonadism. The testicles are getting
- **[00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tqwvm5RsHRM&t=51s)** — smaller and smaller and of course the testosterone is also getting lower. Shrinking muscles as
- **[00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tqwvm5RsHRM&t=56s)** — testosterone is intimately involved with making muscle. And if you don't have enough,
- **[01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tqwvm5RsHRM&t=60s)** — it's going to be very difficult to develop muscle. Number three, reduced semen production. Now,
- **[01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tqwvm5RsHRM&t=66s)** — semen is not sperm. Semen is an extra fluid that helps to deliver sperm. Number four, decreased
- **[01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tqwvm5RsHRM&t=73s)** — body hair. Specifically the beard, the chest, the legs, and even on top of your head. The
- **[01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tqwvm5RsHRM&t=87s)** — is getting hot flashes or night sweats. When I was in practice, I would have men come in
- **[01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tqwvm5RsHRM&t=92s)** — with that symptom. And one time I even had a doctor who specializes in menopause come in
- **[01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tqwvm5RsHRM&t=100s)** — with his main symptom being hot flashes. And he didn't want to take the medication that
- **[01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tqwvm5RsHRM&t=105s)** — he gives women, which is hormone replacement therapy. Unfortunately, a lot of men go for
- **[01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tqwvm5RsHRM&t=109s)** — Viagra. The problem is there's some slight minor complications, side effects like heart
- **[01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tqwvm5RsHRM&t=115s)** — attacks, and even a side effect of prolonged erection. Number six is excess belly fat
- **[02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tqwvm5RsHRM&t=122s)** — because you have insulin resistance. Testosterone does have an influence over insulin. It worsens
- **[02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tqwvm5RsHRM&t=129s)** — insulin resistance, which means your body has to compensate by increasing more insulin,
- **[02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tqwvm5RsHRM&t=134s)** — the fat making hormone. And so now you're storing more fat than you should. And this
- **[02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tqwvm5RsHRM&t=139s)** — ends up as excess belly fat. This is probably why a lot of young males, when they're 18 or 19
- **[02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tqwvm5RsHRM&t=144s)** — or 20, do not have belly fat because they're at their peak hormonally with testosterone
- **[02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tqwvm5RsHRM&t=150s)** — and other hormones that are related to keeping your stomach flat. Okay, so those are all the
- **[02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tqwvm5RsHRM&t=155s)** — signs of low testosterone. Now let's get into some interesting causes. And I think a lot of
- **[02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tqwvm5RsHRM&t=160s)** — people know those causes and they probably also know that junk food and too much sugar
- **[02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tqwvm5RsHRM&t=164s)** — will lower estrogen. And they probably also know that carbohydrates and sugar also decrease
- **[02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tqwvm5RsHRM&t=168s)** — testosterone. So I'm not going to cover those. I want to cover some other things that
- **[02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tqwvm5RsHRM&t=172s)** — need to put on your radar so you really understand. The real big cause of lowered
- **[02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tqwvm5RsHRM&t=177s)** — testosterone presently is endocrine disruptors. What's an endocrine disruptor? Anything in the
- **[03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tqwvm5RsHRM&t=184s)** — environment, chemical-wise, that can mimic estrogen. Pesticides, insecticides, herbicides,
- **[03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tqwvm5RsHRM&t=191s)** — fungicides. You also have plastics. Microplastics accumulate in your body. One of
- **[03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tqwvm5RsHRM&t=196s)** — the biggest primary sources of plastic that we're getting right now is in our water supply.
- **[03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tqwvm5RsHRM&t=200s)** — I don't know if you've heard about Forever Chemicals, but they accumulate in your body
- **[03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tqwvm5RsHRM&t=204s)** — and they just don't break down. It takes like a thousand years for these chemicals to break down
- **[03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tqwvm5RsHRM&t=208s)** — and you can test these in your water supply. And if you actually have city water,
- **[03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tqwvm5RsHRM&t=212s)** — you have them in your water. Another big cause of lowered testosterone, a lack of sleep.
- **[03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tqwvm5RsHRM&t=219s)** — If you're getting under seven hours of sleep, I'll guarantee your testosterone is probably
- **[03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tqwvm5RsHRM&t=224s)** — Because when you don't sleep enough, your cortisol goes up. And cortisol, which is a
- **[03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tqwvm5RsHRM&t=231s)** — stress hormone, just kills testosterone. The next point I want to bring up is just stress
- **[03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tqwvm5RsHRM&t=236s)** — in general. If you're under chronic stress, you're going to have low testosterone. Another
- **[04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tqwvm5RsHRM&t=240s)** — hidden source of decreased testosterone is wi-fi and electromagnetic fields from things
- **[04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tqwvm5RsHRM&t=248s)** — like this, especially if you're putting these in your pocket. Keep this away from your body,
- **[04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tqwvm5RsHRM&t=253s)** — put it on speaker phone, but don't keep it close anywhere in your pockets or even next touching your
- **[04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tqwvm5RsHRM&t=259s)** — head. Next cause is phytoestrogens. Soy products, soy milk, soy protein isolates, which is
- **[04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tqwvm5RsHRM&t=267s)** — probably one of the most common protein in protein powders as well as those protein bars.
- **[04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tqwvm5RsHRM&t=274s)** — That would be also in the vegetarian meats. In practice, I met a guy who was consuming
- **[04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tqwvm5RsHRM&t=278s)** — about a gallon of soy milk a day. He started developing breast tissue and get this with
- **[04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tqwvm5RsHRM&t=285s)** — lactation. I am not kidding. The next cause of low T is low zinc. Zinc is so important for
- **[04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tqwvm5RsHRM&t=293s)** — testosterone. In order for you to make this steroid hormone testosterone, it's dependent on
- **[04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tqwvm5RsHRM&t=298s)** — zinc for the conversion. And what is it converting? It's converting cholesterol
- **[05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tqwvm5RsHRM&t=304s)** — to testosterone with the help of zinc. Cholesterol is also needed as the raw material.
- **[05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tqwvm5RsHRM&t=309s)** — So if you're on a cholesterol blocking drug, aka statins, that could be the reason why you
- **[05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tqwvm5RsHRM&t=316s)** — have low testosterone. And then we get to the last cause of low T, too much iron. What's
- **[05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tqwvm5RsHRM&t=321s)** — interesting about iron is that our body has no mechanism of getting rid of iron. And so
- **[05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tqwvm5RsHRM&t=325s)** — what happens is this iron accumulates in your organs and it starts to rust out the
- **[05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tqwvm5RsHRM&t=330s)** — If you're anemic, you don't have low iron. You have dysfunctional iron. Not only do you
- **[05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tqwvm5RsHRM&t=336s)** — not have enough iron to feed the red blood cells, and that's why you're tired, but you also have
- **[05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tqwvm5RsHRM&t=341s)** — an excess of iron inside the cells because it's all locked up. Because you're deficient in
- **[05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tqwvm5RsHRM&t=348s)** — copper. Copper is involved in certain enzymes to help protect the cells from excess iron.
- **[05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tqwvm5RsHRM&t=355s)** — A deficiency of copper is really at the bottom of this problem with excess iron. Now I'm going
- **[06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tqwvm5RsHRM&t=360s)** — to get into the solutions. The last one is the most important one. Number one, zinc.
- **[06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tqwvm5RsHRM&t=367s)** — Number one most important trace mineral to increasing testosterone. Now the RDAs for zinc
- **[06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tqwvm5RsHRM&t=373s)** — are between 8 and 11 milligrams. That is just not enough. You're going to probably need up to
- **[06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tqwvm5RsHRM&t=378s)** — maybe 50 milligrams every single day. The problem is if you're going to be taking zinc by
- **[06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tqwvm5RsHRM&t=383s)** — itself without being in a base of trace minerals, you're going to end up over time creating a
- **[06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tqwvm5RsHRM&t=389s)** — copper deficiency. And then your iron is going to go up and that can affect your testosterone.
- **[06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tqwvm5RsHRM&t=394s)** — You can get a lot of zinc in red meat, oysters, liver, and shellfish. Next new treat that you
- **[06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tqwvm5RsHRM&t=399s)** — need is more magnesium. Magnesium is also another helper mineral to help you convert
- **[06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tqwvm5RsHRM&t=406s)** — cholesterol into the steroid testosterone. And a lot of people take the wrong magnesium. You
- **[06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tqwvm5RsHRM&t=412s)** — 400 milligrams per day, but probably a little bit more. Maybe 600 or even 800 milligrams per day.
- **[06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tqwvm5RsHRM&t=418s)** — And then we get vitamin D. Vitamin D directly helps you increase testosterone. The big point
- **[07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tqwvm5RsHRM&t=423s)** — about vitamin D is most people are taking way too little vitamin D. You're going to need as
- **[07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tqwvm5RsHRM&t=428s)** — a maintenance dosage at least 10,000 I use of vitamin D every single day to help you
- **[07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tqwvm5RsHRM&t=435s)** — increase testosterone and to help you fix insulin resistance, fix certain things in
- **[07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tqwvm5RsHRM&t=441s)** — your liver. Vitamin D is going to be very, very important. Next thing exercise is going to be
- **[07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tqwvm5RsHRM&t=446s)** — vitally important. You're going to find if you do heavy weight training or resistance
- **[07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tqwvm5RsHRM&t=450s)** — exercise training or even high intensity interval training parallel with enough rest,
- **[07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tqwvm5RsHRM&t=455s)** — you're going to find that's a potent stimulus of testosterone. Next thing get a water filter
- **[07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tqwvm5RsHRM&t=460s)** — that helps you filter out forever chemicals. There's three that I know about. I will put
- **[07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tqwvm5RsHRM&t=466s)** — links down below. Now the last most important solution and you're going to like this one
- **[07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tqwvm5RsHRM&t=472s)** — called Elruderi. Elruderi is a special microbe that's only in about 4% of the population.
- **[07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tqwvm5RsHRM&t=479s)** — 96% of the population doesn't have it anymore because of past antibiotics. This Elruderi can
- **[08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tqwvm5RsHRM&t=486s)** — be cultured and made into kind of like a yogurt type mixture which is in very, very
- **[08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tqwvm5RsHRM&t=496s)** — and you would consume this every single day. There's an interesting study on rats. They fed
- **[08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tqwvm5RsHRM&t=501s)** — these rats Elruderi in their water and the group that got Elruderi had significant increase
- **[08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tqwvm5RsHRM&t=508s)** — in the growth of their testicles even though they were older mice. They have not done this
- **[08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tqwvm5RsHRM&t=515s)** — study in humans but I've been talking to a lot of people that are taking this microbe
- **[08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tqwvm5RsHRM&t=519s)** — and they're noticing a great increase spike in testosterone because if you increase the size
- **[08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tqwvm5RsHRM&t=526s)** — of the testicle you will increase testosterone. But not only that it increases something called
- **[08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tqwvm5RsHRM&t=531s)** — oxytocin. Probably the most powerful hormone to counter cortisol. You're going to sleep a lot
- **[08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tqwvm5RsHRM&t=537s)** — better. You're going to have vivid dreams. More erections during the night which is an
- **[09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tqwvm5RsHRM&t=543s)** — indication of higher testosterone. And so it does all of this plus there's been reports that
- **[09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tqwvm5RsHRM&t=548s)** — increasing stem cells for muscle tissue especially as you age. And I think the next
- **[09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tqwvm5RsHRM&t=556s)** — most important video for you to watch is the one I did on iron. So I put that up right here.
- **[09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tqwvm5RsHRM&t=561s)** — Check it out.

- **[00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us6oOuI-S7Y&t=0s)** — So today we're going to talk about sea moss. You probably have heard about sea moss.
- **[00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us6oOuI-S7Y&t=4s)** — It's all over social media. What actually is it? Well, sea kelp and sea moss are types of seaweed,
- **[00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us6oOuI-S7Y&t=11s)** — which are basically plants that can grow underneath the water. And when you look at sea moss versus
- **[00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us6oOuI-S7Y&t=17s)** — sea kelp, they're fairly similar in what's in them as far as overall nutrition content. People
- **[00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us6oOuI-S7Y&t=23s)** — are using sea moss on their skin to take it internally to help their digestive system,
- **[00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us6oOuI-S7Y&t=30s)** — to help their inflammation. And people are getting all sorts of benefits from this,
- **[00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us6oOuI-S7Y&t=34s)** — from increasing their testosterone, increasing their overall health. Let me first state that
- **[00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us6oOuI-S7Y&t=40s)** — sea moss has a number of things that people talk about. It has amino acids. That's a type
- **[00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us6oOuI-S7Y&t=45s)** — of protein. It has fiber. It has vitamins. It has minerals, fatty acids, phytonutrients.
- **[00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us6oOuI-S7Y&t=54s)** — And the list goes on and on and on and on. Now, of course, if you look at the protein,
- **[00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us6oOuI-S7Y&t=58s)** — the amino acids, it doesn't compare to a steak or animal protein. What does stand out
- **[01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us6oOuI-S7Y&t=64s)** — with sea moss and other types of sea kelp is the minerals, especially the trace minerals.
- **[01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us6oOuI-S7Y&t=72s)** — Trace minerals are those minerals that are needed in very, very small amounts but are very,
- **[01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us6oOuI-S7Y&t=77s)** — very necessary. And you're not going to find a lot of these trace minerals in foods unless
- **[01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us6oOuI-S7Y&t=82s)** — you're close to the ocean. Now, what is the purpose of trace minerals anyway? Well,
- **[01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us6oOuI-S7Y&t=88s)** — one of the purposes for human health for trace minerals is that they help to activate
- **[01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us6oOuI-S7Y&t=92s)** — enzymes and certain other proteins that do the work of the body. For example, there is an enzyme
- **[01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us6oOuI-S7Y&t=100s)** — that helps you convert from T4, the inactive version of the thyroid hormone, to T3,
- **[01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us6oOuI-S7Y&t=108s)** — the active form of the thyroid hormone. And that enzyme is dependent on selenium. Well,
- **[01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us6oOuI-S7Y&t=114s)** — guess what? Where are you going to get selenium? You can get it in Brazil nuts,
- **[01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us6oOuI-S7Y&t=118s)** — but it's not necessarily in other nuts of any significant amount. And what do we have to
- **[02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us6oOuI-S7Y&t=130s)** — get this selenium? Selenium not only helps you with the thyroid, selenium is necessary
- **[02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us6oOuI-S7Y&t=137s)** — for certain proteins to help you detoxify mercury. Selenium is necessary for your
- **[02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us6oOuI-S7Y&t=144s)** — immune system. Okay, like if you don't have enough selenium, you cannot create the T helper
- **[02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us6oOuI-S7Y&t=150s)** — cells. T helper cells are like the general of the army for your immune system. They help
- **[02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us6oOuI-S7Y&t=156s)** — control and coordinate all the other immune cells in the attack against viruses and cancer
- **[02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us6oOuI-S7Y&t=166s)** — and any other type of pathogenic invasion. And so the problem is it's hard to get these trace
- **[02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us6oOuI-S7Y&t=171s)** — minerals, especially selenium from food unless you eat something from the sea. Iodine is also
- **[02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us6oOuI-S7Y&t=178s)** — necessary for the thyroid. And so without iodine, you can't make the thyroid hormones.
- **[03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us6oOuI-S7Y&t=183s)** — But iodine is also really, really important to help regulate estrogen. And this is why when
- **[03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us6oOuI-S7Y&t=190s)** — women are deficient in iodine, they might get breast cancer or ovarian cysts. Japanese women
- **[03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us6oOuI-S7Y&t=197s)** — are much less at risk of getting breast cancer. And I really think it's because the Japanese
- **[03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us6oOuI-S7Y&t=203s)** — as a culture consumes 25 times more iodine than the U.S. So I really think a lot of
- **[03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us6oOuI-S7Y&t=211s)** — benefits from sea moss are coming because finally the person is being satisfied with
- **[03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us6oOuI-S7Y&t=216s)** — the trace minerals which they've been missing. Now it is true that sea moss has carrageenan.
- **[03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us6oOuI-S7Y&t=223s)** — And any seaweed that has red in it is going to have some carrageenan. There's a really big
- **[03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us6oOuI-S7Y&t=228s)** — difference in eating carrageenan that is naturally in sea moss versus carrageenan that
- **[03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us6oOuI-S7Y&t=235s)** — you eat.
- **[03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us6oOuI-S7Y&t=237s)** — So sea moss and even sea kelp is a great product not only to help get the trace minerals,
- **[04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us6oOuI-S7Y&t=244s)** — which I think is the number one benefit, but also some of these other phytonutrients that
- **[04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us6oOuI-S7Y&t=249s)** — create some health benefits that extend way beyond just your normal vitamins and minerals.
- **[04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us6oOuI-S7Y&t=255s)** — Now since we're on the topic of trace minerals, there's a lot more to be said about
- **[04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us6oOuI-S7Y&t=258s)** — that. If you haven't seen this video, check it out.

## Video 120: Why You Can't SLEEP! Simple Fix

- **[00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pf_z1OSYxmk&t=0s)** — I want to give you a really important recommendation to take at dinner time to help you get into the most wonderful deep restorative sleep.
- **[00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pf_z1OSYxmk&t=8s)** — Now, for years I've suffered with a sleep problem. It pretty much started after basic training when I was forced to wake up at four o'clock every morning for three months.
- **[00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pf_z1OSYxmk&t=17s)** — And after that somehow my body was trained. I could not sleep past four o'clock for many years, so I would just go to bed early.
- **[00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pf_z1OSYxmk&t=24s)** — But I was still only getting about six to six and a half hours of sleep for years. And I would always just cope by napping and try to get more sleep.
- **[00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pf_z1OSYxmk&t=34s)** — But it wasn't until I got eight hours of consistent day after day sleep that I discovered for myself how important this sleep is.
- **[00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pf_z1OSYxmk&t=44s)** — Now, if we dissect your sleep, we have several situations. We have people that can't get the sleep.
- **[00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pf_z1OSYxmk&t=49s)** — There's people that get up through the night and have to urinate very frequently. Sleep apnea, restless leg syndrome.
- **[00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pf_z1OSYxmk&t=55s)** — Every single one of those problems I just mentioned can be resolved by this one remedy. And that is vitamin D.
- **[01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pf_z1OSYxmk&t=64s)** — Usually you cannot fix your sleep by taking regular amounts of vitamin D.
- **[01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pf_z1OSYxmk&t=68s)** — In fact, if you look at some of the studies that don't show that vitamin D can help your sleep, they're just using very, very tiny amounts.
- **[01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pf_z1OSYxmk&t=75s)** — You know, people are concerned with the toxic effect of vitamin D, but there's a way to counter that very easily.
- **[01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pf_z1OSYxmk&t=82s)** — Also, vitamin D can fix a lot of problems in your gut, believe it or not. Not to mention all the different connections with vitamin D in your immune system.
- **[01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pf_z1OSYxmk&t=91s)** — Vitamin D also works with magnesium. Those two are kind of partners in their ability to work together.
- **[01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pf_z1OSYxmk&t=97s)** — And magnesium is behind all sorts of problems with cramping, heart palpitations, restless leg syndrome, high levels of cortisol, which prevent your sleep.
- **[01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pf_z1OSYxmk&t=108s)** — And a lot of people sleep better when they take magnesium before you go to sleep.
- **[01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pf_z1OSYxmk&t=112s)** — But if you have a restless leg syndrome or cramps and you're taking magnesium and it's not working, it could be because you need more vitamin D.
- **[02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pf_z1OSYxmk&t=120s)** — And then we get into the powerful effect that vitamin D has with inflammation. It's one of the most powerful anti-inflammatories.
- **[02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pf_z1OSYxmk&t=127s)** — And also when you sleep better, your blood sugar will be better. If we take a look at all the things that can improve your health, we have diet, exercise, sleep.
- **[02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pf_z1OSYxmk&t=138s)** — I think sleep is at the top of the list. You're basically the circadian rhythms of your body that's controlled by a little bundle of nerves deep in your brain in the hypothalamus.
- **[02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pf_z1OSYxmk&t=148s)** — There's receptors for vitamin D in that nerve bundle.
- **[02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pf_z1OSYxmk&t=152s)** — And this is why, for example, when you get jet lag and it throws off your rhythm, the antidote is vitamin D.
- **[02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pf_z1OSYxmk&t=160s)** — An obese person needs three times as much vitamin D as a thin person because vitamin D gets diluted. The same thing with the diabetic. The same thing as you age.
- **[02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pf_z1OSYxmk&t=171s)** — Now, if you get your vitamin D tested and you can even buy these little kits that measure your vitamin D, and I'll put a link down below of the company that I use.
- **[03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pf_z1OSYxmk&t=180s)** — I buy the kit, I measure my own vitamin D, and when you get the results, if it's below 40 nanograms per milliliter, you're going to have all sorts of issues.
- **[03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pf_z1OSYxmk&t=190s)** — You need levels that are like 70, 80, 90, or even 100, or even a little bit more to create a therapeutic benefit.
- **[03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pf_z1OSYxmk&t=199s)** — Vitamin D is not really a vitamin. It's a hormone.
- **[03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pf_z1OSYxmk&t=202s)** — And so if you're focused on taking vitamin D to get this hormone to work better, realize that the type of vitamin D that they test in your blood is the inactive version.
- **[03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pf_z1OSYxmk&t=213s)** — It doesn't really tell you conclusively if you're getting the vitamin D in the cells.
- **[03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pf_z1OSYxmk&t=220s)** — There's a lot of people who have vitamin D resistance who need to take a lot more vitamin D to penetrate that resistance.
- **[03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pf_z1OSYxmk&t=227s)** — I would recommend taking at least 30,000 IUs of vitamin D3 for a period of time to start to elevate the vitamin D that you need therapeutically to create an effect on your sleep.
- **[04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pf_z1OSYxmk&t=241s)** — I take 50,000 IUs every single day. But this is very important.
- **[04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pf_z1OSYxmk&t=246s)** — I drink at least two and a half liters of water every single day to prevent any type of side effect from this toxicity, which is the calcium issue, calcium in the blood.
- **[04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pf_z1OSYxmk&t=257s)** — That's really the only side effect. So if you just maybe cut down on the dairy and you drink more water and you take all the cofactors.
- **[04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pf_z1OSYxmk&t=264s)** — So I always take vitamin D with vitamin K2. Very important.
- **[04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pf_z1OSYxmk&t=270s)** — That prevents the calcium from building up in the blood. And then I also take magnesium.
- **[04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pf_z1OSYxmk&t=274s)** — I take zinc as a cofactor. I take vitamin B6 as a cofactor.
- **[04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pf_z1OSYxmk&t=281s)** — Now a couple additional things that I'm going to recommend. If you're trying to sleep, it's best to take that vitamin D with the cofactors at the last meal of the day.
- **[04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pf_z1OSYxmk&t=290s)** — You're going to get more absorption that way. Now, some people that take vitamin D before bed, it wakes them up.
- **[04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pf_z1OSYxmk&t=297s)** — And I really think it's because they're not taking the cofactors, magnesium, zinc, B6, K2.
- **[05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pf_z1OSYxmk&t=303s)** — I would make sure that the temperature of your room is slightly cooler. That seems to help me. I crack the window open.
- **[05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pf_z1OSYxmk&t=310s)** — I would also make sure that about two hours before you go to sleep, you're not exposed to like your cell phones and bright lights.
- **[05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pf_z1OSYxmk&t=317s)** — Start dimming down the room with the lights. Now, since this vitamin D toxicity idea comes up so often, you should probably get a little more information on that.
- **[05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pf_z1OSYxmk&t=328s)** — And I've created a video just for you. Check it out.

- **[00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYwWTn2MPYo&t=0s)** — So today we're going to talk about all the reasons why vitamins won't work.
- **[00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYwWTn2MPYo&t=3s)** — The first thing to talk about is why do we need vitamins?
- **[00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYwWTn2MPYo&t=6s)** — Can't we get all of our vitamins from food?
- **[00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYwWTn2MPYo&t=8s)** — Many times you're not going to be able to satisfy that just by eating certain foods,
- **[00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYwWTn2MPYo&t=12s)** — especially vitamin D, magnesium, zinc, and even vitamin B3, which is called niacin.
- **[00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYwWTn2MPYo&t=18s)** — And with all that chemistry going on, your body needs roughly about 180 nutrients
- **[00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYwWTn2MPYo&t=24s)** — to allow that biochemistry to work.
- **[00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYwWTn2MPYo&t=26s)** — And it's actually very difficult to determine if someone's deficient in a nutrient by just
- **[00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYwWTn2MPYo&t=31s)** — checking the blood because a lot of these nutrients are deep in yourselves.
- **[00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYwWTn2MPYo&t=36s)** — A big reason why vitamins might not work in your body is that you might not have
- **[00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYwWTn2MPYo&t=40s)** — enough acid in your stomach. You can't absorb certain things like minerals.
- **[00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYwWTn2MPYo&t=45s)** — You're going to have a hard time breaking down things with B12 because B12 is usually in meat
- **[00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYwWTn2MPYo&t=51s)** — and that's locked up with protein. And if there's not enough acid to break down the
- **[00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYwWTn2MPYo&t=55s)** — protein, you don't get absorption of B12. One big clue to know that you don't have
- **[01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYwWTn2MPYo&t=60s)** — enough stomach acid is if you have indigestion, heartburn, too much bacteria in your small
- **[01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYwWTn2MPYo&t=65s)** — intestine. The problem with synthetics is they don't get absorbed like natural ones.
- **[01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYwWTn2MPYo&t=70s)** — The next point I want to bring up is when you take a vitamin or a mineral as an isolated
- **[01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYwWTn2MPYo&t=75s)** — nutrient, this is very unnatural. It's going to create a problem because in nature,
- **[01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYwWTn2MPYo&t=80s)** — you never see an isolated nutrient. If you take too much vitamin D, especially in higher amounts,
- **[01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYwWTn2MPYo&t=86s)** — you'll end up with a magnesium deficiency. It's important to know that a lot of these
- **[01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYwWTn2MPYo&t=91s)** — nutrients come in more of a kind of a complex with other nutrients. The other topic I'm going
- **[01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYwWTn2MPYo&t=96s)** — to talk about is the form of nutrition. For example, folic acid. You don't want to take
- **[01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYwWTn2MPYo&t=101s)** — the synthetic version. Anytime you take vitamin B9, you want to take that in the active
- **[01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYwWTn2MPYo&t=106s)** — form. The folate. The same thing that goes with vitamin B12. You don't want to take the synthetic
- **[01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYwWTn2MPYo&t=112s)** — version called cyanocobalamin. Instead, you want to take methylcobalamin. Why? Because you want
- **[01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYwWTn2MPYo&t=119s)** — to get results. You want something to work better. The next point I want to bring up is
- **[02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYwWTn2MPYo&t=123s)** — thinking you're taking a vitamin like vitamin A, but it's not really... it's the precursor
- **[02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYwWTn2MPYo&t=128s)** — to vitamin A. Not retinol. When people say, just eat a lot of carrots or spinach,
- **[02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYwWTn2MPYo&t=133s)** — you couldn't eat the volume of that food to get this very important active version of vitamin A.
- **[02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYwWTn2MPYo&t=139s)** — Retinol. The way to get retinol is from egg yolks or cod liver oil. Not a supplement. The
- **[02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYwWTn2MPYo&t=145s)** — same thing that goes with omega-3 fatty acids. People have this idea that if you eat
- **[02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYwWTn2MPYo&t=149s)** — walnuts or flaxseed, you're getting your omega-3. It's not true because the active form
- **[02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYwWTn2MPYo&t=156s)** — of omega-3 is EPA in DHA. And you can get that from like fish oil, cod liver oil.
- **[02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYwWTn2MPYo&t=163s)** — Next point is a lot of vitamins have fillers with maltodextrin, which is a starch. And they
- **[02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYwWTn2MPYo&t=170s)** — use maltodextrin as a spray agent to turn things into a powder. The problem with
- **[02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYwWTn2MPYo&t=175s)** — maltodextrin is it can compete for certain nutrients like vitamin C. You also have the
- **[03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYwWTn2MPYo&t=186s)** — break down sugar and refined carbs. And so when you're taking maltodextrin or sugar or starch,
- **[03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYwWTn2MPYo&t=192s)** — the need for B1 goes way, way, way higher. Next point, trying to get results from a vitamin
- **[03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYwWTn2MPYo&t=199s)** — or a mineral while at the same time you're eating junk or your diet sucks. Don't think that
- **[03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYwWTn2MPYo&t=205s)** — vitamins are going to work to compensate for a bad diet. And that leads us to the next
- **[03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYwWTn2MPYo&t=209s)** — problem with nutrition. If you are a diabetic or pre-diabetic or have insulin resistance,
- **[03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYwWTn2MPYo&t=215s)** — your ability to absorb nutrients is going to be a lot less. You want to fix the insulin
- **[03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYwWTn2MPYo&t=220s)** — resistance first or the diabetes by going on a low carb diet. And as another side point to that,
- **[03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYwWTn2MPYo&t=226s)** — if you're a smoker, if you drink a lot of alcohol, that's going to kind of nullify the
- **[03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYwWTn2MPYo&t=231s)** — nutrient results. Unless you're giving up smoking or drinking, then it's very important
- **[03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYwWTn2MPYo&t=235s)** — to start taking nutrition. Realize that the absorption is going to be a lot less.
- **[03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYwWTn2MPYo&t=239s)** — The next point I want to bring up is when you read the label on the back of your
- **[04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYwWTn2MPYo&t=243s)** — and the first one says calcium carbonate, you're basically taking limestone. Anything that's listed
- **[04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYwWTn2MPYo&t=250s)** — as the first ingredient is usually the majority of what's in that bottle. That's why when you
- **[04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYwWTn2MPYo&t=256s)** — take these multivitamins and they're so heavy, it's like a paperweight. When you take
- **[04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYwWTn2MPYo&t=260s)** — calcium at the same time as you're taking magnesium, they can cancel each other out
- **[04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYwWTn2MPYo&t=266s)** — because they both compete for absorption. The next point I want to talk about is taking enough
- **[04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYwWTn2MPYo&t=271s)** — of certain nutrients. The one that I'm talking about mainly is vitamin D. The RDAs for vitamin
- **[04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYwWTn2MPYo&t=278s)** — D3 are like 600 IUs. It's ridiculous. They did not calculate the information correctly from
- **[04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYwWTn2MPYo&t=285s)** — 10 research studies when they came up with this 600 IUs. And I talked to a pioneer in vitamin D
- **[04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYwWTn2MPYo&t=293s)** — research and this person said that this wasn't an error. It was an intentional thing that
- **[04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYwWTn2MPYo&t=298s)** — did to make it sound possibly toxic. I mean think about it. 10,000 international units of
- **[05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYwWTn2MPYo&t=304s)** — vitamin D3 sounds very very scary when in fact it's only like being out in the sun for 20
- **[05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYwWTn2MPYo&t=310s)** — to 30 minutes. It was found that this so-called error with vitamin D3, I'm talking
- **[05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYwWTn2MPYo&t=316s)** — about 600 international units, should have been calculated at 8,895 international units.
- **[05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYwWTn2MPYo&t=326s)** — If you corrected the confusion that they had from all of these studies. If you're taking 600
- **[05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYwWTn2MPYo&t=332s)** — and you don't feel any difference, you know why. Now this especially relates to the next point
- **[05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYwWTn2MPYo&t=337s)** — I want to bring up. If you have a health problem, let's say for example you have some
- **[05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYwWTn2MPYo&t=342s)** — chronic illness or diabetes or whatever, small amounts of any vitamin are not going to create
- **[05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYwWTn2MPYo&t=348s)** — the change. You need therapeutic doses especially with vitamin D, magnesium and other
- **[05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYwWTn2MPYo&t=354s)** — Like for example if you had peripheral neuropathy, the bottom of your feet was numb, tingly because
- **[06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYwWTn2MPYo&t=361s)** — of your diabetic and those nerves are literally dying. If you took tiny amounts of vitamins,
- **[06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYwWTn2MPYo&t=366s)** — especially like vitamin B1, it's not going to create any difference. To fix peripheral neuropathy
- **[06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYwWTn2MPYo&t=371s)** — from a diabetic situation, you need a special type of B1 that is fat-siable. It's called
- **[06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYwWTn2MPYo&t=378s)** — botamine and in larger amounts to create an effect. Anytime you're trying to create a
- **[06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYwWTn2MPYo&t=384s)** — therapeutic effect, you're going to need larger amounts of the nutrient. And like I said before,
- **[06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYwWTn2MPYo&t=389s)** — it's going to be very difficult to get that from your diet. You're going to have to use
- **[06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYwWTn2MPYo&t=393s)** — supplements. And this also relates to potassium. If you're looking for a potassium
- **[06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYwWTn2MPYo&t=397s)** — supplement, if the milligram dosage was 99 milligrams, you'd have to take over 47 of those
- **[06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYwWTn2MPYo&t=405s)** — capsules to get just the daily dosage of your potassium. So again, if you're taking potassium
- **[06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYwWTn2MPYo&t=411s)** — and you're just taking one of those a day, don't expect any change. I hope I shed some light on
- **[06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYwWTn2MPYo&t=417s)** — why vitamins might not be working for you and gave you some knowledge on what to do
- **[07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYwWTn2MPYo&t=422s)** — to get your vitamins to work better. Now I have another similar related topic on mistakes
- **[07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYwWTn2MPYo&t=427s)** — people make with vitamins and you should check that one out. I put it up right here.

- **[00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rP7_UePVK3Q&t=0s)** — We are going to talk about the seven signs that your body is begging you for more vitamin D,
- **[00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rP7_UePVK3Q&t=5s)** — as well as why daily dosing of vitamin D is crucial.
- **[00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rP7_UePVK3Q&t=10s)** — Number one, if you have high blood pressure. One of the biggest causes of high blood pressure is
- **[00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rP7_UePVK3Q&t=15s)** — low vitamin D. Number two, lowered mood as in depression. Could be anxiety as well.
- **[00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rP7_UePVK3Q&t=22s)** — Number three, inflammation. Whether it's from autoimmune or arthritis or anything,
- **[00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rP7_UePVK3Q&t=27s)** — if you have inflammation, you probably need more vitamin D. Number four, your immune system is weak
- **[00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rP7_UePVK3Q&t=32s)** — and you are getting sick too frequently. Number five, if your sleep cycle is off. You wake up
- **[00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rP7_UePVK3Q&t=39s)** — and you're not refreshed or you have sleep apnea, vitamin D will help you get into that delta
- **[00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rP7_UePVK3Q&t=44s)** — wave deep sleep so you wake up feeling refreshed. Number six, almost every type of skin problem
- **[00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rP7_UePVK3Q&t=51s)** — is related to a vitamin D deficiency. And seven, lower back pain as well as muscle pain. If your
- **[00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rP7_UePVK3Q&t=58s)** — muscles are tight, sore and painful, take more vitamin D. It will get rid of that. Now let me
- **[01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rP7_UePVK3Q&t=63s)** — just share some wild information with you. When they test you and they're looking at
- **[01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rP7_UePVK3Q&t=69s)** — this inactive version, they're actually looking at mainly two types of vitamin D. They're
- **[01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rP7_UePVK3Q&t=82s)** — the free vitamin D. Over 99% of all this inactive vitamin D they test in your blood
- **[01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rP7_UePVK3Q&t=89s)** — is this type right here, bounded. And then you have a tiny bit that's free. The half-life for
- **[01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rP7_UePVK3Q&t=94s)** — this bound vitamin D is like two to three weeks. And the half-life for the free is 24 hours.
- **[01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rP7_UePVK3Q&t=101s)** — All right, so what does that all mean? It means that when they test you and you see a certain
- **[01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rP7_UePVK3Q&t=105s)** — amount, they're not differentiating between the bound vitamin D or the free vitamin D.
- **[01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rP7_UePVK3Q&t=114s)** — You can assume that you have enough vitamin D to support your skin, your muscles, your organs,
- **[01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rP7_UePVK3Q&t=119s)** — your immune system. But unless you're taking vitamin D or getting sun every 24 hours,
- **[02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rP7_UePVK3Q&t=127s)** — there's a likelihood that you're probably going to be somewhat deficient. Especially with all
- **[02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rP7_UePVK3Q&t=133s)** — the other barriers on top of this vitamin D situation, including obesity, insulin resistance,
- **[02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rP7_UePVK3Q&t=139s)** — diabetes, being inside and not getting exposure, not getting enough vitamin D from the food. The
- **[02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rP7_UePVK3Q&t=144s)** — more we age, the less we can convert vitamin D on our skin. And the recommendations for
- **[02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rP7_UePVK3Q&t=150s)** — vitamin D are a joke. You need higher amounts. So this is why I recommend daily vitamin D.
- **[02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rP7_UePVK3Q&t=156s)** — If your doctor says, oh my gosh, that's a toxic effect, just ask them, how much vitamin
- **[02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rP7_UePVK3Q&t=162s)** — D can I get from being out in the sun for about a half hour to 40 minutes? Because the answer is
- **[02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rP7_UePVK3Q&t=168s)** — 20,000 I use. So 10,000 is not an abnormal amount. Now the last and very important part
- **[02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rP7_UePVK3Q&t=177s)** — I want to mention about vitamin D. In order for vitamin D to go through those different
- **[03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rP7_UePVK3Q&t=180s)** — biochemical reactions, it needs help from certain nutrients like magnesium, like zinc,
- **[03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rP7_UePVK3Q&t=188s)** — like vitamin K2, like boron. And that way you can maximize your ability to have vitamin D work
- **[03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rP7_UePVK3Q&t=196s)** — without any type of deficiencies. And if you want more information on that and also how to
- **[03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rP7_UePVK3Q&t=201s)** — prevent any type of toxicity, you should watch this video right here.

- **[00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xUu0vqcP7fE&t=0s)** — You may never get high blood pressure after watching this video.
- **[00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xUu0vqcP7fE&t=3s)** — The most important thing to know about blood pressure is that it is a symptom.
- **[00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xUu0vqcP7fE&t=7s)** — It's not a root cause.
- **[00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xUu0vqcP7fE&t=8s)** — And in this video, we're going to talk about the root causes
- **[00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xUu0vqcP7fE&t=10s)** — because the problem with hypertension is that 95% of it is classified
- **[00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xUu0vqcP7fE&t=15s)** — as something called essential high blood pressure,
- **[00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xUu0vqcP7fE&t=18s)** — which basically means they don't really know what causes it.
- **[00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xUu0vqcP7fE&t=20s)** — It might be caused by, you know, genetics or lifestyle.
- **[00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xUu0vqcP7fE&t=24s)** — We don't know. But if you lose weight and reduce your salt
- **[00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xUu0vqcP7fE&t=27s)** — and you exercise and you stop smoking and you stop drinking, it might go away.
- **[00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xUu0vqcP7fE&t=31s)** — There's also a lot of people who don't exercise and they don't have high blood pressure.
- **[00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xUu0vqcP7fE&t=35s)** — And there's a large group of people who consume a lot of salt
- **[00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xUu0vqcP7fE&t=38s)** — and they don't have high blood pressure.
- **[00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xUu0vqcP7fE&t=39s)** — And when someone is put on hypertensive medication, 20% of the time, it doesn't work.
- **[00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xUu0vqcP7fE&t=44s)** — Now, why wouldn't that work? Because they're treating the symptom.
- **[00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xUu0vqcP7fE&t=47s)** — They're not fixing the cause.
- **[00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xUu0vqcP7fE&t=49s)** — Anytime you treat the symptom without fixing the root cause, you camouflage the problem.
- **[00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xUu0vqcP7fE&t=53s)** — It continues.
- **[00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xUu0vqcP7fE&t=54s)** — Now, if you have high blood pressure, I'm not telling you to come off your medication
- **[00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xUu0vqcP7fE&t=57s)** — without your doctor's consent.
- **[01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xUu0vqcP7fE&t=60s)** — But I want to give you some really important information
- **[01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xUu0vqcP7fE&t=62s)** — that will help you get to the root of this problem.
- **[01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xUu0vqcP7fE&t=65s)** — All right, now let's get into the root causes, okay?
- **[01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xUu0vqcP7fE&t=68s)** — Let's start with the big one.
- **[01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xUu0vqcP7fE&t=69s)** — Vitamin D deficiency.
- **[01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xUu0vqcP7fE&t=71s)** — There is a hormone system called the water pressure control system.
- **[01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xUu0vqcP7fE&t=75s)** — When this system gets triggered and it goes up,
- **[01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xUu0vqcP7fE&t=78s)** — there is a potent vasoconstriction going on in your arteries.
- **[01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xUu0vqcP7fE&t=82s)** — Basically, there's a squeezing of the arteries and the pressure is going to go up.
- **[01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xUu0vqcP7fE&t=86s)** — That is triggered by low vitamin D.
- **[01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xUu0vqcP7fE&t=89s)** — This system being high also causes a massive retention of sodium.
- **[01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xUu0vqcP7fE&t=93s)** — Wherever the sodium goes, the water goes.
- **[01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xUu0vqcP7fE&t=95s)** — More sodium, more water, more pressure.
- **[01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xUu0vqcP7fE&t=98s)** — This is why there's a big push to get everyone with high blood pressure
- **[01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xUu0vqcP7fE&t=102s)** — off of sodium or on a low sodium diet.
- **[01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xUu0vqcP7fE&t=105s)** — They would be much better off giving the person vitamin D
- **[01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xUu0vqcP7fE&t=108s)** — and also increasing their potassium.
- **[01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xUu0vqcP7fE&t=110s)** — The more potassium you have, the more sodium you could have.
- **[01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xUu0vqcP7fE&t=114s)** — Potassium protects you against the excess amount of sodium.
- **[01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xUu0vqcP7fE&t=118s)** — People that are salt-sensitive are really potassium deficient.
- **[02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xUu0vqcP7fE&t=122s)** — And unfortunately, the majority of population doesn't get enough potassium
- **[02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xUu0vqcP7fE&t=125s)** — because you need so much.
- **[02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xUu0vqcP7fE&t=126s)** — You need like 4,700 milligrams every single day.
- **[02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xUu0vqcP7fE&t=131s)** — No one's getting that much.
- **[02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xUu0vqcP7fE&t=132s)** — And also look at how many people are deficient vitamin D.
- **[02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xUu0vqcP7fE&t=135s)** — It's just off the charts.
- **[02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xUu0vqcP7fE&t=136s)** — Another interesting point about this is that your risk of high blood pressure
- **[02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xUu0vqcP7fE&t=140s)** — goes up during the winter.
- **[02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xUu0vqcP7fE&t=142s)** — Why is that?
- **[02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xUu0vqcP7fE&t=142s)** — The way the sun is angled at the earth,
- **[02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xUu0vqcP7fE&t=145s)** — there's just not enough UV radiation to create enough vitamin D in our skin.
- **[02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xUu0vqcP7fE&t=151s)** — And then we have this other very important factor.
- **[02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xUu0vqcP7fE&t=153s)** — The darker your skin, the more you're at risk for high blood pressure.
- **[02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xUu0vqcP7fE&t=157s)** — On average, if you have dark skin, your risk for high blood pressure goes up by 2x.
- **[02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xUu0vqcP7fE&t=164s)** — Why does this happen?
- **[02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xUu0vqcP7fE&t=164s)** — Because melanin in your skin is a pigment and it acts as a sunscreen.
- **[02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xUu0vqcP7fE&t=171s)** — It blocks you of ultraviolet radiation, making it very difficult to make vitamin D.
- **[02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xUu0vqcP7fE&t=176s)** — This is why the darker your skin, the more vitamin D you need to take
- **[03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xUu0vqcP7fE&t=180s)** — or the more sun exposure you need to have.
- **[03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xUu0vqcP7fE&t=182s)** — Then you get into the genetic high blood pressure situation.
- **[03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xUu0vqcP7fE&t=186s)** — Well, that's usually associated with a genetic problem with vitamin D,
- **[03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xUu0vqcP7fE&t=192s)** — which is interesting.
- **[03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xUu0vqcP7fE&t=193s)** — There's a super high percentage of people that have a genetic problem with vitamin D
- **[03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xUu0vqcP7fE&t=197s)** — that can't absorb vitamin D that well, and they need a lot more vitamin D.
- **[03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xUu0vqcP7fE&t=202s)** — So I've even questioned, do we really have a genetic blood pressure problem?
- **[03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xUu0vqcP7fE&t=206s)** — Or do we have a genetic problem with vitamin D that's causing the high blood pressure?
- **[03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xUu0vqcP7fE&t=210s)** — I mentioned that 95% of all blood pressure problems are essential,
- **[03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xUu0vqcP7fE&t=214s)** — which means they're unknown cause.
- **[03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xUu0vqcP7fE&t=216s)** — So it could be lifestyle, it could be genetic, they don't know.
- **[03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xUu0vqcP7fE&t=219s)** — They just throw all these lifestyle things in a box and, you know,
- **[03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xUu0vqcP7fE&t=222s)** — we just don't know. But in the meantime, keep taking medication
- **[03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xUu0vqcP7fE&t=225s)** — because until we find out a cause, we need to keep that pressure low.
- **[03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xUu0vqcP7fE&t=229s)** — Then we have this insulin resistant connection.
- **[03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xUu0vqcP7fE&t=232s)** — If you consume a lot of carbs or you're eating a lot of snacks,
- **[03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xUu0vqcP7fE&t=236s)** — you develop this condition called insulin resistance.
- **[03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xUu0vqcP7fE&t=239s)** — And this is a precursor for high blood glucose.
- **[04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xUu0vqcP7fE&t=242s)** — And it is the root cause of a fatty liver, high blood pressure,
- **[04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xUu0vqcP7fE&t=246s)** — high cholesterol, belly fat, high glucose.
- **[04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xUu0vqcP7fE&t=249s)** — It's all just insulin resistance.
- **[04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xUu0vqcP7fE&t=251s)** — If you're low in vitamin D, your risk for getting this goes high.
- **[04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xUu0vqcP7fE&t=256s)** — So that could be one mechanism why some people that are obese
- **[04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xUu0vqcP7fE&t=259s)** — develop hypertension because the obesity is diluting the vitamin D
- **[04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xUu0vqcP7fE&t=264s)** — and either triggering insulin resistance or just causing high blood pressure directly.
- **[04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xUu0vqcP7fE&t=269s)** — Vitamin D depends on magnesium.
- **[04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xUu0vqcP7fE&t=272s)** — Magnesium is essential for vitamin D to work.
- **[04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xUu0vqcP7fE&t=275s)** — So these go hand in hand.
- **[04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xUu0vqcP7fE&t=277s)** — So this is why I put vitamin D, magnesium and potassium.
- **[04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xUu0vqcP7fE&t=282s)** — Okay, those three right there.
- **[04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xUu0vqcP7fE&t=283s)** — Let's look at another connection between vitamin D and soft tissue calcium.
- **[04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xUu0vqcP7fE&t=287s)** — Now you have this situation where if there's too much calcium in the arteries,
- **[04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xUu0vqcP7fE&t=292s)** — your arteries can get stiff and actually your blood pressure can go up from there.
- **[04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xUu0vqcP7fE&t=297s)** — And if you watch some of my other videos,
- **[04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xUu0vqcP7fE&t=299s)** — I recommend taking vitamin K2 to direct the calcium into the bone or the teeth
- **[05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xUu0vqcP7fE&t=304s)** — and out of the soft tissues.
- **[05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xUu0vqcP7fE&t=306s)** — And there's actually even a test called the coronary artery calcification test,
- **[05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xUu0vqcP7fE&t=310s)** — which is a really good indicator or predictor of all-cause mortality.
- **[05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xUu0vqcP7fE&t=315s)** — This is why people with cramps at night or just leg cramps or feet cramps,
- **[05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xUu0vqcP7fE&t=320s)** — really they need more magnesium. Why?
- **[05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xUu0vqcP7fE&t=322s)** — Magnesium prevents the calcium from building up in the tissues.
- **[05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xUu0vqcP7fE&t=326s)** — Also think about women who are postmenopausal that take calcium supplements.
- **[05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xUu0vqcP7fE&t=329s)** — Their risk for heart attack goes up.
- **[05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xUu0vqcP7fE&t=332s)** — Why? Because you're dumping all this calcium.
- **[05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xUu0vqcP7fE&t=335s)** — Some women are taking like 1200 or 1500 milligrams of calcium every single day.
- **[05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xUu0vqcP7fE&t=342s)** — And sometimes even take a little vitamin D.
- **[05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xUu0vqcP7fE&t=344s)** — They're still at risk for heart problems.
- **[05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xUu0vqcP7fE&t=346s)** — Why? Because they're deficient in magnesium.
- **[05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xUu0vqcP7fE&t=349s)** — Magnesium keeps the calcium from getting too high and forming clots.
- **[05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xUu0vqcP7fE&t=354s)** — That's right. Too much clotting or a thrombosis,
- **[05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xUu0vqcP7fE&t=357s)** — they call it, could be coming from too much calcium.
- **[06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xUu0vqcP7fE&t=360s)** — Also, arrhythmias can also be coming from too much calcium.
- **[06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xUu0vqcP7fE&t=365s)** — And guess what? Magnesium is the antidote to preventing building up in the arteries,
- **[06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xUu0vqcP7fE&t=370s)** — heart attacks, all sorts of things.
- **[06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xUu0vqcP7fE&t=372s)** — And let's just talk about two medications they use for high blood pressure.
- **[06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xUu0vqcP7fE&t=376s)** — Calcium channel blockers, which by the way magnesium is a natural calcium channel blocker,
- **[06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xUu0vqcP7fE&t=382s)** — but you can't patent it, so they use a medication.
- **[06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xUu0vqcP7fE&t=386s)** — Then you also have something else called beta blockers.
- **[06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xUu0vqcP7fE&t=388s)** — Beta blockers block adrenaline.
- **[06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xUu0vqcP7fE&t=391s)** — Okay, so if there's too much adrenaline in the body, your blood pressure will go up as well.
- **[06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xUu0vqcP7fE&t=395s)** — And take a well guess what a natural beta blocker is.
- **[06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xUu0vqcP7fE&t=400s)** — Not just magnesium, but vitamin D.
- **[06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xUu0vqcP7fE&t=402s)** — Both of these will naturally decrease adrenaline.
- **[06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xUu0vqcP7fE&t=407s)** — Now let's roll into the four things I recommend to correct the problem if you have high blood pressure.
- **[06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xUu0vqcP7fE&t=412s)** — Okay, vitamin D. I would take 10,000 IUs every single day,
- **[06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xUu0vqcP7fE&t=416s)** — but if you're trying to correct high blood pressure, take 20,000 or even a little bit more.
- **[07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xUu0vqcP7fE&t=422s)** — Now if you have any thought in your mind that 20,000 IUs is toxic,
- **[07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xUu0vqcP7fE&t=426s)** — being on the sun for about 40 minutes will give you 20,000 IUs of vitamin D3.
- **[07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xUu0vqcP7fE&t=430s)** — So 20,000 is not a toxic level.
- **[07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xUu0vqcP7fE&t=433s)** — In fact, this is really like half of one milligram of vitamin D3.
- **[07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xUu0vqcP7fE&t=437s)** — Magnesium, very underrated, but it's very important.
- **[07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xUu0vqcP7fE&t=442s)** — I would recommend taking magnesium glycinate.
- **[07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xUu0vqcP7fE&t=445s)** — You can get a good amount of magnesium from pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, spinach, other leafy greens, almonds, and even chocolate.
- **[07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xUu0vqcP7fE&t=453s)** — Just make sure you don't have the chocolate with a lot of sugar.
- **[07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xUu0vqcP7fE&t=456s)** — Magnesium allows vitamin D to work. These two go hand in hand.
- **[07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xUu0vqcP7fE&t=460s)** — Then I recommend going on a low carb diet because at the root of high blood pressure,
- **[07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xUu0vqcP7fE&t=465s)** — metabolic syndrome, heart disease, is too many carbs.
- **[07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xUu0vqcP7fE&t=469s)** — And consuming too much sugar and starch depletes you of vitamin D magnesium.
- **[07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xUu0vqcP7fE&t=475s)** — And potassium.
- **[07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xUu0vqcP7fE&t=477s)** — Okay, so you need to do that. Also potassium is very, very important.
- **[08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xUu0vqcP7fE&t=480s)** — You can get this from an electrolyte powder.
- **[08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xUu0vqcP7fE&t=483s)** — I would recommend taking a high quality electrolyte powder that has about a thousand milligrams of potassium with other electrolytes.
- **[08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xUu0vqcP7fE&t=491s)** — But you can also get potassium from greens, but you have to consume a very large salad every single day.
- **[08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xUu0vqcP7fE&t=497s)** — But the greens will also give you magnesium.
- **[08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xUu0vqcP7fE&t=500s)** — Now to get more details on this low carb diet, you should go to this video right here.

## Full Transcript with Timestamps

*Click any timestamp to jump to that moment in the video*

- **[00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CeGlTGWtVnM&t=0s)** — I'm going to talk about the plant-based meat scam. Boy, I tell you, nothing will jack up my blood pressure than this topic because it's utterly ridiculous telling people that plant-based meats are healthy, they're clean, they're good for the environment.
- **[00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CeGlTGWtVnM&t=16s)** — But the actual real meat is unhealthy, not just for your body, but for the environment. It's a complete lie. In fact, meat, especially red meat, is one of the most healing things that you can eat. It has not just huge amounts of protein, B vitamins, iron, selenium, zinc, and many other things. I mean, what does plant-based meat have? Let's just take the Impossible Burger, sponsored by Bill Gates.
- **[00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CeGlTGWtVnM&t=46s)** — First of all, they take genetically modified yeast. And what this yeast is going to do, it's going to make a version of a blood protein heme. And it's going to make it from soy. And it's classified as a color additive. That's not the only thing in the Impossible Burger. You have soy oil, which they use hexane, that's a solvent, corn oil, modified food starch, cultured dextrose, that's synthetic sugar.
- **[01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CeGlTGWtVnM&t=76s)** — Soy protein isolates and methylcellulose. What is in a Impossible Burger that even comes close in comparison with the nutrition in red meat? To my knowledge, I haven't seen any study on their testing for this GMO heme. I mean, they're putting this out in the marketplace without any testing.
- **[01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CeGlTGWtVnM&t=94s)** — Now, what about the safety studies, right? There's this classification called GROSS, generally recognized as safe. I mean, the company applied for GROSS in 2000, I think it was in 2015, they got denied. And so they reapplied in 2017. And instead of doing the 90-day safety testing, their company did the 28-day test. The company themselves stated their own safety studies, right? This is a loophole with this GROSS certification.
- **[02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CeGlTGWtVnM&t=124s)** — And if I'm not mistaken, I only saw that they did this on 10 females and 10 males. Rats. I mean, is that a big enough sample study to test this out on? And of course, it was considered safe. But if you look a little deeper, you find some interesting data. There was weight loss with the rats. There was some type of blood chemistry disorder, reproductive changes in the uterus. Yet they said there was no adverse effects. Incredible.
- **[02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CeGlTGWtVnM&t=152s)** — So now let's switch to the environment. Let's talk about why beef is so bad for the environment. It requires so much water, so many resources for beef. But if you really read between the lines, the water that they're calculating, they're adding into this equation rainwater. So if you really want to compare this, apples to apples, 70% of the freshwater reserves are for irrigating crops. And 53% of that is for rice,
- **[03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CeGlTGWtVnM&t=182s)** — wheat, and cotton. And if you compare that to beef, beef uses less actual freshwater if we just subtract the rain, okay, because that's in addition to the freshwater. I mean, just take a look at California almonds, right? Use up 10 times the freshwater than cattle. Yet we're not concerned about these California almonds, are we? It's like, oh, those are healthy. And this next thing is very interesting, too, as far as livestock consuming the resources.
- **[03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CeGlTGWtVnM&t=212s)** — 85% of livestock resources are using non human edible material, like for example, field corn. Humans won't eat that. Also like beet pulp, the entire corn stalk, they can eat that, the whole soybean plant itself. And they can turn all this non edible material that humans can't eat into amazing protein and dairy that we can eat.
- **[04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CeGlTGWtVnM&t=241s)** — So in reality, only 16% of crops that we eat are fed to cattle. No one's really going after the chickens and pigs right now. It's mainly the cows. And so if we look at the growing crops in general, right, for every 100 pounds of crops that we grow, there's about 37 pounds of inedible byproducts that are created from that, which could be fed to the cows.
- **[04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CeGlTGWtVnM&t=267s)** — But if we look at the actual grain that humans eat, really, it only takes 2.8 kilograms to make one pound of beef. And it even takes like 3.2 grams of this grain to feed the chickens and the pigs. If we actually replace the cows just with plants, okay, and we all went vegetarian, about two thirds of that land that we use would be unusable because we can't grow certain foods.
- **[04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CeGlTGWtVnM&t=297s)** — On certain terrain, because it has too much rock, or there's cliffs that you can't make a garden on, or you can't farm on, or the soil's too rough. Well, guess what? Cows can live on that terrain. They can eat not just grass, but they can eat even weeds. I have a bunch of cows and they eat weeds all day long.
- **[05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CeGlTGWtVnM&t=318s)** — The only amount of methane that we get on the land that people grow crops on is from animal fertilizer, right? We get rid of the animals where we're going to get the fertilizer. Now let's talk about this, the cow burps, right? Methane. So roughly the greenhouse gas emissions are about like 10% methane. And the accumulation of all the amount of methane from burps from all livestock is really only about 2.7% of the total.
- **[05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CeGlTGWtVnM&t=346s)** — That's not a lot of methane. The grass or the plants eat or consume carbon dioxide. That goes into the earth, stored as carbon. The livestock consumes the plant, eats the carbohydrate, gets the carbon, okay? Makes methane, the methane goes into the atmosphere, hangs out for about 10 years, then turns into water and CO2, which then cycles through the grass, the plants, the trees.
- **[06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CeGlTGWtVnM&t=376s)** — And this whole cycle starts over and over again. So when you really look at the big picture, the livestock is not adding any more carbon to the atmosphere. All it's acting as is a recycler of the carbon through this whole cycle chain. That's the name of this video, Plant-Based Meat Scam.
- **[06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CeGlTGWtVnM&t=396s)** — Now, if you have not seen my video on the healthiest food in the world that you can eat to heal your body, I put it right here. Check this out.

- **[00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAQ7r6jLEww&t=0s)** — Most people do not get enough salt in their diet and I'm talking about sea salt not table
- **[00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAQ7r6jLEww&t=4s)** — salt. Now if you're not exercising you probably need just one teaspoon a day.
- **[00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAQ7r6jLEww&t=7s)** — But did you realize that every hour you're exercising you are depleting 1,200 milligrams of sodium.
- **[00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAQ7r6jLEww&t=12s)** — Some athletes even lose up to 5,000 milligrams per day. And in top of all that if you're drinking a lot of water, you're going to dilute that sodium to the point where you're going to get muscle cramps, you're going to be tired,
- **[00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAQ7r6jLEww&t=27s)** — and your exercise performance is going to be very poor.

- **[00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CqXHYgKKtY&t=0s)** — I want to discuss the relationship between your friendly bacteria, your gut bacteria.
- **[00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CqXHYgKKtY&t=6s)** — We are going to call that microbiome and your immune system.
- **[00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CqXHYgKKtY&t=10s)** — In fact, 70% of your immune system really is this microbiome, your gut bacteria.
- **[00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CqXHYgKKtY&t=17s)** — You have trillions and trillions of microbes living in and around your body
- **[00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CqXHYgKKtY&t=21s)** — that are constantly exchanging with you.
- **[00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CqXHYgKKtY&t=25s)** — You are giving them a place to live and what they give you is immune protection.
- **[00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CqXHYgKKtY&t=29s)** — They give you nutrients, they help your blood sugars, and they give you other things that are beneficial.
- **[00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CqXHYgKKtY&t=35s)** — There are over 10,000 different species of friendly bacteria in and around your body.
- **[00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CqXHYgKKtY&t=43s)** — And 99% of them are non-pathogenic. They are the good guys.
- **[00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CqXHYgKKtY&t=47s)** — The great majority of microbes in your body are living in the large colon, just above and in the mucus layer.
- **[00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CqXHYgKKtY&t=56s)** — And then you have the colon cells and then you have another layer of protection
- **[01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CqXHYgKKtY&t=61s)** — where you have certain immune cells or guards waiting for an invader to pop through so they can attack and eat them up.
- **[01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CqXHYgKKtY&t=68s)** — What happens is when you have an imbalance in the microbiome, you start to lose your gut lymphatic layer.
- **[01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CqXHYgKKtY&t=77s)** — You start to have a decrease in your lymph nodes.
- **[01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CqXHYgKKtY&t=81s)** — You start to have less antibodies. And antibodies are those things that attach on microbes.
- **[01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CqXHYgKKtY&t=88s)** — They don't kill the microbes. They put a tag on them for other immune cells to kill them.
- **[01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CqXHYgKKtY&t=94s)** — Antibodies are very specific to different pathogens.
- **[01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CqXHYgKKtY&t=97s)** — And then you also have a decrease in the T cell production.
- **[01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CqXHYgKKtY&t=100s)** — And T stands for thymus because the thymus gland helps train the T cells.
- **[01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CqXHYgKKtY&t=107s)** — And you are going to have less of that.
- **[01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CqXHYgKKtY&t=108s)** — The primary function of the thymus gland is central tolerance.
- **[01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CqXHYgKKtY&t=115s)** — Able to tolerate your own cells that are beneficial to you.
- **[02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CqXHYgKKtY&t=120s)** — Because if you did not have that function, these soldier cells, they are like special forces,
- **[02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CqXHYgKKtY&t=127s)** — would not be able to tell the difference between the good guys and the bad guys.
- **[02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CqXHYgKKtY&t=130s)** — And they would end up killing both of them.
- **[02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CqXHYgKKtY&t=133s)** — And you would end up with your own body cells getting attacked.
- **[02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CqXHYgKKtY&t=136s)** — That is a condition called an autoimmune disease.
- **[02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CqXHYgKKtY&t=140s)** — Autoantibodies are antibodies that are basically attacking your own tissue.
- **[02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CqXHYgKKtY&t=145s)** — But they are not really attacking. They are tagging your own tissue as being a bad guy.
- **[02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CqXHYgKKtY&t=151s)** — And other immune cells like T cells are going in there and actually trying to attack them.
- **[02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CqXHYgKKtY&t=157s)** — And that creates inflammation.
- **[02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CqXHYgKKtY&t=159s)** — And when you have autoimmune conditions, you always have inflammation.
- **[02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CqXHYgKKtY&t=162s)** — And that is really what is happening. You are getting this constant attack.
- **[02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CqXHYgKKtY&t=165s)** — And because the microbiome is so heavily connected to your immune system,
- **[02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CqXHYgKKtY&t=171s)** — when you lose this, you lose this, and you lose the tolerance.
- **[02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CqXHYgKKtY&t=175s)** — And you lose the ability to learn to differentiate.
- **[02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CqXHYgKKtY&t=178s)** — Now we have a situation where we have a lot of friendly fire,
- **[03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CqXHYgKKtY&t=182s)** — and we have a lot of collateral damage in the body and a lot of inflammation.
- **[03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CqXHYgKKtY&t=186s)** — T cells not only differentiate between your cells and a pathogen cell,
- **[03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CqXHYgKKtY&t=191s)** — it is quite amazing that your body has this ability to differentiate
- **[03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CqXHYgKKtY&t=195s)** — trillions of cells from pathogens that are not necessarily your cell,
- **[03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CqXHYgKKtY&t=202s)** — but they are so intimately involved and they are such a helper to your body
- **[03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CqXHYgKKtY&t=206s)** — that your body has developed a system to keep them alive and not attack and kill them.
- **[03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CqXHYgKKtY&t=211s)** — And also there are certain T cells that suppress inflammation.
- **[03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CqXHYgKKtY&t=215s)** — So if we lose that, what do we get? A lot of inflammatory conditions.
- **[03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CqXHYgKKtY&t=220s)** — If we also don't have enough microbiome, we get less small chain fatty acid,
- **[03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CqXHYgKKtY&t=225s)** — and one would be called butyrate.
- **[03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CqXHYgKKtY&t=227s)** — And butyrate is not only helpful in balancing your blood sugars
- **[03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CqXHYgKKtY&t=231s)** — and definitely improving insulin resistance,
- **[03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CqXHYgKKtY&t=234s)** — but it's also there to help improve your immune system.
- **[03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CqXHYgKKtY&t=237s)** — Also you have less ability to make B12, B1, vitamin K, biotin,
- **[04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CqXHYgKKtY&t=243s)** — and even lactic acid, which makes the environment for pathogens very uncomfortable.
- **[04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CqXHYgKKtY&t=251s)** — Also the microbiome are hoarding the food and the space
- **[04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CqXHYgKKtY&t=257s)** — to also limit the amount of pathogenic bacteria to exist.
- **[04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CqXHYgKKtY&t=262s)** — And the less microbiome you have, the weaker the intestinal barrier,
- **[04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CqXHYgKKtY&t=266s)** — and then you start getting leaky gut.
- **[04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CqXHYgKKtY&t=268s)** — And I really think, and this is my own opinion,
- **[04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CqXHYgKKtY&t=270s)** — that autoimmune disease starts in the gut.
- **[04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CqXHYgKKtY&t=274s)** — If you ever talk to someone who has an autoimmune disease,
- **[04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CqXHYgKKtY&t=277s)** — and I'm talking about like Hashimoto's, Crohn's, Lupus, MS,
- **[04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CqXHYgKKtY&t=282s)** — they almost always have a gut problem.
- **[04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CqXHYgKKtY&t=286s)** — In my other videos when I talk about COVID-19, the coronavirus,
- **[04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CqXHYgKKtY&t=291s)** — the way that that virus attacks your cell is through a receptor called the ACE2 receptor.
- **[04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CqXHYgKKtY&t=297s)** — Well, it just so happens that your gut has way more ACE2 receptors than the lung tissue.
- **[05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CqXHYgKKtY&t=305s)** — So this is another mode of entry into the cell that goes beyond just your lung infection,
- **[05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CqXHYgKKtY&t=311s)** — which is quite interesting.
- **[05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CqXHYgKKtY&t=312s)** — If you want to know what to do to support the microbiome,
- **[05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CqXHYgKKtY&t=317s)** — check out this video right here.

- **[00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI5a45kmvr0&t=0s)** — You know, you've been lied to about your food for a very long time.
- **[00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI5a45kmvr0&t=4s)** — You see this right here? This is a 450 milligram tablet.
- **[00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI5a45kmvr0&t=9s)** — What if I were to tell you that this is actually zero milligrams?
- **[00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI5a45kmvr0&t=13s)** — Of course, you're looking at it, but it really doesn't exist.
- **[00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI5a45kmvr0&t=15s)** — These aren't the droids you're looking for.
- **[00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI5a45kmvr0&t=17s)** — What would you say? I'm crazy, right?
- **[00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI5a45kmvr0&t=19s)** — Well, this is a loophole that manufacture companies use
- **[00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI5a45kmvr0&t=23s)** — to hide ingredients in your food. And it's called the rounding rule.
- **[00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI5a45kmvr0&t=28s)** — If something is less than 500 milligrams per serving size,
- **[00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI5a45kmvr0&t=33s)** — they don't have to list it in the nutrition facts.
- **[00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI5a45kmvr0&t=35s)** — Let me explain. Let's say a product has less than 500 milligrams of trans fats per serving size.
- **[00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI5a45kmvr0&t=42s)** — Manufacturing companies can round down to zero and even say on the label that it has zero trans fats.
- **[00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI5a45kmvr0&t=49s)** — The same thing with MSG. It's called the rounding down trick.
- **[00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI5a45kmvr0&t=53s)** — And it blows my mind how they got away with getting that passed
- **[00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI5a45kmvr0&t=56s)** — because 500 milligrams is not zero.
- **[01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI5a45kmvr0&t=60s)** — You see, if something says sugar-free, fat-free, sodium-free,
- **[01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI5a45kmvr0&t=64s)** — the chances of you reading the ingredients are pretty slim.
- **[01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI5a45kmvr0&t=66s)** — So this is just another reason why you need to start reading the ingredients.
- **[01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI5a45kmvr0&t=70s)** — And unfortunately, when we talk about sugar, there could be a lot of different terms for sugar.
- **[01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI5a45kmvr0&t=73s)** — There's actually over 200 different words for sugar.
- **[01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI5a45kmvr0&t=75s)** — But the thing that really kind of gets me is something called incidental additives.
- **[01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI5a45kmvr0&t=81s)** — Ingredients that have a different function that's not related to
- **[01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI5a45kmvr0&t=86s)** — texture, flavor, or preservative.
- **[01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI5a45kmvr0&t=89s)** — Or they have a function of extracting certain things from food.
- **[01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI5a45kmvr0&t=93s)** — They're called solvents.
- **[01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI5a45kmvr0&t=95s)** — If that ingredient is less than 5% of the finished product,
- **[01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI5a45kmvr0&t=100s)** — they don't have to declare it on the label.
- **[01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI5a45kmvr0&t=103s)** — Now this could be dextrin, which is a carbohydrate, but it acts more like a sugar.
- **[01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI5a45kmvr0&t=108s)** — On the glycemic index, maltodextrin can go up to 180.
- **[01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI5a45kmvr0&t=114s)** — Table sugar is like 74.
- **[01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI5a45kmvr0&t=117s)** — So even though it's classified as a complex carbohydrate, it acts way more like a sugar.
- **[02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI5a45kmvr0&t=121s)** — Sometimes maltodextrin is just a filler.
- **[02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI5a45kmvr0&t=123s)** — So a lot of vitamins have this hidden maltodextrin and you have no idea if it's in there.
- **[02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI5a45kmvr0&t=128s)** — At the end of this video, I will explain how to identify maltodextrin.
- **[02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI5a45kmvr0&t=132s)** — But I think the most dangerous thing that's hidden in your food is hexane.
- **[02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI5a45kmvr0&t=138s)** — There's hexane residues in MetRx.
- **[02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI5a45kmvr0&t=142s)** — There's also hexane residues in the KineBars.
- **[02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI5a45kmvr0&t=145s)** — Now what's going on with hexane?
- **[02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI5a45kmvr0&t=146s)** — Well, hexane is a solvent.
- **[02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI5a45kmvr0&t=149s)** — And so these products I just mentioned involve soy protein isolates.
- **[02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI5a45kmvr0&t=153s)** — This is a very common protein that they put in bars, veggie burgers, plant-based products.
- **[02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI5a45kmvr0&t=159s)** — And they use this hexane to extract certain things from the soybean.
- **[02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI5a45kmvr0&t=163s)** — And so they bathe these soybeans in a petrochemical bath of this solvent,
- **[02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI5a45kmvr0&t=167s)** — hexane, which is the byproduct of gasoline refining.
- **[02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI5a45kmvr0&t=170s)** — There's a few companies that got sued because they advertise them as all-natural.
- **[02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI5a45kmvr0&t=175s)** — Clif Bars was sued for this.
- **[02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI5a45kmvr0&t=177s)** — And so was Kashi, who is owned by Kellogg's.
- **[03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI5a45kmvr0&t=180s)** — Because you can't have hexane in an all-natural product,
- **[03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI5a45kmvr0&t=183s)** — especially if something is certified 100% organic.
- **[03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI5a45kmvr0&t=186s)** — But hexane is classified as a neurotoxin by the CDC and as hazardous air pollution by the EPA.
- **[03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI5a45kmvr0&t=194s)** — Of course, the soybean industry will argue that,
- **[03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI5a45kmvr0&t=197s)** — oh yeah, hexane can get evaporated, blah, blah, blah.
- **[03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI5a45kmvr0&t=199s)** — There's no regulatory body that's measuring how much hexane
- **[03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI5a45kmvr0&t=203s)** — we're getting when we're eating these foods.
- **[03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI5a45kmvr0&t=204s)** — They might think that they're getting this clean product,
- **[03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI5a45kmvr0&t=207s)** — but they're not getting a clean product.
- **[03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI5a45kmvr0&t=209s)** — And so how these manufacturing companies use this as an exemption is they classify them as
- **[03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI5a45kmvr0&t=214s)** — a processing aid.
- **[03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI5a45kmvr0&t=216s)** — And like I said before, it could be like an anti-caking agent,
- **[03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI5a45kmvr0&t=219s)** — but it can also be a binder.
- **[03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI5a45kmvr0&t=221s)** — And also a lot of the artificial sweeteners have in them hidden amounts of actual sugar
- **[03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI5a45kmvr0&t=226s)** — and maltodextrin and dextrose, which is a synthetic sugar.
- **[03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI5a45kmvr0&t=231s)** — But because they're smaller amounts, they don't have to list them.
- **[03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI5a45kmvr0&t=234s)** — This is why it's probably good to actually get one of those blood sugar monitoring devices
- **[03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI5a45kmvr0&t=238s)** — so you can test your blood sugar after consuming some of these products.
- **[04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI5a45kmvr0&t=242s)** — Like one that I would really want to test would be this one bar here.
- **[04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI5a45kmvr0&t=246s)** — First of all, it says 20 grams of protein, one gram of sugar,
- **[04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI5a45kmvr0&t=250s)** — but it has isomaltoligosaccharides.
- **[04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI5a45kmvr0&t=256s)** — It's classified as a fiber, but it acts just like a sugar.
- **[04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI5a45kmvr0&t=260s)** — The other thing you have to be careful about is when they say no added sugars, right?
- **[04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI5a45kmvr0&t=263s)** — In your mind, you're going to feel better about it like,
- **[04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI5a45kmvr0&t=265s)** — wow, good, there's no added sugars.
- **[04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI5a45kmvr0&t=267s)** — But when you read the ingredients, you're going to see that there might not be added sugars,
- **[04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI5a45kmvr0&t=271s)** — but the stuff in there definitely is filled with sugars.
- **[04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI5a45kmvr0&t=274s)** — And you also have to be careful about anything that says sugar-free or sugar-free gum.
- **[04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI5a45kmvr0&t=278s)** — But because the serving size is so small, they can use it to trick you.
- **[04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI5a45kmvr0&t=282s)** — I'm also suspect of anything that says sugar-free when the carbs are high as well.
- **[04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI5a45kmvr0&t=287s)** — Another trick that they use with multidextrin is multidextrin is classified as a carbohydrate,
- **[04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI5a45kmvr0&t=293s)** — not as a sugar, even though it acts more like a sugar.
- **[04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI5a45kmvr0&t=295s)** — And so they can get away with saying it's sugar-free.
- **[04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI5a45kmvr0&t=298s)** — Again, if you check your blood, it'll just jack your blood sugar way the heck up there.
- **[05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI5a45kmvr0&t=301s)** — Another ingredient I would be very careful about is corn syrup solids.
- **[05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI5a45kmvr0&t=307s)** — Like, wait a second, corn syrup solids?
- **[05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI5a45kmvr0&t=309s)** — Corn syrup solids is basically a solid form of corn syrup.
- **[05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI5a45kmvr0&t=314s)** — So it's the same thing, but it's just in a solid form.
- **[05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI5a45kmvr0&t=317s)** — So it's a synthetic type of sugar made out of corn.
- **[05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI5a45kmvr0&t=320s)** — Besides gum being in a small quantity, and they can kind of hide a lot of things in there,
- **[05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI5a45kmvr0&t=325s)** — you also have the sugar-free non-dairy creamers you put in your coffee.
- **[05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI5a45kmvr0&t=329s)** — I know when I'm at a town in a hotel, right, there's always this coffee machine and
- **[05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI5a45kmvr0&t=334s)** — they always have this non-refrigerated non-dairy creamer.
- **[05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI5a45kmvr0&t=338s)** — Sometimes it says sugar-free. I will not use that in my coffee.
- **[05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI5a45kmvr0&t=341s)** — Even though I need cream in my coffee, I will just drink it black because I don't trust those
- **[05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI5a45kmvr0&t=345s)** — creamers. So I have a question for you.
- **[05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI5a45kmvr0&t=347s)** — What's your thoughts on this 450-milligram capsule really being zero?
- **[05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI5a45kmvr0&t=353s)** — So now let me show you a great simple way to detect if something has
- **[05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI5a45kmvr0&t=358s)** — hidden starches in it, like maltodextrin, cornstarch, or foodstarch.
- **[06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI5a45kmvr0&t=363s)** — Check this out.
- **[06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI5a45kmvr0&t=363s)** — This test is to determine if there are carbohydrates in your supplements
- **[06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI5a45kmvr0&t=368s)** — or even your food. And primarily I'm going to focus on maltodextrin, especially in flavors.
- **[06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI5a45kmvr0&t=374s)** — Now, the works like this. All you need is some iodine.
- **[06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI5a45kmvr0&t=377s)** — If you combine iodine with the starch, it turns the color blue.
- **[06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI5a45kmvr0&t=381s)** — Now, if we take just normal water, I'm just going to take water.
- **[06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI5a45kmvr0&t=385s)** — We just take a drop or two of iodine in just regular water, tap water.
- **[06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI5a45kmvr0&t=391s)** — You can see it doesn't turn blue. It stays kind of gold and yellow.
- **[06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI5a45kmvr0&t=395s)** — But if we take some iodine on some wonderful bread, you can see it will turn it blue.
- **[06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI5a45kmvr0&t=400s)** — Okay, that's the chemical reaction. Now, if we take pure maltodextrin,
- **[06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI5a45kmvr0&t=404s)** — for example, and put it in some water right here, mix it up,
- **[06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI5a45kmvr0&t=408s)** — put a couple drops of iodine in it, you can see the color blue or purple.
- **[06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI5a45kmvr0&t=414s)** — Okay, that's pure maltodextrin.
- **[06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI5a45kmvr0&t=416s)** — Now, let's take this other electrolyte powder, which is a competitor's brand.
- **[07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI5a45kmvr0&t=421s)** — Which has a very similar formula to mine, like a copycat formula.
- **[07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI5a45kmvr0&t=425s)** — They state that this is without sugar or maltodextrin.
- **[07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI5a45kmvr0&t=428s)** — Add a scoop of that and a couple drops of iodine.
- **[07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI5a45kmvr0&t=433s)** — Let's see if it has maltodextrin in there.
- **[07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI5a45kmvr0&t=438s)** — Whoa! Turns purple blue. Apparently it does.
- **[07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI5a45kmvr0&t=441s)** — All right, now let's take my electrolyte powder.
- **[07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI5a45kmvr0&t=442s)** — Let's see if it has any maltodextrin in there or carbs, starches, I mean.
- **[07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI5a45kmvr0&t=446s)** — Okay, mix it here. Let's put a couple drops of iodine in there.
- **[07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI5a45kmvr0&t=452s)** — No purple, no maltodextrin.
- **[07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI5a45kmvr0&t=454s)** — In fact, let's put some even more iodine in there.
- **[07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI5a45kmvr0&t=457s)** — See if it eventually turns it purple.
- **[07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI5a45kmvr0&t=460s)** — And the answer is no. It stays yellow gold.
- **[07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI5a45kmvr0&t=463s)** — And you can detect hidden maltodextrin
- **[07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI5a45kmvr0&t=465s)** — and other starches in your supplements and food.

- **[00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1PQy1DeHEk&t=0s)** — Can eating sugar be part of a balanced healthy diet if consumed in moderation?
- **[00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1PQy1DeHEk&t=5s)** — I mean, come on. They actually help make healthy foods palatable.
- **[00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1PQy1DeHEk&t=9s)** — Dr. David Katz says that it's a preferred fuel for your brain.
- **[00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1PQy1DeHEk&t=14s)** — And he also mentioned that what's the point of being healthy if you can't really enjoy yourself?
- **[00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1PQy1DeHEk&t=19s)** — And if we go to the Sugar Association and you read on their page regarding
- **[00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1PQy1DeHEk&t=23s)** — cardiovascular disease, it says this, nutritional patterns may play a role in several
- **[00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1PQy1DeHEk&t=29s)** — of these risk factors. However, scientists have heavily debated and not fully settled
- **[00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1PQy1DeHEk&t=34s)** — whether there's evidence for a specific role of carbohydrates or sugar in cardiovascular disease.
- **[00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1PQy1DeHEk&t=41s)** — So this is a really common tactic that the tobacco companies use.
- **[00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1PQy1DeHEk&t=46s)** — All you have to do is put doubt in people's minds. Definitely doubt in the scientific
- **[00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1PQy1DeHEk&t=50s)** — research. I mean, we know that the American Heart Association gets major funding from
- **[00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1PQy1DeHEk&t=57s)** — We know that the Major Dietetic Association, the group that organizes events for dieticians,
- **[01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1PQy1DeHEk&t=64s)** — get major funding to the magnitude of like $23 million.
- **[01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1PQy1DeHEk&t=69s)** — So I have a question. On average, how much sugar do you think a person really consumes?
- **[01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1PQy1DeHEk&t=76s)** — It's 23 teaspoons of sugar. 23 teaspoons of sugar is roughly around a half of a cup
- **[01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1PQy1DeHEk&t=82s)** — of sugar every single day. That's a lot. But is that really all the sugar? Well, there's
- **[01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1PQy1DeHEk&t=88s)** — hidden sugars that I want to make you aware of that a lot of people don't talk about.
- **[01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1PQy1DeHEk&t=92s)** — And what do I mean hidden sugars? Well, this food right here, this has zero sugars. This
- **[01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1PQy1DeHEk&t=98s)** — one has zero sugars. This one has zero sugars. Zero sugars. What about goldfish? Zero sugars.
- **[01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1PQy1DeHEk&t=104s)** — So that's interesting because that is a good comparison of junk food,
- **[01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1PQy1DeHEk&t=108s)** — ultra processed food calories. But there's really no sugar in those foods. So why are those so
- **[01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1PQy1DeHEk&t=114s)** — bad? If you take the total carbohydrates and you minus the sugars and you minus the fiber,
- **[02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1PQy1DeHEk&t=120s)** — you're left with what? A starch. That's the stuff right here. And on the glycemic index,
- **[02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1PQy1DeHEk&t=126s)** — this stuff is way, way higher than actual sugar. And when you're talking about starch
- **[02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1PQy1DeHEk&t=130s)** — in these products, you're not talking about like a potato or rice or anything like that.
- **[02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1PQy1DeHEk&t=134s)** — You're talking about multidextrin or modified food starch or modified cornstarch. So in other
- **[02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1PQy1DeHEk&t=139s)** — words, starch has a bigger effect on your blood sugars than actual sugar. If we take a look at
- **[02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1PQy1DeHEk&t=147s)** — the average person's consumption of starch, take a wild guess how much sugar that really is.
- **[02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1PQy1DeHEk&t=154s)** — If you guess 75 teaspoons, you are correct. That is roughly about a cup and a half of
- **[02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1PQy1DeHEk&t=160s)** — every single day from the hidden sugars from starches. Now let me just give you another
- **[02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1PQy1DeHEk&t=165s)** — example. I used to consume a much bigger bag of Doritos going through college and this right
- **[02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1PQy1DeHEk&t=170s)** — here has 11 serving sizes. I'll guarantee no one is going to consume one 11th of this bag.
- **[02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1PQy1DeHEk&t=179s)** — Cheez-Its, zero sugar. But if you look at the hidden sugar of starches, it's about 30
- **[03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1PQy1DeHEk&t=184s)** — teaspoons of sugar. Pringles, this has like 60 teaspoons of hidden sugar as starch.
- **[03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1PQy1DeHEk&t=190s)** — About a cup and a half. Okay, so there's a lot of sugar in a lot of different foods,
- **[03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1PQy1DeHEk&t=193s)** — but what's so bad about this sugar? I mean, sugar is natural, right? Well,
- **[03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1PQy1DeHEk&t=197s)** — at least this sugar is natural. Well, it might be from nature or it might be synthetic,
- **[03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1PQy1DeHEk&t=202s)** — but there's a big difference between actual sugar in the refined form and the sugar
- **[03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1PQy1DeHEk&t=208s)** — in a banana or fruit or other foods. What is the difference? Well, with refined sugar,
- **[03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1PQy1DeHEk&t=214s)** — this is not just empty calories. This is something without nutrients, without antioxidants.
- **[03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1PQy1DeHEk&t=221s)** — It's very, very different than actual fruit. And what people do not realize is that when you
- **[03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1PQy1DeHEk&t=227s)** — try to consume that and use that as fuel, it requires a tremendous amount of nutrition.
- **[03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1PQy1DeHEk&t=233s)** — I'm talking about magnesium, calcium, zinc, B vitamins. And this is really unknown to a lot
- **[03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1PQy1DeHEk&t=239s)** — of people because the biochemistry of your body in your little factories called the mitochondria
- **[04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1PQy1DeHEk&t=244s)** — need nutrients to process that type of fuel. And so if you're chronically consuming that type
- **[04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1PQy1DeHEk&t=249s)** — of fuel, there's only one choice. And that is to deplete your reserves to the point where you
- **[04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1PQy1DeHEk&t=254s)** — don't have any nutrients anymore. Now there's the backup engine that's outside the mitochondria,
- **[04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1PQy1DeHEk&t=260s)** — but the problem with that is it doesn't produce a lot of energy. It only produces like two
- **[04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1PQy1DeHEk&t=266s)** — units of energy called ATP versus in the mitochondria, you produce like 36 to 38
- **[04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1PQy1DeHEk&t=273s)** — units of energy or ATP. So now you're running on an old clunky motor and everything starts
- **[04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1PQy1DeHEk&t=279s)** — going downhill because now you don't also have the antioxidants to protect you against
- **[04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1PQy1DeHEk&t=283s)** — all the damage that has occurred in your cells. So this is why we develop chronic diabetes,
- **[04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1PQy1DeHEk&t=291s)** — Alzheimer's, inflammation, skin problems. So we've known this for a very long time. And this
- **[04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1PQy1DeHEk&t=296s)** — is why if you look on the ingredients in some of these foods, you'll see that they're all
- **[05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1PQy1DeHEk&t=302s)** — fortified with nutrients because they know if you're deficient and even one nutrient, you can
- **[05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1PQy1DeHEk&t=307s)** — get a major disease. I mean, just to make a point about that, if you completely block one
- **[05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1PQy1DeHEk&t=313s)** — nutrient, vitamin B3, you will die. What the food manufacturing companies have done is
- **[05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1PQy1DeHEk&t=319s)** — enriched or sprayed a couple of synthetic vitamins. And you might think that might be
- **[05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1PQy1DeHEk&t=324s)** — enough, but it's not even close. Spraying like seven synthetic vitamins from petroleum
- **[05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1PQy1DeHEk&t=329s)** — is not the same as consuming whole foods. Okay, you're not going to get the same nutrition
- **[05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1PQy1DeHEk&t=333s)** — from these junk foods. So this is what I recommend that you do. Okay, number one,
- **[05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1PQy1DeHEk&t=339s)** — stop eating sugar, but you might not have considered also eliminating starches. And
- **[05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1PQy1DeHEk&t=345s)** — I'm not concerned with you eliminating all the starches from vegetables. I'm talking about
- **[05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1PQy1DeHEk&t=349s)** — the starches from this stuff right here. Because if you did that, what's going to happen
- **[05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1PQy1DeHEk&t=354s)** — is you're going to start to reverse this whole disease cycle. You're going to start to
- **[05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1PQy1DeHEk&t=359s)** — lower the blood sugars. You're going to start to get rid of a fatty liver. You're going to
- **[06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1PQy1DeHEk&t=369s)** — much better fuel for the heart than glucose. And all of a sudden your body organs start
- **[06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1PQy1DeHEk&t=374s)** — working better and better and better. And your cravings go away and your mood is elevated.
- **[06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1PQy1DeHEk&t=379s)** — Now, if you haven't seen my other video on sugar that had over 17 million views,
- **[06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1PQy1DeHEk&t=384s)** — I put it up right here. Check it out.
