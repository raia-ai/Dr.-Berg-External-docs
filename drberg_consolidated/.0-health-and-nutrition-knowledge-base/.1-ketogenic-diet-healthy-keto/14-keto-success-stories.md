## Is It Normal To Have Red Stool After Eating Beets

# Is it normal to have red stool after eating beets?

Yes, it's normal to have red stool after eating beets. Beets contain betanin, a red pigment giving beets their distinct color. Some people cannot fully break down betanin during digestion, resulting in reddish-colored stool and urine.

Red stool after eating beets isn't anything to worry about. However, if your stool is red more than a day or two after eating beets, it's best to consult with your doctor. Red stool can indicate intestinal bleeding.
