## Can I Consume American Cheeses On Keto

# Can I consume American cheeses on keto?

Many people prefer European cheeses over American cheeses.

The cheeses that contain the most probiotics are aged cheeses that aren’t heated. Keep an eye out for raw milk cheeses – these are the ones that you want.

Make sure the cheese you buy is organic and from grass-fed cows. Soft cheese has more friendly bacteria than hard cheese.
Here are some cheeses you should try:

- Cheddar

- Parmesan

- Swiss

- Gruyere

- Gouda (best probiotic cheese)

Keep in mind that you should consume only a moderate amount of cheese. Cheese can contain hormones that may affect your prostate or contribute to fibroids in high amounts. Don’t overdo it and you should be fine.
