## How To Tighten And Flatten Stomach Just In A Few Days

# How to tighten and flatten stomach just in a few days?

A caloric deficit is not a sustainable way to lose weight or get a flat stomach! Most people find that their metabolism slows down in their 20s and 30s after a series of calorie-restrictive diets. Lowering calories increases hunger and cravings, which will require immense willpower and can stifle weight loss. The caloric deficit model is not sustainable!

Insulin is the hormone that controls whether you burn or store fat. If you reduce insulin, you can tap into your body fat for energy. Carbohydrates have the most significant effect on insulin, while fat is neutral and protein has a moderate impact. All calories are not the same! To lose weight, you must lower insulin, which means you must reduce your carb intake. If you’re on a low-carb diet, your body can use both food and body fat for fuel. This eliminates hunger and cravings between meals. Fat provides more than double the energy of glucose.

It takes 2 to 3 days to get into ketosis and 2 to 3 weeks for fat adaptation. Fat adaptation means your body is burning the most fat possible. Your body can burn ketones and fat, which are two different fuel sources. To get your body into ketosis, carbohydrates should make up about 5% of your diet, protein 20%, and fat 75%. Visceral fat in the abdomen may prevent a flat belly, but you can eliminate it with this diet. The dead bug exercise stimulates the fascia and muscles that can act as a girdle, giving you a flat belly fast! Do this exercise every day, and within 1 to 2 weeks, you will start to see amazing results!

## What Is One Of The First Warning Signs Of Dementia

# What is one of the first warning signs of dementia?

Surprisingly, one of the earliest signs of dementia involves the retina. There is a high correlation between problems in the retina and problems in the brain. Problems with night vision or central vision, floaters, and light sensitivity issues are the earliest signs of dementia.

Some people develop amyloid-beta plaquing on the retina and may experience problems differentiating shades of grey and other colors. Researchers have found high levels of microbes, typically found in the mouth, in the brains of Alzheimer’s patients. When people die from dementia, it’s usually caused by an infection such as a UTI or lung infection. For some people, surgery can be too much on the body and lead to death. Some people with dementia have a slow, progressive degeneration of the brain to the point they’re bedridden and stop eating and drinking, which ultimately leads to death.

Focus on cleaning your brain and reducing inflammation for dementia prevention. The glymphatic system cleans the brain, mainly at night, which is one of the primary purposes of sleep. This system removes malformed proteins and plaquing and rejuvenates the brain. Anything that inhibits sleeping may increase your risk for Alzheimer’s, heart attacks, strokes, cancer, blood sugar issues, and type 2 diabetes. Sleep apnea can also be problematic. You need 8 to 9 hours of sleep! Alcohol significantly interferes with REM sleep and is very damaging to brain health.

To prevent Alzheimer’s, you must flood the brain with oxygen. Exercise is one of the best ways to do this! Exercise stimulates the growth of brain cells and the hormone BDNF (brain-derived neurotrophic factor). Adequate sun exposure and high amounts of vitamin D can help support healthy sleep. A diet high in sugar and carbohydrates can starve your neurons. Brain cells love ketones! To get into ketosis, you must lower your carbohydrate intake. If you have any early signs of dementia, try taking ketones as a supplement or MCT oil. Niacin may also be helpful. Take 50 mg daily, slowly increasing to 500 mg per day.

## What Is The Worst Health Advice

# What is the worst health advice?

The worst health advice:

1\. People can get all their nutrition from food. Getting enough nutrients such as vitamin D, potassium, and magnesium from food is almost impossible. Many people consume refined carbs and sugar, which deplete them of vital nutrients. Supplements are often the only way to compensate.

2\. Take more calcium to prevent osteoporosis. Normal blood calcium levels do not prevent bone loss. Osteoporosis usually occurs when you age and hormones like estrogen and testosterone decrease.

3\. Always use sunblock. Sunblock became very popular when sun exposure was linked to cancer. But you need sun to get enough vitamin D, which is vital for your immune system.

4\. Snack frequently to avoid overeating. Snacking raises insulin, creating a high blood sugar situation. This keeps you hungry and will not prevent overeating.

5\. Sugar in moderation is fine. Sugar and carb consumption, even in moderation, stops you from tapping into your fat reserve.

6\. Avoid saturated fats. Saturated fat does not clog your arteries. High-carb diets create a much more significant risk for heart problems.

7\. Whole grains are heart-healthy. Whole grains trigger blood sugar. Most products that contain whole grains also contain refined grains and fillers like maltodextrin and modified food starch. Whole grains contain phytates, which block the absorption of key nutrients, and gluten, which irritates the gut.

8\. Avoid red meat Grass-fed, grass-finished red meat is the healthiest food you can eat!

9\. Our brains need sugar and carbs. Your brain can also run on ketones, which will prevent brain fog and increase cognitive function.

10\. Restrict salt for high blood pressure. Rather than avoiding salt, focus on eliminating junk food from the diet and increasing vitamin D and potassium.

11\. All calories are equal. The body does not treat all calories equally. Instead of creating a calorie deficit to lose weight, create a carbohydrate calorie deficit. This forces the body to burn fat as an alternative fuel source.

## What Is The Main Reason For Heart Attacks And Strokes

# What is the main reason for heart attacks and strokes?

If someone dies from a heart attack or stroke, their death is typically the result of a clot. A clot can form in less than 5 seconds! Usually, your body should form a clot, fix the hole in the artery, then dissolve the clot, but this doesn’t always happen.

Clots can be caused by the following:

•Smoking

•Pollution/chemicals

•Alcohol

•Birth control pills

•Stress

•Surgery

•Endurance sports

•Refined starches

•Infection

•High blood sugar

•Inflammation

Excess calcium in the arteries can also trigger clotting, which can lead to a heart attack or stroke. Postmenopausal women who take large amounts of calcium are at a much greater risk for blood clots. Calcium is involved in over 15 different clotting factors. Vitamin K2 prevents calcium from building up in the soft tissues and arteries. It is found in dairy, butter, and other fatty foods. Always take vitamin D with vitamin K2. Magnesium is another important calcium regulator. It helps prevent calcium from entering the soft tissues, as well as arrhythmias and atrial fibrillation. Nitric oxide can reduce clotting. Vitamin D, L-arginine, and sunlight can increase nitric oxide to help prevent heart attack. Polyphenols, vitamin C, and omega-3 fatty acids all support heart health and may help reduce your risk of clotting. Keto and intermittent fasting can help reduce clotting by reducing inflammation in your arteries. Regular moderate exercise is vital in preventing clotting. Garlic and onion are also essential. Nattokinase, serrapeptase, and bromelain can be taken as supplements to prevent clotting.

## What Can I Do If My L. Reuteri Yogurt Comes Out Too Watery

# What can I do If my L. Reuteri Yogurt comes out too watery?

The watery portion is whey, a natural resultant of the fermentation process.  The whey can be stirred into the yogurt and eaten as-is or enjoyed with berries or stevia.  

How to Help Reduce the Whey 

The more thoroughly and rapidly the components are mixed, the greater the potential reduction in whey. 

First, add your starter culture, either an L. reuteri capsule or three tablespoons of yogurt from a previous batch, to your mixing bowl. Then, as you add one tablespoon of inulin, stir vigorously for a few seconds—longer if you're using yogurt from a previous batch. Stir by hand; machine mixing can harm bacteria. Keep your container of organic half-and-half ready near your mixing bowl while you do this.\*\*\*\* 

Next, after the starter culture and inulin are mixed immediately add your half and half, it can be more than 2 tablespoons, it can even be 2-4oz, stirring vigorously.   

The key is that it all mixes well with no lumps at all, without any sticking to the spoon/fork (which you don't want) or the bottom of the mixing bowl itself, as it's easy to miss, so make sure you do a quick check.   

Once quickly and thoroughly mixed, put the mixture in your bowls/ jars evenly (with jars, it helps to use a 1/2 cup measuring cup) and make sure your water levels are even or slightly above the water line just to be sure:)

## What To Do For Alzheimers Disease If Nothing Is Working

# What to do for Alzheimer's Disease if nothing is working?

Interestingly, smoking cigarettes and ibuprofen reduce LH and Alzheimer's risk. Now, I'm definitely not saying you should start taking ibuprofen and smoking cigarettes to prevent AD.

The drug Lupron—which is used for endometriosis, fibroids, prostate cancer, and breast cancer—also decreases the risk of Alzheimer's. Lupron also happens to lower LH. However, Lupron has numerous adverse side effects.

There is one drug without side effects that can also decrease LH: melatonin. Melatonin is stimulated by darkness, and it helps you get into a deep sleep. It also helps stimulate your immune system and offers powerful antioxidant properties.

Melatonin has significant effects when it comes to reducing Alzheimer's risk in women. Men can also see some benefits when taking much larger amounts of melatonin.

Here is what the book recommends for reducing Alzheimer's risk.

- Females: 75mg of melatonin per day

- Males: 120 mg of melatonin per day

- 300mg pregnenolone

- 3tsp MCT oil

- Regular exercise

- Fasting

Always check with your doctor before applying any of this information. This is just to educate you on these interesting links between hormones and Alzheimer's disease.

## What Can Help With Xantomas

# What can help with xantomas?

To help with xanthomas, the following recommendations are provided:

1. **Niacin**:

    - Take 500 milligrams of extended-release niacin two to three times a day.

    - Niacin is one of the most potent ways to lower cholesterol.

2. **Exercise**:

    - Exercise daily, especially if you have high triglycerides, as it helps burn off extra triglycerides in the bloodstream.

3. **Dietary Changes**:

    - Consume a good portion of your protein from fish or seafood high in omega-3 fatty acids.

    - Include huge salads in your diet, around seven to ten cups daily.

    - Add walnuts to your salads for their omega-3 fatty acid precursors.

    - Use extra virgin olive oil with garlic on your salads.

4. **Supplements**:

    - Choline: Helps prevent fatty liver and reduce cholesterol.

    - TUDCA (a specialized type of bile salt): Helps with the flow of cholesterol and reduces LDL cholesterol.

    - Red yeast rice extract: Acts as a natural version of a statin and is influential in lowering cholesterol.

5. **Healthy Ketogenic Diet**:

    - Follow a ketogenic diet with a twist by consuming fat that comes with the protein, rather than adding extra fat.

These steps can assist in managing and potentially reducing xanthomas by addressing the underlying cholesterol and triglyceride buildup.

Always consult your medical healthcare provider before starting any new supplement or protocol to address a medical condition.

## This 1 Thing Can Replace Our Entire Medical System

# This 1 Thing Can Replace Our Entire Medical System

Fasting has gained significant attention for its potential to address the root cause of many chronic illnesses: insulin resistance. By abstaining from food for a period, you can effectively "reset" your body's metabolism and improve its sensitivity to insulin.

**How Fasting Works:**

- **Activates Survival Genes:** Fasting triggers survival mechanisms within your body, prompting it to utilize stored fat and ketones for energy instead of relying solely on glucose.

- **Ketosis:** It typically takes around 3 days of fasting to enter ketosis, a metabolic state where your body efficiently burns fat for fuel.

- **Insulin Sensitivity:** Fasting enhances your cells' responsiveness to insulin, allowing for better blood sugar regulation.

- **Cortisol Levels:** Contrary to popular belief, fasting does not elevate cortisol (stress hormone) levels.

**Types of Fasting:**

- **Water Fasting:** Consuming only water during the fasting period.

- **Dry Fasting:** Abstaining from both food and water. Dry fasting may offer additional benefits like accelerated weight loss and enhanced detoxification, but it should be approached with caution and under appropriate guidance.

**Important Considerations:**

- **Listen to Your Body:** Don't force yourself to fast longer than feels comfortable. Pay attention to your body's hunger cues.

- **Nutrient Intake:** If you experience hair loss or menstrual irregularities while fasting, it could indicate a lack of protein. Prioritize high-quality protein sources like grass-fed red meat, which provides essential amino acids, trace minerals, and B vitamins.

- **Essential Minerals:** Ensure adequate intake of sea salt, magnesium (around 400mg), and zinc (around 50mg) to support overall health during fasting.

- **Hydration and Sleep:** Stay well-hydrated (especially during water fasting) and prioritize getting enough sleep.

**Disclaimer:** While fasting can offer significant health benefits, it's crucial to consult with your healthcare provider before starting any fasting regimen, especially if you have any underlying health conditions or are taking medications.

## What Is The Typical Timeframe Required To Effectively Reverse Diabetes 2A4E9B

# What is the typical timeframe required to effectively reverse diabetes, and what factors influence the speed and success of achieving healthy blood sugar levels?

How long it takes to reverse diabetes depends on your overall health status, severity of diabetes, and your commitment to dietary and lifestyle changes. While some individuals can reverse diabetes within three months of starting intermittent fasting and Healthy Keto, others may require up to six months to restore blood sugar control.

## What Is An Unhealthy Type Of Ketosis

# What is an unhealthy type of Ketosis?

The classical ketogenic diet, an unhealthy form of ketosis, is primarily used for children with epilepsy to help reduce seizures. While it effectively induces ketosis, it offers limited nutritional value as it focuses more on inducing ketone production rather than providing a balanced diet. This diet often includes margarine, GMO oils, maltodextrin, soy, and synthetic vitamins.

Critics of ketosis sometimes highlight potential risks, such as kidney stones, elevated uric acid levels, and bad breath, using the classical ketogenic diet as an example. In contrast, a healthy ketogenic diet offers numerous benefits beyond managing epilepsy and is fundamentally different from the classical ketogenic diet.

## What Are The Foods That You Should Avoid For Alzheimers

# What are the foods that you should avoid for Alzheimer's?

In my opinion, what you eat is the most important thing that influences dementia or Alzheimer’s disease. There is one food I believe you have to avoid if you’re trying to improve symptoms of Alzheimer’s disease, and that is refined carbohydrates. Surprisingly, insulin is actually neuroprotective, and carbs increase insulin. If you’re deficient in insulin, your risk for amyloid plaquing goes up.

But this doesn’t mean you should consume more carbs. A high-carb diet is associated with high blood sugar, and people with high blood sugar or diabetes have an increased risk of Alzheimer’s disease. When your insulin is too high, your body starts protecting itself against excess insulin, leading to insulin resistance. Insulin resistance is a deficiency of insulin inside the cells. It's important to have just the right amount of insulin.

Refined carbs and sugar can also create brain inflammation. Not only that but sugar and refined carbs can destroy the energy sources for neurons and create oxidation and free-radical damage while also decreasing antioxidants.

This is why it’s key to fix insulin resistance. If you fix insulin resistance, the neurons can get the level of insulin they need for neuroprotection and to help decrease inflammation.

**How to support healthy insulin levels:**

1\. Get on the keto diet (run your body on ketones)

2\. Do intermittent fasting

3\. Do OMAD

4\. Consume nutrient-dense foods

5\. Decrease stress

## What Is The Connection Between Thyroid And Gallbladder

# What is the connection between thyroid and gallbladder?

Bile contains bile salts, lecithin, bilirubin, protein, and cholesterol. If a person has too much cholesterol and not enough bile salts, they could develop gallstones. However, cholesterol is necessary to help you make bile, hormones, and vitamin D. The body makes the majority of cholesterol in the body.

The liver makes bile. Bile helps eliminate excess cholesterol and certain toxins. It also helps break down fats and supports the absorption of fat-soluble vitamins and fatty acids. A person with hypothyroidism or a subclinical hyperthyroid issue has an increased risk of gallstones. Many different connections cause this increased risk, but overall, it takes a healthy thyroid to make enough bile and bile to create a healthy thyroid.

Ultimately, I believe a lack of fat and cholesterol in the diet can increase your risk of gallstones and hypothyroidism from multiple angles. The Healthy Keto® diet can help supply the fats and important vitamins and minerals your body needs. Learn more about Healthy Keto in my other videos.

## Can Apple Cider Vinegar Boost Energy And How Might It Affect Metabolis Aada26

# Can apple cider vinegar boost energy, and how might it affect metabolism and energy production?

If you’re tired all of the time or lack energy, this one is for you.

It turns out that apple cider vinegar also supports energy. Apple cider vinegar is basically acetic acid, which can be absorbed by most of your tissues as fuel. If you’re on keto and fasting but lack energy, consuming apple cider vinegar is a great way to feel more energetic. On top of increased energy, you’re getting all the tremendous health benefits of apple cider vinegar.

**How to boost your energy levels using apple cider vinegar:**

Add one to two tablespoons of apple cider vinegar to a 16-ounce glass of water, and drink the mixture once a day. You can also add lemon and electrolyte powder for added benefits, but that’s optional.

## Why Do I Get Diarrhea On Keto

# Why do I get diarrhea on Keto?

Why do you get diarrhea on keto? There are a few reasons, which I’ll explain. First, you may not be used to digesting the amount of saturated fat required on keto. Your body will produce more bile, which lubricates your colon. Cut back on your oil consumption, especially if it’s in a liquid form like MCT oil. Also, reduce the amount of butter and coconut oil you’re consuming. See if that helps.

A more likely reason is that you’re not used to digesting the quantity of vegetables I recommend. Certain compounds in some vegetables can overwhelm the microbes in your small intestine. Switch the type of vegetables you’re consuming to safe ones: lettuce, cucumber, tomato, zucchini, bell pepper, and bean sprouts.

For now, avoid consuming onions, garlic, artichokes, beetroot, leeks, Brussel sprouts, and cabbage. As well, temporarily avoid green beans, avocados, blackberries, cauliflower, mushrooms, and fennel. Stick with the safe vegetables I listed, and try consuming fermented vegetables.

As your microbes start multiplying and adapting to the safe vegetables, you’ll be able to gradually include more of the ones you were temporarily avoiding. Ease more of them in after three or four weeks. You should no longer get diarrhea on keto.

## Which Type Of Carbohydrate Lowers Ldl Cholesterol Quickly And How Does 31125B

# Which type of carbohydrate lowers LDL cholesterol quickly, and how does it work?

Ever wondered why doctors recommend vegetables for high cholesterol? The secret lies in vegetable fiber! It's like having tiny bodyguards fighting cholesterol in your system.

**Understanding Cholesterol and Bile Salts**

Your body produces more cholesterol than you consume. Bile salts, produced by the liver, act as a detergent, breaking down fats and escorting excess cholesterol out of your body. Insufficient bile production can lead to constipation and increased cholesterol levels.

**Vegetable Fiber: The Cholesterol-Lowering Champion**

Vegetable fiber is superior to other fibers for reducing cholesterol. It acts like a sponge, soaking up bile salts and preventing their reabsorption into the bloodstream. Unlike other fibers, vegetable fiber doesn't raise insulin levels, making it an ideal choice.

**Nutritional Powerhouses**

Vegetables are low in sugar, high in fiber, and packed with phytonutrients, vitamins, and minerals, making them essential for overall health and cholesterol management.

**How Fiber Works its Magic**

- **Binds with Cholesterol:** Fiber traps cholesterol in the gut, preventing it from entering the bloodstream.

- **Increases Bile Production:** Fiber encourages the liver to produce more bile salts, further aiding cholesterol elimination.

- **Stabilizes Blood Sugar and Insulin:** Fiber doesn't spike blood sugar or insulin levels, unlike simple carbs.

- **Nourishes Gut Microbes:** Fiber feeds beneficial gut bacteria, which produce short-chain fatty acids that reduce inflammation and promote gut health, crucial for managing cholesterol.

**Dietary Recommendations**

- **Increase Vegetable Intake:** Aim for at least five servings of fiber-rich vegetables like broccoli, carrots, and Brussels sprouts daily.

- **Avoid Sugars and Starches:** Reduce consumption of sugary drinks and refined carbohydrates, as they raise blood sugar and indirectly contribute to high cholesterol.

**Conclusion**

Lowering cholesterol naturally starts with adding more vegetables to your diet. They are your allies in the battle against high cholesterol, thanks to their fiber content and nutritional benefits. By making simple dietary changes, you can take control of your health and enjoy a cholesterol-friendly lifestyle.

## What Is The 1St Sign Of Fatty Liver

# What is the 1st sign of fatty liver?

There really is no “first sign” of a fatty liver. When you first start developing a fatty liver, there are no symptoms at all. It’s important to be aware of this because many people have a fatty liver and don’t even know it. People will start to notice signs once the condition has progressed.

Signs of a fatty liver:

• A protruding mid-section

• Insulin resistance

Fifty-nine percent of the fat in your liver originates from outside your liver—it’s fat from other places in your body that end up in the liver. Twenty-six percent of fat in the liver comes from the liver itself. The liver makes fat from glucose, and insulin is supposed to stop this process. But, because of dysfunctional fat and insulin resistance, the liver is making sugar uncontrollably. The third source of fat in the liver is dietary fat from consuming sugar. I believe the top cause of a fatty liver is a high-carb diet. The good news is that the liver is the only organ that can completely regenerate. However, there is a point of no return, so it’s time to act now.

**Natural things to do for a fatty liver:**

1\. Get on the Healthy Keto® diet and do intermittent fasting

2\. Exercise regularly

3\. Consume one to two tablespoons of apple cider vinegar in your water a few times a day

## What Is The Vitamin Deficiency Behind The Bladder Issues

# What is the vitamin deficiency behind the bladder issues?

**A vitamin B1 deficiency could lead to problems, including:**

• Leaky bladder

• Incomplete urination

• Frequent urination

• Getting up in the middle of the night to urinate

The common thread behind these bladder issues is actually a problem with the nervous system. The main control with urine elimination stems from the brain, and this part of the brain is very sensitive to a vitamin B1 (thiamine) deficiency. A thiamine deficiency in the brain can even starve off certain neurons, causing a lack of function. The part of the brain that controls the bladder can shrink, leading to a loss of control of the bladder. This situation is common with age and in those with diabetes, prediabetes, or chronic insulin resistance.

**Natural tips to get rid of bladder issues:**

1\. Take vitamin B1 (benfotiamine and natural B1)

2\. Get on the Healthy Keto® diet and do intermittent fasting

3\. Drink 2.5 liters of fluid a day (not past 6 pm or 7 pm)

4\. Consume apple cider vinegar (1 to 2 TBSP in water)

5\. Reduce caffeine consumption

6\. Massage the bladder

## What Is The Carb That Lowers Cholesterol

# What is the carb that lowers cholesterol?

In some cases, it’s not a problem if cholesterol is a little bit higher. This can happen when you first start the keto diet because you’re mobilizing cholesterol from the fat cells. But what can you do if you need to lower bad cholesterol naturally? There is one specific food that can really help you. Your body makes cholesterol. Excess cholesterol is eliminated through the bile ducts with the help of bile salts. Bile salts have a lot of important roles in the body.

Typically, carbohydrates will increase cholesterol and triglycerides. There are three types of carbohydrates: sugar, starches, and fiber. Fiber can actually help reduce your cholesterol, but it has to be the right type of fiber. We’re talking about the fiber in vegetables. Vegetables have low amounts of sugar and high amounts of fiber. They’re also rich in nutrients, phytonutrients, vitamins, and minerals. Fiber helps bind with cholesterol and modify the absorption of lipids and fats. It also increases the production of bile and eliminates bile connected to cholesterol. Fiber has zero effect on blood sugar and insulin, which will help lower your cholesterol. Feeding your microbes fiber also decreases the production of cholesterol. If you have high cholesterol, consume more vegetables to help increase the release of bile and feed the microbes. At the same time, be sure to avoid sugar and starch in your diet.

## Do Keto And Fasting Increase Stress Hormones

# Do Keto and fasting Increase stress hormones?

Do keto and fasting increase stress hormones? The answer is no.

Some people believe that it appears to be stressful on the body because you're starving the body of glucose. However, a person has fat on their body to be used as fuel. Logically, our bodies are meant to run off of fat between meals.

Cortisol is a stress hormone. It is also called glucocorticoid. One of the major functions of cortisol is to keep your blood sugars from getting too low. It releases stored glucose or causes the production of glucose to maintain blood sugar levels. This isn't a stress event; it's a normal thing that occurs in the body.

It takes about three days for the body to adapt from burning glucose to burning fat. Cortisol can rise a little bit when a person goes through the three-day keto-adaptation phase, but then it levels out.

When you run your body on glucose, it is very stressful for the body, and you can't tap into your own fat. However, when you get into ketosis, you could go from a stress state to a much higher level of calmness and a state of well-being. Burning fat or being in ketosis is a non-stressful state. Keep in mind, that when you start keto and fasting, it's important to take electrolytes and B vitamins.

## Can A 16 Hour Fast Start Autophagy

# Can a 16-Hour fast start autophagy?

Yes, inducing autophagy may be possible with a 16-hour fast, especially for those following a low-carb ketogenic diet. 

Depleting blood sugar and glycogen stores is key for activating autophagy, which explains why consuming a low-carb diet can help promote autophagy.

---

## How Do You Know When Autophagy Starts

# How do you know when autophagy starts?

Autophagy is associated with various signs, including increased ketone levels, reduced appetite, and increased cognition. 

Bad breath can also signal autophagy as the body produces a type of ketone called acetone, which can lead to body odor and bad breath.

## What Are The Early Stages Of Potassium Deficiency

# What are the early stages of potassium deficiency?

In its early stages, a potassium deficiency, also known as mild hypokalemia, often manifests as subtle but noticeable changes in how you feel:

- [Muscle Cramps](https://www.drberg.com/blog/taking-electrolytes-yet-still-cramping): One of the initial and noticeable potassium deficiency symptoms is muscle cramping. Muscles rely on the proper balance of electrolytes, particularly potassium, to function smoothly. When blood potassium levels drop, your muscles may start to spasm or feel tight. If you've ever experienced a sudden, painful charley horse in your calf, you've felt a mild form of muscle cramping. These cramps can occur in various muscle groups, including your legs, arms, or even your abdomen.

- [Fatigue](https://www.drberg.com/blog/fatigued-on-keto-and-when-fasting): Potassium is crucial in energy production. It helps convert the food you eat into usable energy your cells can utilize. Low potassium disrupts this energy conversion process, often leaving you feeling drained and lethargic. This lack of energy might manifest as difficulty concentrating or simply feeling less motivated throughout the day.

- [Constipation](https://www.drberg.com/blog/constipation-is-not-just-a-lack-of-fiber): Ever notice how dehydration can back you up? Well, low potassium can have a similar effect on your digestive system. Potassium is involved in muscle contractions that help move food through your digestive tract. Low potassium levels can slow things down, leading to discomfort, bloating, and those dreaded irregular bowel movements we know as constipation.

## What Is Better Pasture Raised Eggs Or Store Bought Eggs

# What is better pasture raised eggs or store bought eggs?

### **Why Free-Range Eggs Are Healthier Than Commercial Chicken Eggs**

**1\. Diet and Nutrient Content:**

- **Commercial Chicken Diet**: Commercial chickens are typically fed a grain-based diet supplemented with vitamins and minerals. While this diet helps produce large eggs, it lacks critical nutrients found in the natural diet of free-range chickens, such as insects and green vegetation.

- **Free-Range Chicken Diet**: Free-range chickens have some access to the outdoors, allowing them to consume a more varied diet that includes insects, worms, and vegetation. This natural diet contributes to the higher nutrient content in their eggs.

**2\. Nutritional Differences:**

- **Omega-3 vs. Omega-6 Fatty Acids**: Free-range eggs generally have a better balance of omega-3 to omega-6 fatty acids. Omega-3s are anti-inflammatory and important for heart and brain health, while too many omega-6s can contribute to inflammation.

- **Vitamins and Antioxidants**: Free-range eggs contain higher levels of vitamins and antioxidants. For example, they have double the amount of vitamin E and 38% more vitamin A compared to commercial eggs. These nutrients are essential for overall health, including eye, prostate, and heart health.

**3\. Living Conditions:**

- **Commercial Chickens**: These chickens are often kept in confined spaces with limited movement, which can impact their overall health and the quality of the eggs they produce.

- **Free-Range Chickens**: Although the term "free-range" can be somewhat misleading, as it only requires "access" to the outdoors, these chickens generally have more space to move around compared to commercial chickens. This can lead to healthier chickens and better-quality eggs.

Free-range eggs are considered healthier than commercial eggs due to the more varied and natural diet of free-range chickens, which leads to higher nutrient content in the eggs. Additionally, the living conditions of free-range chickens are generally better, contributing to the overall quality of the eggs.

## What Are The Most Effective And Rapid Strategies For Detoxifying The L F3Bf1C

# What are the most effective and rapid strategies for detoxifying the liver, and how do various dietary, lifestyle, and supplementation approaches contribute to this process?

**Here are some tips for supporting your liver health:**

To support and speed up liver detoxification, we need to trigger autophagy.

The best ways to trigger autophagy:

1\. Dry fasting (Recommend doing it under medical supervision)

2\. Water fasting

3\. Calorie restriction

4\. Sleep

5\. Exercise

6\. Keto diet

7\. Phytonutrients

Dry fasting (recommended under medical supervision) is one of the most powerful ways to trigger autophagy and truly cleanse the liver cells.

With dry fasting, you don’t consume any food or water. To cleanse the liver, you may want to consider dry fasting for a full day—starting at sunrise and ending at sunset.

The effects of just one day of dry fasting are equivalent to three days of water fasting.

Additional benefits of dry fasting:

• Enhanced immunity

• Liver and kidney support

• Mental clarity

• Decreased inflammation

When the sun sets, you’ll eat your one meal for the day, which should consist of meat and cruciferous vegetables. These foods are also great for cleaning the liver.

Try dry fasting for three days of the month (they don't need to be consecutive) and see how you feel. (recommended that it is done under medical supervision)

Before you start dry fasting, take bile salts or TUDCA, consume beets, or drink apple cider vinegar with water to help thin your bile.

This can help prevent any negative liver detox side effects.

## What Does A 24 Hour Fast Do

# What does a 24-Hour fast do?

Not consuming calories for 24 hours forces your metabolism to utilize stored body fat as a primary fuel source.  

Once the liver depletes all the glucose and starts burning fat, ketone levels rise and provide your cells and tissues with energy—this metabolic state is known as ketosis.

## What Is Glycine And What Are Its Key Roles And Benefits In The Body Pa C64721

# What is glycine, and what are its key roles and benefits in the body, particularly for health, metabolism, and overall well-being?

**It's a very important amino acid: glycine.** Collagen is a main component of connective tissues, tendons, ligaments, and cartilage. About ⅓ of collagen is made by glycine. Your body can make glycine, but unfortunately, it doesn’t make very much. If you're not getting it from the diet, you could be deficient. Unless you’re eating the skin and cartilage from meat, you’re probably not getting enough glycine.

**Glycine** is needed to make the most important antioxidant for all of your cells, glutathione. Without enough glycine to make glutathione, you can’t detoxify your body. This can cause a buildup of toxicity, leading to inflammation. Glycine is a potent anti-inflammatory agent and is an essential building block for many enzymes and proteins.

**Here are some of the many important functions of glycine:**

• Makes heme in your blood

• Important for gum health

• Essential for DNA

• Building block for catalase

• Supports sleep

• Supports the liver

• Can help fix a leaky gut

• Detoxifies uric acid

• Supports blood sugar

• Helps with weight loss

• Reduces visceral fat

**Glycine can also turn into glucose to be used as fuel.** Certain parts of the body, especially the brain, need a certain amount of glucose. If you’re not consuming glucose, your body can make it. Glycine is a precursor for glucose, but don’t worry about it bumping you out of ketosis. Glycine stimulates the hormone glucagon, which opposes insulin.

**If you’re not eating animals nose-to-tail, if you’re under stress, taking medication, drinking alcohol, or exposed to toxins, you can become deficient in glycine.** You can increase your glycine intake by consuming gelatin! Try making your own gelatin using Knox Blox and using a natural sweetener like stevia. You can also take a glycine supplement. The average person needs about 4 to 10 grams of glycine per day.

**Bone broth and pork rinds can increase your glycine intake, but you need to consume a lot to get enough glycine.**

As we age, we need more glycine. Increasing glycine intake can potentially help people with osteoarthritis, osteoporosis, hair thinning, insomnia, gout, and kidney stones.

## Why Are My Triglycerides Elevated On The Carnivore Diet

# Why are my triglycerides elevated on the Carnivore Diet?

While Dr. Berg has created content on the benefits of the Carnivore Diet, we are not specialists in the diet.  However, Healthy Keto, which we are specialists in, and the Carnivore Diet may both enter you into a state of ketosis due to the limited intake of carbohydrates.

In ketosis, the body starts using fat as the primary source of energy. This fat may come from stored fat in the body, even if the person is thin. Triglycerides are stored in the body's fat and are mobilized when the fat is converted to energy. This can cause an increase in triglyceride levels in the blood, which may decrease over time. However, some foods allowed in the Carnivore Diet may contain additional triglycerides that could also show up in the blood.

It's important to consult a medical professional to monitor and test any increase in triglyceride levels.

## What Are The Most Effective Remedies For Addressing Dry And Wrinkled Skin

# What are the most effective remedies for addressing dry and wrinkled skin?

Say goodbye to dry, dehydrated skin! While most moisturizers contain alcohol, which can worsen dryness, there are natural solutions that truly nourish your skin.

Vitamin E, coconut oil, and tallow offer relief, but the champion of hydration is hyaluronic acid. This powerful molecule, naturally found in your body, holds an incredible 1000 times its weight in water, making it essential for youthful, supple skin. It even aids in wound repair and sunburn recovery.

Unfortunately, hyaluronic acid levels decline with age or due to certain conditions. But don't worry! You can replenish it through injections, topical application, or oral supplements. Just 200mg daily can make a noticeable difference in combating dryness and wrinkles.

For quick relief, apply a few drops of alcohol-free hyaluronic acid to damp skin, rubbing it gently into your hands and face. Remember, healthy skin starts from within. A balanced diet like the Healthy Keto® approach can further enhance your skin's radiance.

Say hello to hydrated, glowing skin with hyaluronic acid!

## What Is The Parathyroid Gland

# What is the Parathyroid Gland?

**Understanding the Parathyroid Glands**

- **Location and Function:** Your body has four parathyroid glands located behind the thyroid in your neck. These glands are crucial for regulating calcium levels in your blood, ensuring a healthy balance.

- **Consequences of Imbalance:** Too much or too little calcium can lead to health problems. Parathyroid malfunctions can cause your body to withdraw excessive calcium from your bones, potentially leading to osteopenia, osteoporosis, fractures, bone pain, and hypercalcemia (excess blood calcium). Hypercalcemia may cause high blood pressure, irregular heart rhythms, kidney stones, fatigue, memory issues, and GERD.

- **Hypocalcemia:** Parathyroid problems can also result in hypocalcemia (low blood calcium).

- **Potential Causes of Tumors:** Exposure to toxins like aluminum, ozone, and certain pesticides may increase the risk of parathyroid tumors.

- **Supporting Parathyroid Health:** A diet rich in cruciferous vegetables, choosing organic foods, and following a healthy keto diet may support parathyroid function.

## What Is Protein Starvation On Low Fat Diet

# What is protein starvation on low-fat diet?

## **Understanding Protein Starvation on a Low-Fat Diet**

Have you ever heard of rabbit starvation? It occurs when you consume too much lean protein without enough fat in your diet. This can lead to protein starvation, which can have some pretty unpleasant side effects.

When you're on a [low-fat diet](https://www.drberg.com/blog/think-twice-before-you-start-a-low-fat-diet), it's easy to fall into the trap of relying too heavily on lean protein sources like chicken breast or egg whites. But here's the thing: your body needs fat to function properly.

Without enough fat, you can start to experience some serious health issues.

### **Symptoms and Side Effects of Protein Starvation**

So, what exactly happens when you're not getting enough fat in your diet? Well, for starters, you might start to feel pretty lousy. Common symptoms of protein starvation include:

- [Diarrhea](https://www.drberg.com/blog/diarrhea-on-the-ketogenic-diet)

- Headaches

- Fatigue

- Low blood pressure

- Slow pulse rate

- Insatiable hunger

These symptoms can be pretty debilitating, and they're a clear sign that your body isn't getting the nutrients it needs to function properly. If you're experiencing any of these symptoms on a low-fat diet, it's time to reevaluate your eating habits.

### **The Role of Fat in Preventing Protein Starvation**

So, how much fat do you need to prevent protein starvation? Well, it depends on a few factors, like your age, sex, and activity level. But experts generally recommend getting about 20-35% of your daily calories from fat.

To put that into perspective, let's take a look at rabbit meat. Rabbit is often touted as a lean, healthy protein source. But here's the thing: rabbit meat only has about 8% fat. That's not nearly enough to keep your body functioning properly.

In fact, there have been documented cases of people who have tried to survive solely on rabbit meat and ended up with severe protein starvation. Their bodies simply couldn't handle the lack of fat in their diets.

## The Keto Friendly Snack   Olives

# The Keto-Friendly Snack - Olives

The [ketogenic diet](https://www.drberg.com/blog/the-ketogenic-diet-plan-for-beginners) is a high-fat, low-carb eating plan that has gained popularity recently for its potential weight loss and health benefits. Olives fit perfectly into a ketogenic diet, as they are high in healthy fats and low in carbs.

Snacking on olives can help you stay in ketosis, a metabolic state in which your body burns fat for fuel instead of carbohydrates.

### **Fermentation's Role in Reducing Lectins**

Olives undergo a fermentation process that enhances their flavor and makes them more digestible by reducing harmful compounds called lectins.

Lectins are proteins found in many plant foods that can interfere with nutrient absorption and cause digestive issues in some people.

The fermentation process used to cure olives helps break down lectins, making the olives easier to digest and less likely to cause gastrointestinal discomfort. This is good news for people with sensitive digestive systems or those following lectin-free diets.

## What Are The Least Effective Fasting Patterns For Beginners

# What are the least effective fasting patterns for beginners?

## **The Least Effective Fasting Patterns for Beginners**

While intermittent fasting can be a game-changer for many people, not all fasting patterns are created equal. Some methods may be too extreme or unsustainable for beginners, leading to frustration and potential health risks.

Choosing a fasting pattern that aligns with your goals, lifestyle, and individual needs is important. Here are two fasting methods that may not be the best choice for those just starting out:

### **The Five and Two Diet's Limited Ketosis Impact**

The five-and-two diet, also known as the 5:2 diet, involves eating normally for five days a week and restricting calorie intake to 500-600 calories on the other two non-consecutive days.

While this method may lead to some weight loss, it has limitations when it comes to achieving ketosis, a metabolic state where your body burns fat for fuel.

To enter ketosis, you typically consume fewer than 50 grams of carbohydrates daily for several days. With the five-and-two diet, the fasting days may not be long enough or consistent enough to trigger this fat-burning state.

As a result, beginners may not experience the full range of benefits associated with intermittent fasting, such as increased energy and improved mental clarity.

### **Alternative Day Fasting's Sustainability Concerns**

Alternative day fasting (ADF) is another popular method that involves alternating between "fast" days, on which you consume only 25% of your normal calorie intake, and "feast" days, on which you eat without restriction.

While some studies have shown that ADF can lead to weight loss and improved health markers, it may not be the most sustainable approach for beginners.

The drastic calorie restriction on fasting days can be challenging to stick to long-term, leading to feelings of deprivation and even binge eating on feast days. This yo-yo effect can make establishing healthy eating habits difficult and may lead to weight regain over time.

Additionally, the constant fluctuation in calorie intake can be stressful on the body and may not be suitable for those with certain health conditions or a history of disordered eating.

For beginners, a more moderate and consistent approach to fasting may be a better choice for long-term success.

## **Recommended Fasting Patterns for Optimal Benefits**

Finding the right approach to intermittent fasting is key to unlocking its full potential. While some methods may be too extreme for beginners, several fasting patterns offer a more sustainable and effective way to reap the benefits of this lifestyle.

Here are three recommended fasting methods that have been shown to deliver optimal results:

### **The 18/6 Fasting Pattern**

The 18/6 fasting pattern, or the Leangains protocol, involves fasting for 18 hours and eating within a 6-hour window each day. For example, you might finish your last meal at 8 pm and not eat again until 2 pm the following day.

This method is popular among those looking to build muscle and lose fat, as it allows for more flexibility in meal timing and macronutrient intake.

Fasting for an extended period also gives your body ample time to enter a fat-burning state and experience the benefits of [increased growth hormone levels](https://www.drberg.com/blog/increase-growth-hormone-as-you-age) and [autophagy, a cellular cleanup process](https://www.drberg.com/blog/the-real-reason-why-autophagy-exists) that helps remove damaged proteins and organelles.

### **The 20/4 Fasting Strategy**

The 20/4 fasting strategy may be a good fit for those looking for a more aggressive approach. This method involves fasting for 20 hours and eating within a 4-hour window daily.

While this may sound intense, many people find that the longer fasting helps them feel more focused and energized throughout the day.

The 4-hour eating window also allows for larger, more satisfying meals, which can be especially appealing for those who enjoy the social aspect of dining.

Research has shown that the 20/4 method can be highly effective for weight loss and improving markers of metabolic health, such as insulin sensitivity and blood sugar control. It may also offer cognitive benefits, such as improved brain function and memory.

# Achieving Success with Periodic Fasting

## **Achieving Success with Periodic Fasting**

To truly harness periodic fasting's potential for improving health and managing chronic conditions, it's essential to approach it with the right strategies and mindset.

You can minimize side effects and optimize your results by focusing on consistency, gradual adaptation, and a balanced approach.

### **Transitioning Smoothly into Fasting**

One of the best ways to start intermittent fasting is to ease into it gradually. Begin by reducing your eating window by an hour or two each day until you reach your desired fasting schedule.

This allows your body to adapt more comfortably to the changes in nutrient intake and can help minimize the severity of any side effects during the adaptation period.

It's also important to focus on nutrient-dense, whole foods during your eating windows to ensure your body is getting the essential vitamins, minerals, and macronutrients it needs to function optimally.

Staying hydrated and prioritizing sleep can further support your body's adaptation to fasting and help you feel your best.

### **Optimizing Health Outcomes Through Fasting**

When done correctly, periodic fasting can offer a range of health benefits, including improved insulin sensitivity, better blood sugar control, reduced inflammation, and [enhanced cognitive function](https://www.drberg.com/blog/enhance-cognitive-function-and-mood-on-healthy-ketosis).

Maintaining a consistent fasting routine and focusing on healthy lifestyle habits can optimize these outcomes and support your overall well-being.

It's important to remember that fasting is just one piece of the health puzzle. Combining intermittent fasting with a proper diet, regular physical activity, stress management, and adequate sleep can help you achieve and maintain optimal health in the long run.

As with any new health practice, it's always a good idea to consult with a healthcare professional before starting a fasting regimen, especially if you have any underlying health conditions or concerns.

With the right approach and guidance, periodic fasting can be a powerful tool for transforming your health and quality of life.

![16:8 fasting illustration](https://drberg-dam.imgix.net/others/intermittent-fasting-theme-represented-by-black-04.jpg?w=992&auto=compress,format)

## **Intermittent Insight**

Provide a comprehensive view of the potential drawbacks associated with periodic fasting, mainly focusing on the [18:6 fasting](https://www.drberg.com/blog/dramatically-spike-brainpower-with-an-18-hour-fast) approach. While intermittent fasting can offer numerous health benefits, it's important to understand and address potential challenges.

Drawbacks may include initial hunger or discomfort during fasting periods, difficulty with adherence to a restricted eating window, and potential disruptions to social eating patterns.

Additionally, some individuals may experience fluctuations in energy levels or difficulty maintaining muscle mass with prolonged fasting.

By acknowledging these drawbacks and finding personalized strategies to mitigate them, individuals can make informed decisions about incorporating intermittent fasting into their lifestyle while maximizing its potential benefits.

## The Adaptation Period Of Periodic Fasting

# The Adaptation Period of Periodic Fasting

Starting a periodic fasting regimen involves a significant metabolic shift as the body transitions from using glucose to burning fat for fuel. This adaptation process, known as ketosis, typically takes between three to seven days.

**Understanding the Shift to Fat Burning**

Initially, fasting depletes glycogen stores in the liver and muscles. Once these reserves are low, usually within 24-48 hours, the body begins lipolysis, breaking down fat into fatty acids. The liver then converts these fatty acids into ketones, providing an alternative energy source for the brain and organs.

**Navigating Early Side Effects**

During this transition, you may experience temporary side effects, including fatigue, irritability, brain fog, and symptoms akin to the "keto flu." Hypoglycemia, characterized by shakiness, dizziness, and lightheadedness, is also common as insulin levels drop and glucose intake ceases.

These symptoms generally subside within the first week as the body adapts to fat metabolism. Staying hydrated, getting adequate rest, and monitoring your body's responses can help alleviate discomfort during this adaptation phase.

---

## The Transition To Ketosis During Fasting

# The Transition to Ketosis During Fasting

During fasting, glycogen stores are depleted, prompting the body to produce ketones from stored fat. This process, known as ketosis, allows the brain and other organs to use ketones as an alternative fuel source when glucose is scarce.

**Glycogen Depletion and Ketone Production**

Within the first 12 to 24 hours of fasting, glycogen stores are exhausted, leading to lipolysis, where fat is broken down into free fatty acids and glycerol. The liver then converts these fatty acids into ketones through ketogenesis, typically starting around 12 to 24 hours into the fast.

As fasting continues, glucose and insulin levels decrease, prompting the body to use fat for energy. By 12 to 72 hours, approximately 40% of fat is utilized for ketone production. Prolonged fasting promotes adaptation to ketosis, enhancing the body's efficiency in using ketones and fat for energy.

These symptoms may include:

- Difficulty walking or maintaining balance

- Poor coordination and clumsiness

- Slurred speech or difficulty speaking

- Tremors or involuntary movements

- Trouble with fine motor skills, such as writing or buttoning clothes

It's important to note that these symptoms can develop gradually over time and may be subtle in the early stages of the condition.

### **Diagnostic Tools for Gluten Ataxia**

Diagnosing gluten ataxia can be challenging, as the symptoms can overlap with other neurological conditions. However, several diagnostic tools can confirm the presence of gluten ataxia.

Blood tests are often the first step in diagnosing gluten ataxia. These tests look for specific antibodies that indicate an immune response to gluten, such as anti-gliadin antibodies and anti-tissue transglutaminase antibodies.

In addition to blood tests, imaging studies like [magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)](https://www.drberg.com/blog/ct-scan-versus-mri-how-they-differ) can help identify damage or atrophy in the cerebellum, which is a hallmark of gluten ataxia.

![Human brain illustration](https://drberg-dam.imgix.net/others/human-brain-stimulation-activity-neuron-close.jpg?w=992&auto=compress,format)

### **Effective Prevention Measures**

Preventing the onset or worsening of gluten ataxia symptoms primarily involves adopting a strict [gluten-free diet](https://www.drberg.com/blog/is-the-gluten-free-healthy-on-a-ketogenic-diet). This means eliminating all sources of gluten, including wheat, barley, rye, and their derivatives, from the diet.

It's also important to be aware of potential cross-contamination in restaurants and shared kitchen spaces, as even trace amounts of gluten can trigger an immune response.

In addition to dietary changes, lifestyle adjustments such as regular exercise and stress management techniques can help support overall brain health and potentially slow the progression of gluten ataxia.

However, it's crucial to remember that damage to the cerebellum caused by gluten ataxia is difficult to reverse. Symptoms of cerebellum damage may include focus and attention problems, brain fog, anxiety, depression, and cognitive decline.

## What Is The Science Behind Low Carb Diets

# What is the science behind low-carb diets?

Low-carbohydrate diets work by reducing insulin levels and promoting fat-burning for energy production. When carb intake is minimized, blood sugar levels stabilize, and insulin sensitivity improves.

This leads to reduced hunger cravings and increased satiety after meals, which can result in weight loss over time.

## How To Grow Your Muscles

# How to grow your muscles?

**Building Muscle on Keto with Intermittent Fasting**

Keto and intermittent fasting can support muscle growth, but exercise is essential. Here's what you need to know:

- **Intensity Matters:** Muscle growth depends on challenging workouts. Focus on pushing yourself to your limits.

- **Benefits of Fasting:** Fasting boosts human growth hormone (HGH), aiding muscle growth and preservation. Minimize snacking to maximize HGH benefits.

- **The Keto Advantage:** A well-formulated keto plan with intermittent fasting sets the stage for muscle building:

    - 2 meals a day

    - 50g carbs per day

    - 7-8 oz. protein per meal

    - Prioritize sleep

**The Dorian Yates Approach (Advanced)**

Inspired by 6-time Mr. Olympia Dorian Yates, this intense strategy can accelerate results:

1. **Warm-Up:** Light sets prepare your muscles.

2. **Go All Out:** One extremely hard set of 6-8 reps, then assisted reps to push beyond failure.

3. **Controlled Negatives:** Focus on the eccentric (lengthening) phase of each exercise.

4. **Full Recovery:** Work each muscle group once a week for optimal repair.

**Important Notes:**

- **Start Gradually:** If you're new to this intensity, ease in and consider a trainer's guidance.

- **Recovery is Key:** Intense workouts require ample rest for maximum muscle growth.

## What Is Dr. Bergs Recommendation For Pancreatic Insufficiency

# What is Dr. Berg's recommendation for pancreatic insufficiency?

Dr. Berg recommends a couple of approaches for managing pancreatic insufficiency:

1. **Dietary Adjustments**: Lowering fat intake is suggested, especially if one is following a ketogenic diet, to help manage the symptoms associated with pancreatic insufficiency.

2. **Enzyme Supplementation**: Dr. Berg suggests using pancreatic enzymes to aid digestion. This can include both prescribed enzymes and over-the-counter options, depending on the individual's specific needs and the severity of their condition.

These recommendations aim to support the pancreas by reducing its workload and enhancing digestion, which can be compromised when the pancreas is not functioning optimally.

## How To Break Your Prolonged Fast

# How to Break Your Prolonged Fast

Breaking a prolonged fast safely is crucial to avoid potential health issues such as refeeding syndrome.  This severe and potentially fatal medical condition happens when you start to increase your calorie intake after a prolonged fast. The reintroduction of carbohydrates triggers a shift from fat to carbohydrate metabolism, leading to severe electrolyte imbalances and fluid alterations. These imbalances can cause complications such as heart failure, seizures, and, in extreme cases, death. A crucial factor contributing to refeeding syndrome is nutrient deficiency, particularly phosphorus, potassium, and magnesium, which are rapidly depleted as they are used in metabolizing glucose upon resuming eating. This condition underscores the importance of carefully planning and executing the transition from fasting to a typical eating pattern to avoid such risks. 

Please review “[The #1 Danger of Prolonged Fasting You HAVE to Know About](https://youtu.be/ldi9vElgemE?si=Vvq1e-m8sgxxv15J)” to learn more about refeeding syndrome, its risks, and ways to help avoid it. 

Here are the steps to safely break a prolonged fast, based on Dr. Berg's advice: 

1. **Start Slowly**: Begin by consuming small amounts of food. It's important not to overwhelm your digestive system, which has been resting during the fast. 

2. **Supplement with Vitamin B1 (Thiamine)**: Essential for glucose metabolism and helps convert food into energy. It is particularly crucial during refeeding to help prevent refeeding syndrome. 

3. **Avoid High-Carbohydrate Foods**: Avoid foods high in carbohydrates immediately after a fast. They can rapidly deplete minerals like potassium, phosphorus, magnesium, and B1, increasing the risk of refeeding syndrome. 

4. **Choose the Right Foods**: 

1. **Keto-Friendly Foods**: [Keto-friendly foods](https://www.drberg.com/ketosis-approved-foods) help maintain stable blood sugar levels and prevent sudden depletion of essential minerals. 

2. **Easy-to-Digest Foods**: Foods like soups, smoothies, or bone broth are recommended as they are gentle on the stomach and more easily digested. 

3. **Gradual Increase**: Gradually increase the quantity and variety of foods over several days. This allows your body to adapt without causing undue stress on your metabolic system. 

4. **Listen to Your Body**: Pay close attention to how your body reacts during refeeding. If you experience any adverse symptoms, you may need to adjust and consume less food and/or space out your intake of nutrients. 

These steps can help reintroduce food to support your body’s needs and minimize potential risks. Consult a healthcare professional before starting or ending a prolonged fast, especially if you have pre-existing health conditions. 

This information is provided from [Dr. Berg's Guidelines for Prolonged Fasting.docx](https://realdrberg-my.sharepoint.com/:w:/g/personal/shawnh_drberg_com/EazcZ9dNJ6VDhEOO13hV0F8BnVvc-Ge6y2mYjpN-FnojYg?e=RHdisz&clickparams=eyJBcHBOYW1lIjoiVGVhbXMtRGVza3RvcCIsIkFwcFZlcnNpb24iOiI1MC8yNDAzMzEwMTgxNyIsIkhhc0ZlZGVyYXRlZFVzZXIiOmZhbHNlfQ%3D%3D).

## Prolonged Fasting   Build Up Nutrients With Healthy Keto

# Prolonged Fasting - Build Up Nutrients with Healthy Keto®

An adequate nutrient reserve is essential to a safe prolonged fast.  Healthy Keto® is a low-carb, high-fat, moderate-protein diet focusing on high-quality, nutrient-dense foods.   

Healthy Keto® emphasizes organic vegetables, full-fat organic dairy, and wild-caught, grass-fed, pasture-raised meat, fish, fowl, and eggs to maximize vitamin and mineral nutrients.  Healthy Keto® replaces unhealthy oils like soy, corn, and canola oil with healthier butter, coconut, avocado, olive, and animal fats to help reduce inflammation and support improved nutrient absorption.  Dr. Berg’s Healthy Keto® also encourages the consumption of 7 to 10 cups of vegetables daily for adequate vitamins and mineral nutrients. 

**Always Start with Intermittent Fasting** 

Intermittent fasting serves as a foundational step before transitioning to prolonged fasting for several reasons: 

1. **Adaptation to Fasting State:** Intermittent fasting helps your body gradually adapt to periods without food. This adaptation can make the transition to prolonged fasting smoother and more manageable. 

2. **Metabolic Flexibility:** Intermittent fasting enhances your body's ability to switch between using glucose and fat as energy sources. This metabolic flexibility is crucial for prolonged fasting, where your body needs to utilize fat stores for energy over extended periods efficiently. 

3. **Building Fasting Tolerance:** Starting with intermittent fasting allows you to build knowledge of your hunger signs and learn how your body responds to fasting. This experience is valuable when you extend the fasting duration in prolonged fasting. 

4. **Safety and Efficacy:** Gradually increasing fasting duration through intermittent fasting is essential to a safer and more efficient fast than jumping directly into prolonged fasting, which can be more challenging and has a higher risk of adverse effects if not done correctly. 

Starting with intermittent fasting prepares your body and mind for the more intensive experience of prolonged fasting, potentially enhancing both the experience and the benefits. 

To start intermittent fasting, you can follow these steps: 

1. **Choose Your Fasting Plan**: Decide a fasting schedule that suits your lifestyle. Standard plans include the 16:8 method, where you fast for 16 hours and eat during an 8-hour window. 

2. **Gradually Increase Fasting Time**: Begin by slowly extending your overnight fast. For example, delay breakfast by an hour and gradually increase until you can comfortably skip it. 

3. **Stay Hydrated**: During fasting periods, drink plenty of water and electrolyte water. Black coffee or herbal teas should be consumed in limited amounts, as they can dehydrate you. 

4. **Listen to Your Body**: Pay attention to how your body responds. If you experience fatigue or feel unusually cold, these could be signs that you’re advancing too quickly. 

5. **Nutrient-Dense Foods**: During your feeding window, choose nutrient-dense foods, such as those on the [Healthy Keto® Approved Foods](https://www.drberg.com/ketosis-approved-foods) list. 

6. **Consult Healthcare Providers**: If you have any health conditions or concerns, consult a healthcare provider before starting an intermittent fasting regimen. 

This information is provided from [Dr. Berg's Guidelines for Prolonged Fasting.docx](https://realdrberg-my.sharepoint.com/:w:/g/personal/shawnh_drberg_com/EazcZ9dNJ6VDhEOO13hV0F8BnVvc-Ge6y2mYjpN-FnojYg?e=RHdisz&clickparams=eyJBcHBOYW1lIjoiVGVhbXMtRGVza3RvcCIsIkFwcFZlcnNpb24iOiI1MC8yNDAzMzEwMTgxNyIsIkhhc0ZlZGVyYXRlZFVzZXIiOmZhbHNlfQ%3D%3D).

## What Is The Role Of Dietary Cholesterol For Healthy Heart

# What is the role of dietary cholesterol for healthy heart?

### **The Role of Dietary Cholesterol in Heart Health**

First, let's talk about [cholesterol](https://www.drberg.com/blog/cholesterol-basics-101-by-dave-feldman-and-dr-berg)—specifically, dietary cholesterol—the kind found in foods like eggs, meat, and dairy.

For years, conventional wisdom held that dietary cholesterol was public enemy #1 for heart health. The thinking went: you eat cholesterol, your blood cholesterol levels rise, and your heart suffers.

However, fresh investigations have questioned this long-held belief, suggesting it might not be as straightforward as once thought. Emerging research indicates that ingesting cholesterol doesn't significantly alter blood cholesterol figures for most people.

Interestingly, a 2018 investigation unveiled that consuming as many as a dozen eggs weekly doesn't elevate heart disease risk in individuals with no pre-existing health issues.

So, what gives? It turns out that the relationship between dietary cholesterol and heart health is a lot more complex than we once thought.

Factors like genetics, overall diet quality, and lifestyle habits all play a role in determining how your body responds to cholesterol intake.

### **Observational Studies vs. Clinical Trials**

To really understand the egg-heart connection, we need to discuss the different types of nutrition research available.

On the one hand, you've got observational studies. These look at large groups of people and try to find links between specific foods or nutrients and health outcomes.

The problem with observational studies is that they can't prove cause and effect. Just because egg-eaters have a higher risk of heart disease doesn't necessarily mean that eggs are to blame.

On the other hand, you've got clinical trials. In these meticulously designed studies, participants are randomly sorted into varied dietary factions, and their well-being is monitored over time.

In nutrition research, clinical trials reign supreme due to their ability to definitively demonstrate causality. And when it comes to eggs and heart health, the clinical trial evidence is pretty reassuring.

![certified humane organic eggs](https://drberg-dam.imgix.net/others/basket-chicken-eggs-on-wooden-table.jpg?w=992&auto=compress,format)

## **Heart-Healthy Choices** 

When comparing brown [eggs to hot dogs](https://www.drberg.com/keto-recipes/eggs-grassfed-hot-dog-and-kaleshake), the health benefits are clear: brown eggs are a rich source of protein, vitamins, and minerals essential for overall health.

Hot dogs often contain high levels of sodium, saturated fats, and preservatives, which can increase the risk of heart disease and other health issues.

Brown eggs provide nutrients like vitamin D, B12, and selenium, supporting immune function, bone health, and metabolism. In contrast, hot dogs are processed meats linked to an increased risk of cancer and cardiovascular disease.

We must make informed choices about what we consume, opting for nutrient-dense foods like brown eggs over processed options like hot dogs to support optimal health.

## Healthy Keto Diet For Healthy Teeth

# Healthy Keto Diet for Healthy Teeth

## **Healthy Keto® Diet: A Delicious Way to Better Oral Health**

[The Heathy Keto® diet](https://www.drberg.com/the-healthy-keto-diet-for-beginners) can be a tasty solution to dental problems. Replacing sugary foods with nutrient-dense alternatives can improve oral health and protect against tooth decay.

### **What Is A Healthy Keto Diet?**

A keto diet is a low-carb, high-fat [](https://www.drberg.com/the-healthy-keto-diet-for-beginners)diet that can help with weight loss, diabetes control, and heart health. Lowering carbs and augmenting healthy fats leads to your body entering a ketogenic state.

A [Healthy Keto diet](https://www.drberg.com/blog/healthy-keto-plan-start-here) emphasizes whole foods like vegetables, lean proteins, and healthy fats such as avocados and olive oil.

### **Benefits Of A Healthy Keto Diet For Your Teeth**

- **Sugar Reduction:** A keto diet is low in sugar, which can help prevent cavities and gum disease. Bacteria in your mouth feed off sugar, producing acids that erode enamel and cause decay.

- **Balancing Your pH:** Limiting carbs can maintain a balanced pH level in your mouth, preventing bacterial growth and promoting healthier teeth and gums.

- **Nutrient-Rich Foods:** A healthy keto diet includes nutrient-rich foods like leafy greens, which provide essential vitamins and minerals for strong teeth and gums.

Switching to a keto lifestyle can be intimidating, yet proper meal planning and new recipes may prove both tasty and satisfying. Plus, the benefits extend beyond your teeth - you may experience increased energy, improved mood, and better concentration.

While natural remedies like clove oil can provide temporary relief, they should not replace regular dental visits and proper hygiene practices. By making mindful food choices, you can dramatically improve your oral health and reduce the need for short-term solutions.

## The Role Of Cortisol In Morning Hunger

# The Role of Cortisol in Morning Hunger

## **The Role of Cortisol in Morning Hunger**

[Cortisol, often called the "stress hormone,"](https://www.drberg.com/blog/cortisol-extremely-simplified-by-dr-berg) plays a significant role in morning hunger while fasting and doing keto. When you wake up, cortisol levels experience a significant spike.

This spike is not just a tiny increase; it's more like a high jump athlete clearing the bar. The reason this matters is that when cortisol levels rise, it also leads to an increase in glucose (sugar) levels in the body.

This rise in blood sugar is the body's way of ensuring that you have enough energy to start your day.

However, for individuals [following a ketogenic diet](https://www.drberg.com/blog/how-to-start-keto-correctly) or [practicing intermittent fasting](https://www.drberg.com/blog/my-1-best-intermittent-fasting-tips-for-faster-weight-loss-dr-berg), this increase in blood sugar can also trigger the brain to signal hunger, even if you're not hungry.

Grasping the intricate interplay of hormones is vital for those tackling unwelcome morning cravings as they commit to their nutritional objectives.

So, the next time you feel your stomach growling before breakfast while on keto or during a fasting period, remember that cortisol may be playing a role in your morning routine.

## The Sugar Industrys Influence On Dietary Guidelines

# The Sugar Industry's Influence on Dietary Guidelines

## **The Sugar Industry's Influence on Dietary Guidelines**

Did you know the sugar industry holds significant sway over our dietary guidelines? They make up only 2% of farms but account for a third of all donations from US agriculture.

It's like David throwing stones at Goliath, except this time, David has a serious sweet tooth.

### **Unveiling the Power of Lobbyists**

Sugar lobbyists have mastered the art of influence to shape dietary recommendations. Just imagine them as puppeteers controlling how we perceive and consume sugar in our diets.

Their tactics are subtle yet effective, like adding just enough sugar to your coffee without making it overly sweet.

Their power extends far beyond merely advocating for their interests. They're also skilled in altering perceptions about food pyramid recommendations—twisting scientific facts into knots that even Houdini would struggle with.

### **Discrediting Anti-Sugar Research**

Besides shaping guidelines, these clever folks are adept at undermining research suggesting harm from high-sugar consumption—it’s as if they've turned deflecting criticism into an Olympic sport.

In their world, science isn't always black or white; it's often coated with a layer of sugary deception.

As cunning as foxes sneaking through henhouses under the moonlight, they work tirelessly to discredit any evidence that paints sugar in less than glowing terms.

## **The Surprising Truth About Obesity and Metabolism**

Contrary to commonly assumed, not all obese people have a [slow metabolism](https://www.drberg.com/blog/how-to-fix-a-slow-metabolism); research has revealed that approximately 20% maintain regular metabolic rates. Studies show that around 20% of obese individuals carry standard metabolic rates.

### **Obesity Doesn't Always Mean Poor Metabolism**

You may be astounded to find out that some people classified as overweight have normal metabolisms.

They defy the stereotype of [obesity](https://www.drberg.com/blog/the-answer-to-obesity-is-obvious-if-you-look-at-the-statistics), leading inevitably to diabetes or heart disease. Just like you can't judge a book by its cover, you can't predict an individual's health based on weight alone.

Despite carrying extra pounds, they avoid the common trap of developing insulin resistance - a critical factor in metabolic syndrome and related conditions such as [type 2 diabetes](https://www.drberg.com/blog/what-to-eat-to-correct-diabetes) and cardiovascular diseases.

This group is often called "metabolically healthy obese" (MHO), but don't be misled – it doesn't imply obesity is good for health.

However, don't let this term fool you – it does not mean obesity is healthy. It merely means these individuals appear resilient against the usual detrimental effects of excess body fat.

[Research suggests](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22804876), though somewhat controversially due to conflicting findings from various studies, about one-fifth of those who are clinically defined as 'obese' actually fall into this MHO category.

This throws up fascinating questions for scientists looking at how we approach dieting strategies and overall health promotion.

![Image](https://drberg-dam.imgix.net/video-thumbnails/9072f64e-bd4c-43d5-9cb0-e9ea4a3230f1.jpg?w=992&auto=compress,format)

## **The World Health Organization's Stance on Sugar Consumption**

The World Health Organization (WHO) has a clear-cut guideline regarding the daily sugar intake. According to them, your sweet tooth should be limited to 12 teaspoons of added sugar daily.

It's easy to see how quickly we can surpass the WHO recommendation of no more than 12 teaspoons of added sugar per day when one soda contains nearly that amount. And what happens if we do?

Things start getting sticky – not in the fun caramel way.

### **The Not-So-Sweet Consequences**

High consumption may lead to numerous health issues, including diabetes and heart disease. It's almost as if consuming too much sugar is akin to inviting unwanted guests into our bodies - they're hard to get rid of once they've made themselves comfortable.

In other words, while enjoying sweets now and then won't cause any harm, consistent overconsumption could turn life sour fast.

## The Role Of Keto In Stye Prevention

# The Role of Keto in Stye Prevention

It might come as a shock that what you eat could affect your ocular health, even for styes. Yes, even those pesky styles. A ketogenic diet, focusing on healthy fats and reduced carbohydrates, may be an effective way to improve eye health.

Firstly, it's crucial to understand how this works. A [keto diet](https://www.drberg.com/blog/keto-diet-for-beginners) may help regulate insulin levels. Insulin resistance is often linked with immune system impairment, which we know plays a role in stye formation. [Research](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2903931) supports this theory.

Besides managing insulin levels, the ketogenic diet also boosts the intake of essential nutrients like vitamins A and D and zinc – all critical for maintaining good eye health.

These micronutrients are essential for properly functioning our mucous membranes, including those in our eyes.

A word of caution, though - while going keto might sound tempting as a potential way to prevent styes, always remember: moderation is key. Overdoing anything isn't beneficial; balance remains paramount regarding nutrition.

## What Strategies Can I Employ To Enhance My Sleep Quality While Simulta 65D2Cb

# What strategies can I employ to enhance my sleep quality while simultaneously ensuring optimal nourishment for my cells?

When someone has some type of defect in their genes, and everyone does have some defects and mutations to their genes, and there's some great DNA testing that you can do, you'll see more of this as time goes on. It doesn't mean that those genes will always be expressed, because they're not the controlling factor. You have epigenetics, which is above your genes. So it's lifestyle. It's when you eat. It's what you eat. It's the stress level, all these other things. But what you're trying to do, which is smart, is trying to do fasting. And it's been hard, so you have to snack.

First of all, you need to start including the apple cider vinegar with water with your meals, and maybe even before you go to bed, because that's one of the best things to regulate your blood sugars. Even if someone does a high-carb diet, if they consume that apple cider vinegar with water, their blood sugars will be better, even if you have something called the dawn phenomenon in the morning, where your blood sugars are high.

The other thing is to look back at my videos on your meal and compare it to what I recommend to what you're doing. You might need more fat with the meal. Because if you're truly in ketosis, to be able to get the benefits, you need to go. You should lose your appetite, so you should not be hungry at all, and you should feel good, and everything should be fine. So the fasting for your condition is so vitally important, because that way all these cool things will happen when you start fasting to your blood like normalization of all sorts of things.

You may also need to add a little bit of salt and water in the evening and drink that. That does help sleep, especially if you have what you have. And there's other remedies, too, like vitamin D3 before bed and zinc before bed. These are all just natural things that I would do versus snacking.

## Which Type Of Carbohydrate Is Most Effective At Lowering Cholesterol L B8Accb

# Which type of carbohydrate is most effective at lowering cholesterol levels, and how does it contribute to improved cardiovascular health?

In some cases, it’s not a problem if cholesterol is a little bit higher. This can happen when you first start the keto diet because you’re mobilizing cholesterol from the fat cells. But what can you do if you need to lower bad cholesterol naturally? There is one specific food that can really help you.

Your body makes cholesterol. Excess cholesterol is eliminated through the bile ducts with the help of bile salts. Bile salts have a lot of important roles in the body.

Typically, carbohydrates will increase cholesterol and triglycerides. There are three types of carbohydrates: sugar, starches, and fiber. Fiber can actually help reduce your cholesterol, but it has to be the right type of fiber. We’re talking about the fiber in vegetables.

Vegetables have low amounts of sugar and high amounts of fiber. They’re also rich in nutrients, phytonutrients, vitamins, and minerals.

Fiber helps bind with cholesterol and modify the absorption of lipids and fats. It also increases the production of bile and eliminates bile connected to cholesterol.Fiber has zero effect on blood sugar and insulin, which will help lower your cholesterol. Feeding your microbes fiber also decreases the production of cholesterol.

If you have high cholesterol, consume more vegetables to help increase the release of bile and feed the microbes. At the same time, be sure to avoid sugar and starch in your diet.

## Can Alcohol Induced Gastrointestinal Damage Be Corrected With Keto And If

# Can alcohol-induced gastrointestinal damage be corrected with keto and IF?

To a large degree it can. But I think you're going to need some additional things to help correct it. If you do the healthy version of keto and you include more probiotics, and get a nice diversified group of microbes living in your intestine testes that can actually help fortify and help build up the mucus layer that's needed in the GI tract. That mucus layer is really what's missing with so many people and their health problems. And that mucus layer is generated by eating healthy and having enough microbes and making sure they're doing their job. When you lose the mucus layer, you lose your immune system because then you have less of a buffer for these pathogens to invade. And then you start getting autoimmune diseases and inflammatory diseases. That mucus layer is going to be really key to maintain your health and you can have a good start by doing the healthy keto.

## How To Break A Prolonged Fast  Refeeding

# How to Break a Prolonged Fast & Refeeding

**Understanding Refeeding Syndrome After Prolonged Fasting**

Prolonged fasting (4-7+ days) carries the risk of refeeding syndrome, a rare but potentially serious condition. This occurs when your body rapidly shifts nutrients from the bloodstream into cells, especially if you were already nutrient deficient before the fast.

**Why It Happens:** Pre-existing nutrient deficiencies worsen during a fast. When you suddenly reintroduce food, your body can experience dangerous imbalances. People with known vitamin deficiencies should avoid prolonged fasting.

**Prevention is Key:** During a prolonged fast, it's crucial to supplement with vitamins, electrolytes, and sea salt. This helps maintain balance and won't break your fast.

**Breaking Your Fast Safely:** Ease back into eating slowly with keto-friendly foods. Avoid carbohydrates, sugars, and non-keto foods, as they can worsen nutrient depletion. Start with small portions and gradually increase as your body adjusts.

**Important:** If you have any underlying health conditions, always consult your doctor before starting a prolonged fast.

## The Biggest Research Study Scam

# The Biggest Research Study Scam

**Understanding Research Manipulation and the Importance of Critical Evaluation**

Dr. Westman, an M.D. and Master's-level statistician, highlights how data in research studies can be manipulated to present misleading information. He emphasizes the crucial distinction between absolute risk and relative risk and how this difference can be exploited.

**The Limitations of Observational Studies**

Dr. Westman points out that observational studies often cannot prove causation. He cites examples like recent headlines demonizing red meat and fasting, which frequently stem from self-reported observational studies with unreliable dietary recall data.

While observational studies cannot establish definitive cause-and-effect relationships, they serve a purpose as "hypothesis-generating studies," providing a potential starting point for more rigorous experimental research.

**Case Study: The Stanford Twin Experiment**

Dr. Westman discusses the Stanford twin experiment, a study with flaws and funding from a plant-based interest group, as a recent example of potentially misleading research.

**Nutritional Epidemiology and its Weaknesses**

Harvard University's School of Public Health conducts research based on observational studies linking dietary elements to health outcomes. Dr. Westman cautions that nutritional epidemiology often only reveals weak associations and shouldn't be treated as definitive fact.

**Dr. Westman's Approach**

Dr. Westman's clinic uses a low-carb keto diet to successfully treat numerous chronic health conditions, including diabetes, obesity, heartburn, and IBS. He focuses on both treating and educating patients, offering online courses on health topics through his Adapt Your Life Academy.

**Disclaimer: It's important to critically evaluate all health-related information and consult with qualified medical professionals when making decisions about your health.**

## What Could Be Causing My Acne After Starting The Ketogenic Diet

# What could be causing my acne after starting the ketogenic diet?

Acne development after initiating a ketogenic diet may indicate that the version of keto you're following is not optimal or that you might be lacking certain essential nutrients. Generally, when adhering to a well-balanced and nutritious ketogenic diet, individuals often see an improvement in skin condition, including a reduction in acne.

One crucial nutrient for preventing acne is vitamin A. The synthetic version of vitamin A, such as Accutane, is used in severe cases, but it is advisable to focus on natural sources instead. Foods rich in retinol, such as egg yolks, liver, and butter, as well as certain dairy products like cheese, can significantly contribute to your vitamin A intake. It's important to note that the form of vitamin A found in animal products is more effective for skin health than the provitamin A found in plant sources. If acne persists, it may be beneficial to consult a healthcare professional for personalized recommendations.

## Can I Follow The Keto Diet If Im Prone To Kidney Stones

# Can I follow the keto diet if I’m prone to kidney stones?

Number one, you have to keep your fluids a little higher because you're gonna lose a lot of fluid on the ketogenic diet, right? So we want to keep the fluids to at least two and a half liters of fluid a day, and then you'll be good.

The most common type of kidney stone is the oxalate version, and so making sure that your urine is acidic would be a smart thing, okay? Because when you become too alkaline, that's when you can start developing more stones. But if you have a uric acid stone, you want to do the opposite, and you want to alkalize the body.

And then one last point. Make sure that you avoid spinach, almonds, chocolate, because they're very high in oxalates.

## Which Vitamin Is Most Effective For Promoting Healthy Skin And How Doe A8E9C4

# Which vitamin is most effective for promoting healthy skin, and how does it contribute to skin health and appearance?

**If you are deficient in vitamin B3, you can end up with pellagra. However, there’s also a subclinical version of this B3 deficiency. This is a situation where you have dermatitis—dry, brittle, scaly, and red skin.**

**Vitamin B3 helps protect and restore your DNA, which results in your skin feeling and looking vibrant and healthy.**

Studies show that those with pellagra see amazing results when taking vitamin B3. Those with pellagra often consume too much corn, flour, rice, and alcohol. To fix this problem, people started adding synthetic vitamin B3 to enhance these foods. The problem is, synthetic vitamins don’t have the same effects as natural ones.

**A healthy keto diet and intermittent fasting eliminate this problem. You should know that the best form of vitamin B3 is niacinamide.**

**Vitamin B3 can also help with:**

• Brown spots

• Skin cancer

• Anti-aging

• Decreased acne

## Should People On The Carnivore Diet Worry About Ketoacidosis Elevated  0De81C

# Should people on the carnivore diet worry about ketoacidosis, elevated ammonia, or elevated urea?

Well, you're not just eating all the protein to your eating a lot of fat. Okay, so you're eating fat which actually kind of offsets that and our bodies have an incredible ability to adapt to different diets. So some people have an issue.

Some people don't but the benefits of doing that, especially if you have gut inflammation, you just pretty much you're creating a healing response to your gut because in that situation your system is compromised where you can't tolerate these fibers or legumes or or anything other than some protein and so and fat. It seems to work, but I would recommend not just doing muscle protein. I would also recommend doing like the eggs, the fish, things like that.

But it's something to test the waters and then see how you do. Do I recommend it long term? It really depends on the severity of damage. But once your gut heals, maybe you want to start introducing things like sauerkraut or fermented vegetables in smaller amounts and gradually increase it after that.

## What Does The Presence Of Belly Fat Indicate About An Individuals Heal 9Debf4

# What does the presence of belly fat indicate about an individual's health, and what factors contribute to its accumulation?

[See Video/Image/Document](https://hls-player.drberg.com/asset?path=migrated-assets/belly-fat-is-merely-a-symptom)

**For you to have a big belly, you first have to have a fatty liver.**  The liver becomes fatty due to consuming too many carbs, which turn to fat in the liver and around the organs. Eventually, the fat from the liver will spill over into other organs. All of this comes from a high-carb diet as well as frequent eating. 

In many cases, people don't associate their belly fat with any other health problems. At least, initially. They may not even see a high blood sugar problem for a few decades. This is because insulin is taking care of the blood sugar levels. But, doctors don't typically test insulin levels, so they won't see that your insulin is too high and is leading to a blood sugar problem. 

**You probably won't know you have a fatty liver.** You'll just see that you have a large belly. But, as the years go on, you can develop diabetes.  The deeper cause of insulin resistance is really a fatty liver. The liver can't function right, and everything starts backing up. But, a high-carb diet is what's really behind all of this. 

**Other symptoms of high blood sugar and high insulin:**

• Frequent urination 

• Fatigue 

• Sleep apnea 

• A weakened immune system 

• Arthritis 

• Cravings 

• Metabolic syndrome (high blood pressure, heart disease, fatty liver diabetes type 2) 

All of these things, plus the belly fat, are coming from the same things: a high carb diet, high blood glucose, and high insulin. But, the good news is that the Healthy Keto diet and intermittent fasting may help.

## What Strategies Or Practices Are Most Effective For Enhancing Learning 74977C

# What strategies or practices are most effective for enhancing learning and cognitive performance?

**It all starts with the hippocampus.** Your hippocampus is the structure in your brain that has to do with learning and spatial memory. The omega-3 fatty acid called DHA makes up 20% of your brain’s grey matter (including your hippocampus).

**DHA also helps…**

• Support your retina

• Lower oxidative stress/acts as an antioxidant

• Reduce inflammation

• Increase BDNF (this helps your brain grow)

• Boost the volume of the hippocampus

As you age, the structure of your hippocampus shrinks. In turn, this can affect your ability to learn and maintain spatial memory. If you’re DHA deficient, your hippocampus will get even smaller. Taking omega-3 fatty acids can greatly benefit the hippocampus and improve your ability to learn. DHA is involved with the synapses—these allow communication between neurons. Low levels of DHA can even cause ADHD and dyslexia. The brain and retinas depend on DHA.

**If an infant is not breastfed, the makeup of their retina may be abnormal due to low levels of DHA. In fact, DHA can even influence a child’s IQ.**

**The best sources of DHA are:**

• Fatty fish

• Cod liver oil

• Algae

## What Are The Most Effective Methods For Detoxifying The Kidneys From E Ad65Ea

# What are the most effective methods for detoxifying the kidneys from elevated levels of uric acid and oxalates, while also preventing their accumulation?

The kidneys can take a beating and can even regenerate. They are composed of roughly one million tiny filters, which filter your blood. But as you age, you start losing these filters—so it becomes even more important to start eating better and decrease exposure to toxins. The two worst things for your kidneys are sugar and oxalates. It’s crucial to stop consuming sugar and high-carb foods and to start limiting your exposure to high-oxalate foods.

However, consuming cheese or dairy with foods that are high in oxalates, but are otherwise healthy, can help counter kidney damage from oxalates.

The best ways to protect your kidneys:

1\. Consume lemon water every morning

2\. Consume apple cider vinegar mixed in water

3\. Consume 2.5 liters of water a day

4\. Avoid high-oxalate foods or add dairy to high-oxalate foods

5\. Get on the Healthy Keto® diet and do intermittent fasting

6\. Avoid fructose

7\. Avoid consuming high levels of vitamin C

8\. Consume potassium (not for end-stage kidney disease)

9\. Consume plant foods and microgreens

## What Supplements Does Dr. Berg Recommend Taking While On The Healthy K B53E6E

# What supplements does Dr. Berg recommend taking while on the healthy Ketogenic Diet?

Dr. Berg recommends several supplements to take while on the ketogenic diet for optimal health and functionality. Here are some of them:

**1\. Magnesium:** Many people, even those who are not on the ketogenic diet, struggle with magnesium deficiency due to poor dietary choices and even certain medications that can deplete the body’s supply of magnesium. Ideally, keto dieters should make sure they are getting at least 200–400 mg of magnesium each day.

**2\. Omega-3 Fatty Acids:** Omega-3s can reduce inflammation, improve brain health, and decrease a person’s risk of heart disease, making them a very valuable item to have in your high-fat diet, either eaten as food or as a supplement.

**3\. Vitamin B5:** This vitamin is important for the conversion from sugar to fat burning; it helps in keto-adaptation and prevents ketogenic fatigue, flu, and rash.

**4\. Vitamin A:** This vitamin improves insulin resistance.

**5\. Vitamin D:** This vitamin also improves insulin resistance.

**6\. Choline:** This nutrient helps a fatty liver.

**7\. Minerals:** First up are the major minerals: potassium, magnesium, sodium, and calcium. These four are what are called electrolytes—electrically charged minerals that maintain fluid throughout your body. Trace minerals such as iron, manganese, and copper are also beneficial when you’re on a keto diet. Remember to consult with a healthcare professional before starting any new supplement regimen.

## What Steps Can I Take To Address Elevated Alkaline Phosphatase Levels

# What steps can I take to address elevated alkaline phosphatase levels?

So one thing about the liver is it really doesn't give you any symptoms until later. It's kind of good that this showed up just so you can start working on your liver. The liver is the only organ that can completely 100% rejuvenate. It's rough, it's rugged. **So I would start taking milk thistle right away. That's one thing. And TUDCA, which will help to thin the bile because that liver enzyme is usually involved with a backup of more of the bile ducts and that which the Tudka is a natural way of thinning the bile, but then the milk thistle will actually protect the liver and bring down those enzymes.** And then of course, I'm assuming you're doing the healthy version of ketogenic diet with intermittent fasting. Hopefully you are and you can.

If you get on a ketogenic diet, you're going to find your liver enzymes probably will be much, much better in a couple of months because reducing the carbs is going to take a big stress off the inflammation in the liver. And one thing that's cool, if you do have any fat in the liver, which I don't know if you do, you have to do an ultrasound for that. You'll find that within even two weeks, you can reduce like 50% of the fat off the liver if you do the ketogenic diet correctly.

**There's a lot of things you can do for the liver, but I would stick with the TUDCA, the milk thistle, and I would do low carb and then get it retested. I think that enzyme will come down, but there's not a lot of things you can do medically to reverse liver disease because everything is involving toxicity. So really the natural way is the best way to approach this. And a lot of the foods that are good for the liver are like the persimmons, vegetables, microgreens, sprouts, and healthy proteins like eggs and things like that too. Eggs are really good for the liver. And so is grass-fed beef. That's really good for the liver too because it has the choline, which will protect the liver. Those are the things that I would suggest. And I think that can turn things around for you.**

Now, because the uricidal does water down the bile, should I stop that and just take the TUDCA? That's a really good question that I can't tell you not to take it, but I would just research the side effects from that and then research TUDCA. And then you make up your own mind based on the data because I think you'll be pleasantly surprised if you look at the wider viewpoint on this and side effects and benefits.

## Im Experiencing A Hair Loss On Frequent Fasting What Can I Do

# I'm experiencing a hair loss on frequent fasting, what can I do?

Hair loss during frequent or prolonged fasting can sometimes be caused by a lack of essential nutrients. Before starting a fast, it's important to build strong nutritional reserves, just like building muscle for exercise. To ease into fasting, start with a healthy keto diet and intermittent fasting with three meals a day. As your body adjusts, gradually skip meals until you reach one meal a day. Extend fasts slowly and carefully. The key is to listen to your body and progress at a comfortable pace.

**Supplement:**

- **Amino Acids (Dr. Minkoff Brand)**\-For healthy hair growth, your body relies on a steady supply of protein's building blocks, called amino acids. Diets lacking sufficient protein can disrupt this process and lead to hair growth problems.

- **Trace Minerals** -While a wide range of trace minerals impact hair health, iron, zinc, copper, silicon, and selenium play particularly vital roles in supporting hair follicle function and hair growth.

- **B-Vitamins** - are essential for hair growth because they support two key factors: healthy cell replication (which hair follicles rely on for rapid growth) and strong blood circulation to the scalp (which delivers vital nutrients to the hair follicles).

- **Whole Food Multivitamin** -Gives your body the nutrient reserves it needs to help prevent hair loss during periodic and prolonged fasting.

Dr. Berg Nutritionals staff, including Dr. Berg Advisors, do *not* encourage prolonged fasting. We are not healthcare professionals equipped with the tests and facilities to perform the necessary monitoring during a prolonged fast, nor do we have an individual's medical health records. Dr. Berg Advisors provides this document based on Dr. Berg's education for informational purposes only to those already on a prolonged fast or independently choosing to do one.

**Always consult with your healthcare provider before starting a prolonged fast.  If you're considering prolonged fasting, discussing the benefits and risks with your healthcare provider is essential.**

[Dr. Berg's Guidelines for Prolonged Fasting.docx](https://realdrberg-my.sharepoint.com/:w:/g/personal/shawnh_drberg_com/EazcZ9dNJ6VDhEOO13hV0F8BnVvc-Ge6y2mYjpN-FnojYg?e=RHdisz&clickparams=eyJBcHBOYW1lIjoiVGVhbXMtRGVza3RvcCIsIkFwcFZlcnNpb24iOiI1MC8yNDAzMzEwMTgxNyIsIkhhc0ZlZGVyYXRlZFVzZXIiOmZhbHNlfQ%3D%3D).

## What Should You Consume In The First Trimester If Youre Dealing With N Cdabe9

# What should you consume in the first trimester if you’re dealing with nausea and food aversions?

The most important thing is the diet. I would be careful about doing the rice.

I would go back to what I recommend is the basic keto plan and find out maybe instead of doing heavy fatty foods you do. You do like maybe less fatty foods, but you definitely need animal source nutrients for the best bioavailable source of amino acids and nutrition, because this is the time where that that baby is being fortified and developing. And so you don't want to have any deficiencies.

*\*Anything I say is not meant to diagnose or replace your medical care check with a doctor before implementing any of these suggestions.*

## You Best Strategy Against Cancer

# You Best Strategy Against Cancer

**Understanding Cancer and the Potential Benefits of Fasting**

**Key Differences Between Normal and Cancer Cells**

- **Origin:** Cancer cells develop from mutated normal cells.

- **Mitochondrial Damage:** Damage to cellular powerhouses (mitochondria) can trigger the transformation from normal to cancerous.

- **Fuel Preference:** Cancer thrives on sugar, while normal cells have more flexibility.

- **Lifespan:** Cancer cells can replicate indefinitely, unlike normal cells.

- **Growth Rate:** Cancer cells multiply much faster than normal cells.

**How Fasting May Combat Cancer: Key Mechanisms**

- **Mechanism 1: Fuel Starvation:** Fasting reduces glucose, the primary energy source for cancer cells.

- **Mechanism 2: Amino Acid Deprivation:** Fasting limits glutamine and arginine, alternative fuel sources for some cancers.

- **Mechanism 3: Autophagy:** Fasting triggers cellular cleanup, potentially shrinking tumors and hindering cancer growth.

- **Mechanism 4: Immune Boost:** Fasting strengthens your cancer-fighting immune system.

- **Mechanism 5: Hormone Reduction:** Fasting lowers IGF-1 (problematic in existing cancer), insulin, and estrogen, which may fuel cancer risk.

- **Mechanism 6: Inflammation Control:** Fasting helps reduce inflammation, a factor in cancer development.

- **Mechanism 7: Ketone Impact:** More research is needed, but some natural inhibitors (alpha-lipoic acid, garcinia, etc.) may block a process that benefits cancer cells.

**Fasting Protocols: Prevention vs. Active Cancer**

- **Prevention:** Aim for 16-hour fasts with an 8-hour eating window, plus a low-carb diet.

- **Active Cancer:** Consider 18-20 hour fasts, 48-hour fasts weekly, or extended fasts under medical supervision. Prioritize cruciferous vegetables, healthy proteins, and fats.

**Important Note:** Always consult your doctor before starting any fasting regimen, especially if you have cancer. This information is for educational purposes and not a substitute for medical advice.

## What Are The Health Benefits And Physiological Roles Of Vitamin B2 Rib E32B46

# What are the health benefits and physiological roles of Vitamin B2 (riboflavin), and how does it support overall bodily functions?

Vitamin B2 is called riboflavin. A keto rash is caused by a vitamin B2 deficiency. B2 is involved in fat metabolism, and the more fat that you eat, the more B2 you are going to need.

If you start the ketogenic diet with a vitamin B2 deficiency or even a subclinical vitamin B2 deficiency, the problems related to the deficiency will be magnified.

**Benefits**

- Can stimulate collagen type 1

- Helps break down proteins, fats, and carbohydrates

- Regulates thyroid activity

- Plays a vital role in maintaining the body’s energy supply

- Is involved in fat metabolism

**Symptoms of deficiency**

- Painful red tongue

- Chapped lips

- Cracked heels

- Bloodshot eyes

- High histamines

- Migraine headaches

- Myopia

- Anal fissures

- Seborrheic dermatitis—rough and scaly skin

- Cracked skin (on your heels, around your mouth, around your nose)

- Peripheral neuropathy

- Weak limbs

- Skin lesions or problems

- A swollen mouth or tongue (or red tongue)

- A breakdown of the nervous system

- Oily skin (especially around the nose)

- Hearing loss

**Causes of deficiency**

- Low hydrochloric acid

- heartburn

- GERD

- gas

- pain in the stomach after consuming protein

- Tanning beds

## What Kind Of Diet Would You Recommend If I Have Psoriasis

# What kind of diet would you recommend if I have psoriasis?

For managing psoriasis, focus on:

1\. **L-Glutamine**: Strengthens the gut lining and supports gut health. Start with 1 gram daily, gradually increasing to 10 grams split into three doses on an empty stomach.

2\. **Tamanu oil**: Apply topically for its antibacterial and skin-healing properties.

3\. **Vitamin D3 and K2**: Take 10,000 IU of D3 and 100 mcg of K2 (MK7) daily to support immune function and skin health.

Avoid inflammatory vegetable oils and consider adopting a healthy keto diet with intermittent fasting to reduce inflammation and support your immune system. Periodic prolonged fasting may also help alleviate symptoms over time.

## Is It Ok To Take Testosterone

# Is it ok to take testosterone?

When considering testosterone supplementation, it's crucial to understand potential side effects, including worsened sleep apnea, mood swings, acne, and increased cardiovascular risk. Other effects may include reduced fertility, blood thickening, testicular atrophy, and erectile dysfunction.

Before starting testosterone supplements, identifying the underlying causes of low testosterone is essential. Factors such as aging, insulin resistance, low zinc or protein intake, a low-fat diet, statin use, high soy consumption, and deficiencies in vitamins A or D should be addressed.

Boosting testosterone naturally involves strategies like weight training, increasing zinc and vitamin D intake, prioritizing healthy fats over carbohydrates, using DHEA supplements, improving REM sleep, managing weight through a ketogenic diet and intermittent fasting, and ensuring adequate protein intake. These methods support natural hormone production and overall health without the potential risks associated with exogenous testosterone.

## Does Brain Need To Adapt To Ketosis Too

# Does brain need to adapt to ketosis too?

**The brain has the capacity to run on ketones immediately. It even prefers ketones as its fuel source.** 

• 1/3 of the brain will always run on glucose, but 2/3 of the brain runs on ketones. 

• 23% of all the energy that is generated is used by the brain. 

**Sources of ketones:**

1\. Endogenous ketones – Meaning the body can make them if you lower your carbohydrates.

2\. Exogenous ketones – Meaning ketones outside of the body like ketone salts and MCT oil. 

Your blood ketone level is what determines how many ketones are in the brain—this level should be high. Your blood ketone level is determined by your insulin and glucose levels. Your insulin levels should be on the low side of the normal range, and your glucose levels need to be low. 

The more ketones you have in the blood, the better and faster the brain will be able to use them. The brain does not need time to keto adapt. Still, you can assist this process and prevent brain fog or keto fatigue by taking ketones or MCT oil. 

Another situation where it would be a good idea to start taking exogenous ketones is if you need to improve brain function or improve memory. For example, in cases where you have memory problems or even Alzheimer’s. 

**Parts of the brain that use ketones:**

1\. Cerebral Cortex 

2\. Hypothalamus 

3\. Pituitary Gland 

4\. Pineal Gland

## What Is Copd

# What is COPD?

COPD, also known as emphysema, presents with symptoms like breathlessness, coughing, and mucus production. It can lead to pulmonary hypertension, stressing the heart's right ventricle and causing edema.

Strategies for managing COPD based on research include:

1\. Tocotrienols: 300 mg daily for potential lung support

2\. Vitamin D: 40,000 IUs to boost immunity and reduce inflammation.

3\. Fasting and keto diet: May help manage inflammation and improve overall health.

4\. Vitamin C: Supports immune function and reduces oxidative stress.

5\. Osha root and Mormon tea: Traditional remedies for respiratory health.

**6\. Vitamin B1: Important for energy and nerve function.**

**7\. Stop smoking: Essential to prevent further lung damage from smoke and nicotine.**

**These methods aim to alleviate symptoms, support lung function, and potentially slow COPD progression.**

## What Can Help Me To Stop Snacking Or Grazing

# What can help me to stop snacking or grazing?

With snacking, you may have a certain time that you have a snack. With grazing, there’s no limit on how much you eat, what you eat, or when you eat. You eat constantly. I believe some of the worst advice a person can give is to snack to prevent overeating.

When people start snacking and grazing, they can get into a cycle of raising their blood sugar and insulin, then dropping their blood sugar. Eating causes hunger about one and a half hours later, especially when consuming carbohydrates. Then, the process repeats. If someone is stuck in this snacking cycle, eventually, they could develop high insulin, which could then lead to insulin resistance.

**Eating and depression:** You might feel better temporarily, but then the high insulin could cause depression to worsen.

**Eating when tired:** The more you eat to try to get more energy, the more tired you’ll be.

**Eating when bored or stressed:** The more you eat when bored or stressed, the more you release cortisol, which could cause you to be more stressed.

**Eating carbs for pleasure:** You could spike dopamine, putting yourself at risk for developing dopamine resistance.

**Eating for no reason:** Some people eat because the food is there, and then they get stuck in the snacking trap.

Many people don’t realize that when they do fasting correctly, they can put the body in a condition where there is no hunger or cravings. This is because your body is essentially eating your own fat all day long. Fat generates ketones, which is a clean fuel. You’ll feel good, you could have improved cognitive function, and you could have an enhanced mood.

**What to do:**

1\. Do not eat breakfast (most important)

2\. Understand that eating causes hunger

3\. Do not make junk foods available

4\. Stay very active

5\. Avoid carbs when you eat

## How Can I Help A Friend To Lose Weight

# How can I help a friend to lose weight?

The #1 thing to do is help educate them about these problems. I’m going to talk about these issues in detail. Take a look. 

**1\. Cutting Calories** 

The most common mistake people make with weight loss is cutting calories. It is true that you want to reduce the frequency of meals, but you don’t want to lower your calories. Calorie reductions can cause:

• Slow metabolism

• Constant hunger

• Nutrient deficiencies. 

**2\. Low Fat**

You need healthy fats in your diet. Many people try to cut back on fats like butter and animal fat, but this is a mistake. Low-fat protein is actually much higher on the glycemic index. What this means is that it will cause your insulin to spike. The more their food choices trigger insulin, the less weight they’re going to lose. Keep in mind that fat has the least effect on insulin.

**3\. High Carbs** 

In the presence of too much insulin, you cannot lose fat. Insulin is a fat-storing hormone. Carbs are very high on the glycemic index. If you are eating carbs, you don’t be able to lose weight, you will have frequent cravings, and you will likely gain even more weight. Cut out the carbs by going on a healthy keto diet.

**4\. Monitoring Steps + Drinking Lots of Water**

This happens a lot with people who try to lose weight. They count steps, hit the treadmill or stationary bike, and drink lots of water, but they still don’t see significant results. Why? Because these things are only effective if you first work on the diet. In fact, exercise only makes up about 15% of weight loss results. Put more energy into your diet, and you’ll see far more results. 

**5\. Weighing Daily**

As you’ve probably heard me say before, get healthy to lose weight—don’t lose weight to get healthy. If you put too much of your attention on losing weight, you’re doing things backward. The main thing you can do to get healthy is to work on fixing insulin resistance with healthy keto and intermittent fasting. This can take time, so be patient. 

**6\. Six Small Meals Per Day** 

Every time you eat, you trigger insulin. If you consume 6 small meals every day, you are spiking your insulin over and over. This makes weight loss very difficult. Instead, do intermittent fasting. This will help fight off cravings, fix insulin resistance, and burn fat. 

Educate your friends and family on these points. This will give them the basics to help them lose weight.

## How Can I Visualize My Plate Instead Of Counting Macros

# How can I visualize my plate instead of counting macros?

The three macronutrients are proteins, fats, and carbohydrates. Most foods are not 100% one macro—they often contain multiple macros.

Let’s start breaking down your meal plate.

**You want the majority of your carbohydrates to come from vegetables.** The average person needs at least 7 cups/servings of vegetables every day. One cup of vegetables is roughly a fist full of salad. If you’re consuming more dense vegetables—broccoli, cauliflower, bell peppers, carrots—then you only need about 3.5 cups/servings per day. You can also include a small number of berries in your diet, which count as carbohydrates.

**Olives, hummus, and avocados are a combination of carbohydrates and fats**. Fats and proteins are often combined. The fattiest proteins are the best to consume on a healthy keto diet. Avoid all low-fat proteins and do not trim the fat off of full-fat meats.

**3-5 oz of protein per meal is ideal.** For men, this is 1-2 pieces of protein that are about the size of the palm of your hand. For women, about 1 palm worth of protein. This would be similar to 2-4 eggs, one handful of nuts, 2 thumb-sized pieces of cheese, or 1-2 thumb-sized servings of nut butter.

---

## Can I Eat What I Crave

# Can I eat what I crave?

If you’re on keto, you’re probably doing it for health reasons or weight loss. But if you’re not on keto, what motivates you to eat?  **It’s dangerous to ask your body what it’s in the mood for because you’re really asking what’s going on with your blood sugars. If your blood sugars are low, your answer will likely be refined carbohydrates.** 

Some people eat to try to raise their mood. Others eat just because there’s food there. It’s best not to have junk food available in your house because if it’s there, you might be more likely to start eating it without even thinking about it. 

Our bodies have a mechanism to crave sodium foods. We do not have a mechanism to crave potassium foods. Our bodies retain salt, but they cannot really retain potassium. This gets people in trouble because they will ask their body what they’re in the mood for, and they will think they want something salty. They will start consuming a lot of sodium and not potassium, which will alter the correct ratio and can cause fluid retention and even more cravings. 

**What to do:**

• When you eat, start with your vegetables first, and then have your salty protein. 

• Find keto-friendly healthy foods that give you a lot of pleasure.

## Why Do I Have A Sudden And Rapid Weight Gain

# Why do I have a sudden and rapid weight gain?

**Sudden changes in weight have nothing to do with losing or gaining fat. Let's say you start keto, and the next day you are four pounds lighter—this is due to fluid loss, not fat loss.**

As your body stores fat in the form of glycogen, you also store water. For every one gram of fat, your body stores three grams of water. High-carb diets cause you to retain even more water because your levels of stored sodium increase. Those with a lot of fluid retention often see the fluid build up around their feet and ankles.

**The best indicator of success on keto is if your cravings are going away—are you less hungry between meals? If you can't go without food for a few hours, then you know there's a lot of room to improve your diet.**

**The best natural diuretics for getting rid of excess fluids are:**

• Ketones

• Dandelion

• Uva Ursi

• Horsetail

• Celery

• Potassium

## What Factors Contribute To The Ongoing Need For Increased Medication A D4845B

# What factors contribute to the ongoing need for increased medication among individuals with diabetes?

What is diabetes? It’s a disease of high blood sugar, caused by eating a lot of carbohydrates. The purpose of diabetes medication is to lower blood sugar. But — this is key — it lowers only sugar in your blood, not in the rest of your body. The medication crams the sugar into other parts of your body. Usually, the sugar is converted into fat.

Your fat cells get bigger, and they spread to your liver, around your other organs, into the pancreas and your brain. Type 2 diabetes is a diet problem, which is why medication will never fix it. The medication hides the real problem and allows it to continue. Eventually, you’ll need more powerful medications for the health problems that chronic high sugar causes.

Then, you experience side effects, leading you to need more drugs for different conditions, and the chain reaction goes on and on! If this is your first time hearing this concept, and you’re a diabetic, I urge you to go on the ketogenic diet and boost your chances of getting off diabetes medication.

## What Is The Initial Symptom That Typically Indicates The Presence Of G 841378

# What is the initial symptom that typically indicates the presence of gallstones?

Gallstones often present without symptoms in 80% of cases, but symptoms can include pain under the right ribcage and rhomboid, nausea, vomiting, and digestive issues like bloating and belching. The formation of gallstones is linked to high cholesterol and insufficient bile production, which is crucial for cholesterol metabolism. Bile sludge, a precursor to stones, can persist even after gallbladder removal, causing similar symptoms.

Natural approaches to manage gallstones include taking purified bile salts and probiotics, consuming salads, using acupressure, and reducing insulin levels through methods like intermittent fasting and the ketogenic diet.

## What Are The Potential Therapeutic Benefits Of Vitamin E Supplementati 126893

# What are the potential therapeutic benefits of vitamin E supplementation in the context of hepatic health and liver disease management?

There is a condition called NASH (non-alcoholic steatohepatitis), which is basically a fatty liver that has some inflammation. There have been many studies on using vitamin E for NASH.

Vitamin E has demonstrated significant improvement in:

1\. Steatosis (the fatty liver portion)

2\. Inflammation

3\. Ballooning of the liver cells (degeneration)

Essentially, vitamin E may have the power to reduce the fat, inflammation, and the death of the liver cells in adult patients with NASH that don’t have diabetes or cirrhosis. In one study, they used a natural version of only one part of the vitamin E complex. However, it may be beneficial to have the whole complex. They also used 800 IUs of this one part. Other studies have used up to 1000 IUs, while others only used 400 IUs. Between 800 and 1000 IUs may be the best idea.

Vitamin E may help stop the transition of going from having a fatty liver to an inflamed liver. It’s a very powerful antioxidant that may help calm free radicle damage, prevent inflammation, and prevent fibrosis.

Taking vitamin E alone may not change anything very much. But, changing the diet as well may make a more significant difference. The healthy keto diet with intermittent fasting may be the best way to go. Adding vitamin C in a food complex with choline may also be beneficial.

## What Natural Remedies Can Effectively Support The Management Of Erecti 2F2821

# What natural remedies can effectively support the management of erectile dysfunction?

In many cases, people with erectile dysfunction have normal hormone levels. But, they also typically have high blood pressure, obesity, diabetes, or are smokers.

Erectile dysfunction is one of the earliest signs of peripheral artery disease.

**Other symptoms of peripheral artery disease can include:**

• Cold feet

• Painful legs

• Cramping in the lower legs

• Color changes in the lower legs

• Slow healing

• Loss of hair on the lower legs

It’s crucial to fix the root cause of erectile dysfunction by healing the endothelial layer. Getting on the keto diet is one of the best things you can do to start addressing this issue.

In the meantime, several natural remedies for erectile dysfunction can be combined into one simple drink.

**Ingredients:**

• 1 cup of juice from watermelon rinds

• The juice of one medium beet (or two tsp. beet powder with eight oz. of water)

• 1 cup celery juice

**Optional ingredient:**

• Dark, leafy green vegetables

Blend the above ingredients and drink one glass of this remedy every morning for four to six weeks. Nose breathing and exercise may also be beneficial to help with erectile dysfunction. It’s also important to note that viewing porn may lead to porn-induced erectile dysfunction.

## What Can You Do If Youre No Longer Losing Weight While Fasting Postpartum

# What can you do if you’re no longer losing weight while fasting postpartum?

**When you actually go through pregnancy or actually deliver, you have this spike of estrogen that pops up. It interferes with your metabolism. Estrogen does contribute to certain types of fat.**

**I would work on getting into what's called keto adaptation a little bit more to the point where it's easier to do fasting.** That does take weeks, but it's dependent on how many carbs that you eat when you eat. So maybe finding substitutes for those carbs because the problem is that all it takes is a little bit of carbs to knock you out of fat burning for a longer period of time.

**The other thing is adding in twice a week high intensity interval training just to start to stimulate the exercise, but don't do it more than twice a week. But when you do it, like do it really good. In between that, do long walks and then try to get an extra hour of sleep.**

**To make fasting easier, sometimes it's helpful if when you do eat, you just add a little more fat to go longer.** But over time, it's gonna be easier to fast. If you're having any problems fasting for a longer period of time, all that means is that you have to either lower your carbs when you eat or just give it more time and then build up to that.

## What Is A Recipe For Keto Raspberry Peach Tea

# What is a recipe for Keto Raspberry Peach Tea?

This is an amazing keto raspberry peach tea. It has muddled raspberries, mint, and lemon in a nice peach tea.

This fantastic keto-friendly drink is not only tasty—it has some health benefits as well. It has a little bit of collagen in it, and it's great for the skin! To keep it keto-friendly, we don't actually use fresh peaches in this drink. The peach flavor comes from the peach tea. This means that it doesn't have all of the extra sugar that peaches have.

Of course, drinking plenty of water is great! But, drinking only water can get old for some people. With this drink, you can switch things up on occasion with something that's fresh, super tasty, and healthy! This keto drink recipe is very simple and doesn't take long to make, which also makes it perfect for serving when you have company.

## Why Do I Have High Blood Glucose Levels On Keto

# Why do I have high blood glucose levels on Keto?

First, let’s quickly go over insulin resistance. **If a person is insulin resistant, they typically have very high insulin in their body—around 5 to 9x the normal amount.**

Insulin regulates blood sugars by lowering them and keeping them down. Over time, this mechanism weakens and your insulin levels drop. This leads to high blood sugar, prediabetes, and eventually diabetes.

**If you have high blood glucose on keto, you probably had high insulin before you started the keto diet. Once you begin a ketogenic diet and intermittent fasting, your body is no longer spiking insulin. Without high insulin, there is nothing keeping your blood sugars down.**

The good news is that high blood glucose on keto is temporary as your body transitions into ketosis. Your blood sugar will eventually stabilize.

## What Is The Most Critical Supplement For Supporting Optimal Health In  D29685

# What is the most critical supplement for supporting optimal health in individuals managing diabetes?

Benfotiamine is a synthetic B1. Vitamin B1 is naturally water-soluble. Benfotiamine is a fat-soluble B1 vitamin. This is one of the only synthetic vitamins that I like because it has virtually no side-effects.

I believe every diabetic should be taking benfotiamine. Vitamin B1 is involved in the engine in the mitochondria that involves glucose metabolism. The more glucose you have running through the machine, the higher the blood sugar, and the more depleted of vitamin B1 you’re going to become.

With diabetes, there are four main tissues involved, and B1 can help with all of them:

1\. Nerves/brain - Neuropathy 

2\. Eyes - Retina

3\. Kidney - Nephron

4\. Heart vessels - Microvascular endothelial dysfunction

Benfotiamine:

• 3-5x more absorption

• Protects against oxidation and AGEs

• Decreases A1C

• Protection

When it comes to benfotiamine dosage, consider taking at least 600mg of benfotiamine per day, and you can spread it out. You should also be doing healthy keto and intermittent fasting. 

***We recommend consulting with your doctor before making any dietary changes or before you start taking any new supplements, especially if you have any existing health conditions.***

## What Are The Reasons For High Creatine On Keto

# What are the reasons for high creatine on Keto?

First, what is creatinine? It’s a waste product from muscle metabolism. (Side note: a waste product from dietary protein is called urea.) Every day your body converts creatine to creatinine.

**The higher level of creatinine on keto isn’t pathological. Here are the five reasons why they are high:**

1\. Consuming way too much protein, especially cooked meat. Ideally, you want to eat three to six ounces of protein, or as much as seven, at a meal. If you’re a big person perhaps a little more.

2\. Taking too much creatine supplementation; try cutting back

3\. Exercising excessively especially if it’s intense, because of muscle physiology. Cut back and take longer to recover.

4\. Having an injury or inflammatory condition, which could itself be pathological

5\. Having a problem with your gallbladder or liver, which could also be pathological

## Does Skipping Meals Slow Metabolism

# Does skipping meals slow metabolism?

[See Video/Image/Document](https://hls-player.drberg.com/asset?path=migrated-assets/will-skipping-meals-increase-your-metabolism-drberg)

We have to differentiate between skipping a meal, otherwise known as infrequent meals or intermittent fasting, from just being on a low-calorie diet. They are two different things. When you decrease the frequency of your meals you’ll probably automatically reduce your calories. When you reduce your calories and the frequency of your meals you won’t feel too good. Here’s an example. I’ve done several cleanses in the past, I think it was the lemon water, cayenne pepper, and maple syrup one. I did it for ten days and it almost killed me!

The maple syrup was enough glucose to keep me out of ketosis and keep my blood sugar up and down while I was basically starving to death. I was so hungry it was torturous. I’ve done other cleanses and also felt terrible. So if someone brought up fasting, I’d reject it. But what I didn’t know then that I know now is that if you do keto (low carb) and infrequent meals and ease gradually into fasting, your hunger goes away. You adapt to burning your own fat.

**When you eat more frequently you can’t get into fat-burning mode.** **You’ll have a lot of blood sugar issues, but you won’t on keto and intermittent fasting. When you decrease meals you decrease insulin, which automatically increases your metabolic rate. You’ll feel really good because your brain loves ketones. If you do a search on how to increase your metabolism you’ll find suggestions like drink more water, eat more protein, eat spicy foods, and drink green tea. These are trivial.**

**These are the things that affect your metabolism:**

●Age, which you can’t do much about

●Dieting; go on keto and decrease the frequency of your meals

●Your diet as an infant or your mother’s diet when she was pregnant with you. If it was high carb and she developed insulin resistance you’re at higher risk of becoming prediabetic and having a slow metabolism.

●Insulin levels; decrease your meal frequency without cutting calories and see how much weight you lose

●Cortisol levels; decrease your stress

Skipping meals doesn’t slow your metabolism!

## What Strategies Can I Employ To Help My Children Reduce Their Sugar Intake

# What strategies can I employ to help my children reduce their sugar intake?

Added sugars are everywhere, even in places you might not expect them. The average child consumes 66 pounds of added sugar every single year!

**Here are some sugary foods to avoid:**

• Sweetened milk

• Sweetened chocolate milk

• Sweetened tea

• Fruit juices

• Sodas

• Sports drinks

• Vitamin drinks

• Ketchup

• Sauces

• Breaded meats

• Chicken fingers

The best thing you can do for your kid’s health is to get them off of junk food! By removing sugar from the diet, you can get them to start burning fat instead of sugar.

**There are several benefits to burning fat instead of sugar:**

• Improved mood

• Improved cognitive function

• Improved ability to learn

• Stabilized blood sugars

The best way to get your kids to stop eating sugar is to substitute sugary foods with identical alternatives. Keto-friendly cookies, pies, and chocolates are all great alternative foods for kids, without the sugar. Keto bombs are also a great alternative to junk foods and other sugary foods. Keto bombs are similar to a cookie, but made completely of fat. You can use erythritol, xylitol, and stevia to sweeten treats instead of sugar. It may take a few days for your child to adjust, but removing sugar from your kid’s diet is a great choice for their health.

## Keto Is Beneficial For Athletic Performance

# Keto is Beneficial for Athletic Performance

In 2012 there was a study, which I linked to below this video, that keto doesn’t affect the strength performance in elite gymnasts. A 2018 study, also linked below, shows that keto reduces oxidative stress and inflammation in deep sea divers. When you run your body on ketones, you get less oxidative stress, meaning that your organs and tissues don’t break down as easily.

Yet another study of cyclists showed that keto didn’t compromise their endurance. Two of the top ultramarathon runners are both on keto. One of them, Zach Bitter, took the US record for a 100 mile event. It’s not carbs that build muscle, it’s protein. Strength training also builds muscle. While it’s true that insulin is anabolic, which helps your muscles grow, Two things stimulate insulin; one is carbs, the other is protein.

When you do the keto diet, you go low carb. When you go low carb, and combine it with intermittent fasting, you fix something called insulin resistance. Most of the population has this. Your cells need evermore insulin to offset the effect of eating too many carbs. When you fix insulin resistance, you increase the absorption of amino acids. Your body uses insulin more effectively. When you do a healthy keto plan, your body runs on ketones, fatty acids, and part of it still uses a little bit of glucose. Even though you’re not consuming glucose, your body has the ability to make its own in the liver, a process called gluconeogenesis.

When you start keto, you go through keto adaptation. You may experience fatigue. Increase your B vitamins and minerals. This is a temporary phase. Once you tap into your fat reserves, your performance will improve. You’ll have more endurance. Some athletes become fat burning machines. The truth is, when you eat high carb, you’ll feel more fatigued and your performance will suffer. You’ll have higher insulin along with blood sugar issues and more oxidative stress. Now you can see why the keto diet is actually beneficial for athletic performance.

## Are Xanthan And Guar Gum Keto Friendly

# Are Xanthan and Guar Gum keto-friendly?

**What is xanthan gum?** Xanthan gum is an additive used in a lot of different foods as a thickener and to provide texture. It’s used in a lot of bread recipes because it can replace gluten. 

**Is xanthan gum keto-friendly?**  Xanthan gum usually made from corn, glucose, or soy. It’s technically keto-friendly. It has zero net carbs, and it won’t affect your blood sugars. But, if you were to consume this, you would want to make sure the product you’re buying is non-GMO.

## What Strategies Or Interventions Can Assist Someone Struggling With Ex 585E07

# What strategies or interventions can assist someone struggling with excessive carbohydrate consumption?

Carboholic is someone that is addicted to carbohydrates. This is a physical problem and a cellular level where the body is driving you to not think about the future consequences, logically it doesn’t help you to understand that.

Insulin is the hormone that allows the sugar fuel into the cell, which could lead to insulin resistance where the insulin doesn’t work anymore and that makes your body crave sugar.

Every time you consume sugar there is a spike of beta-endorphins, which is the chemicals in the body that are 30x stronger than morphine for pain and stress.

Dopamine which is a pleasure hormone that is stimulated when you take drugs is also triggered when you consume a lot of sugar and carbohydrates.

**The difference between addiction and a habit:**

• Addiction: Completely out of control and cannot say no. The more you can’t have it, the more you want it.

• Habit: Something that you can say no to. It is just like a routine you get into.

**Ways to Overcome Addiction to Carbs:**

1\. Understand what is happening in the body

2\. Heal insulin resistance

3\. Do things gradually: Start consuming keto bombs (sweet cookies that do not affect insulin)

4\. Start consuming a lot of nutrients – It is the nutrients that protect the cell against high levels of sugar

## What Is The Recommended Protocol For Managing And Treating Calcified P Cb26D9

# What is the recommended protocol for managing and treating calcified plaque in the arteries?

**What you could do for calcification in the arteries:**

1\. Allicin  This is a phytonutrient in garlic. There is some interesting research on the association of allicin and decreased artery calcification in animals. 

2\. Butyrate  This is a compound that the microbes in the gut make when you feed them fiber (vegetable fiber). It’s a type of fat, a small-chain fatty acid. Butyrate has been associated with a decreased risk of artery disease. 

3\. Lycopene  This is a phytonutrient in certain vegetables. There is some interesting data showing how lycopene can decrease the thickness of the wall of the arteries and decrease the stiffness. 

4\. Omega-3 fatty acids  You can find this in cod liver oil or fish oils. Omega-3 fatty acids may help decrease inflammation.

5\. GLA (gamma-linolenic acid)  This is a type of omega-6 fatty acid that is actually friendly to your arteries. A few examples would be borage oil, black currant seed oil, and evening primrose oil. GLA may help decrease inflammation, decrease the thickness of the arteries, and decrease plaque formation in the arteries. 

6\. Vitamin K2 (MK-7 version) You may want to consider consuming 300mcg of vitamin K2 every day. Vitamin K2 can activate a certain protein that inhibits calcium from forming in the arteries. 

7\. Tocotrienols  This is one form of the vitamin E complex. Tocotrienols can greatly decrease inflammation in the arteries. 

8\. Decrease insulin resistance  Do whatever you can to decrease and reverse insulin resistance. There is a direct relationship between having insulin resistance and having calcification in the arteries. A lot of these other remedies may not work unless you also fix insulin resistance. You can help fix insulin resistance by doing the healthy keto diet and intermittent fasting. 

**The most important combination:**

• Address insulin resistance 

• Tocotrienols 

• Vitamin K2 

• Allicin 

• Omega-3 fatty acids 

**Secondary**:

• Butyrate 

• Lycopene 

• GLA

## Are There Any Danger Sides Of Fasting

# Are there any danger sides of fasting?

[Dr. Berg's Guidelines for Prolonged Fasting.docx](https://realdrberg-my.sharepoint.com/:w:/g/personal/shawnh_drberg_com/EazcZ9dNJ6VDhEOO13hV0F8BnVvc-Ge6y2mYjpN-FnojYg?e=RHdisz&clickparams=eyJBcHBOYW1lIjoiVGVhbXMtRGVza3RvcCIsIkFwcFZlcnNpb24iOiI1MC8yNDAzMzEwMTgxNyIsIkhhc0ZlZGVyYXRlZFVzZXIiOmZhbHNlfQ%3D%3D).

Dr. Berg Nutritionals staff, including Dr. Berg Advisors, do *not* encourage prolonged fasting. We are not healthcare professionals equipped with the tests and facilities to perform the necessary monitoring during a prolonged fast, nor do we have an individual's medical health records. Dr. Berg Advisors provide this document based on Dr. Berg's education for informational purposes only to those already on a prolonged fast or independently choosing to do one.

**Always consult with your healthcare provider before starting a prolonged fast.  If you're considering prolonged fasting, discussing the benefits and risks with your healthcare provider is essential.**

Most of the dangers of fasting I’m going to cover aren’t related to a 16 to 18-hour fast. This applies more to prolonged fasting, which is when a person fasts for 48 to 72 hours—or even longer. The purpose of eating is not just to get fuel. It’s also to get nutrients. When you’re fasting, you’re restricting nutrients. If your diet isn’t providing you with the nutrients you need when you do eat, you could end up with deficiencies that lead to certain issues.
**It’s crucial to do a prolonged fast correctly and avoid common mistakes related to the dark side of fasting.**

**The dark side of prolonged fasting:**

1\. Refeeding syndrome When you come off of a fast, have a small amount of food, wait a couple of hours, and have a little bit more. Avoid overeating or eating carbs.

2\. Dirty keto Make sure you consume nutrient-dense, high-quality foods on the keto diet.

3\. Not taking nutrients while fasting At the bare minimum, you need to take electrolytes, sea salt, trace minerals, and B vitamins while fasting.

4\. Kidney stones Avoid high-oxalate foods if you’re prone to kidney stones. Also, consume at least two and a half liters of fluid a day, and add lemon juice to your water. When you’re back to having meals, consume large salads.

5\. Anorexia Anorexia will cause nutritional deficiencies. Instead of fasting, get on the keto diet.

6\. Athletes that have not adapted to fat yet Give your body enough time to become fully fat-adapted before attempting prolonged fasting.

7\. Fasting for children Fasting isn’t a good idea for children. Eating three meals a day and cutting out snacking may be beneficial for children. Teenagers who are overweight may consider two meals a day without snacking.

8\. Not getting enough nutrition while pregnant or lactating Not getting enough nutrients while pregnant or lactating can lead to issues for the mother and child. Choosing a whole-food, natural prenatal vitamin over a synthetic prenatal vitamin is also important.

9\. Muscle loss If you’re older and noticing muscle loss, try adding a blend of amino acids to your diet.

10\. Ketoacidosis This rare condition occurs in people under very specific circumstances and isn't something most people should be concerned about.

## What Are The Common Symptoms Associated With A Skin Rash And How Can T 7Fd779

# What are the common symptoms associated with a skin rash, and how can these symptoms vary based on the underlying cause?

When you have poor blood clotting or nutrient deficiencies you may have red, pink or purple spots on your skin that can also itch. What is important to know is that for healthy functioning of the skin we need several vitamins. Let’s look at the known remedies for this condition.

**Cause #1: Bile deficiency**

Bile is a very important liquid that is produced in your liver and stored in your gallbladder. The main function of bile is digestion of fats as well as certain vitamins. Additionally, If you consume too much fat and are unable to digest it, this can cause skin rash. In such a case purified bile salts can help you digest fats.

**Cause #2: Vitamin B2 deficiency**

Vitamin B2 is very important for healthy levels of the skin as well as for proper digestion of fats. The more fat you eat, the more B2 you need. Lack of B2 in the body can cause skin rash.

**Cause #3: Allergies**

Allergy means intolerance to certain types of foods or environmental elements, like pollen. Your body overreacts to the thing causing allergy (allergen), creating a lot of symptoms like inflammation, irritation, etc. The best way to see if you have an allergy is to look back and see what you ate or were exposed to just before getting a rash. Chances are that there was an unusual type of food or an environmental substance you were exposed to.

**Detoxification:**

Additionally, while on keto and intermittent fasting, your body may go through a detoxification cycle. This is because you are burning and breaking down your body fat, which releases toxins that were stored in the fatty tissue. Therefore, fat-burning can cause this reaction.

- Increase vegetables

- Take bentonite clay on an empty stomach

## What Are The Potential Reasons For Sugar Cravings And How Do Factors S Fc537C

# What are the potential reasons for sugar cravings, and how do factors such as hormonal fluctuations, emotional triggers, and dietary habits contribute to this desire?

Craving sugar is a very common problem, especially if you are trying to get onto a healthy diet. It can be caused by several underlying issues. Let’s break it down and look at some simple remedies to the problem.

**Cause #1: High-carb diet**

When you are on a high-carb diet your body will produce insulin (fat-storing hormone) to lower the blood sugar spikes. High blood sugar will make you feel satisfied after the high-sugar / high- carb meal. However, a few hours later, the insulin will drop the blood sugar too low, causing you to crave these foods again. The cycle repeats.

Additionally, consuming refined carbs and sugar increases the hormones and chemicals in the body that are related to pleasure, making you feel satisfied when you are consume them.

A high-carb diet is very addictive, with many side effects.

The solution is to get on the Healthy Keto® diet and intermittent fasting. When you start following them, in a few days your body will adapt to a new healthy type of fuel: ketones (instead of sugar).

Ketones are a byproduct of your body burning its own fat. If your body is adapted to ketones you will feel much more energetic, less stressed, healthier, and you will have no cravings or hunger whatsoever. As an additional reward, you will burn fat.

**Cause #2: Snacking**

Eating between meals, even if it’s not much food, will raise your level of insulin. This is because eating in general will raise insulin. Insulin in turn will lower your blood sugar levels, and shortly after your snack you will feel hunger and cravings again.

**Cause #3: Stress**

When you are undergoing stress, you may feel like eating sweets and carbohydrates. This usually has its roots in being accustomed to a high-carb diet. When you eat carbs out of stress, you may feel satisfied temporarily, because your blood sugar and dopamine (pleasure-related chemical produced by your body) go high. Shortly after, when they drop, you will feel stressed again and will crave carbs to feel better. The solution would be to get on the right diet and get your stress levels under control.

Additionally, if you constantly undergo stress, your stress hormone, called cortisol, is going to break down your body proteins and turn them into sugar. This will spike your blood sugar and make your body produce insulin to lower it. Once blood sugar is lowered below the normal level, you will crave sugar and carbs.

## What Strategies Or Substances Can Effectively Enhance Insulin Sensitivity

# What strategies or substances can effectively enhance insulin sensitivity?

To understand insulin sensitivity, you need to understand insulin resistance. Insulin resistance is a situation where the receptor for insulin in your cells is blocking insulin. It’s not allowing insulin to go into the cells. You don’t have the function that insulin should have normally. Because of this, the body starts putting out more insulin. 

Insulin is very important to help regulate the blood sugars and to help with the absorption of nutrients. But, the more insulin resistance you have, the more insulin you’re going to have, and the more problems you’re going to have. For example, in the presence of insulin, you can’t lose weight. 

We want to improve insulin resistance by making insulin more sensitive.

**Help improve insulin sensitivity naturally by doing these things:**

1\. Resistance training 

2\. Fasting 

3\. Decrease inflammation 

4\. Reduce glucose (do healthy keto)

5\. Increase sleep

6\. Decrease stress (cortisol)

7\. Consume more vegetables (fiber)

**A few additional things to help increase insulin sensitivity:**

• Apple cider vinegar

• Cinnamon

• Omega 3 

• Vitamin D

## How To Get Faster Weight Loss Despite Having Hypothyroidism

# How to get faster weight loss despite having hypothyroidism?

It’s a complex subject because there are different kinds of hypothyroidism such as Hashimoto’s and non-Hashimotos. Sometimes you can’t figure out what’s important and what’s trivial information. In this video, I focus on the most important things you need to know to achieve weight loss with a hypothyroid condition.

Your thyroid is located at the bottom of your neck. It produces a hormone called T4 which is an inactive thyroid hormone. T4 converts to T3 which is the active thyroid hormone. T3 goes into your cells and speeds up your metabolism as well as weight loss. 80 percent of conversion happens through your liver, 20 percent happens through your kidneys.

So many people with hypothyroid conditions have a fatty liver. If you have belly fat chances are you have a fatty liver, which decreases the capacity to convert T4 to T3. Your focus is to get the fat off your liver and improve its function. But it could also be a function of your gallbladder, or perhaps cirrhosis of your liver.

You’d think cutting fat from your diet would make the fat on your liver go away but that’s not what you want to do. You do need to cut carbs which is why I recommend keto and intermittent fasting.

As well, here are some things to speed up the process: Choline is one of the most powerful nutrients to strip fat from your liver very quickly. Get high quality choline and start taking it. It dissolves fat. Egg yolks have the highest amount of choline in a food. If you have a choline deficiency you could potentially get a fatty liver.

Selenium is also involved in the conversion of T4 to T3. It’s an antioxidant and is especially important if you have Hashimoto’s. Also, do more strict intermittent fasting to decrease inflammation and boost your immune system.

Iodine is part of the raw material to build thyroid hormones. I recommend consuming sea kelp as a source of iodine. Next is zinc which will help with almost every single side effect of being hypothyroid such as hair loss, fatigue, and constipation. It’s in oysters, meat, and pumpkin seeds, but I recommend taking a supplement. These are the steps you can take to get faster weight loss even with hypothyroidism.

# What is a keto fat bomb?

A keto fat bomb is a keto dessert that is loaded with healthy fats. It is a great way to stay satisfied between meals if you’re doing the keto diet and intermittent fasting.

Just remember to only have one with your meal, as a keto dessert, and not as a snack between meals.

There is no sugar in these tasty keto-friendly treats – only healthy fats to help get your body move into fat-burning and stay in fat-burning.

**Chocolate Keto Fat Bombs Ingredients:**

1⁄2 cup coconut oil

1⁄2 cup peanut butter

2 Tbsp cocoa powder

3 Tbsp xylitol or other sweetener

1⁄4 tsp vanilla

**Instructions:**

Mix it all up, pour into a tray and put into freezer.

## Why Isnt The Ketogenic Diet Working For My Hypoglycemia

# Why isn't the ketogenic diet working for my hypoglycemia?

Someone was having an issue with keto where they said that keto didn’t work because even though they did keto and felt better after doing it for a month, they went back on their diet, and their hypoglycemia came back.

What causes hypoglycemia (low blood sugars) is something you ate that’s triggering insulin, and the insulin is pushing your blood sugars down. When you have hypoglycemia, you may think you need to consume sugar because your sugar is low. But, the problem with this is that you’re just going to activate insulin again, which will bring the blood sugar back down. I don’t believe you can correct hypoglycemia by consuming more carbs.

When someone starts the keto diet, they also really need to commit to it for longer than one month. If a person has hypoglycemia, they have very severe insulin resistance. It could take several years before this person could get into a stabilized position, and if the person was to go back to carbs, the situation would just come back. The keto and intermittent fasting plan is designed to be a lifestyle change.

## What Is Hypoglycemia Without Symptoms

# What is hypoglycemia without symptoms?

When adopting a ketogenic diet or fasting, lower blood sugar levels, even below typical thresholds, can occur without symptoms in individuals adapted to using ketones and fats for energy. Symptoms of hypoglycemia, such as confusion, irritability, and shaking, indicate true hypoglycemia despite low readings, warranting attention. Idiopathic hypoglycemia, related to insulin receptor issues, or reactive hypoglycemia post-carb meals are also considerations. Transitioning to a low-carb ketogenic diet and integrating fasting gradually can effectively manage these conditions.

## What Is The Relationship Between Glycogen Stores And Electrolytes When 189B2E

# What is the relationship between glycogen stores and electrolytes when doing Keto and Intermittent fasting?

**Glycogen is series of glucose molecules linked together as a group. When you have more glycogen, you are going to hold more water. Doing ketogenic diet and intermittent fasting will shrink down glycogen that could cause the symptoms in transitioning from sugar burning to fat burning.**

**Problems of Deplete Minerals:**

• Sodium – Weaker muscles, keto flu, dizziness, low blood pressure

• Potassium – Fatigue, Sleep problems, higher pulse rate. Potassium is needed for energy and also calmness when sleeping.

• Calcium – Cramps

• Magnesium – Sleep problem, cramps, heart rhythm

## Can Fluctuations In Blood Sugar Levels Contribute To The Occurrence Of 7C94D0

# Can fluctuations in blood sugar levels contribute to the occurrence of headaches and migraines?

Low blood sugar can trigger headaches and migraines. When you eat carbs, your blood sugar goes up, and your ache may disappear. However this will not resolve the issue because shortly after, your blood sugar will go low again, causing a new headache.

I recommend getting on the Healthy Keto® diet, which will give your body a better type of fuel for your brain: ketones (a byproduct of fat-burning). Ketones will not cause your blood sugar to go up and down. Stable blood sugar may resolve the headache issue.

(Note: If you have just started a keto diet, headaches could be a symptom of adapting to the diet.)

## What Is The Most Potent Treatment For Eradicating Candida Infections

# What is the most potent treatment for eradicating candida infections?

Now, we normally have candida living in our bodies without any issue. But when you take an antibiotic, your defenses are lowered and you end up with an overgrowth of candida. This is a fungal infection caused by yeast, the most common being candida Albicans.

If this infection turns your tongue white, that’s a condition called thrush. Sometimes the white patches are on the inside of your cheek; sometimes there are small red patches on your tongue. If the infection is in your vagina, it’s called a yeast infection. If in your esophagus, it’s called candida esophagitis.

Garlic is, hands down, the most powerful fungus killer. It also works on toenail fungus. Garlic has a natural phytochemical called ajoene that’s responsible for its power to kill fungus. Ajoene is also a natural blood thinner; drug companies are researching it to use in medication for blood clotting disorders.

Crush up fresh garlic and put it in your food on a regular basis. But you also have to fix your diet! Lower your sugar intake. Reduce your consumption of milk sugar. I recommend a healthy keto plan with intermittent fasting. If you’re consuming garlic but your sugar and carb consumption is still high, I doubt your fungal infection will go away. You want to starve off the fungus and re-establish the friendly flora in your body.

I also recommend a type of probiotic called effective microbes, to help your gut flora. Garlic has many other phytochemicals that provide you with health benefits. Not only is it anti-fungal, but antibacterial and antiviral as well. Garlic has been shown to be very effective for basal cell carcinoma, the most common type of skin cancer.

Now you can see how effective garlic is to kill candida.

## Is Colon Cleansing Advantageous For Health

# Is colon cleansing advantageous for health?

There are several different types of colon cleansing: 

**• Colon hydrotherapy** 

This is where water goes up the rectum into the large intestine and flushes everything out. This can flush out you’re electrolytes. You may want to take electrolytes after, so you don’t become deficient. You’re also flushing out your friendly bacteria, which would need to be put back in. 

**• Herbal laxatives**

Creates a purging of the material out of the colon 

**• Colema** 

This is a combination of an enema and a colonic. The problem is that it’s very temporary. It also flushes out your electrolytes. If you’re already deficient in electrolytes, this can cause dizziness and even affect your heart. The apple juice a person is supposed to drink while doing the colema, can also keep the blood sugars up, preventing ketosis. 

Fixing your diet (doing keto) may be the best way to go. Typically, fixing the diet can fix whatever issue caused you to want to do the colon cleansing to begin with. I’m not against colon hydrotherapy as a short-term solution for constipation or other conditions. But, it should be supervised, and the electrolytes and friendly bacteria need to be put back in. 

**What you can do:** 

1\. Start fasting 

2\. Decrease inflammation 

3\. Consume phytonutrients 

4\. Consume fermented vegetables

## What Are The Effective Strategies For Alleviating Constipation

# What are the effective strategies for alleviating constipation?

For people who have had chronic constipation before starting the keto diet, you may need a deeper evaluation by your doctor. A natural laxative may also be a helpful constipation remedy.

**Here’s what you could consider if you started having constipation after starting keto:**

1\. Adjust your vegetables

A. Try increasing or decreasing the number of vegetables you consume.

B. Try different types of vegetables.

C. Switch to fermented vegetables or consume some of your vegetables raw, and some of them steamed.

2\. Add bile salts

3\. Add potassium

4\. Add a probiotic

5\. Add an herbal laxative

6\. Add vitamin B1

\*MCT oil may also help

## What Is Rheumatoid Arthritis And What Are The Common Symptoms Associat 8Ced0E

# What is rheumatoid arthritis, and what are the common symptoms associated with this autoimmune condition?

**Rheumatoid Arthritis**

Rheumatoid arthritis is an autoimmune disease causing joint pain on both sides of the body due to immune system attacks on healthy cells.

**Microbial Connection**

Studies link knee rheumatoid arthritis to bacteria like porphyromonas gingivalis found in knee and heart joints.

**Natural Antibiotics**

Test with natural antibiotics like goldenseal, tea tree oil, myrrh, garlic, thyme, oregano oil, and olive leaf extract to check if microbes are the cause.

**Supporting Immune System**

Boost immune health and reduce inflammation with vitamin D (20,000-60,000 IU/day), vitamin K2 (300 mcg/day), zinc (200 mg 3x/day for 1-2 weeks), Healthy Keto® diet, intermittent fasting, potassium (6,000 mg/day), ginger, turmeric, cinnamon, omega-3 fatty acids, ozone therapy, and thunder god vine (570 mg).

## What Is The Relationship Between High Insulin Levels And The Developme 02E96B

# What is the relationship between high insulin levels and the development of acne?

When you eat high amounts of sugar or carbohydrates, that increases your insulin level. Insulin, in its turn, increases androgens (male sex hormones that play a role in the amount of oil your skin produces). When your androgens are elevated, you get skin acne.

## What Is The 30 Day Sugar Detox Program And How Does It Help Reduce Sug 70A1B2

# What is the 30-Day Sugar Detox program, and how does it help reduce sugar intake and improve health?

What will happen if you cut sugar out of your diet for thirty days? Let’s talk about it.

Metabolic flexibility is a term used to describe how smoothly and efficiently your cells can adapt to utilize and burn fuel like fat, ketones, or glucose.

When you’re metabolically inflexible, this transition is very dysfunctional. Your ability to burn fat in a fasting state will be very difficult. If you can’t lose weight when fasting or exercising, this could be why.

Metabolic inflexibility can lead to diabetes, obesity, loss of muscle protein, and chronic illnesses. It can also cause irritability, fatigue, anxiety, and hunger. When you try to fast, you won’t feel very good, and you’ll miss out on certain benefits if you’re not metabolically flexible.

Insulin resistance is at the heart of this problem. Insulin controls whether you burn fat or not. If someone is metabolically inflexible, they have insulin resistance. Insulin tells the body not to burn fat and to store fat instead.

On the flip side, metabolic flexibility is really insulin sensitivity, and there are ways to make the body more metabolically flexible or insulin sensitive.

When you become more metabolically flexible, you’ll be able to fast for longer without hunger or cravings, burn fat, and burn sugar more efficiently.

How to transition your body into a state of metabolic flexibility and insulin sensitivity:

1\. Eat less frequently

2\. Eat fewer carbohydrates

3\. Eat sufficient amounts of fat, but not excessive amounts of fat

4\. Try exercise snacking (do short bouts of exercise throughout the day)

## What Are The Potential Causes Of Itchy And Red Eyes

# What are the potential causes of itchy and red eyes?

Having itchy, red eyes can create a number of difficulties in our daily lives. This condition can come from infections and allergies as well as nutritional deficiencies.

**Cause #1: Viral infection**

If you have an eye infection like pink eye, it can cause eye irritation, redness and inflammation. I suggest using colloidal silver as well as zinc and vitamin D to improve your immune system.

**Remedies:**

- Use 1 drop of colloidal silver in each eye 7 times per day

- Consume zinc

- Consume garlic

- Consume other natural antibiotics

Consume vitamin D

**Cause #2: Nutritional deficiencies**

There are several nutrients that your body needs for healthy functioning of the eyes. If you are deficient in them, this can create redness and irritation in the eyes.

\-If you are deficient in vitamin A, it can cause you to have dry eyes as well as a thickened mucus around the eyes that can result in itchiness and redness.

\-B vitamin deficiencies can cause redness or irritation in the eyes, especially B1 and B2 deficiencies.

\-Vitamin C helps keep veins and capillaries healthy and supports their work. If you have a small hemorrhage (bleeding) in the eye, vitamin C (along with vitamin K) can help repair it.

\-Vitamin D is one of the best nutritional anti-inflammatories; if you have red, irritated eyes, vitamin D can help resolve this condition.

**Remedies: Vitamin A:**

- Beef liver

- Egg yolks

- Cod liver oil

- Fatty fish

- Butter

- Cheese

    **B vitamins:**

- Nutritional yeast

- Eggs

- Meat

- Liver

- Fish

- Nuts

- Seeds

    **Vitamin C:**

- Sauerkraut

- Bell pepper

- Berries

- Raw lemons

    **Vitamin K:**

- Any type of dark leafy green

    **Vitamin D3:**

- Consume cod liver oil

- Get more exposure to the sun

- Take a vitamin D3 supplement

    **Improve the absorption of vitamins:**

- Consume apple cider vinegar (1 to 2 teaspoons stirred into about a cup of water)

- Consume betaine hydrochloride

• Take purified bile salts

**Cause #3: Allergies**

An allergy is an intolerance to certain foods or some substance in the environment (like pollen). If you have red, itchy eyes, there is a possibility that you have an allergy and your eyes are reacting to certain substances or food.

**Remedies:**

- Consume vitamin A

- Consume vitamin D

- Locate the source of the allergy by looking back and seeing what you were exposed to or what you ate before the eye irritation started, then avoid it.

    **Cause #4: High-carb diet**

    When you are on a high-carb diet your blood sugars elevate too high after eating. As a result your tear glands can stop producing tears. Insulin can also affect the blood flow to the nerve that goes to the cornea. Additionally, if you feel that there is something in the eye but nothing is in there, this is a sign of a blood sugar / insulin problem.

    **Remedies:**

- Avoid sugar and refined carbs

- Avoid snacking

- Do the Healthy Keto® diet

- Do an intermittent fasting plan

    **Other causes:**

- Blue lights causing irritation

- Lack of sleep

- Low blood sugar

- Anemia

- Lack of essential pancreatic enzymes

- Liver/gallbladder problem

- Alcohol

- IBS

## What Are The Underlying Causes Of Leaky Gut Syndrome

# What are the underlying causes of leaky gut syndrome?

Leaky gut is a digestive condition in which bacteria and toxins are able to “leak” through the intestinal wall. This condition can create food sensitivities and an immune system response, causing discomfort and inflammation. This is basically a scurvy in the colon.

**Symptoms:**

- Chronic diarrhea, constipation, or bloating

- Food sensitivities

- Scar tissue in the colon

- Nutritional deficiencies

- Fatigue

- Headaches

- Confusion

- Difficulty concentrating

- Skin problems

- Joint pain

- Widespread inflammation

**Cause #1: Vitamin C deficiency**

A lack of vitamin C can cause a loss of collagen in the lining of the intestines, opening gaps in the intestinal walls that allow undigested proteins or harmful bacteria to enter the intestinal cavity. So you have leaks that go into the blood vessels and that creates an immune reaction or food sensitivities.

**Remedies:**

- Take natural vitamin C complex (not ascorbic acid)

- Consume the following foods with bioflavonoid (the component of vitamin C that helps with leaky gut):

    - sprouted buckwheat

    - quercetin

    - parsley

    - onions

    - green tea

    - citrus

    - cruciferous vegetables

- Avoid things that will deplete you of vitamin C:

    - smoking

    - carbs and sweets

    - snacking

(Note: If you try the above remedies, consuming natural vitamin C complex and the foods above, and leaky gut does not resolve, the issue can be insulin resistance in the body. When you have insulin resistance, vitamin C is depleted by the high level of insulin produced in the body. In this case you should do a Healthy Keto® diet and intermittent fasting plan.)

**Other causes:**

- Insulin resistance

## I Am Struggling To Commit To Keto And Intermittent Fasting 100. What D F13Ded

# I am struggling to commit to keto and intermittent fasting 100%. What do you suggest?

Starting gradually is key when transitioning to a ketogenic diet and intermittent fasting, especially if you're accustomed to frequent meals and a high-carb diet. Incorporating MCT oil can help reduce cravings and support longer fasting periods, but introduce it gradually to avoid digestive issues. As your body adapts to fat burning, the process becomes easier, leading to uplifted mood, reduced cravings, and increased energy. Ensure you consume enough nutrients by incorporating plenty of vegetables and nutritional yeast into your diet. Keep progressing towards your goal with consistency and patience.

## Can Elevated Insulin Levels Contribute To The Development Of Clogged Arteries

# Can elevated insulin levels contribute to the development of clogged arteries?

Clogged arteries are created due to certain plaques in the blood routes. This can create a lot of difficulty and stress on your body because it lowers the ability of blood to freely move through its channels.

**Myth about cholesterol**

When it comes to clogged arteries, most people focus on cholesterol. They want to lower their cholesterol by eliminating things like fat, butter, eggs and animal meat. I want to go over some additional data that has to do with the chain reaction that occurs before cholesterol enters your arteries.

Not all cholesterol is bad. In fact, your body makes a ton of it--more than 3,000 mg a day. Keep in mind that an egg only contains 300 mg of cholesterol. If your body makes so much, why is it considered bad? It’s not. Every cell wall is made from cholesterol. Hormones, specifically sex hormones, are made from cholesterol.

When your artery gets damaged, cholesterol comes as a band-aid for the damage, creating a plaque along with calcium and fibrin (connective tissue). However, we need to fix the underlying issue, which is this: what is creating the damage to your arteries in the first place? Knowing the cause of the damage, you can resolve the plaques and avoid the clogged-artery condition.

**Cause #1: High amounts of insulin**

Frequent eating and a high-carb diet will cause your insulin to be very high. Insulin is a hormone that has the capacity to cause clogged arteries. This is because insulin creates inflammation in the body, which eventually will result in damaged tissue. If this damage occurs in the arteries, your body will try to heal it using a combination of cholesterol, calcium and fibrin (connective tissue) that creates a plaque.

## Is It Possible To Remedy The Liver Cirrhosis Caused By High Insulin

# Is it possible to remedy the liver cirrhosis caused by high insulin?

If you have high insulin in your body this can cause inflammation and a fatty liver. Inflammation can cause damage to your liver and your body will attempt to heal it, creating scar tissue in your liver. This will result in cirrhosis. Insulin goes too high mainly due to consuming a lot of refined carbs and sugar and due to frequent eating over a long period of time.

**Remedies:**

- Avoid refined carbs and sugar

- Avoid snacking

- Do the Healthy Keto® diet

- Do an intermittent fasting plan

- Do periodic prolonged fasting

- Consume more potassium

**\*We recommend consulting with your doctor before making any dietary changes or before you start taking any new supplements, especially if you have any existing health conditions.**

## What Are The Initial Signs And Symptoms That May Indicate The Onset Of 021107

# What are the initial signs and symptoms that may indicate the onset of dementia, and how can they manifest in daily life?

**They can be:**

1\. A loss of spatial navigation (like forgetting where you parked your car)

2\. Difficulty finding the right words

3\. Confusion

4\. Repeating yourself

The first thing you want to do if you are experiencing dementia symptoms is to start feeding your brain ketones. This will help bypass the degraded glucose absorption mechanism that is starving your brain of fuel and begin to feed the neurons directly.

**There are three ways you can increase your ketones:**

1\. Lower your carbs

2\. Do intermittent fasting

3\. Supply your body with healthy fats, like MCT oil and fatty fish

## What Is The Most Effective Remedy For Depression

# What is the most effective remedy for depression?

There is an interesting link between BDNF and depression. It’s been found that there is no way to diagnose depression. But, it was also found that people who are depressed have low levels of BDNF. Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) is an important molecule involved in learning and memory.

So an interesting question is how to enhance BDNF. All of the trials delivering BDNF into the central nervous system have failed. So, how can we enhance it naturally?

BDNF is basically a fertilizer for the brain. It helps with nerve growth, nerve differentiation, and the maintenance of the synapse between the nerves.

**Benefits of BDNF:**

- It can help improve learning

- It can help improve long-term memory

- It helps higher thinking

- It helps you think more clearly

- It helps you become more mentally alert

- It can decrease inflammation

- It can increase the absorption of neurotransmitters

**Things to help enhance BDNF and get out of depression:**

- Deep sleep (at least 7 high-quality hours of deep sleep)

- Exercise (the fastest and most effective method of increasing BDNF)

- Sunlight

- Intermittent fasting and periodic prolonged fasting

- Healthy Keto®

- Avoiding sugar

- Magnesium

## I Cant Get My Ketone Levels High Enough  What Should I Do

# I can’t get my ketone levels high enough – what should I do?

Here are five things you need to know when increasing your ketone levels.

- It takes time – If you just started on keto, you will need to give it some time before you fully switch over to ketosis. Your mitochondria do not fully adapt to ketosis right away. It can take around one month to become fully keto-adapted.

- Use the right test – Testing your ketones can be a great way to figure out where you are in your keto-adaptation. First, you can use urine ketone tests. However, as your body adapts to ketosis, it will naturally become more efficient at burning ketones, leaving you with little to no ketones in your urine. At this point, you want to use a blood ketone test.

- Keep your protein intake in check – Having more than 8 oz of protein per meal may spike your insulin levels high enough to slow down ketosis. Make sure you increase your fat-to- protein ratio and have around 3 to 6 oz of protein per meal. Sausage, olives, olive oil, fatty fish, fatty cheese, pecans, macadamia nuts, butter, cod liver oil, stew and sardines are great foods for increasing your fat-to-protein ratio.

- Stress – High stress levels can have effects similar to sugar. Stress can trigger cortisol and lower your ketones.

- Lack of sleep – Not getting enough high-quality sleep can throw off your blood sugar levels and limit your ability to get into ketosis.

## I Cant Quit Carbs. What Should I Do

# I can’t quit carbs. What should I do?

Carbohydrates are highly addictive. We are conditioned as children to feed a carb addiction – most children consume large amounts of sugar daily. Sugars and refined grains are added to baby food, cereal, candy and virtually all processed foods.

Carbs are so addictive because they trigger two hormones: dopamine and serotonin. These are pleasure and happiness hormones.

Over time, an addiction to carbs becomes stronger and stronger. So what can you do to break a carb addiction? Take a look.

- Stop eating immediately – The first thing you should do is start fasting. This will kick-start ketosis, which is when your body burns fat as fuel instead of glucose (sugar). This will begin to heal your neurotransmitter receptors that are triggering intense carb cravings.

- Exercise – This will further increase your fat-burning and allow you to get rid of any excess glucose in your system.

- Avoid triggers – Get rid of all carbohydrates and sugars in the house, avoid images of food (like commercials or unhealthy recipe books), don’t go to restaurants with unhealthy foods, avoid food smells that cause cravings, etc.

- Take B vitamins – All B vitamins are important for lessening the addiction to carbs– especially vitamin B1. Using nutritional yeast is a great way to get your B vitamins.

## Can I Do 5 Days Of Fasting And On The Weekends Eat Whatever I Want

# Can I do 5 days of fasting and on the weekends eat whatever I want?

Here are two reasons why this is not recommended:

- You are not going to adapt to a full state of ketosis.

- This provides no standard for what to eat.

Recommendation: do intermittent fasting every single day and do it correctly – start with 16:8 daily, then if you are comfortable with the ratio, start shortening the eating window a little bit at a time to notice better results.

## Can I Eat Cornstarch On Keto

# Can I eat cornstarch on keto?

You can’t. Starch is a bunch of glucose molecules stuck together. It’s basically concentrated sugar. It breaks down a little slower than pure sugar, but it will still raise insulin.

---

## Can I Eat Cucumbers On Keto

# Can I eat cucumbers on keto?

**Yes. 5 basic benefits of cucumbers:**

• May help stabilize blood sugars

• May help stabilize cholesterol

• Have anti-inflammatory properties

• Are loaded with powerful antioxidants

• Provide fiber to make butyrate (butyrate can help with insulin resistance)

## Can I Add Carrots To My Salad On Keto

# Can I add carrots to my salad on keto?

Yes in moderate amounts.

**What is the glycemic index of carrots?**

It’s 72, which is high.

**What is the glycemic index?**

It’s a scale of carbohydrates and how fast each carbohydrate will raise your blood sugar. Below 55 is low, above 70 is high.

But, we need to look at the whole picture.

The glycemic load is the concentration of carbohydrates in a food. The glycemic load will take into consideration the fiber, as well.

The calculation for glycemic load is:

The glycemic index multiplied by the number of carbs divided by 100. Less than 10 would be low, over 21 would be high.

**For carrots:**

72 multiplied by 4 g divided by 100 = 2.88 (very low)

Even though carrots are high on the glycemic index, they have a lot of fiber which inhibits the glycemic reaction.

But, different variables, like taking the carrot juice out of the carrot fiber, or cooking the carrots, can raise the glycemic index.

Overall, are carrots healthy? Yes.

Are carrots one of the keto-friendly vegetables? Yes. 

Can I eat corn on keto? No, due to the high carbohydrate content.

Corn nutritional profile:
Potassium 476 mg
Carbohydrates 123 g
Sugar 1 g
Protein 16 g

## What Is The Difference Between Keto And Atkins

# What is the difference between keto and Atkins?

Here are some of the characteristics of the Atkins diet:

1\. The Atkins diet only recommends 1 to 3 cups of vegetables per day. This is way too low; it can cause a fatty liver.

2\. If you are not hungry, add a protein snack – bad advice because this will stimulate insulin. Protein does increase insulin, which will then cause a lowering of the blood sugars, making you hungry again.

3\. Atkins recommends artificial sweeteners as okay – but most will trigger insulin.

4\. The Atkins diet gives the option of 5 small meals a day. These will trigger insulin release 5 times, knocking you out of fat burning.

5\. Atkins also recommends that you not skip a meal – bad advice because eating in general stimulates insulin. If you’re fasting and burning fat and not hungry why not skip a meal? Your body will then eat its own fat. What do you think you do when you eat breakfast? – You have been fasting all night and you break the fast by eating, hence the name “break-fast.”

6\. The Atkins diet does not put a limit on protein – another bad idea because excess protein blocks fat burning.

## What Is A Keto Rash

# What is a keto rash?

Dr. Berg’s theory is that there are high levels of histamines being dumped into the liver. When you switch over to the keto diet, or you’re running on ketones, you’re releasing a lot of fat that’s coming out through the liver. That fat holds a lot of stuff like chemicals and toxins.

But if you don’t have a lot of bile in your gallbladder and you do a ketogenic diet, you might not be able to release the toxins that are coming out with the fat. This could create an immune reaction with the histamines. One of the purposes of bile is to break down fats. The other is to eliminate toxins. Basically, you’re trying to get rid of these toxins, but you don’t have enough bile to handle the fat being released on the keto diet, so you end up with a rash.

A great potential keto rash remedy is to add purified bile salts. This could help increase the flow of the bile through the liver and gallbladder to help eliminate toxins a lot better and reduce the keto rash that’s occurring.

## Why Am I Itching A Lot On Keto

# Why am I itching a lot on keto?

Sudden skin itchiness after starting keto can be caused by bile salts that back up from the liver into the skin. This can happen because the person has something called cholestasis.

Cholestasis is a situation where the person has a decreased flow of bile, either because there is an obstruction in one of the ducts, or there is sludge (a higher level of cholesterol and low bile). Bile is a detergent, and it can be very toxic if it’s in the wrong place, for example on the skin. A person with cholestasis may also experience a full sensation underneath the right rib cage. This may have started because you introduced more fat into the diet, and you didn’t have enough bile to handle the fat because your body hadn’t adapted yet.

Remedies for itchiness on keto:

- Consume purified bile salts (TUDCA)

- Consume choline

## What Are The Potential Consequences Of Straying From The Ketogenic Diet

# What are the potential consequences of straying from the ketogenic diet?

When you have a cheat meal and you eat carbs, you spike insulin which then reacts to store glucose. You end up with a low blood sugar situation. This is when hunger sets in, the cravings start, and other negative effects like anxiety happen.

Cheating on keto can kick you out of fat burning for 1 to 3 days.

Of course, when you eat carbs you will feel better, but not for very long. Soon after the carbs, you’re left wanting more and more. By eating carbs you’re also depleting a lot of essential nutrients.

How to recover from a cheat day on keto:

- Drink apple cider vinegar with water

- Start fasting

- Exercise

- Take potassium and sodium

- Consume B vitamins

## What Is The Difference Between Ketogenic And Paleo Diets

# What is the difference between ketogenic and paleo diets?

A paleo diet is a dietary plan based on foods similar to what might have been eaten during the Paleolithic era, which dates from approximately 2.5 million to 10,000 years ago.

A paleo diet typically includes lean meats, fish, fruits, vegetables, nuts and seeds – foods that in the past could be obtained by hunting and gathering. A paleo diet limits foods that became common when farming emerged about 10,000 years ago. These foods include dairy products, legumes and grains.

Paleo, despite being healthy, allows more carbs from fruit and sweet potato or yams. Paleo also allows you to eat a greater percentage of protein compared to the ketogenic diet, where your only carb source is vegetables and you consume high amounts of fat and moderate amounts of protein.

## Does Keto Diet Make You Gassy

# Does Keto diet make you gassy?

Keto itself should not cause gas, but you may have preexisting gastrointestinal problems that do cause it.

Colon cells have “roots” that absorb the nutrients passing through the intestines. If you have pre-existing problems with your colon cells, they wouldn’t absorb nutrients and that would prevent the combination of certain enzymes with food particles to break down the food for absorption into the cells. You could end up having undigested food particles in the intestines. The undigested food then would either rot or ferment, causing gases.

Sources of this problem:

- Antibiotics – destroy some of your body’s microbes and cause the body to make more of the unfriendly microbes

- Antacids – when you lose the acidity of the stomach and as you age, you lose the stomach acids

- Junk food

- Small intestines (overgrowth of bacteria entering small intestines can cause gases)

Recommendation:

- Adjust the type of fiber that you consume

- Adjust the quantity of fiber – start with small amounts and gradually increase over time.

## What Is A Speed Keto Diet Plan

# What is a speed keto diet plan?

For those on the Healthy Keto® diet seeking to enhance intermittent fasting, ensure you're already following these steps:

\- Intermittent fasting with 1 to 2 meals within 4 hours

\- Ketogenic diet with less than 20 grams of carbs per day

\- Plenty of salad, moderate protein, and sufficient healthy fats

\- Avoidance of soy oil and regular exercise

To elevate your progress:

1\. Avoid starchy vegetables like squash, corn, and carrots.

2\. Enhance insulin resistance with potassium, Vitamin D, plant-based trace minerals, and Vitamin B1.

3\. Incorporate full-body high-intensity exercise twice a week with adequate recovery.

4\. Manage stress using techniques like acupressure to reduce cortisol levels.

5\. Consider choline supplements if you have a fatty liver.

**\*We recommend consulting with your doctor before making any dietary changes, especially if you have any existing health conditions.**

## Will Bulletproof Coffee Block My Autophagy

# Will bulletproof coffee block my autophagy?

If you make bulletproof coffee with small amounts of additives, like 1 tablespoon of mct oil, 1 tablespoon of butter, this should be fine. It may inhibit the autophagy for a little bit, but it will kick back in shortly after.

Now, if you do half-and-half it may cause more difficulty due to some content of carbs and protein.

Autophagy is a state when you are in fasting mode and the body starts repairing and recycling its damaged proteins and microbes; in that state the need for vitamins and nutrients goes way down.

## What Is The Best Keto Food After Menopause

# What is the best keto food after menopause?

Most postmenopausal women go straight for the calcium supplements, like calcium carbonate, to build bone. But this is a mistake. This could potentially increase the risk of heart attacks.

The vitamin they may really need more of is vitamin K2. It’s also important not to go on a low- fat diet.

## What Is The Most Effective Diet For Reducing Belly Fat During Menopause

# What is the most effective diet for reducing belly fat during menopause?

The keto diet is the best diet for menopausal women.

During menopause, women experience a sudden loss of ovarian function. With that comes a spike in insulin, which causes belly fat.

When you go through menopause, your insulin is going to be higher and you’ll have insulin resistance. Here’s the Healthy Keto® way to handle it:

- Cut carbs down to 20 to 50 g per day (eat plenty of vegetables though)

- Moderate protein

- Don’t go low-fat

- Intermittent fasting: 3 meals with no snacks (and if you’re not hungry, don’t eat)

Is keto beneficial to menopausal women? Yes. You want to do keto and get into ketosis, especially if you’re going through menopause. Healthy Keto is the healthiest way, and the lowest- stress way, to lose belly fat.

## Can I Consume Breakfast On Keto

# Can I consume breakfast on Keto?

Many people say it’s the most important meal of the day–right? Some people will say that there are a lot of negative health consequences associated with skipping breakfast.

The idea that breakfast is the most important meal of the day and that skipping breakfast is a bad thing basically started with a fear campaign to get people to eat more cereal and bacon.

Dr. Berg believes it’s false that eating breakfast is important. If you skip breakfast, you could potentially help prevent certain health problems.

The real benefits of skipping breakfast:

- Weight loss

- Less appetite

- Mental clarity

- Faster metabolism

- Fewer cravings

- Better mood

- Less tendency toward metabolic syndrome

## What Is Fat Adaptation

# What is fat adaptation?

If you aren’t familiar with keto already, the goal is to go from burning sugar (glucose) for fuel to burning fat (ketones) for fuel.

Fat adaptation is a transition from sugar-burning into ketosis (the body burns fat for energy, and if you are doing keto to achieve weight loss, the body burns its own fat).

When you first start keto, here’s what to expect:

- Around 3 days in, you begin burning ketones (instead of glucose)

- At around 1 to 2 weeks, you lose a lot of water weight

- At around 3 weeks, weight loss may slow down temporarily

- At around 4 to 12 weeks, most people become fully fat-adapted (weight loss increases)

- At around 12 months, athletes become fully fat-adapted

## Are Granola Bars Keto Friendly And Safe To Consume

# Are granola bars keto-friendly and safe to consume?

No.

When you see a box of granola bars, you may note that the packaging says it’s 100% natural and organic, and it contains no artificial flavoring or coloring. That means that it must be healthy – right?

If you read the back label of the granola bars, the “healthy” granola bar may not seem so healthy. Here’s what is in a typical granola bar:

- Whole oats

- Sugar

- Canola oil

- Yellow corn flour

- Soy flour

- Brown sugar syrup

- Baking soda

- Natural flavoring

Keep in mind that the first few ingredients on a particular label typically make up the majority of the product.

These ingredients make up 29 grams of carbohydrates per serving. They are very high on the glycemic index, which means they have the potential to contribute to blood sugar issues and weight gain.

In summary, granola bars are not keto-friendly at all. They contain a massive amount of sugar that will knock you out of ketosis very quickly. Avoid these products at all costs.

## What Vegetables Are The Most Keto Friendly

# What vegetables are the most keto-friendly?

Healthy vegetables that have less than 1 carb per cup:

- Beet greens

- Arugula

- Lettuce

- Bok choy

- Chard

- Endive

- Mustard greens

- Spinach

- Sprouts

- Romaine

- White cress

You’re allowed 20 to 50 grams of carbs per day on the Healthy Keto® eating plan. Sometimes when people do keto, they’re afraid to eat too many vegetables because of the carbs. But if you consume these low-carb veggies, the carbs would basically be insignificant. These vegetables won’t stop you from losing weight, and they provide benefits like fiber and nutrients.

Healthy vegetables that have less than 3 carbs per cup:

- Avocado

- Asparagus

- Celery

- Chili pepper

- Cucumber

- Eggplant

- Mushroom

- Pickles

- Radish

- Zucchini

- Cabbage

Tomatoes in moderate amounts are OK.

High-carb vegetables (not recommended):

- Artichoke

- Pumpkin

- Rutabaga 

- Turnip

- Potato

- Corn

- Squash

- Peas

## What Is A Lazy Keto

# What is a lazy keto?

Lazy keto is when you do not count calories or ketones. You primarily focus on counting carbohydrates–and keeping them below 50 grams per day. Lazy keto also involves consuming a moderate amount of protein (roughly 3 to 8 oz per meal) and consuming high amounts of fat (without focusing on the quality of fat).

---

## Does Stress Affect My Weight Loss On Keto

# Does stress affect my weight loss on keto?

Stress may actually prevent ketosis. When you spike cortisol, which is a stress hormone, you could start to break down your protein and turn it into glucose.

Basically, when you have a lot of stress, your blood sugars rise, which will cause insulin to spike to lower the elevated blood sugar.

Over time, this could create insulin resistance, which could lead to diabetes. Synthetic cortisol, like prednisone, may have the same effect.

**What may help:**

- Start increasing your exercise

- Consume vitamin B1 (nutritional yeast)

- Consume potassium (vegetables)

- Consume magnesium (vegetables)

- You can also get Dr. Berg’s Adrenal & Cortisol Support supplement

- You can also get Dr. Berg’s Adrenal Stress Advanced Formula supplement

**\*We recommend consulting with your doctor before making any dietary changes, especially if you have any existing health conditions.**

## How Do I Boost My Discipline For Keto And Exercise

# How do I boost my discipline for keto and exercise?

Discipline is self-control, not laziness. If you feel lazy, you may just need more energy. Start with the keto diet for increased energy and exercise. Boost your emotions to naturally enhance discipline—listen to music, partner with friends, or surround yourself with upbeat people. Speed up your activities, as moving and talking quickly can boost discipline.

Get a trainer or coach to push you further and provide valuable information. Keep your word to build willpower and integrity. Simplify your meals and workout routines—opt for easy meals and try working out for 10 minutes instead of skipping exercise altogether.

## I Just Started Keto. Can I Have A Cheat Meal

# I just started keto. Can I have a cheat meal?

It is certainly not recommended.

When you first start keto and you’re not fully adapted to fat burning, just one cheat meal can mean it takes you a lot longer (24+ hours) to get back on track.

Look for alternative types of pleasure foods that mimic the brownies, cakes, cookies, bread, pizza etc. that you crave. Go for keto-friendly, low-carb, no-sugar treats to satisfy that craving.

Once you start cheating it is hard to stop because sugar is addictive. Having cheat meals will put your blood sugar levels on a roller coaster. Having unstable blood sugars will not help you correct insulin problems that are a barrier to weight loss.

Once you are fully keto-adapted and have enough health reserve, if you decide to have a cheat meal you can bounce back a lot quicker to make up for the damage. Your goal is to create health with consistency. Start where you are and build yourself up to being 100%.

## What Is Too Much Fat On A Ketogenic Diet

# What is too much fat on a ketogenic diet?

Too much dietary fat can cause:

\- Floating stool

\- Bloating

\- No weight loss

\- Right shoulder/rib pain

\- Nausea

\- Oily stool

\- Lack of appetite

If you have these symptoms, reduce fat to 75 grams per day.

For hypoglycemia, you might need more fat but avoid gallbladder overload. Excess fat between meals prevents burning body fat in ketosis. Combine ketosis with intermittent fasting.

Aim for 70% of calories from fat (20-40g per meal). Gradually increase fat to adapt. Once adapted, you'll burn stored fat more efficiently.

## How Can I Adjust To Incorporating More Fat Into My Diet While On Keto

# How can I adjust to incorporating more fat into my diet while on keto?

You may have started eating too much fat or added more too suddenly – more than your digestive system is used to. Cut back a little bit, and gradually increase it. Gallbladder or liver problems could cause difficulties with digesting fat as well.

Taking purified bile salts, choline, or lipase can help with fat digestion.

## What Is Better On Keto Chicken Or Pork

# What is better on keto, chicken or pork?

You would want to consume fattier proteins on a ketogenic diet. If you compare pork and chicken, pork has a higher fat content. However, you can still consume chicken with the skin to supply yourself with healthy fats.

## What Is Insulin

# What is insulin?

Insulin is a hormone made by the pancreas that lowers blood sugar and allows cells to absorb nutrients. Insulin is like a key that unlocks cells and opens the door to allow glucose and nutrition to go into the cells. Insulin stores sugar in the liver and muscle, in the form of glycogen that is released for quick energy. It is also a fat-making hormone that will convert extra sugar into body fat.

The problem with insulin roots in too much insulin due to too much dietary sugar, as insulin in itself is not bad for your body. High amounts of sugar will trigger high amounts of insulin, and as a result your cells eventually are going to resist excess insulin; initially your pancreas will produce more insulin to counter this resistance. Over time, the pancreas becomes exhausted and produces less insulin leaving the blood sugars uncontrolled. This condition is called insulin resistance. Insulin resistance is behind many body problems, including type 2 diabetes but also metabolic syndrome.

## How Can I Prevent Adrenal Fatigue Or Keto Flu On The Keto Diet

# How can I prevent adrenal fatigue or keto flu on the keto diet?

If you are suffering from fatigue and keto flu, you may need to consume more sea salt. Low blood pressure and lightheadedness are two more signs you may be suffering from a lack of salt. Starting a keto plan prompts significant water loss, as high-carb diets typically lead to water and sodium retention. Opt for sea salt over table salt; Himalayan pink sea salt, being unrefined, is preferable. Table salt often contains additives like dextrose, making natural salts like Himalayan pink sea salt a better choice for overall health.

Himalayan pink sea salt is beneficial because it:

• Is unrefined

• Has 84 minerals

• Is unpolluted

• Contains trace minerals

• Is antimicrobial

• Can help support healthy blood sugars

## What Are The Most Reliable Predictors Of A Heart Attack

# What are the most reliable predictors of a heart attack?

Calcium and cholesterol act as band-aids to help repair the artery. But this is late on the chain of events after inflammation and after high insulin. High insulin starts this chain of events in place with the eventual hardening of your arteries, high blood pressure, and plaquing.

The coronary artery feeds the heart muscle blood and if this muscle does not get its oxygen, then it cramps and you get a heart attack. A simple test (CAC) costing under $100 and taking 2 seconds, can give you valuable feedback on your past lifestyle and score things for you. Reducing insulin with healthy ketosis and intermittent fasting is the first action to start with since high insulin triggered this problem in the first place.

**\*The above information is not intended for diagnosis. If you have any health concerns you should consult your physician.**

## How Can I Improve My Sleep When On Intermittent Fasting Plan

# How can I improve my sleep when on Intermittent fasting plan?

**Sleep is vitally important when you’re on keto and intermittent fasting. Let’s find out how to improve sleep if you’re having challenges.**

A lack of high-quality sleep could be the reason you’re not losing weight. Most of the hard-core fat-burning through the stimulation of growth hormone happens when you’re asleep. Also, fixing insulin resistance and blood sugar problems requires sleep. If you have diabetes, you probably notice that your blood sugars are way off on the days when you didn’t get a good night’s sleep.

Insomnia is a symptom of another problem; insomnia isn’t a disease. Let’s go through some reasons why you may not be getting high-quality sleep.

**The first is frequent eating.** If you’re not doing intermittent fasting, and you eat snacks between meals, that will spike your insulin. You’ll be tired during the day but not be able to sleep at night. So, plus in intermittent fasting. Three meals per day, no snacks, then gradually move to two meals per day, no snacks.

**Second, you may be getting up frequently to urinate.** That’s a problem with insulin resistance. One of the symptoms of diabetes is frequent urination. Doing keto and intermittent fasting correctly will eventually correct the frequent urination. If you want to do a test to determine if you have a problem with insulin resistance, get a test called HOMA-IR.

Or you may have problems with your adrenals caused by accumulated stress in your body. Your body is in a constant state of flight or fight. I suggest a natural sleep aid and massage. If you’re consuming foods that cause you to bloat, such as cruciferous vegetables, that could disrupt your sleep. Start eating regular green lettuce instead, for example. Reduce the amount of cruciferous vegetables you consume, then gradually increase it.

**Lastly, sleep apnea could be the culprit.** It’s a problem of too much insulin. Keto and intermittent fasting will eventually correct it and help improve your sleep.

## How Long Do I Need To Fast To Spike Brainpower

# How long do I need to fast to spike brainpower?

**To start seeing these incredible cognitive benefits, you have to fast for at least 18 hours a day.**

With an 18:6 intermittent fasting pattern, you would fast for 18 hours and have a 6-hour eating window. This means no snacking while fasting. You can eat during your 6-hour window, but I recommend only two meals. If you are still hungry, add more fat at the end of your meals.

Ketones are very therapeutic for your brain.

**There are three ways to get your body to produce ketones:**

1\. Go on the keto diet

2\. Fasting

3\. Exercise

## I Have No Appetite On Intermittent Fasting   What Do I Do

# I have no appetite on Intermittent fasting - what do I do?

As soon as people start doing intermittent fasting, their appetite goes away, they feel better, they have less inflammation, and they have more energy. But, the thing that most people focus on is weight loss. Many think that the more weight they lose, the healthier they are. But weight loss is just one part of getting healthy.

One problem that many people have is they begin to stop doing healthy keto. This is a huge problem, especially when you're doing one meal a day. Why? Because this can cause some serious nutrient deficiencies. Some nutrient deficiencies take a long time to develop. Others happen quickly. Vitamin B12, for instance, can be stored in the body for up to a year. Other nutrients like potassium aren't stored for very long.
If you felt great when you first started intermittent fasting, but down the road, you started to feel worse and worse, this is a sign of a nutrient deficiency.
**
Signs you may have nutritional deficiencies:**

• Tiredness

• Dizziness

• Weakness

• No endurance

• Hair loss

• Brittle nails

• Mood changes

• Cognitive issues

**If you start consuming just one meal a day on your intermittent fasting program, you should increase your intake of:**

• Omega 3 fatty acids (unless you consume salmon and other fatty fish every other day)

• Protein (8-10 oz. athletes may need more)

• Vitamin C/E/B9/D (eat your vegetables!)

• Minerals

• Trace Minerals

## What Is Bulletproof Coffee And Is It Recommended For A Ketogenic Diet

# What is bulletproof coffee, and is it recommended for a ketogenic diet?

Bulletproof coffee is coffee with grass-fed butter, MCT oil / coconut oil, and cream blended into it. It’s consumed in the morning as a meal replacement. It’s a good thing, and can be a great first step to start out with because the fat in the coffee will allow you to go a longer period of time before feeling hungry again.

You should know that bulletproof coffee will trigger insulin a little bit. For most this will not raise blood sugars, but will raise ketones. The added fat can cause your weight loss to slow because your body will convert this fat into ketones and burn it as fuel instead of using your own fat reserve. Once you have become fat-adapted you may want to remove the butter and MCT oil from your coffee.

One bulletproof coffee hack is coffee, MCT oil, xylitol and 100% cacao powder. Xylitol is 30 on the glycemic index, not zero, so it does influence the blood sugars a little bit, but not in a significant way. The 100% cacao enhances cognitive function, it has cardiovascular protection, it helps your blood sugars, it’s anti-inflammatory and it can improve your mood.

## What Can I Do If Im Extremely Hungry On Intermittent Fasting

# What can I do if I'm extremely hungry on Intermittent Fasting?

1\. Go slower and gradually ease into it.

2\. Increase fat in the meal or increase more protein.

3\. Decrease carbs (20-50g/day). If your carbs are too high, you'll never get into ketosis.

4\. Increase your vegetable intake (7-10 cups) to get your potassium and magnesium.

5\. Add apple cider vinegar to your meals.

6\. If you have to snack, consume fat as your snack.

**It takes 4-5 days to start getting into ketosis.**

## What Is The Difference Between The Traditional Keto Diet Plan And Heal B771A7

# What is the difference between the traditional keto diet plan and Healthy Keto?

Any type of ketogenic diet, by limiting net carbs, also reduces your fat-storing hormone. To distinguish my keto program from others, I coined the term “Healthy Ketosis.” It’s based on a guiding principle of mine: It’s not “Lose weight to get healthy,” it's “Get healthy to lose weight!” Healthy Keto is groundbreaking because it emphasizes obtaining your required nutrients from high-quality foods such as organic vegetables, full-fat organic dairy, and wild-caught, grass-fed, pasture-raised meat, fish, fowl, and eggs—with the goal to get you healthy to lose weight rather than lose weight to get healthy.

## How To Overcome No Will Power To Start Intermittent Fasting

# How to overcome no will power to start Intermittent Fasting?

Fasting is an exercise for willpower. Willpower is the ability to control your thoughts and actions in order to do what you want. It's the power of self-control. It's your personal power to overcome things like temptations, addictions, and cravings. 

Willpower helps you stick to something, but it's like a muscle that needs to be developed and strengthened. You can do this through intermittent fasting. Intermittent fasting is basically a workout to improve your willpower. 

**Fasting removes barriers that keep people from doing fasting in the first place, such as:**

• Hunger

• Cravings

• Bad habits 

**Tips to help with fasting and enhance your willpower:**

1\. Start doing intermittent fasting (skip breakfast and don't consume snacks) without keto 

2\. Add MCT oil 

3\. Start Healthy Keto

4\. Find keto-friendly replacements for your favorite foods

## Does Keto And Fasting Increase Stress Hormones

# Does Keto and fasting increase stress hormones?

**The answer is no.**

Some people believe that it appears to be stressful on the body because you're starving the body of glucose. But, a person has fat on their body to be used as fuel. I believe it's logical that our bodies are meant to run off of fat between meals.

**Cortisol is a stress hormone. Cortisol is also called glucocorticoid. One of the big functions of cortisol is to keep your blood sugars from getting too low. It will release stored glucose or cause the production of glucose to maintain the blood sugars. This isn't a stress event. It's a normal thing that occurs in the body.**

It takes about three days for the body to start adapting from burning glucose to burning fat. Cortisol can rise a little bit when a person goes through the three-day keto-adaptation phase, but then it levels out.

When you run your body on glucose, it is very stressful for the body, and you can't tap into your own fat. But, when you get into ketosis, you could go from a stress state to a much higher level of calmness and state of well-being. Burning fat or being in ketosis is a non-stressful state. Keep in mind, when you start keto and fasting, it's important to take electrolytes and B vitamins.

## Does Fasting Help With Adhd

# Does fasting help with ADHD?

Some fascinating research shows that intermittent fasting and prolonged fasting may significantly affect the brain's frontal lobe and create significant improvements in cognition. 

**Fasting may potentially help improve cognitive functions, including:**

• Focus 

• Memory 

• Concentration

• Clarity 

• Creativity 

**The study relates to improving the front part of the brain, which is involved with:**

• Paying attention

• Making decisions

• Organizing 

• Planning 

Experts will say that ADHD is a chemical imbalance, that it's genetics, or that the brain is somehow rewired for these symptoms. But, these theories have never been proven. There are medications, but they have side effects that may even potentially create the same symptoms they're supposed to get rid of. 

Basically, with fasting, you stop feeding the brain glucose. As a survival mechanism, the body switches over to making a preferred source of fuel called ketones.  Certain parts of the brain need glucose, but the body can make the glucose it needs from non-carbohydrate sources like fat and protein. You don't need to consume glucose to feed the brain glucose. 

When you fast, you give the brain ketones. Ketones can do many incredible things, including potentially improving cognitive functions. 

**If you have any problems with focus, concentration, or clarity, you may want to try fasting as well as a few other things, including:**

• Vitamin B1 (nutritional yeast) 

• Zinc 

• Omega-3 fatty acids

## Can Intermittent Fasting Reverse A Poor Age Related Memory Loss

# Can intermittent fasting reverse a poor age-related memory loss?

**Age-related memory loss is not normal.** You can improve memory loss, and if it’s not too far gone, you may even be able to reverse poor memory. The key to getting memory, focus, and concentration back is to understand the basic problem and the different factors that relate to it. 

Certain areas in the brain make insulin. These areas are also the same areas that are involved with memory problems that are related to diseases like Alzheimer’s. 

**Areas of the brain that make insulin:**

• Hippocampus – memory, and learning 

• Prefrontal Cortex — short term memory, planning, decision making, goals, differentiating good and bad, trivial vs. important, consequences, selective attention 

• Olfactory Bulb – Sense of smell

If there’s too much insulin, the body protects itself by developing insulin resistance around the blood-brain barrier. After that, the body may start to develop amyloid plaques. Amyloid plaque is a type of protein that sticks together, making the protein unusable and difficult to leave the body. 

**Fasting is one of the most powerful things you can do to avoid amyloid plaques. Starting at 16 hours of fasting, the body starts the process of autophagy (the body starts eating up damaged and misfolded proteins that turn into amyloid plaque).**  

**Action steps for those with Alzheimer’s disease or memory loss signs:**

• Get on healthy keto

• Start fasting

• Take MCT oil

• Take exogenous ketones

## Can Type 1 Diabetics Do Prolonged Fasts

# Can type 1 diabetics do prolonged fasts?

Dr. Berg Nutritionals staff, including Dr. Berg Advisors, do *not* encourage prolonged fasting. We are not healthcare professionals equipped with the tests and facilities to perform the necessary monitoring during a prolonged fast, nor do we have an individual's medical health records. Dr. Berg Advisors provide this document based on Dr. Berg's education for informational purposes only to those already on a prolonged fast or independently choosing to do one.

**Always consult with your healthcare provider before starting a prolonged fast.  If you're considering prolonged fasting, discussing the benefits and risks with your healthcare provider is essential.**

[Dr. Berg's Guidelines for Prolonged Fasting.docx](https://realdrberg-my.sharepoint.com/:w:/g/personal/shawnh_drberg_com/EazcZ9dNJ6VDhEOO13hV0F8BnVvc-Ge6y2mYjpN-FnojYg?e=RHdisz&clickparams=eyJBcHBOYW1lIjoiVGVhbXMtRGVza3RvcCIsIkFwcFZlcnNpb24iOiI1MC8yNDAzMzEwMTgxNyIsIkhhc0ZlZGVyYXRlZFVzZXIiOmZhbHNlfQ%3D%3D).

**The focus of type-1 diabetics is to keep their glucose level under control. This is important. However, it’s also important to keep an eye on your level of insulin. The number of carbs you eat determines the amount of insulin you need. So if you consume lots of carbs, you have to use a lot of insulin. Insulin takes excess glucose and starts to store it throughout the body.**

Taking too much insulin is just as bad as having too much glucose. Fasting will help lower the amount of insulin that you need. Many type-1 diabetics have something called double diabetes.

This is a situation where your pancreas isn’t able to produce insulin (type-1), and your cells are also resistant to insulin (type-2). This means that taking insulin doesn’t always work—your insulin receptors don’t absorb the insulin you inject.

Doing fasting and healthy keto helps prevent insulin resistance.

**While you fast, it’s important to also take nutrients, including:**

• Electrolytes

• B-vitamins

• Trace minerals

• Vitamin C

• Vitamin E

## What Are Important Fasting Rules

# What are important fasting rules?

The 7 most important intermittent fasting rules are as follows:

**1\. Hydration is Key**: Drinking water, tea, and coffee while fasting is beneficial. Certain teas can help extend your fast and reduce hunger. Coffee is fine, but avoid excessive consumption.

**2\. Supplement Wisely:** Taking supplements like vitamins, electrolytes, trace minerals, nutritional yeast, and omega-3 fatty acids is important while fasting. A green drink without fiber, like wheatgrass juice powder, is acceptable. Avoid protein powders and branched-chain amino acids. Bone broth or MCT oil can be tried but may not suit everyone.

**3\. Listen to Your Hunger Cues**: Only eat when you're truly hungry. If you reach your fasting goal and feel like you can go longer, it's okay to extend your fast. However, don’t push yourself to the point of weakness, fatigue, irritability, or dizziness.

**4\. Refeed Gradually:** After fasting for 48 hours or more, reintroduce food slowly. Start with a small amount of food and wait before gradually increasing your intake.

**5\. Monitor Insulin Resistance:** Your ability to fast can indicate your insulin resistance level. If fasting is easy, your insulin resistance may be improving. Difficulty fasting may suggest you still have insulin resistance and need more time and effort.

**6\. Combine with Healthy Keto:** Pair intermittent fasting with a healthy keto diet. This combination helps keep insulin levels low and offers numerous health benefits. A high-carb diet could undermine the benefits of intermittent fasting.

## When Should I Exercise During Fasting

# When should I exercise during fasting?

Typically a big mistake people make is adding too many things like keto, intermittent fasting, and exercise too fast. Maybe they’re trying to go to two meals a day right away and are exercising on top of that. This could be too much too soon.

A good indicator to know if you’re ready for exercise is how you feel when you start to exercise.

You may not want to do things like cardio or interval training early in the morning if you’re fasting. You could deplete your glycogen reserve, and if you’re not adapted, you’re going to get really hungry. You may want to exercise just before your meal, in-between your first and second meal, or just after your last meal. Some people may benefit from adding more protein to their diet when they workout.

Some people may also need to add a meal when they work out if they are too hungry and haven’t fully adapted yet. Another thing that may help is creatine. Creatine could potentially help improve recovery and increase muscle mass. Creatine doesn’t have to be taken with a meal.

## How Often Should I Do Intermittent Fasting

# How often should I do Intermittent Fasting?

Intermittent fasting offers several schedules, each with its own benefits. The 16:8 method involves fasting for 16 hours and eating within an 8-hour window, typically with two meals. Alternatively, the 20:4 schedule extends the fasting period to 20 hours, followed by a 4-hour eating window, offering additional benefits for brain function, heart health, repair, and anti-aging. OMAD (One Meal A Day) condenses eating into a single daily meal, sometimes necessitating alternate-day OMAD for optimal results. While intermittent fasting, it's advisable to combine it with a healthy ketogenic diet. Try to start with three meals a day without snacking, gradually transition to fewer meals, and listen to your hunger cues so that you can adjust your intermittent fasting plan to best suit your needs.

## What Are The Potential Side Effects Of Fasting

# What are the potential side effects of fasting?

The side effects of fasting occur primarily during the transition phase from eating to consuming nothing. Potential side effects include a spike in uric acid, feeling cold, moodiness, headaches, increased stomach acid, nausea when eating, fainting (if prolonged fasting is done too quickly), and hair loss. However, if you push through the symptoms and start the ketogenic diet and intermittent fasting correctly, they shouldn't be a significant problem.

## Will Fasting Slow Down My Metabolism

# Will fasting slow down my metabolism?

If you have been starving your body of nutrients, then it is true that your metabolism will slow down. You must be sure you have nutritional reserves and eat nutrient-dense foods Following a diet like Healthy Keto® will help with this. You do not want to fast for a long period of time (longer than 4-5 days), this can cause muscle loss. Start with intermittent fasting then gradually prolong to where you are comfortable.

## What Are The Most Common Mistakes That People Make On Intermittent Fasts

# What are the most common mistakes that people make on intermittent fasts?

Intermittent fasting provides a ton of health benefits. But some common intermittent fasting mistakes could cause it to be more difficult than it should be. For example, starting to quick and fasting for too long instead of slowly adjusting your eating window will cause many people to quit. Intaking more potassium, B vitamins and trace minerals can help with this.

Overindulging in carbs during an eating window will also make fasting more difficult as it spikes your insulin levels. Not eating enough nutrients or consuming low-quality ingredients during your eating window will also ruin your fasting experience. Finally, not consuming enough fat during your meals causes you to feel much hungrier during your fast, and can make you want to quit.

## What Are The Different Stages Of Fasting

# What are the different stages of fasting?

**Dr. Berg Nutritionals does not encourage prolonged fasting. We are not healthcare professionals equipped with the tests and facilities to perform the necessary monitoring during a prolonged fast, nor do we have an individual's medical health records. Dr. Berg Advisors provides this document based on Dr. Berg's education for informational purposes only to those already on a prolonged fast or independently choosing to do one.**

**Always consult with your healthcare provider before starting a prolonged fast. If you're considering prolonged fasting, discussing the benefits and risks with your healthcare provider is essential.**

The six stages of fasting:

Stage 1: 8-14 hours

• Stable blood sugar levels

• Using up stored sugar and sugar in the blood

• At 10 hours—the muscles use about 50% glucose and 50% fat (you’re starting to transition to fat-burning)

Stage 2: 14-24 hours

• Starting to get into ketosis

• Fewer cravings

• More energy

• Improved mood

• Improved cognitive function

Stage 3: 24-36 hours

• Full ketosis and fat burning

• The liver is making ketones

• Decreased appetite

• Decreased ghrelin

• Increased BDNF (new brain cells)

Stage 4: 36-48 hours

• Autophagy

• Kill cancer cells

• Decreased oxidative stress

• Decreased misfolded proteins

• Increased memory

Stage 5: 48-60 hours

• Insulin sensitivity super boost

• More autophagy

• Less inflammation

• Atrophy healing

• Protein sparing

Stage 6: 60-72 hours

• Immune system regeneration

• Spike in immune stem cells

• A 2014 study demonstrated that a 72 hour fast led to a complete rejuvenation of the immune system, and people on chemotherapy had less damage

## How Can I Avoid Getting Angry While I Do Intermittent Fasting

# How can I avoid getting angry while I do intermittent fasting?

When you start intermittent fasting, your body is initially running on sugar stores. After a long enough period, your body will have used up all the glycogen and will switch over to burning fat for energy. If you eat a meal high in sugars after a period of intermittent fasting, this will cause a drastic spike in insulin, leading to irritability. To avoid this, be sure that your meals are rich in nutrients and low in carbohydrates, so that your blood sugar remains in a healthy range and you do not experience mood swings.

## Im Losing Weight So Slowly   What Can I Do About It

# I'm losing weight so slowly - what can I do about it?

There’s a big difference between not losing any weight and losing weight slowly—and the actions you need to take for each will be entirely different. If you’re not experiencing any weight loss, you have to make a big change.

There’s something affecting your weight loss, and it could be related to your thyroid, adrenals, kidneys, and other parts of your body. To figure out what’s behind this issue, you have to dig deeper and do some testing. If you are experiencing some weight loss, you don’t want to make any huge changes. Instead, you want to strengthen your successful weight loss efforts.

Start by looking at the quality and quantity of your foods. Make sure you’re having moderate amounts of protein, plenty of healthy fats (avoid vegetable oils!), and very low amounts of carbohydrates and sugars (only get your carbs from low-carb vegetables). Avoid snacking. You should only eat 1-3 times a day. Intermittent fasting is a fantastic way to support a healthy body and avoid insulin spikes that block weight loss.

Problems with your sleep, digestion, or mensural cycle may also slow down weight loss. Insulin and Glucose Support is a great supplement for promoting weight loss if you have insulin issues.

## Why Is Having A Weight Loss Goal A Bad Idea

# Why is having a weight loss goal a bad idea?

**Your weight loss goal is setting you up for failure. I’ll explain by giving you several concepts, so you may want to take notes.** 

First, the difference between muscle and fat. One pound of fat takes up more space than one pound of muscle. Overweight people have less muscle than fat. A keto and intermittent fasting program will solve your stubborn weight and metabolism issue. When you start the program, you’ll lose fat and increase muscle because you’ll trigger certain muscle-building hormones as you train your body to use fat for fuel. You’ll also lose water weight. When you use up the stored sugar in your body, you’ll release the significant amount of water that’s attached to the glycogen. 

Most people who go on any weight loss program lose water weight for the first one to two weeks. But that weight loss isn’t consistent. Plus, when you start Keto and intermittent fasting you may or may not lose overall weight while you gain muscle. If you only focus on losing fat and not gaining muscle, you end up thinner but flabby and weak. You also may or may not lose inches. Most of the time you will, but you may plateau because you’re gaining muscle. Losing weight isn’t linear. It isn’t consistent when you’re gaining muscle along with losing fat. But this is what you want to develop a strong, healthy body. You don’t want your muscles to atrophy, although many people’s muscles do, especially women going through menopause. 

Plus, the more muscle you have, the better your metabolism. Muscle burns more calories. You want to make sure the calories being burned are from fat, not sugar. Lower your carb intake, and your body will burn fat. Hormonally, the difference between men and women comes down to two different hormones. Men have more testosterone. Women have more estrogen, which creates the fat layer around the female body. This is why men lose weight faster. They’re not dealing with the amount of estrogen that causes their body to create a fat layer. You see why I recommend not making weight loss your main goal. You’ll most likely just get frustrated and discouraged. Instead, have several goals: inches lost, weight loss, health improvement, and a strength goal. Weight loss isn’t the only measure of your success.

## Why Cant People Lose Weight

# Why can't people lose weight?

At 18, most people can burn fat easily. But, once a person gets into their forties or older, they start having a more difficult time with weight loss. So, what happens? Well, at age 18, you have the most fat-burning hormones that you will ever have. After 18, these hormones decrease. 

The problem with taking hormones to combat this problem is that your body will start to make even fewer hormones, and it will become dependent on the hormones you're taking. 

You're also born with fat-making hormones that peak around age 18. But, the fat-making hormones don't decrease—they stay the same. This makes trying to lose weight the same way you did when you were 18 impossible.  These fat-making hormones are really what's keeping your last little bit of fat-burning hormones from working. So, instead of taking hormones, why don't we just stop triggering the fat-making hormones? 

Insulin is the hormone that regulates blood sugars. Insulin is triggered by sugar, and it's a fat-making hormone. Cortisol is a stress hormone that's triggered by stress, and it's also a fat-making hormone. 

**How to help lower fat-making hormones to lose weight:** • Avoid sugar  • Reduce your stress

## Why Am I Tired On Keto

# Why am I tired on Keto?

Many of my patients ask me why they feel lethargic and fatigued when they go into ketosis. First, let’s talk about what ketosis is. On a ketogenic diet, you switch from using sugar as your primary fuel source to using fat. The purpose of fat is to protect the body from starving of sugar. So when you eliminate sugar, you naturally start burning fat. Most people don’t start burning fat reserves because they have a little too much sugar or carbs in their diet. You have to starve the body of sugar to really get into ketosis. To break down fat and turn it into fuel, your body now has to create new enzymes. This can take between three days and two weeks. There’s one nutrient that helps with this process. Without it, you are going to feel fatigued and lethargic. This nutrient is vitamin B5. This is a helper vitamin that boosts the metabolism of fat. Vitamin B5 also supports the adrenal glands, which helps with adrenal fatigue.

If you are tired on keto, grab some vitamin B5 from the health foods store and see how it affects your energy levels.

## What Is The Difference Between Zero Carb And Low Carb Diets

# What is the difference between zero-carb and low-carb diets?

It is the carbohydrates that determine whether you would get into ketosis or not. The higher the carbs, the less the ketosis, and the lesser the carb, the deeper the ketosis and ketosis is fat burning. The insulin index is the scale of foods that are non-carbohydrates in nature (like fat and protein) that has the capacity to influence insulin. The glycemic index is the scale of carbohydrates that affect blood sugars.

**Zero Carbs Foods:**

• Meat

• Fish

• Sea Foods

• Sardines

• Butter

• Coconut Oil

• Olive oil

• Whole cream (Heavy)

• Coffee

• MCT oil

**Low Carbs Foods:**

• Egg

• Veggies

• Half and Half

• Hummus

• Berries

• Lemon Juice

• Nuts

• Seeds

• Sour Cream

• Whey Protein

• Olives

• Avocado

## What Do I Do If I Dont Feel Satisfied After Eating On Keto

# What do I do if I don't feel satisfied after eating on Keto?

There are usually two reasons. Either you’re still having a problem with insulin resistance, or you have a gallbladder issue and aren’t releasing enough bile. If it’s low bile, my gallbladder formula may help.

Typically, though, people have a problem with insulin resistance. With insulin resistance, insulin isn’t connecting to the cell, and you’re unable to absorb nutrients, amino acids, and fuel. You might have to give it more time, but let’s make sure you’re doing keto correctly. You need a lot of vegetables. You don’t want to add carbs, or too much protein, because otherwise, you’ll prolong the insulin resistance.

But you can increase your fat intake. I love pecans; they’re the fattiest nut. Take a handful, and another if you need to until you feel satisfied. Nut butters are great with celery or maybe even carrots. The cheese is good too. Brie is a fatty cheese that will help satisfy you.

Apple cider vinegar is good to consume with a meal. It will help with insulin resistance. I like to consume salad or vegetables first, then protein, then fat. Mainly, give keto and intermittent fasting more time. If you have had a big problem with insulin resistance, it will take a while to heal it. As you do keto correctly, and give it more time, you’re going to start feeling more satisfied. I know keto and intermittent fasting will help you, which is why I urge you to be patient in order to get the outcome you want.

## Is Ketogenic Diet Safe For Thyroid

# Is Ketogenic diet safe for thyroid?

**What is the thyroid?** The thyroid is in the base of the neck, and it’s controlled by the pituitary. The thyroid makes T4, but T4 is inactive. T4 has to be converted to the active form, which is T3. 80% of the conversion happens through the liver, and 20 % happens through the kidney.

**How does keto affect thyroid function?** When you go on a ketogenic diet, T4 will decrease up to 40%.

But let’s look at the big picture. There are no studies out there that show any negative effects on the thyroid when you go on a keto or low-carb diet. Also, despite the 40% drop, there is no drop in metabolism. T3 is becoming more sensitive and more effective.  I believe that high carb diets increase the need for more thyroid hormone, so T3 is higher. With a keto diet, T3 goes down, but I think that’s not actually abnormal. I believe that number is normal for what our bodies are designed to use. 

**So, is keto safe for thyroid function?** Yes. When you’re on the ketogenic diet, you’re actually improving the efficiency of the thyroid.

## Why My Hypoglycemia Is Back And Im On Keto

# Why my hypoglycemia is back and I'm on Keto?

Someone was having an issue with keto where they said that keto didn’t work because even though they did keto and felt better after doing it for a month, they went back on their diet, and their hypoglycemia came back.

What causes hypoglycemia (low blood sugars) is something you ate that’s triggering insulin, and the insulin is pushing your blood sugars down. When you have hypoglycemia, you may think you need to consume sugar because your sugar is low. But, the problem with this is that you’re just going to activate insulin again, which will bring the blood sugar back down. I don’t believe you can correct hypoglycemia by consuming more carbs.

When someone starts the keto diet, they also really need to commit to it for longer than one month. If a person has hypoglycemia, they have very severe insulin resistance. It could take several years before this person could get into a stabilized position, and if the person was to go back to carbs, the situation would just come back. The keto and intermittent fasting plan is designed to be a lifestyle change.

## What Is The Main Cause Of High Blood Glucose Levels When I Am In Ketosis

# What is the main cause of high blood glucose levels when I am in ketosis?

When you do a healthy ketogenic plan and intermittent fasting, you are lowering insulin levels. Insulin suppresses blood sugars but insulin resistance ma still be an issue your body is dealing with. Lower amounts of insulin and insulin resistance cause the blood sugar to spike a little bit higher while you are still in ketosis. In addition, high blood sugar on keto can be caused by excessive protein, too many carbs, frequent meals, or high stress levels.

## How Can I Reduce My Blood Sugar Levels On Keto

# How can I reduce my blood sugar levels on keto?

To improve lower blood sugar on keto, start by reducing your carbohydrate intake and incorporating fasting into your routine. Regular exercise is crucial, and ensure you get adequate sleep while also spending time in the sun to boost your overall well-being. Manage stress effectively, and increase your fiber intake by eating more vegetables. Consider adding apple cider vinegar (ACV) to your diet and ensure you’re getting enough potassium and Vitamin B1 to support your health.

## What Is Autonomic Neuropathy

# What is autonomic neuropathy?

Neuropathy means nerve damage. With autonomic, we’re dealing with a part of the nervous system called the autonomic nervous system, which controls things automatically. It works on its own. 

The #1 cause of autonomic neuropathy is diabetes. But, you don’t end up with diabetes overnight. It’s a gradual condition that starts with high insulin, which leads to insulin resistance, then prediabetes, and finally, diabetes. Autonomic neuropathy is also a condition that gradually occurs. You could have one or more symptoms, which are really the beginning of this condition. 

**Symptoms of autonomic neuropathy:**

1\. Urinary retention 

2\. Hypertension

3\. Abdominal pain 

4\. Malabsorption 

5\. Gastroparesis 

6\. Constipation

7\. Sleep apnea 

8\. Abnormal sweating 

9\. Orthostatic hypotension (POTS) 

10\. Arrhythmias 

**What you could do about autonomic neuropathy:**

1\. Benfotiamine 

2\. Alpha-lipoic acid  + Keto and intermittent fasting

## What Is The Most Effective Remedy To Remove Blackheads

# What is the most effective remedy to remove blackheads?

A big mistake is doing things like over-cleansing the skin and using pore strips. These things actually make the problem worse by removing friendly bacteria that are there to help protect you against bad bacteria.

The root cause of blackheads is a spike in androgens caused by a spike in insulin and IGF-1.

**How to get rid of blackheads permanently:**

1\. Go on a low-carb diet (Healthy Keto)

2\. Cut out dairy from your diet

3\. Decrease omega-6 fatty acids and increase omega-3 fatty acids

4\. Take borage oil

## What Is The Most Effective Remedy To Reverse Wrinkles

# What is the most effective remedy to reverse wrinkles?

In this video, we’re going to talk about how to reverse wrinkles. GAG (glycosaminoglycan) helps hydrate and repair the skin and collagen, and helps make collagen. The hormone that controls GAG is IGF-1 (insulin-like growth factor 1). IGF-1 is triggered by growth hormone, which is the anti-aging hormone. There are a few things you can do to actually trigger this hormone naturally. 

How to reverse wrinkles:

1\. Lower insulin (do healthy keto and intermittent fasting) 

2\. Enhance your sleep and lower cortisol 

3\. Do HIIT (high-intensity interval training) 

4\. Consume a moderate amount of quality protein (3-6 oz. with each meal) 

5\. Enhance the liver (avoid alcohol, eat organic, consume a lot of vegetables, take supplements to support the liver) 

6\. Do Intermittent fasting (IGF-1 is stimulated when you’re not eating) 

7\. Take fat-soluble vitamins (vitamin A, vitamin D, and vitamin K2)

## Is It Safe And Beneficial To Undergo Colon Cleansing

# Is it safe and beneficial to undergo colon cleansing?

**There are several different types of colon cleansing:** 

• **Colon hydrotherapy** - This is where water goes up the rectum into the large intestine and flushes everything out. This can flush out you’re electrolytes. You may want to take electrolytes after, so you don’t become deficient. You’re also flushing out your friendly bacteria, which would need to be put back in. 

**• Herbal laxatives** - Creates a purging of the material out of the colon 

**• Colema** \- This is a combination of an enema and a colonic. The problem is that it’s very temporary. It also flushes out your electrolytes. If you’re already deficient in electrolytes, this can cause dizziness and even affect your heart. The apple juice a person is supposed to drink while doing the colema, can also keep the blood sugars up, preventing ketosis. 

Fixing your diet (doing keto) may be the best way to go. Typically, fixing the diet can fix whatever issue caused you to want to do the colon cleansing to begin with. I’m not against colon hydrotherapy as a short-term solution for constipation or other conditions. But, it should be supervised, and the electrolytes and friendly bacteria need to be put back in. 

**What you can do:** 

1\. Start fasting 

2\. Decrease inflammation 

3\. Consume phytonutrients 

4\. Consume fermented vegetables

## What Should I Do If Im Experiencing Hunger And Frequent Cravings

# What should I do if I'm experiencing hunger and frequent cravings?

Many people worry about cravings when starting a ketogenic diet, but both keto and intermittent fasting can help eliminate them.

High insulin levels lower blood sugar, leading to cravings. Reducing insulin through a low-carb diet is key, as carbs trigger insulin release. While protein can also spike insulin if consumed excessively, it’s important to keep protein intake moderate. Increasing fat consumption is crucial, as fat does not affect insulin, and including plenty of vegetables is beneficial.

The transition from sugar-burning to fat-burning may come with cravings, often lasting about three days. To speed up this process, use electrolyte powder, B vitamins from nutritional yeast, and apple cider vinegar with meals.

If you still feel hungry despite following a low-carb diet, consider these factors:

\- Not practicing intermittent fasting

\- Consuming hidden carbs

\- Low dietary fat

\- Insufficient adaptation time

\- Eating low-nutrient foods

\- Insulin resistance

\- Low bile production

Addressing these issues can help manage cravings and improve your success on keto.

## My Cholesterol Levels Are Too High On Keto. Why

# My cholesterol levels are too high on keto. Why?

Cholesterol is present in your fat cells. As you lose weight, your body is releasing your fat and cholesterol from your fat cells. This is why your cholesterol can go up, at least temporarily, when you start a ketogenic diet. However, most people find their cholesterol reduces.

## What Is Keto Adaptation

# What is Keto adaptation?

Most people have been running their bodies, for their whole lives, on a diet that is mostly carbs. When you are becoming keto-adapted your body will switch to burning fat and ketones instead of blood sugar. This transition can take anywhere from 3 days to 2 weeks.

## What Is A Recommended Fat Intake On A Keto Diet

# What is a recommended fat intake on a Keto diet?

When you first start keto and intermittent fasting, you’re going to need more fat. As you progress, you’ll need to consume less fat because your body is eating its own fat. The best way to judge how much fat you need is to base it on your hunger.

Eat enough fat to keep you comfortable and full between meals but not so much that you feel stuffed. On average, you’d consume:

**140 grams per day if you’re consuming three meals; 113 grams per day if two meals;**

**86 grams per day if you’re eating one meal per day.**

The meal plans on drberg.com, under Recipes, already have these keto macro amounts built into them.

## What Are The Benefits Of Insulin Beyond Glucose Regulation And How Doe 951C18

# What are the benefits of insulin beyond glucose regulation, and how does it support metabolic health and manage certain conditions?

The main reason why the keto diet and intermittent fasting work so well to support a healthy body is that they both help lower insulin. However, insulin has certain benefits. This is where the confusion starts. How can insulin be harmful and also have health benefits?

**Potential health benefits of insulin:**

• It helps lower blood sugar levels

• It supports muscle growth

• It protects against muscle atrophy

• It supports the arteries

• It helps lower LDL cholesterol

• It helps lower blood pressure

• It lowers the production of glucose in the liver

• It supports the absorption of potassium and magnesium

• It suppresses lipolysis

• It is a potent anti-inflammatory

• It has antioxidant properties

• Insulin nasal spray is used to help people who have dementia

• It helps increases testosterone

• It helps lower uric acid

The real problem is with the insulin receptors. When the receptors become resistant, as in insulin resistance, we lose the function of insulin. When someone has insulin resistance, they actually have an insulin deficiency. You may have excess insulin in your blood, but it’s not affecting the receptors. A high level of insulin is what creates insulin resistance. The more you increase insulin, the less the receptors will work.
