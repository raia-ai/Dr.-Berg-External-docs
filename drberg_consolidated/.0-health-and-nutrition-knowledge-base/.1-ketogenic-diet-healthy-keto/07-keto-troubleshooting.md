High levels of stress increase the hormone called cortisol which is a type of hormone that makes the liver increase sugars even without consuming sugar. The high levels of sugar then lead to high levels of insulin and with high insulin you cannot get into ketosis which can make you gain more weight. He also talks about the different causes of stress.

Cause of Stress:

• Problems

• Relationships

• Sick Parent/Child

• Losses

• Chronic Pain

• Constant Worry

Remedies:

• Take vitamin B1- Nutritional yeast is a good source.

• Long walks

• More Sleep

## What Are The Most Effective Strategies For Reducing Inflammatory Marke 810743

# What are the most effective strategies for reducing inflammatory markers in the body?

The first step I recommend is to eliminate all seed oils from your diet, including canola, soybean, and corn oils. These oils can contribute to inflammation. Additionally, it's important to assess your iron levels, as excessive iron intake can also lead to increased inflammation.

If you are not currently following a ketogenic diet, consider adopting it, as it may help reduce inflammation. Increasing your intake of vitamin D can be particularly beneficial in this regard. Some individuals find that niacin, along with niacinamide, can also aid in reducing inflammation, particularly at the cellular level, and may be worth incorporating into your regimen.

## What Could Be The Reasons For Constantly Feeling Cold

# What could be the reasons for constantly feeling cold?

If you’re following a ketogenic diet and find yourself feeling cold, it may be beneficial to increase your intake of vitamin B1 (thiamine). B1 plays a role in temperature regulation and can help improve your tolerance to extreme temperatures. For example, if you struggle with ice bath therapy due to discomfort, this could indicate a deficiency in B1.

Similarly, if you find yourself overheating easily when exposed to sunlight, it may also suggest a B1 deficiency. Additionally, incorporating iodine from sources like sea kelp could be beneficial. Together, these two nutrients may support better thermal regulation.

## Why Do I Run Out Of Breath While Exercising

# Why do I run out of breath while exercising?

If your heart rate takes a long time to return to normal after sprints, it might be due to a weaker parasympathetic nervous system, which controls recovery. Here are some tips to improve your recovery and endurance:

1\. **Exercise**: Do shorter workouts with sprints followed by longer rest periods to train your parasympathetic system.

2\. **Supplements**: Consider Co-enzyme Q10, Vitamin K2, and Vitamin E for better endurance.

3\. **Diet**: Achieve deeper ketosis and incorporate fasting to improve endurance.

For accurate assessment, testing with heart rate variability equipment is recommended. These steps should help strengthen your recovery system and enhance performance.

## Can I Eat Pomegranates On Keto

# Can I eat pomegranates on Keto?

In this video, Dr. Berg talks about pomegranate and is it okay to consume on a ketogenic diet. The juice is a bit too high in sugars despite having a moderate glycemic index, however, the seeds are low and they contain phytonutrients (antioxidants) that help your blood sugars and reduce insulin, so yes, on the seeds and NO on the juice.

## Can Damage To Brain Cells Lead To The Phenomenon Of Brain Fog

# Can damage to brain cells lead to the phenomenon of brain fog?

**Damage of brain cells**

Another cause of brain fog is damage of the brain cells, for example due to aging or injury. Additionally, lack of sleep can cause hormonal imbalance and this can result in a bad effect on your brain. Prolonged fasting will help not only with providing ketones to feed your brain, but also by activating autophagy (healing/detoxifying process in the body).

## Can I Consume Asparagus On Keto

# Can I consume asparagus on keto?

Yes. It has a lot of nutritional benefits:

- Prebiotic – a fiber that doesn’t break down until it hits the large intestines; the microbes in the large intestines live on this fiber, which helps you build up your friendly bacteria

- High in vitamin K, folate, and B1, 2, 3, 5 and 6 – good for stress and energy and calming your nervous system down

- High in phosphorus – a great way to improve your energy

- Diuretic – gets rid of excess fluids because asparagus is low in sodium and high in potassium so it is a mild kidney detoxifier

- Protection from kidney stones and dissolving them

- High in chromium – a mineral that helps repair insulin resistance. It makes your cells more insulin-sensitive, helping nutrients to go through the cell wall and regulating glucose. Great for diabetics, good for hypoglycemic people, and definitely helps insulin resistance

## Can I Add Honey To The Apple Cider Vinegar Drink For Keto

# Can I add honey to the apple cider vinegar drink for keto?

No. About 56% of honey is fructose and 44% of it is glucose. Honey has a glycemic index of 78, which is high. The problem with fructose is that only the cells in the liver can deal with it. So, fructose puts a lot of stress on the liver and can create a lot of additional problems. If you had to choose between honey and sugar, honey might be the better option because it has some antioxidants and some antimicrobial properties. It may also help with certain allergies. But, overall, honey is low in actual nutrients. It may be better than refined sugar, but not by much.

## Can I Consume Red Bull On Keto

# Can I consume Red Bull on keto?

No. In theory, energy drinks are supposed to help increase brain energy, exercise performance and endurance. However, most energy drinks will actually cause brain fog and reduce exercise performance – and the ingredients will deplete the cells.

The big problem with energy drinks is that the ingredients don’t give you real energy. These drinks are composed mostly of caffeine and sugar. Caffeine is not a fuel, it’s a stimulant. It makes you think you have energy, but really it’s just revving up your adrenal glands. There are also crazy amounts of sugar in energy drinks, which will later make you more tired and grumpy, and will make you want another energy drink. A lot of this sugar is not just glucose. It’s fructose.

These drinks also contain a lot of sodium and not enough potassium. You need to look for an energy drink that has all of the electrolytes, the electrically charged minerals that really do help to energize your cells. Potassium helps recharge the batteries in your cells. Magnesium feeds the mitochondria.

## Can I Consume Flaxseed Oil On Keto

# Can I consume flaxseed oil on keto?

Not really. It is a highly refined product and is not recommended on keto.

Although flax seeds are loaded with omega-3, ligands, fiber, B1, etc. the problem is that flax has enzymes and enzyme inhibitors that prevent the absorption of nutrients. If you consume sprouted flax, you will absorb nutrients much better.

## Can I Eat Tofu When I Am Fasting

# Can I eat tofu when I am fasting?

## Do I Need To Stop Eating Fruit

# Do I need to stop eating fruit?

You don't need to eliminate fruit entirely on a keto diet. Berries are a suitable option as they are lower in sugar compared to other fruits.

Some individuals, particularly those following a carnivore keto approach, incorporate fruit and honey due to their improved metabolic flexibility and lack of insulin resistance. However, this is not suitable for everyone. Many people may struggle to metabolize higher-sugar fruits, leading to potential complications.

For most individuals, it is advisable to limit fruit intake to maintain ketosis and avoid metabolic issues, unless they are highly active and can effectively burn off the extra sugars.

## Do Medications Slow Down Results From Keto And Intermittent Fasting

# Do medications slow down results from Keto and Intermittent Fasting?

Metformin and Insulin will definitely slow the results because the goal is to lower insulin. Steroids are an injection for inflammation and skin problems can block your keto results. Anti-Depressants could slow the results and will give you side effects such as weight gain and statins worsen the results.

**Some Top Medications:**

- Metformin

- Insulin

- Steroids

- Anti-Depressants

- Statins

## Optimal Vegetable Choices During Ketosis

# Optimal Vegetable Choices During Ketosis

## **Optimal Vegetable Choices During Ketosis**

So, how can you minimize the risk of diarrhea while still getting the nutrients you need from vegetables? The key is to choose options that are gentler on your digestive system.

### **Easily Digestible Vegetables for Keto Dieters**

Some of the best vegetables to consume during ketosis include green lettuce, cucumber, tomato, zucchini, bell pepper, and bean sprouts. These options are lower in fiber and more accessible for your gut microbiome to handle.

You can also try cooking your vegetables instead of eating them raw, as this can make them easier to digest. Steaming, sautéing, or roasting are all excellent options.

Focusing on these easily digestible vegetables can help prevent diarrhea and other digestive disturbances while still providing the nutrients your body needs to thrive on a keto diet.
