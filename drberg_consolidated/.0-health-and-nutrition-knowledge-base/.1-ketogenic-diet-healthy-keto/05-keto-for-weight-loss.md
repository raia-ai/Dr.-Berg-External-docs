## Would Lemon Water Help Me To Lose Weight On Keto

# Would lemon water help me to lose weight on keto?

There are no studies that demonstrate that drinking lemon water will help you lose weight. But, there are still benefits to lemon water.

Here are 3 amazing lemon water / lemon juice benefits:

1\. Citric acid

Will bind with oxalates and help reduce the risk of kidney stones

2\. Vitamin C

Lemons can provide a good amount of vitamin C; but, it needs to come from raw lemons

3\. Alkaline

Lemons turn into an alkaline compound in the body that can help decrease the risk of gout. It can also potentially reduce the risk of getting uric acid stones.

## Can You Eat As Much As You Want On Keto

# Can you eat as much as you want on keto?

A keto diet does not necessarily say how large you should make the meals you consume. It is recommended, though, that you consume enough to feel satisfied.

If you eat too much and snack often, even using keto-friendly ingredients, you will slow down your weight loss, as your insulin will be high. For the best results, it’s recommended that you follow the Healthy Keto® diet with an intermittent fasting plan.

## Whats The Difference Between Sea Kelp And Sea Weed

# What's the difference between sea kelp and sea weed?

## **Sea Kelp vs. Seaweed**

If you're interested in health, nutrition, weight loss, the ketogenic diet, and intermittent fasting, then you may have heard of [sea kelp and seaweed](https://www.drberg.com/blog/kelp-vs-seaweed-whats-the-difference).

While they may seem interchangeable for marine plants that grow in nutrient-rich saltwater environments, there are some key differences between these two natural food sources.

Sea kelp is a brown algae growing along rocky coastlines worldwide. It's known for its high nutrient profile and has been used as a traditional medicine in many cultures throughout history.

In addition to being rich in vitamins A, C, D, and E, as well as minerals such as iodine and iron, it also contains fucoidan, which has potentially anti-inflammatory properties.

"Seaweed" refers to any marine plant or algae that grows in saltwater environments. This includes red algae (such as nori), green algae (such as sea lettuce), and brown algae (such as bladderwrack).

Like sea kelp, seaweeds contain nutrients, including vitamins B12 and C, calcium, magnesium, potassium, zinc, iron, and copper - making them one of nature's most nutrient-dense foods.

### **Differences Between Sea Kelp And Seaweed**

**Taste:** Sea kelp tends to have a milder flavor than other types of seaweeds, which can be pretty salty or bitter, depending on the variety.

**Nutrient profile:** While sea kelp and seaweed offer similar nutritional benefits, their specific vitamin/mineral content will vary based on species/variety.

**Uses:** Sea kelp is often used in supplements or added to foods as a natural source of iodine. Seaweeds are more commonly consumed whole, fresh, or dried and can be used in various dishes such as soups, salads, sushi rolls, etc.

While sea kelp and seaweed may like the same thing, they have distinct differences that set them apart. However, both offer an impressive nutrient profile, making them excellent additions to any healthy diet.

### **Rich in Trace Minerals** 

One of the most well-known benefits of sea kelp is its high [iodine](https://www.drberg.com/blog/8-unexpected-benefits-of-iodine-must-watch) content, which plays a crucial role in maintaining healthy thyroid function.

In addition to iodine, sea kelp contains other essential trace minerals such as selenium and zinc. These minerals are vital for various bodily functions, including [immune system support](https://www.drberg.com/blog/how-keto-protects-your-immune-system), antioxidant activity, and DNA synthesis.

## Can I Consume Slimfast Products On Keto

# Can I consume SlimFast products on keto?

The main issues with SlimFast products are:

1\. **Poor Ingredients**: They contain high-glycemic sugars (maltodextrin, dextrose), GMOs (soy, canola oil, beet sugar), synthetic vitamins, and caffeine, which aren't suitable for a ketogenic diet.

2\. **Snack-Based**: These products are marketed as snacks, leading to frequent blood sugar spikes that hinder weight loss and are incompatible with intermittent fasting.

3\. **Lack of Integrity**: SlimFast still produces products with high sugar content (18g per serving), which contradicts their mission to improve health during an ongoing sugar consumption epidemic.

Overall, SlimFast seems to be capitalizing on market trends for profit, rather than genuinely promoting health.

## Is Slimfast Safe To Consume On Keto

# Is SlimFast safe to consume on Keto?

The first problem with these products is the ingredient list. The ingredients include:

- Maltodextrin (110 on the glycemic index–sugar is only 70!)

- Dextrose (Synthetic sugar with the glycemic index of 100)

- Tapioca

- Soy (GMO)

- Canola oil (GMO)

- Synthetic vitamins (poorly absorbed)

- Caffeine

- Beet sugar (GMO)

These are poor-quality ingredients, which should have no place in a ketogenic diet.

A second problem with these products is that they are snack-based–meaning they are meant to be eaten as snacks or treats, like chips, bars and energy boosters. This isn’t compatible with intermittent fasting. Consistent blood sugar spikes will halt weight loss.

A final problem with SlimFast is their integrity. They are still producing the original SlimFast, which has 18 grams of sugar (beet sugar). We have a massive epidemic right now of people consuming too much sugar. Promoting more sugar consumption is not okay for a company that is supposed to be helping people improve their health.

Overall, it seems that SlimFast is just trying to tap into a trending market to make a big profit.

## What Can I Eat For Breakfast On Keto

# What can I eat for breakfast on keto?

You can consume bacon and eggs, or many other foods, as your first meal of the day. But it’s not recommended that you have a morning meal, because it will cause you to lose the benefits of the morning fasting time added to your fast during the night. Try to push your first meal to a little later in the day – even to noon or early afternoon.

Ideally, you would combine a ketogenic diet with intermittent fasting, to get the most benefits for health and weight loss.

## Does Fasting Boost Testosterone

# Does fasting boost testosterone?

Intermittent fasting can potentially increase testosterone by 180%. It does this by triggering the hypothalamus and releasing GRH. Insulin will kill your testosterone levels, and fasting prevents you from having insulin spikes.

As you lose weight, it will likely get easier and easier to stimulate testosterone. Consider fasting for at least 16 hours with an 8-hour eating window. It may also be beneficial to work up to 20 hours of fasting with a 4-hour window of eating.
