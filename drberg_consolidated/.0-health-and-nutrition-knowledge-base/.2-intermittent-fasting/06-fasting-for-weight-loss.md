## Why Am I Losing Inches But Not Weight

# Why am I losing inches but not weight?

**There is nothing more frustrating than doing everything right with keto and intermittent fasting, and still not losing weight.** 

**Even if you're losing inches but not losing weight, the ketogenic diet is still working:**

• If you're losing inches

• If your hunger is going away

• If you're not craving anymore

• If you have more energy

A slow metabolism really is insulin resistance. Insulin is an anabolic hormone. If insulin is not working, you're not going to have the anabolic effect. As soon as you do keto and intermittent fasting, you're going to fix insulin resistance.  Once you fix insulin resistance, you're going to absorb more protein. Protein weighs more than fat per the same volume. This means, initially, you will lose inches but not weight. 

**This is because you're:**

• Absorbing protein

• Getting more muscle mass

• Fixing atrophy 

If you're not losing weight on keto, keep in mind that it is working. You're getting healthier. You have to get healthy to lose weight, not lose weight to get healthy.

## How Can I Increase Fat Intake On Keto

# How can I increase fat intake on keto?

To ensure sufficient fat intake on keto and intermittent fasting:

1\. Incorporate healthy fats into your diet, such as:

\- Avocado

\- Olive oil

\- Coconut oil

\- Nuts and seeds

\- Fatty fish

2\. Listen to your hunger cues rather than focusing solely on reaching a specific fat percentage. Eat until satisfied, adjusting fat intake accordingly.

3\. Allow your body to utilize its own fat stores for energy by gradually reducing fat intake as weight loss progresses.

4\. During maintenance phases, increase dietary fat to maintain weight, but adjust intake as needed to align with energy requirements.

## Can You Eat As Much As You Want On Keto

# Can you eat as much as you want on keto?

A keto diet does not necessarily say how large you should make the meals you consume. It is recommended, though, that you consume enough to feel satisfied.

If you eat too much and snack often, even using keto-friendly ingredients, you will slow down your weight loss, as your insulin will be high. For the best results, it’s recommended that you follow the Healthy Keto® diet with an intermittent fasting plan.

## Why Might Keto Not Be Effective For Me

# Why might Keto not be effective for me?

Healthy Keto® emphasizes a balanced macronutrient approach paired with nutrient-dense foods to optimize various health indicators, including energy levels, skin health, weight loss, cognitive function, inflammation, mood, cravings, and hunger management.

To implement keto effectively, consider the following guidelines:

\- **Avoid Fruits and Snacking**: Minimize intake of high-carb fruits and refrain from snacking between meals.

\- **Eat Only When Hungry**: Focus on true hunger cues rather than eating out of habit.

\- **Prioritize Healthy Fats and Greens**: Ensure that the majority of your diet consists of higher-fat foods and leafy greens.

\- **Incorporate Apple Cider Vinegar**: This can aid digestion and support metabolic health.

Aim for a protein intake of 3 to 6 ounces per meal, with fat comprising approximately 70% of your total caloric intake, and carbohydrates limited to 20 to 50 grams per day. For optimal results, consider combining the ketogenic diet with intermittent fasting, which can further enhance metabolic flexibility and support weight loss goals.

## If I Lose Weight On Keto Will I End Up With Loose Sagging Belly Skin

# If I lose weight on keto, will I end up with loose, sagging belly skin?

Following a Healthy Keto® diet and intermittent fasting can prevent loose skin after weight loss if done correctly. Your skin, the largest organ in the body, heals as you get healthier, improving collagen structure. Loose skin, or atrophy, often results from a protein deficiency worsened by insulin resistance, a common issue in weight gain.

The ketogenic diet addresses insulin resistance, enabling amino acids to enter cells and form proteins, which helps tighten the skin. During this process, you might experience a weight plateau as muscle, which is heavier than fat, rebuilds. However, you’ll notice your size shrinking and your waist getting smaller.

Combining keto with intermittent fasting spikes growth hormone levels up to 2000%, further preserving protein and supporting skin recovery.

## Is Keto Effective Without Intermittent Fasting

# Is Keto effective without intermittent fasting?

While keto is an effective diet that can improve overall health and reduce insulin resistance on its own, it is much more effective when combined with intermittent fasting. Even on a low-carb diet, the more often you eat, the more often you are raising your insulin levels. Intermittent fasting helps keep insulin levels low, making sure you stay in ketosis and lose weight more effectively. Intermittent fasting will also help you break any snacking habits you may have, further increasing the effectiveness of your keto diet.

## Does Fasting Help With Visceral Belly Fat

# Does fasting help with visceral belly fat?

Correct intermittent fasting patterns can target visceral fat. The key lies in maintaining a consistent ketogenic diet in combination with intermittent fasting, unlike patterns such as every-other-day fasting or the 5:2 method, which can slow down weight loss by disrupting the body's fuel adaptation process. For optimal results in targeting belly fat and correcting metabolism, combining keto with intermittent fasting is recommended.

## How Not To Get Your Wife To Lose Weight For Men Only

# How not to get your wife to lose weight? FOR MEN ONLY

The best way to get your wife to lose weight, hands down, is by using cash. Of course, I’m kidding!

First, let’s talk about what not to do. The next time you hug her, don’t pinch her fat. Stop giving her candy, donuts, and other similar items. When you’re at a restaurant and she orders something like bread or pasta, don’t shame her. For Christmas or her birthday, don’t give her presents like a scale, a tape measure, or a gym membership.

Okay, so what can you do? Lead by example. Get yourself in shape. Ask if she wants to come with you to the gym. If she says yes, great. If not, drop it. Send her one of my videos on metabolism. If she wants to watch it, great. If not, drop it. Validate her. Tell her she’s beautiful. Build her up.

If you’ve tried all these positive approaches but they don’t work, then use the cash. I’m joking! Take a positive approach to help your wife lose weight.

## What Diets Should I Not Follow

# What diets should I not follow?

**7 Diets That Can Harm Your Health and Weight Loss Goals**

Beware of these popular diets that often rely on heavily processed ingredients and can sabotage your health and metabolism:

1. **Junk Food Atkins:** The Atkins brand's shakes and bars are loaded with unhealthy ingredients like soy protein isolate, artificial flavors, and polydextrose.

2. **Jenny Craig:** Pre-made meals and the "anytime bar" contain soy protein isolate and synthetic starches like maltodextrin.

3. **Weightwatchers:** While focused on portion control, their Smart Ones brand includes meals with ultra-processed ingredients like soy protein isolates and soybean oil.

4. **Nutrisystem:** Marketed as diabetic-friendly, it uses ingredients like maltodextrin, which has a high glycemic index.

5. **Ideal Protein:** "Wheat protein isolate" is just another name for starch, a chain of sugars.

6. **Optifast:** This medically supervised program relies heavily on shakes, bars, and soups, often with maltodextrin as a primary ingredient.

7. **Medifast:** Despite being "scientifically designed," their products contain soy protein isolates, polydextrose, and other processed ingredients.

**The Bottom Line:**

These ultra-processed ingredients can disrupt your metabolism and contribute to health issues like diabetes and obesity.

**For sustainable weight loss, focus on whole foods and always read ingredient lists!** Don't be fooled by "keto-friendly" labels – prioritize real, nutritious food

## How Can I Lose Weight Without Dieting

# How can I lose weight without dieting?

It's very difficult to lose even one pound of body fat without changing your diet. If you eat junk food, you’ll have to burn even more calories to burn extra fat. Weight loss is 15% exercise and 85% diet! You have to change your diet if you want to lose weight. There’s no way around it! Exercise improves fitness, muscle tone, and health, but it is not the key to weight loss and certainly won’t help you lose weight fast.

If you want to lose fat and not just water weight, you have to keep insulin low. Decreasing insulin will also decrease your appetite and cravings. To reduce insulin, you must go on a low-carb diet!

The carnivore diet involves eliminating all carbohydrates and eating meat, eggs, fish, and cheese. This simple diet can help you lose weight fast!

Intermittent fasting is the key to fat loss. It can also help with other health problems, such as inflammation, high blood pressure, diabetes, and depression. Remember, carbs block fat burning.

You can lose weight without changing your diet, but it won't be much!

## How Can I Naturally Boost Testosterone Levels

# How can I naturally boost testosterone levels?

Fortunately, you can increase testosterone naturally by getting enough rest and a nutritious diet. Here are more ways to boost your testosterone levels:

• Weight training

• More zinc in the diet

• Vitamin D

• More fatty foods with less carbs

• DHEA supplements

• Getting more REM sleep

• Lose weight

• Lowering blood sugar with a keto diet

• Intermittent fasting

• Sufficient protein in the diet

## What Will Happen When You Exercise For Weight Loss

# What will happen when you exercise for weight loss?

The belly is an indirect indicator of the amount of insulin there is in the body. Insulin is the fat-storing hormone that is triggered by various things. It stores fat around the midsection and the liver.
Exercise as a tool for weight loss will not lower insulin to any significant degree.

What to Do?

• Cut the Carbs – like brown rice, pasta, wine, fruits

• Intermittent fasting - Decrease the frequency of meals. Stop snacking before or after your workout and work out in a fasting state.

---

## Can Fasting Help With Diabetes

# Can fasting help with diabetes?

Yes, fasting is an excellent strategy to manage diabetes. During fasting periods, the body is forced to utilize stored body fats instead of sugars to generate energy. This promotes weight loss, keeps blood sugar levels balanced, and can increase insulin sensitivity, all crucial aspects for effective diabetes management.  

If you are considering fasting, we recommend that you do so under the guidance of a Healthcare professional.

## Triggers For Enhancing Fat Burning

# Triggers for Enhancing Fat Burning

Boosting Fat Burning: A Comprehensive Approach

**1\. Exercise and Adrenaline**

Intense exercise, especially high-intensity interval training (HIIT), stimulates adrenaline release, activating lipase to break down stored fat into free fatty acids for energy.

**2\. Intermittent Fasting**

Intermittent fasting lowers insulin levels, enhancing the activity of hormone-sensitive lipase and promoting fat breakdown. It also increases growth hormone levels, further supporting fat loss.

**3\. Dietary Impact**

Reducing refined carbohydrates and sugars helps keep insulin levels low, facilitating fat burning. Including protein and healthy fats supports this process. Foods like green tea extract can boost fat oxidation and thermogenesis.

**4\. Hormonal Triggers**

Growth hormone, thyroid hormones, and lipase are key to fat metabolism. Intense exercise, fasting, adequate sleep, and balanced nutrition help regulate these hormones for effective fat burning.

By aligning exercise, diet, and hormonal management, you can turn your body into an efficient fat-burning machine.

## What Are The Risk Factors For Gallstone Formation

# What are the risk factors for gallstone formation?

### Risk factors for gallstone formation include obesity, rapid weight loss, high-carbohydrate low-fiber diets, prolonged fasting, sedentary lifestyle, nutrient deficiencies, and certain medications like estrogen and cholesterol-lowering drugs. Awareness of these factors can help you make informed choices to support gallbladder health and reduce the risk of gallstones.

## What Are Some Different Ways To Burn Fat

# What are some different ways to burn fat?

Insulin is one of the most important hormones related to fat burning. It’s produced in the pancreas and tells your body to store fat. You can not burn fat if insulin is too high. Aim for less than 50 grams of carbs per day to avoid spiking insulin. Intermittent fasting can also help prevent insulin spikes.

Seed oils and modified food starches like MSG trigger insulin and inflammation and should be avoided.

**To help lower insulin, do the following:**

1\. Lower your carbohydrate intake

2\. Do intermittent fasting

3\. Drink apple cider vinegar with water

4\. Consume berberine and cinnamon

**Estrogen and cortisol** can also cause your body to store fat. To lower estrogen, avoid synthetic hormones and chemicals in your environment. Choose organic foods to avoid pesticides and herbicides that mimic estrogen in the body.

**To minimize cortisol**, focus on stress reduction. Physical activity like housework, long walks, or exercise can get your mind off of stress. Vitamin B1 and vitamin D are also very important for keeping cortisol levels low.

**Growth hormone and IGF-1** (Insulin-like growth factor 1) are the main hormones involved in fat burning. Intense exercise, good sleep habits, moderate protein intake, and intermittent fasting trigger growth hormone and IGF-1. Sprinting is one of the best workouts to trigger these hormones to burn fat.

**Testosterone, glucagon, thyroid hormone (T3), and adrenaline are also important for fat-burning.** To boost testosterone naturally, ensure that you’re consuming foods high in zinc and make sure you’re getting enough cholesterol.

**Exercise** is important, but only contributes to about 15% of your overall weight loss. Exercise can lower stress, improve sleep, and also trigger glucagon and adrenaline.

## What Factors Contribute To A Decreased Appetite While Following A Keto 30Faf1

# What factors contribute to a decreased appetite while following a ketogenic diet and practicing intermittent fasting?

Some people experience a decreased appetite on the Healthy Keto® diet. Although you are taking energy from your body fat and don’t feel the need of food, it is important to note that food has an additional purpose--to provide nutrients. For example if you are deficient in electrolytes and you don’t eat, you can pass out, have low blood pressure etc. While you may not feel hungry because you’re burning enough fat to keep your body supplied with energy, you still need micronutrients.

**What to do:**

If you aren’t hungry for days at a time, it’s important to still eat a nutrient-dense meal once or twice a day. Make sure the meals that you eat are rich in nutrients. Lowering your fat intake may also help you regain your appetite.

- Don’t stop eating.

    - Eat one good meal per day if you want to lose weight

    - Eat two meals per day if you want to maintain your weight

- You can lower your fat intake gradually (to improve appetite)

- Avoid appetite blockers.

## Can I Consume Slimfast Products On Keto

# Can I consume SlimFast products on keto?

The main issues with SlimFast products are:

1\. **Poor Ingredients**: They contain high-glycemic sugars (maltodextrin, dextrose), GMOs (soy, canola oil, beet sugar), synthetic vitamins, and caffeine, which aren't suitable for a ketogenic diet.

2\. **Snack-Based**: These products are marketed as snacks, leading to frequent blood sugar spikes that hinder weight loss and are incompatible with intermittent fasting.

3\. **Lack of Integrity**: SlimFast still produces products with high sugar content (18g per serving), which contradicts their mission to improve health during an ongoing sugar consumption epidemic.

Overall, SlimFast seems to be capitalizing on market trends for profit, rather than genuinely promoting health.

---

## Is Slimfast Safe To Consume On Keto

# Is SlimFast safe to consume on Keto?

The first problem with these products is the ingredient list. The ingredients include:

- Maltodextrin (110 on the glycemic index–sugar is only 70!)

- Dextrose (Synthetic sugar with the glycemic index of 100)

- Tapioca

- Soy (GMO)

- Canola oil (GMO)

- Synthetic vitamins (poorly absorbed)

- Caffeine

- Beet sugar (GMO)

These are poor-quality ingredients, which should have no place in a ketogenic diet.

A second problem with these products is that they are snack-based–meaning they are meant to be eaten as snacks or treats, like chips, bars and energy boosters. This isn’t compatible with intermittent fasting. Consistent blood sugar spikes will halt weight loss.

A final problem with SlimFast is their integrity. They are still producing the original SlimFast, which has 18 grams of sugar (beet sugar). We have a massive epidemic right now of people consuming too much sugar. Promoting more sugar consumption is not okay for a company that is supposed to be helping people improve their health.

Overall, it seems that SlimFast is just trying to tap into a trending market to make a big profit.

## Can I Consume Cheese Every Day

# Can I consume cheese every day?

**Cheese is a great protein source, has probiotic properties, and is low in lactose.**

**The best cheeses are goat cheese and sheep cheese. These cheeses contain A2 casein, which is easier on your digestive system than lactose. Surprisingly, the oldest people in the world consume sheep cheese and goat cheese!**

Cow's milk is around 4% lactose, while cottage cheese and mozzarella cheese vary from 1% to 4% lactose. Goat cheese and sheep cheese are only about .5% lactose. Goat and sheep cheese are higher in protein, vitamin A, vitamin E, folic acid, B vitamins, calcium, and CLA than cow's milk cheese. CLA helps with exercise performance and weight loss.

Around 20% to 30% of the fat in sheep and goat cheese is MCT fat, which is converted directly into ketones. Sheep cheese and goat cheese generate quick energy with little stress on your digestion.

**Cheese from animals who graze at higher altitudes is higher in polyphenols. When you introduce these polyphenols to your mitochondria, it triggers an uncoupling effect. This means it generates extra energy, which is effective if you’re trying to lose weight. Polyphenols also stimulate mitochondrial biogenesis.**

**Research has shown that people who live longest have more mitochondria uncoupling. Other ways to stimulate mitochondrial uncoupling include exercise, cold therapy, fasting, and consuming other polyphenols like sulforaphane, turmeric, and green tea.**

## Are Frequent And Small Meals An Effective Strategy For Weight Loss

# Are frequent and small meals an effective strategy for weight loss?

One of the big tips for sticking to diets and losing weight is to eat frequent small meals. But, every time you eat, you increase insulin.  In the presence of insulin, you can’t burn fat, and if you can’t burn fat, then you can’t lose weight. This can also cause insulin resistance, which can lead to a myriad of health concerns.  Eating less frequently, also known as intermittent fasting, is one of the best things you can do to lose weight and support your overall health.  To stay satisfied between meals without eating snacks, you need to feed the cells your body fat (burn fat). But, to burn fat, you have to lower your insulin by lowering your carbohydrates and eating less frequently.  Once your body has adapted to burning fat, not only will you be able to lose weight, you will finally get rid of hunger and cravings for good.

## What Are Some Tips That Can Help Me To Stick To A Diet Plan

# What are some tips that can help me to stick to a diet plan?

The best ways to stick with your eating plan and lose weight:

• Get more sleep 

• Decrease sugar 

• Consume an adequate amount of protein

• Get plenty of fiber 

• Decrease stress 

• Avoid alcohol and smoking 

• Keep caffeine consumption to a minimum 

• Consume healthy fats 

• Eat slowly 

• Decrease carbohydrates 

• Take l-tryptophan (for cravings during menstrual cycles)

• Consume nutrient-dense foods 

• Do intermittent fasting

## Is There An Alternative For Body Mass Index

# Is there an alternative for Body Mass Index?

One of the biggest problems with BMI is that it doesn’t tell you how much fat you have versus muscle. It also can’t give you much of an idea of what's going on with your overall health. Other common measurements:

• BMR (basal metabolic rate): Measures how fast you’re burning calories

• TDEE (total daily energy expenditure): Measures the quantity of energy being burned

• Keto calculator: Measures BMR and TDEE and can tell you how many calories and how many macronutrients you should consume in a day based on your BMR and TDEE

Many times, people look at how much weight they lose per week as a measurement of how healthy their metabolism is. However, this isn’t a good idea. A big principle to consider is: get healthy to lose weight—don’t lose weight to get healthy. In the process of exercising and getting healthy, you’re going to gain muscle. Muscle is heavier than fat. This means that some weeks you may not lose any weight, but your clothes are still going to feel more and more loose. Instead of a BMI test, there are many other helpful tests you can do to help measure your overall health.

One of the best assessments of overall health is the metabolomic test. This test can look at your metabolic pathways in real-time. It can provide great data to help professionals understand what could happen down the road, so you can do something about it now.

## How Can I Guarantee Sustainable Weight Loss

# How can I guarantee sustainable weight loss?

Guaranteeing Sustainable Weight Loss

**1\. Manage Carbohydrate Intake**

Opt for nutrient-rich, whole foods over refined carbs. Incorporate fruits, vegetables, and whole grains for fiber and essential nutrients. Consider lower-carb diets like keto or paleo under professional guidance.

**2\. Incorporate Healthy Fats and Proteins**

Include sources of healthy fats such as avocados, nuts, and olive oil, and lean proteins like chicken, fish, and legumes. Aim for 0.8-1 gram of protein per pound of body weight to maintain muscle mass and support recovery.

**3\. Combine Effective Strategies**

Integrate the ketogenic diet with intermittent fasting for enhanced fat burning and improved insulin sensitivity. For those post-gastric sleeve surgery, intermittent fasting can aid in maintaining weight loss and managing hunger.

Sustainable weight loss is a gradual process requiring balanced nutrition and consistent strategies. Celebrate progress and maintain a long-term focus for lasting success.

## Should I Cut Out Cheese To Lose More Weight

# Should I cut out cheese to lose more weight?

Cutting out cheese, especially if it's made from pasteurized milk, can be beneficial for weight loss. However, when hitting a plateau, it's important to review a few key factors: reassess your carb intake, ensure you're fasting adequately, focus on high-quality foods, prioritize good sleep, manage stress effectively, and support healthy digestion. These elements together can help you break through weight loss plateaus.

---

## Which Is Worse A High Carb Diet Or Snacking For Weight Loss

# Which is worse: a high carb diet or snacking for weight loss?

Snacking is actually worse than a high-carb diet when it comes to weight loss. Both increase insulin, but frequent snacking keeps insulin levels elevated throughout the day, preventing fat loss. For example, when I stopped snacking, even on seemingly healthy options like apples with peanut butter, I lost a significant amount of weight. Research has shown that snacking is a major contributor to obesity, more so than even high-carb diets.

Historically, people ate three meals a day with minimal snacking, and obesity rates were much lower. The modern habit of frequent snacking keeps insulin levels high, giving the pancreas no time to recover. This constant stimulation of insulin can be detrimental to your health.

Intermittent fasting is a powerful alternative that simplifies your eating routine and reduces hunger over time, making it an effective strategy for both weight loss and improving overall health.

## I Have No Appetite Should I Eat

[See Video/Image/Document](https://hls-player.drberg.com/asset?path=migrated-assets/should-i-eat-if-i-am-not-hungry-no-appetite-drberg-on-loss-of-appetite)

**Food has two purposes, to provide the body with fuel and with nutrients. If you are nutritionally deficient, which most people are, you may have problems going longer than a day without food. Low blood pressure and fainting episodes are common in people who go too long without eating.**

Most people need to eat once a day, even if they have no appetite. If weight loss is not your goal, you should consume 2 meals per day, also if you don’t have an appetite. You don’t have to consume a large meal if you have no appetite. Try consuming a small salad with a small amount of protein and fat.

Your stomach will shrink when you’re doing intermittent fasting. Your requirement for food will be less, so you won't need as many calories. You won’t even need the same amount of nutrients in some cases. This may cause your appetite to decrease.

In the morning if you have no appetite, don’t eat! Go as long as you can, but try to eat at least once per day to ensure your body gets enough nutrients.

## How Fast Will I Lose Weight On Keto

# How fast will I lose weight on keto?

On a Healthy Keto® diet, individuals can generally expect to lose approximately 2 pounds of fat per week, with the inclusion of intermittent fasting potentially accelerating this process. Initially, weight loss may be more significant, with individuals losing between 7 to 15 pounds in the first week, largely attributed to the loss of water weight associated with glycogen depletion. Various factors can influence weight loss on the ketogenic diet, including age, activity level, gender, metabolism, overall health, dietary choices, and stress levels.

## Should I Do Cardio To Lose Weight

# Should I do cardio to lose weight?

You can, as an addition to a Healthy Keto® diet and an intermittent fasting plan. You can also try high-intensity interval training (HIIT) to support your health and weight-loss goals. Make sure not to overtrain.

## Can I Do Ketogenic Diet And Intermittent Fasting If Im Underweight

# Can I do ketogenic diet and intermittent fasting if I'm underweight?

The answer is keto and IF is not just good for weight loss, but for anti-aging, inflammation, cognitive health, mood, and the list go on and on. If you don't need to lose weight, just add more fat to your meals. This will stop the weight loss, so your body will burn the dietary fats and not your own fat.

## How Low Calorie Diets And Intermittent Fasting Affect Metabolism

# How low-calorie diets and intermittent fasting affect metabolism?

**Low-calorie diets:**

• Slow your metabolism 

• Raises your set point (you can’t lose weight once you hit a certain point that’s typically high)

• Decrease muscle

• Increase cravings and hunger

• Don’t put a person in fat-burning 

• Ignore how food triggers certain hormones 

• Ignore the nutrients in the calories 

**Intermittent fasting:**

• Speeds up metabolism 

• Lowers your set point (allows your weight to go down)

• Improves muscle by triggering growth hormone 

• Decreases cravings and hunger 

• Puts a person in fat-during 

• Considers the hormone aspects, especially insulin 

• Promotes eating nutrient-dense foods when eating

**Low-calorie diets focus on restricting calories, but intermittent fasting focuses on restricting the frequency of eating. Intermittent fasting doesn’t lower your calories when you do eat.** 

**With intermittent fasting, when you do eat a meal, you want it to have healthy fats, a moderate amount of protein, and nutrient-dense vegetables. Having a nice big meal will help you switch over to fat-burning when you’re fasting and help make it easier to fast. A great form of intermittent fasting is having two meals a day without snacks.**

## Does Fasting Boost Testosterone

# Does fasting boost testosterone?

Intermittent fasting can potentially increase testosterone by 180%. It does this by triggering the hypothalamus and releasing GRH. Insulin will kill your testosterone levels, and fasting prevents you from having insulin spikes.

As you lose weight, it will likely get easier and easier to stimulate testosterone. Consider fasting for at least 16 hours with an 8-hour eating window. It may also be beneficial to work up to 20 hours of fasting with a 4-hour window of eating.

## Im On The Weight Loss Journey   Can I Eat Healthy Snacks

# I'm on the weight loss journey - can I eat healthy snacks?

People will tell you that in order to lose weight, you need to snack before you get too hungry, or snack to trigger your metabolism or snack to prevent overeating. 

It's snacking camouflaged as "Healthy snacking". All these extra meals even if they are small and healthy create a spike in insulin - this adds up. 

Insulin is the FAT-MAKING hormone, AND IT PREVENTS FAT BURNING. We snack on liquids too. The grocery store is filled with all sorts of new snacks protein bars, jerky, drinks, and granola bars, with added buzz words like "gluten free" or "organic" or "natural", but it's still food. 

Even fruit between meals can block weight loss. I myself cut fruit out between meals and went from 211 pounds to 185 pounds in 6 weeks.

## Are Keto Snacks Safe To Eat On A Ketogenic Diet

# Are Keto snacks safe to eat on a Ketogenic Diet?

**There are so many different kinds of keto snacks available now, like protein bars, keto bombs, and much more. But, these keto snacks can actually decrease your results significantly. You’re going to plateau.** 

The goal of keto is to decrease and normalize insulin. Every time you eat anything of significant calories, you will spike insulin. So, the more frequent the meals, the more insulin you’re going to have, and the less progress you’re going to make with weight loss and your overall health. 

Low-calorie foods like vegetables won’t spike insulin too much, especially if it’s filled with fiber, like leafy greens. So, this could be an exception. 

Let’s say you’re doing intermittent fasting, and your first meal is at 12 pm, and your next meal is at 7 pm. But, you have a snack in between because this time is technically your eating window. I don’t recommend doing this. I don’t recommend eating anything during the day except for during your first meal and second meal. So, after 7 pm, you would fast again until 12 pm the next day. To really see some significant changes, you may want to work up to an 18 hour fast. However, some people may need to go up to 20 hours or even 23 hours of fasting. 

A lot of keto snacks and keto bombs are okay to have, but you should only eat them with your meal.
