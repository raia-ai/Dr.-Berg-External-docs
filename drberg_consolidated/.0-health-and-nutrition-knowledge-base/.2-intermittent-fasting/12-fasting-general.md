## Which Is More Suitable For A Ketogenic Diet Balsamic Vinegar Or Apple  B5Fb4C

# Which is more suitable for a ketogenic diet: balsamic vinegar or apple cider vinegar?

Balsamic vinegar doesn’t have fiber on it, it is pure liquid and can spike blood sugar because it is high in glycemic index. It is important to read the label because they vary – make sure you would get the one that’s only 2 grams of sugar per tablespoon.

## Will Going Low Carb And Low Insulin Reduce My Muscle Mass And How Can  C28Ab0

# Will going low-carb and low-insulin reduce my muscle mass, and how can I maintain muscle while doing keto and intermittent fasting?

Maintaining muscle mass on a low-carb, low-insulin diet is possible if you follow these guidelines:

\- Keep your daily carb intake between 50-60 grams.

\- Consume 8-9 ounces of protein per meal.

\- Ensure you're not deficient in essential nutrients.

Insulin is an anabolic hormone that helps absorb amino acids, but consistently high insulin from carbs and sugar leads to insulin resistance, impairing amino acid absorption and causing muscle loss. Keto and intermittent fasting improve insulin sensitivity, enhancing amino acid and protein absorption.

For muscle maintenance and growth, incorporate weight training and increase protein intake. Aim for 8-9 ounces of high-quality protein per meal from sources like eggs, meat, and fish. Avoid high-carb foods to prevent insulin resistance.

Consider supplementing with complete amino acids for maximum efficiency in muscle building.

## How Do I Make A Keto Waffle

# How do I make a keto waffle?

This is a recipe for a classic almond flour waffle. But you can do so much more with this waffles recipe than just make classic waffles. If you pull a few ingredients from this recipe, you can get a really nice “bready” texture. If you miss bread, the resulting waffle bread can be a great alternative.

**Amazing Low-Carb Waffles Ingredients:**

1 cup almond flour

1 pinch salt

1 tsp baking soda

4 eggs (organic, pasture-raised)

1⁄4 cup FiberYum\\cooking spray (for example, avocado spray)

**Instructions:**

1\. Heat waffle iron per the directions that came with it.

2\. Mix all ingredients above. Do not overmix.

3\. Spray both sides of iron with oil before batter is poured in. Pour batter in and cook per the directions that came with your waffle iron. All are different!

4\. These are best served right away. If not, put them on a cookie sheet and don’t stack. They tend to get soft when stacked.

5\. Add butter and sugar-free syrup or peanut butter, and enjoy!

The following super-easy waffle bread is a variation on the waffle recipe, and cooked just like the waffles above, or as pancakes. The texture and taste make this great to use as a bread replacement! Try it out!

**Waffle Bread
Ingredients:**

1 cup almond flour

1⁄4 tsp salt

1 tsp baking soda

3 Tbsp Fiber Yum (or Vitafiber, etc.) cooking spray for the pan or waffle iron

You can try adding different nuts, seeds, or herbs to this recipe. One with dried onion and poppy will taste like a bagel and would be great with cream cheese. Another one could be made with sunflower and pumpkin seeds, and another with shredded carrots and zucchini. Play with it!

Use the rounds (pancake-size) as “bread” for a cheeseburger – amazing. And it’s fun for the kids to get a sandwich on waffle bread!

Enjoy!

## I Had A Cheat Day. Now How Do I Recover

# I had a cheat day. Now how do I recover?

Take these nutrients individually to recover faster from a cheat meal: 

- Magnesium

- Potassium

- Vitamin B1

- Vitamin D

They will help stabilize your blood sugar, improve insulin resistance, and buffer the effects of high sugar to a certain degree.

Incorporate exercise to burn up the excess sugar that you have consumed.

Get right on a fasting program. Fast longer to make up the damage from the cheat meal. This will bring your insulin back down to where you need it to be, and your body will burn up the excess sugar and tap into fat again.

When you go off the keto plan do not spread this out over a long period of time. Do it for a short period of time and get right back on. The longer you are off, the harder it will be to get back.

## What Can I Do For Early Puberty

# What can I do for early puberty?

**It ultimately comes from exposure to Xenoestrogens which is external so your body isn’t making it because it's coming from the environment.**

Chemicals that mimic estrogen would be BPA(Plastic Bags), PCB(Industrial Waste), in the food supply, and more. The main one you should know about is ZERANOL (Potent Estrogen) which is a growth hormone that they inject into cattle. It’s actually banned in Europe but it is still used in the U.S. and is 100,000 times stronger than BPA. When you eat meats or dairy you should do organic, even though it might be a little more expensive you save more if you're doing intermittent fasting by eating a few times a day to invest in higher quality food.

## What Foods Should I Avoid To Fall Asleep Faster

# What foods should I avoid to fall asleep faster?

**Things that can prevent sleep:**

**1\. Snacking**

When you snack, you’re triggering insulin, which can lead to insulin resistance. This can cause frequent urination at night and sleep apnea.

**2\. Sugar**

Consuming sugar can lead to insulin resistance. It can also deplete your potassium. Potassium relaxes the body.

**3\. Protein**

Protein is a stimulant and will wake you up. Make sure you only have a moderate amount of protein with vegetables. Also, make sure you don’t have your protein too late at night.

**4\. Coffee and tea**

Coffee and tea contain caffeine, which is a stimulant. One small cup of coffee or tea without sugar is fine.

**5\. Alcohol**

Alcohol can dehydrate you, affect your liver, and affect your hormones, which can keep you up at night.

**6\. Protein and sugar**

Combining protein and sugar will raise insulin and can lead to insulin resistance, which will prevent sleep.

**7\. Drinking excessive amounts of water**

Drink when you’re thirsty. Having lemon juice or apple cider vinegar with your water is more hydrating than water alone.

## What Helps To Stop Cold At First Sign

# What helps to stop cold at first sign?

First, take zinc and vitamin C together, but eat foods high in vitamin C as opposed to a supplement. I recommend eating lemons, as opposed to pasteurized lemon juice.

You can also drink apple cider vinegar because when you acidify your body with it, you speed up the action of white blood cells called phagocytes. They clean up bacteria as part of your immune system.

Eat garlic. It’s the most powerful anti-viral food I know. It’s also anti-bacterial. Make sure you do these things right when you get the first symptom of a cold.

## What Are Some Great Tips For When You Are Sick

# What are some great tips for when you are sick?

Viral infection symptoms will be more systemic. If you have a viral infection, you’ll notice more body aches and chills. Bacterial infection symptoms will be localized. Fevers are typically higher with a bacterial infection. A sore throat associated with a viral infection is often accompanied by a runny nose and a cough. If a sore throat is caused by a bacterial infection, you’ll feel more localized pain without a runny nose. A dry cough is associated with a viral infection, while bacterial infections are associated with a productive cough. Respiratory infection, the common cold, flu, bronchitis, and infections involving the sinuses and lungs are generally viral. Pneumonia can be both bacterial and viral. A viral infection typically lasts 1 to 2 weeks. A bacterial infection will probably last a bit longer, but this depends on your immune system. Mucus associated with a viral infection is usually clear or white and green or yellow with a bacterial infection.

The best viral infection remedies are elderberry and olive leaf extract. For bacterial infections, try garlic, oregano oil, and echinacea. The following remedies for infection work for both viral and bacterial infections:

•Take a hot bath or shower/dress warm

•Get more sleep

•Take zinc, vitamin D, and vitamin C

•Fasting

•Increase sea salt intake

•Improve emotional state

•Get more sunlight (UVB and infrared rays)

•Take cod liver oil

## Why Is My Stomach Bloated When I Havent Eaten

# Why is my stomach bloated when I haven't eaten?

Eating too much during the eating window is a common cause of bloating while fasting. Overeating can strain the digestive system, leading to poor digestive processes and bloating hours after eating. 

In addition, dehydration can cause chronic constipation, which can lead to gas buildup and bloating, irrespective of food intake.

---

## How Can A Pro Athlete Transition To Keto And Fasting Safely Without Ha Ce1D0D

# How can a pro athlete transition to keto and fasting safely without having the risk of kidney stones?

There's a couple of factors that make up the stone. One is the consumption of food that has a lot of oxalates in it. You want to avoid those foods. It's very high in almonds and almond flour. A lot of Keto products contain almonds or almond flour. Spinach also has high levels of oxalates. As well as chocolate and even sugar-free chocolate. Kiwis are also on the list. Try avoiding these foods.

But the other thing too, is that it's impossible to get a kidney stone unless there's a super concentrated urine in your bladder or your kidneys. One solution is to make sure you have at least two and a half liters of fluid a day.

---

## Is A Higher Glucose Level Normal When Testing Outside Of The Fasting Window

# Is a higher glucose level normal when testing outside of the fasting window?

A higher glucose level outside of the fasting window is generally expected, especially after consuming carbohydrates. However, if blood sugar remains elevated when not eating, it could indicate underlying insulin resistance or other factors. For example, morning glucose spikes can result from cortisol release, which mobilizes stored sugar. Additionally, exercise can temporarily raise blood sugar levels.

To assess long-term glucose control, A1C testing is more informative, as it reflects average blood glucose over three months. To manage higher blood sugar, consider regular exercise, using diluted apple cider vinegar, and incorporating supplements like berberine to support insulin sensitivity.

---

## What Can I Do For Shakiness While Fasting

# What can I do for shakiness while fasting?

Shakiness during fasting often results from rapid adjustments in blood sugar levels. To address this, consider gradually easing into fasting rather than making abrupt changes, particularly if you are new to intermittent fasting or ketogenic diets. Allow your body to adapt at its own pace.

Additionally, ensure your carbohydrate intake remains low when you are not fasting. High carb consumption can prolong the adaptation period and exacerbate low blood sugar symptoms. Maintaining a consistent, low-carb diet will help stabilize blood sugar levels and ease the transition.

## What Effective Strategies And Treatments Can Help Alleviate The Sympto Ac0Baf

# What effective strategies and treatments can help alleviate the symptoms and prevent urinary tract infections (UTIs)?

UTI, or urinary tract infection, can affect the bladder or kidneys, commonly caused by E.coli. Factors that can make E.coli pathogenic include high glucose, estrogen fluctuations, antibiotics, intercourse, low estrogen, and catheters.

Natural remedies for UTI:

1\. Buchu: Antimicrobial, anti-adhesive, and natural diuretic.

2\. Cranberry: Anti-adhesive and reduces biofilms.

3\. Uva ursi: Natural diuretic and antimicrobial.

4\. Juniper: Antimicrobial for bladder and kidneys.

## Is Cantaloupe Juice Beneficial

# Is cantaloupe juice beneficial?

While cantaloupe juice contains valuable nutrients, its high sugar content, especially when juiced, poses concerns. Juicing removes the fiber that helps regulate sugar absorption, leading to a direct intake of fructose, which may not be ideal, particularly for those managing blood sugar levels. I’ve learned from personal experience—once juicing large amounts of carrot juice until noticing a skin color change—that moderation is key. Cleanses involving sugary juices or glucose can prevent full adaptation to ketosis, making fasting more challenging and intensifying cravings. For effective cleansing and fasting, it's crucial to consider the impact of sugar and opt for methods that support metabolic balance.

---

## Which Supplements Or Beverages Should I Consume While Fasting

# Which supplements or beverages should I consume while fasting?

While fasting, consider adding apple cider vinegar to your routine, as it boosts energy and enhances insulin sensitivity. Mix a tablespoon with water, and add lemon juice for its citrate content, which may help prevent kidney stones.

It's also essential to ensure adequate sea salt intake, especially if you're on a one-meal-a-day plan, to avoid muscle weakness and sleep disturbances. Additionally, using an electrolyte powder rich in potassium and B vitamins is beneficial. These vitamins are crucial for energy production, particularly on a low-carb, high-fat diet.

## What Strategies Can Be Implemented To Improve Sleep Quality And Boost  25Da15

# What strategies can be implemented to improve sleep quality and boost overall energy levels throughout the day?

**To improve sleep:**

1\. Add more vegetables - 7-10 cups per day.

2\. Avoid excess protein - 3-6 ounces.

3\. Avoid too much caffeine

4\. Don't snack in the evening

5\. Avoid sugar - excess insulin causes your bladder to more active.

6\. Avoid over-training - and walk regularly.

**If you can't get to sleep - you need minerals (calcium, potassium and magnesium)**

**If you wake up at 2am in the middle of the night, then support your adrenals.**

**If your bladder is waking you up too much, then this is insulin resistance. Get on the ketogenic diet and intermittent fasting.**

Top Strategies for Stroke Prevention:

1\. Adopt a ketogenic diet and practice intermittent fasting.

2\. Ensure ample intake of nutrient-dense salads.

3\. Maintain a regular exercise regimen.

4\. Prioritize consumption of nutrient-dense foods.

## Why Do I Run Out Of Breath While Exercising

# Why do I run out of breath while exercising?

If your heart rate takes a long time to return to normal after sprints, it might be due to a weaker parasympathetic nervous system, which controls recovery. Here are some tips to improve your recovery and endurance:

1\. **Exercise**: Do shorter workouts with sprints followed by longer rest periods to train your parasympathetic system.

2\. **Supplements**: Consider Co-enzyme Q10, Vitamin K2, and Vitamin E for better endurance.

3\. **Diet**: Achieve deeper ketosis and incorporate fasting to improve endurance.

For accurate assessment, testing with heart rate variability equipment is recommended. These steps should help strengthen your recovery system and enhance performance.

## What Are The Dangers Of Excessive Salt Consumption

# What are the dangers of excessive salt consumption?

Signs of consuming too much salt include:

\- Edema (swelling in eyes, hands, feet, or legs)

\- Thirst

\- High blood pressure

\- Headache

\- Restlessness

\- Irritability

\- Nausea

\- Fatigue

Signs of sodium deficiency include:

\- Weakness

\- Low blood pressure

\- Increased neurotransmitters

\- Vascular stiffness and high blood pressure

\- Insulin resistance

Insulin resistance often causes high blood pressure, influenced by factors like a high-carb diet or intermittent fasting. Diuretics, commonly used for hypertension, may lead to sodium and potassium loss. For those with sodium sensitivity or signs of deficiency, ensuring adequate potassium intake is crucial, alongside a balanced mineral intake. Sea salts like Baja Gold Sea Salt offer a comprehensive mineral profile, including lower sodium content.

## Does Looking At Sweets Spike Your Insulin

# Does looking at sweets spike your insulin?

**The answer is no – not in a fasting state.** Looking at sweets and carbs will not cause an insulin spike. The primary triggers of blood sugar are glucose and things that turn into glucose. But, anything you eat has the potential to trigger insulin just for the fact that you ate it. If it’s more carbohydrate, it will trigger your blood sugar more. If it’s less carbohydrate and more fat, it will trigger your blood sugar less.

**Chronic high insulin can lead to insulin resistance. Other triggers that can cause a blood sugar spike:**

• Cortisol – Stress

• GIP

• Protein – especially if it’s low fat

**Common symptoms of insulin resistance**

1\. Can’t go long without eating

2\. Not satisfied

3\. Cravings

4\. Need for snacks

2\. Boron 

3\. Herbal remedies (black cohosh, fennel, wild yam, Pueraria mirifica)

4\. Fasting and a low-carb diet 

5\. Vitamin E 

6\. Adjust your stress levels (lower stress)

7\. Adjust your exercise (make sure you’re not overtraining)

## How Is Intermittent Fasting Connected To Blood Sugar Levels And The Ad F3E08B

# How is intermittent fasting connected to blood sugar levels and the adrenal glands?

When transitioning between meals, hypoglycemia (low blood sugar) may occur. Normally, the adrenals and liver raise glucose levels. Weak adrenals can lead to severe drops in blood sugar, causing symptoms. Strong adrenals typically prevent hypoglycemia during intermittent fasting (IF). IF isn't harmful to adrenals, but with weak adrenals, it should be approached gradually, incorporating more fat, B vitamins, and potassium.

## What Supplements Should I Take On Keto

# What supplements should I take on keto?

Here is the list of the most important nutrients needed for keto, along with sources for them.

- Minerals

- Vitamin B1 (needed in conversion from sugar to fat burning)

- Vitamin B3 (to remove fat and cholesterol from the liver)

- Vitamin B5 (for the conversion from sugar to fat burning; helps in keto-adaptation and prevents ketogenic fatigue, flu and rash

- Vitamin A (improves insulin resistance)

- Vitamin D (improves insulin resistance)

- Choline (to help a fatty liver)

Virgin cod liver oil helps to provide vitamin D and A equally. Nutritional yeast provides the B vitamins.

Electrolyte powder helps provide the minerals.

## How Long Does Keto Flu Last

# How long does Keto flu last?

Usually 1 to 2 days. It can span up to 6 weeks or longer depending on how long you have been living on sugar and how bad your liver is.

If you support yourself during the transition period with the right nutrition (electrolytes and B vitamins) keto flu should go away pretty fast.

---

## Is Intermittent Fasting Safe For Your Adrenal Glands

# Is intermittent fasting safe for your adrenal glands?

It's normal for cortisol to counter low blood sugar levels. During intermittent fasting, as your blood sugar drops, cortisol, an adrenal hormone, kicks in to prevent this. This is a normal function of cortisol, just like how it increases white blood cells and inflammation during infection and injury. These processes don't stress the adrenals; they're part of cortisol's purpose. To address this, you may need to fix both your insulin resistance and adrenal function separately.

## Is Periodic Fasting Effective

# Is periodic fasting effective?

There are several popular periodic fasts, such as the 5:2 fast, the 3-days-a-week fast, and the every-other-day fast. However, these can make you feel miserable because they don’t give your body enough time to adapt to fat burning, which takes 3-7 days. Instead of periodic fasting, consistent intermittent fasting on a daily basis is recommended to help you burn fat and improve cognition and mood.

## Is Intermittent Fasting Safe For Your Adrenals

# Is intermittent fasting safe for your adrenals?

It's normal for the adrenals to raise cortisol levels during intermittent fasting to counter a low blood sugar level. While many people suffering from adrenal fatigue hear this about fasting and believe it is safer to avoid it, actually the opposite is true. Fasting can be beneficial for the adrenals because it relieves oxidative stress and inflammation, which considerably alleviates stress on the adrenals.

## Is Feeling Cold Normal When Doing Intermittent Fasting

# Is feeling cold normal when doing intermittent fasting?

Feeling cold is a normal sensation that occurs when you do not eat for stretches of time. The body's core temperature will decrease due to lower calorie intake and lower levels of blood sugar. As you continue fasting, your body will adapt and the cold feelings will lessen, but you can take vitamin B1 to ease this transition.

## Why Am I Experiencing A Cold Sensation On Keto And What Should I Do

# Why am I experiencing a cold sensation on Keto, and what should I do?

A cold sensation may occur while following a ketogenic diet, particularly during intermittent fasting. This can result from a reduced frequency of meals, causing your body to adapt by decreasing its metabolic workload. As your thyroid adjusts to these changes, you might feel cooler.

To help mitigate this sensation, consider incorporating iodine into your diet, such as from high-quality sea kelp, particularly during periods of intermittent fasting. This can support thyroid function and overall metabolic balance.

## What Brand Of Moringa Powder Does Dr. Berg Recommend

# What brand of moringa powder does Dr. Berg recommend?

Dr. Berg does not have a brand to recommend; however, these are the best practices to follow when looking for a Morgina product.

1\. Source
  •  Look for organic moringa grown in clean, uncontaminated soil.
  •  The best moringa often comes from India, Sri Lanka, or parts of Africa, where the tree is native and traditionally cultivated. 

2\. Non-GMO and Organic
  •  Choose moringa that is certified organic and clearly labeled non-GMO. This ensures the leaves are free from genetically modified organisms and synthetic chemical residues. 

3\. Color
  •  A vibrant, deep green powder is a sign of freshness and high nutrient retention.
  •  A pale or yellowish-green hue can signal poor drying practices, oxidation, or age. 

4\. Dried at Low Temperatures
  •  Look for shade-dried or low-temperature dried moringa. High-heat processing destroys delicate nutrients like enzymes and antioxidants.
  •  Labels that mention “gently dried” or “raw” typically indicate better nutrient preservation. 

5\. No Fillers or Additives
  •  The ingredients list should say only one thing: “Moringa leaf powder.” No maltodextrin, rice flour, silica, or flow agents. 

6\. Lab-Tested for Contaminants
  •  Choose a brand that uses third-party testing to check for:
  •  Heavy metals (lead, cadmium, mercury, arsenic)
  •  Pesticides and herbicides
  •  Microbial contamination (mold, bacteria, pathogens)
  •  Reputable companies will make lab results available or mention them clearly on the label or website. 

7\. GMP-Certified Manufacturing
  •  Look for products made in a GMP-certified facility (Good Manufacturing Practices). This ensures the powder was processed under strict hygiene and quality controls to avoid contamination and preserve potency. 

8\. Freshness
  •  Check for a harvest or packaging date when possible.
  •  Choose small-batch brands with fast turnover. Older moringa loses flavor, color, and effectiveness. 

9\. Packaging
  •  High-quality moringa comes in opaque, airtight containers — like dark glass jars or sealed foil pouches — to protect against light and moisture.
  •  Avoid clear plastic containers or any packaging that lets in light or air. 

10\. Taste and Smell
  •  It should smell fresh, earthy, and slightly bitter, like green tea or spinach. If it smells musty, sour, or bland, it’s likely old or poorly handled. 

11\. Reputation and Reviews
  •  Choose a brand with a strong reputation and transparent sourcing and processing practices.
  •  Look for verified customer reviews, especially those mentioning improvements in energy, inflammation, or digestion.

## How Beneficial Is Resveratrol

# How beneficial is resveratrol??

People who think they have a slow metabolism actually have an efficient metabolism. This means their body requires less fuel. To lose stubborn fat, you must get your body to waste more fuel. The mitochondria are the body's “energy factories,” turning food into stored energy, known as ATP. Uncoupling occurs when the mitochondria make less ATP and more heat.

Resveratrol is a natural mitochondrial uncoupler. It’s found in grapes, cranberries, blueberries, dark chocolate, pistachios, and Japanese knotweed. Resveratrol is also made into a powder supplement. One tablespoon per day can help reduce belly fat by encouraging mitochondrial uncoupling.

Ketones can cause mitochondrial uncoupling and improve the function of the mitochondria. Cold therapy, exercise, fasting, green tea, saunas, and jacuzzis also cause mitochondrial uncoupling.

## Is It Ok To Take Painkillers While Fasting

# Is it ok to take painkillers while fasting?

While it's essential to follow your prescribed medication regimen, fasting can be complemented by addressing pain with natural remedies. Increasing your intake of omega-3 fatty acids and vitamin D may help manage pain and inflammation. Omega-3s and vitamin D, particularly at levels around 40,000 to 50,000 IU, can be effective for reducing pain and inflammation without significant side effects.

---

## What Supplements Or Nutrients Can Disrupt A Fast

# What supplements or nutrients can disrupt a fast?

Supplements that can disrupt a fast typically include those with significant caloric content, such as protein powders (e.g., whey protein) and sugary vitamin drinks. In contrast, most vitamins and minerals without added calories, sugar, or protein generally do not interfere with fasting. To maintain the integrity of your fast, avoid supplements that contain these ingredients.

## How Much Protein Is Too Much On A Ketogenic Diet

# How much protein is too much on a ketogenic diet?

To manage insulin, aim for 3-6 oz of protein per meal, adjusting for fitness and metabolism. For regular workouts, up to 8 oz may be okay. For one meal a day, you might need more protein.

Dr. Berg suggests grass-fed beef, pasture-raised chicken (with skin), eggs, and wild-caught salmon. Fattier proteins help lower insulin levels.

Calculate your protein needs: body weight (lbs) x 0.4. Divide by your meals per day (2 or 3).

Example: At 172 lbs, you need 68.8g/day. For 2 meals, that's 34.4g/meal.

Adjust to find your ideal amount.

## Is Tapioca Starch Ok To Consume On Keto

# Is tapioca starch ok to consume on Keto?

No. Tapioca is a starch that comes from the cassava plant. It’s actually quite high in carbohydrates. In fact, the carbohydrate content of cassava flour is 25% more than that of white flour.

If we compare tapioca flour to almond flour, this is what we find:

- 1/4 cup tapioca flour – 27 net carbs

- 1/4 cup almond flour – 3 net carbs

There is an ingredient found in many so-called “keto-friendly” products called soluble tapioca fiber. Soluble tapioca fiber is the same thing as “prebiotic tapioca” and “organic non-GMO tapioca fiber.”

Soluble tapioca fiber is a big source of IMO, which is a common sweetener. Dr. Berg no longer recommends it. Recent studies show that IMO has the same glycemic effect as glucose and dextrose. It’s actually worse to use than sugar. If you want to eat keto-friendly foods and stay in ketosis, you may want to stay away from tapioca flour and tapioca fiber.

## What Are The Keto Food Ratios

# What are the keto food ratios?

The percent of carbs should be 5% of the calories in your diet (low)

Your protein should be roughly 20% (moderate) and

The percent of fat should be 75% (high).

Don’t count carbohydrates from vegetables in this equation since these carbs are mainly fiber and will not raise insulin too much.

Dr. Berg recommends consuming 7 to 10 cups of salad veggies (leafy greens) per day. If you are eating other vegetables like broccoli, Brussels sprouts, etc. you would need less (3.5 to 4 cups).

## Is Intermittent Fasting Different For Women

# Is intermittent fasting different for women?

The difference between women and men is that women have a more complete reproductive system, which results in higher estrogen levels. This doesn't mean that women shouldn't do intermittent fasting. In fact, unless a woman is pregnant or breastfeeding, intermittent fasting can be extremely beneficial.

## What Can Help Me To Burn Fat

# What can help me to burn fat?

**Tired of feeling like your metabolism is working against you?** The truth is, your body might be more efficient than you think! To shed that stubborn fat, you need to ignite your body's energy-burning potential.

**The key lies in your mitochondria:** the powerhouses within your cells that convert food into stored energy. By triggering a process called mitochondrial uncoupling, you can shift those powerhouses to generate less stored energy and more heat – essentially "wasting" fuel and promoting fat burning.

**Resveratrol, a natural compound found in various fruits and plants, is your secret weapon.** It acts as a mitochondrial uncoupler, and studies show that incorporating a daily tablespoon of resveratrol powder can help reduce belly fat.

**But resveratrol isn't the only solution:** Ketones, cold therapy, exercise, fasting, green tea, saunas, and even Jacuzzis can also stimulate mitochondrial uncoupling.

**Maximize your results by avoiding factors that hinder this process:**

- **Limit excess calories:** Fuel your body efficiently, not excessively.

- **Stay active:** Combat the effects of aging and a sedentary lifestyle.

- **Minimize heavy metal exposure:** Protect your mitochondria from toxins.

- **Review your medications:** Discuss potential impacts with your doctor.

**By embracing these strategies, you can unlock your metabolism's full potential and finally conquer that stubborn fat.** Remember, it's not about having a slow metabolism; it's about harnessing your body's power to burn energy efficiently.

## How Can I Stop Weight Gain During Perimenopause

# How can I stop weight gain during perimenopause?

To prevent weight gain during perimenopause, especially around the midsection, consider gradually reducing your meal frequency until you reach one meal a day. This approach can help counteract the slower metabolism that often comes with age. Periodic longer fasts can also be highly effective in accelerating results. Additionally, closely monitor your calorie intake and aim to keep carbohydrates to a minimum for optimal results.

## How Long Does Keto Breath Last

# How long does Keto breath last?

It can last from a few days up to 3 weeks. It is usually a sign of keto adaptation.

What you need to do is:

- Be strict with your carbs, bringing them below 20 grams per day

- Do intermittent fasting as this will speed things up and drop insulin

- Consume a little more fluid with electrolytes to encourage the body to release ketones out of the urine instead of in your breath

- Consume more foods with chlorophyll (in vegetables)

## Is It Possible To Prevent Muscle Loss On Intermittent Fasting

# Is it possible to prevent muscle loss on intermittent fasting?

To prevent muscle loss during intermittent fasting, ensure you are consuming enough protein and engaging in regular strength training. You can lift heavy weights at lower repetitions, moderate weights at higher repetitions, or a combination of the two. Distribute protein intake evenly across meals within your eating window.

## Why Should I Stop Snacking At Night

# Why should I stop snacking at night?

Snacking late at night raises insulin thus prevents losing weight. Having higher insulin will prevent losing your belly. Make sure you do not have these snacks available in your space. In your last meal, to prevent snacking, add more fat to your meal.

## What Causes Phlegm While Fasting

# What causes phlegm while fasting?

I wouldn't worry too much about that. It could be one of the transition things you're going through. Of course, phlegm is part of the immune reaction. It could be just something that you can compensate with taking something like Spanish black radish or maybe something that's high in sulfur to help clean out your glands and things like that.

## How Many Grams Of Sugar Can I Have On Keto

# How many grams of sugar can I have on keto?

0!

---

## Why Am I Losing Muscle On Keto

# Why am I losing muscle on keto?

This could be due to low protein in your diet and a lack of exercise.

When you don’t want to lose muscle mass while doing intermittent fasting, add strength training as a part of your workout, loading up muscle to recruit as many muscle fibers as you can.

- Go heavy weight with a lower number of reps

- Go moderate amount of weight to failure

    Or you can do a combination of both the above. These two actions can create a hypertrophic effect on the muscles which can keep them bigger and prevent them from shrinking when you are doing keto and intermittent fasting.

## Does Intermittent Fasting Cause Gallstones

# Does Intermittent Fasting cause gallstones?

When we don't eat, we concentrate our bile up to 20x, and the more concentrated it is, the better to ensure we do not get stones. Also saturated fat triggers the release of bile and low fats dry up bile. Its the lack of bile that causes gallstones, not the excess. High carbs tend to lower your bile and cause gallstones as well.

## Hip Pain Relief Technique

# Hip Pain Relief Technique

[See Video/Image/Document](https://hls-player.drberg.com/asset?path=migrated-assets/the-fastest-way-to-hip-pain-relief-drberg)

You can do this technique on yourself, or you can have someone help you. This is a simple technique that you can do right at home to help get rid of hip pain fast.

Reference this video for a full demonstration of a unique technique to get hip pain relief fast! A few important points to keep in mind:

• Do not press on the side that hurts. Work on the opposite side from where you’re feeling pain.

• The way you know you’ve found the right spot is if it feels tender or sore. Apply light pressure and massage.

If this technique doesn’t work for you, you may be experiencing referred pain. For example, if you’re a female, a cyst on the ovary can cause hip pain. In this case, sea kelp may be a fantastic natural option to try.

## Is It Normal To Have Loose Watery Stools During A 48 Hour Fast

# Is it normal to have loose, watery stools during a 48-hour fast?

No, it's not normal. And there's obviously probably something going on with your microbes, that there's some imbalance. And sometimes if you actually do a first fast and you haven't done it before so what can happen is these microbes are so used to getting fed and all of a sudden you don't feed them. What I would probably recommend is to take a probiotic. Take something that survives the stomach acid too. Kefir is a good natural probiotic as well.
