## What Is The Most Effective And Fastest Way To Get Rid Of Double Chin

# What is the most effective and fastest way to get rid of double chin?

Ready to say goodbye to that turkey neck? Today, I'm sharing four simple exercises that can tighten loose skin and strengthen the muscles under your chin.

As we get older, it's common to develop loose skin, particularly in areas like the neck that don't get much exercise. But there's good news! By regularly performing these exercises, you can see a noticeable difference.

The secret lies in the fascia, a connective tissue beneath your skin that plays a crucial role in head and jaw movement. These exercises target both the superficial and deep layers of fascia, promoting a firmer, more toned neck.

We'll start by working the muscle responsible for opening your jaw, followed by an exercise that activates the superficial fascia. Next, we'll deeply stretch the fascia, and finally, we'll perform a head flexion exercise to strengthen it even further.

Remember, the key to success is consistency! By incorporating these exercises into your routine, you can effectively combat loose skin and achieve a more youthful neckline. So let's get started and say farewell to that turkey neck!

## What Is The Biggest Danger Of Prolonged Fasting

# What is the biggest danger of prolonged fasting?

Prolonged fasting is very beneficial to support a healthy body. However, there is one aspect of prolonged fasting that can be dangerous, and that’s what we’re going to cover today. Prolonged fasting is when you fast for three or more days. The biggest danger of prolonged fasting is called refeeding syndrome. This can happen if a person consumes too much of the wrong foods too fast after coming off of a prolonged fast.

However, the risk of refeeding syndrome is low if you aren’t malnourished going into a prolonged fast. As a bare minimum, when you start any type of fasting, you need to take electrolytes and B vitamins.

## What Is Hormesis

# What is hormesis?

Hormesis describes two things that might oppose each other. In terms of health, hormesis refers to a controlled dose of stress that makes positive changes for your body. With hormesis, you can adapt to various types of stress, including exercise, radiation, cold, heat, hypoxia, plant chemicals, pesticides, insecticides, and fungicides.

Sulforaphane found in broccoli sprouts and radish sprouts triggers the heat shock protein that allows the body to strengthen its detoxification enzymes. In this instance, the body is exposed to a small amount of poison that strengthens its ability to get rid of other poisons.

The liver contains phase 1 and phase 2 detoxification enzymes that can take a poison and turn it into a harmless particle.

Sulforaphane triggers this system. Exercise is one of the best examples of hormesis.

Exercise induces microinflammation but then allows the body to get rid of inflammation. Fasting activates the body’s mechanisms that counter starvation. It encourages our brain cells to grow, increases mitochondria, and regenerates the immune system.

Health is often counterintuitive. For example, cutting fat won’t help you lose fat, and sterilizing your environment won’t protect you from getting sick. You can’t develop a strong immune system without getting sick.

Antibiotics destroy good bacteria in the body, which can lead to pathogen overgrowth.

Antacids can lead to more heartburn because you need more acid to get rid of heartburn. When you don't expose yourself to the sun, you put yourself more at risk for certain types of cancers. Many people have been told that the sun causes cancer, but the sun gives us vitamin D. Having a deficiency in vitamin D can increase your risk for cancer.

One last example is dieting. The more dieting you do in your lifetime, the more weight you will gain—especially if you’re doing it incorrectly.

## What Is The Root Cause Of Peripheral Neuropathy

# What is the root cause of peripheral neuropathy?

Diabetic neuropathy usually affects the bottom of the feet and sometimes the hands and is one of the first signs of a blood sugar problem. Chemotherapy, hypothyroidism, autoimmune diseases, medications, viruses, and Lyme disease can also lead to peripheral neuropathy. However, high blood sugar and diabetes are the most common causes. Diabetes wears down the myelin sheath over time, leaving exposed nerves at the bottom of the feet. Peripheral neuropathy can feel like hypersensitivity, burning, severe pain, or itching. If it’s not corrected, it can lead to ulcers in the lower part of the body and gangrene.

Consuming too much sugar makes it difficult for the mitochondria to get enough fuel. Too much sugar also leads to nutrient deficiencies and inhibits the function of enzymes that bring fuel to the cell. When sugar blocks the body’s mechanism for getting energy to the cells, it utilizes alternative pathways for energy. One of these alternative pathways produces sorbitol, a sugar alcohol. Sorbitol can damage the lens of the eye, leading to cataracts. It can also affect the retina, leading to diabetic retinopathy. Sorbitol affects the cells that compose the myelin sheath. It can also convert to fructose, creating even more problems.

Benfotiamine is a fat-soluble form of vitamin B1 that can help support the nerves. Try taking 300 mg of benfotiamine 4 times daily. Lipoic acid is a cofactor for the enzyme that allows you to metabolize excess glucose. Vitamins B5, B2, and B3 are also cofactors for this enzyme. Diabetes damages your nervous system and brain over time, so it’s imperative to correct your diet, which I believe is the root cause of peripheral neuropathy. Learn more about the benefits of a low-carb diet and intermittent fasting in my other videos.

## What Is The Number Food That Depletes Vitamins From The Body

# What is the number food that depletes vitamins from the body?

Refined starches include rice flour, tapioca flour, corn flour, modified corn starch, maltodextrin, and modified food starch. Certain nutrients are required to metabolize refined starch and turn it into energy. Vitamin B1 (thiamine) is vital to this process. Refined starches are much higher on the glycemic index (GI) than sugar—this scale tells you how fast a food can raise blood sugar. Sugar is a 74 on the GI, while refined starches like maltodextrin are 180! Vitamin B1 is not stored in the body in large amounts, so consuming refined starches can quickly cause you to become deficient.

**Symptoms of vitamin B1 deficiency include:**

•Fatigue

•GI problems (slow digestion, bloating, constipation, nausea)

•Low stomach acid

•Low bile

•Stress

•Nervous tension

•Insomnia

•Frequent mood swings

•Muscle twitches

•Breathing problems

Much of the refined starch broken down into glucose in the body can not be used as energy, so it’s converted into lactic acid. This decreases oxygen in the body and makes it more acidic, which can cause hyperventilation and restless legs syndrome.

## What Is The Main Reason For Heart Attacks And Strokes

# What is the main reason for heart attacks and strokes?

If someone dies from a heart attack or stroke, their death is typically the result of a clot. A clot can form in less than 5 seconds! Usually, your body should form a clot, fix the hole in the artery, then dissolve the clot, but this doesn’t always happen.

Clots can be caused by the following:

•Smoking

•Pollution/chemicals

•Alcohol

•Birth control pills

•Stress

•Surgery

•Endurance sports

•Refined starches

•Infection

•High blood sugar

•Inflammation

Excess calcium in the arteries can also trigger clotting, which can lead to a heart attack or stroke. Postmenopausal women who take large amounts of calcium are at a much greater risk for blood clots. Calcium is involved in over 15 different clotting factors. Vitamin K2 prevents calcium from building up in the soft tissues and arteries. It is found in dairy, butter, and other fatty foods. Always take vitamin D with vitamin K2. Magnesium is another important calcium regulator. It helps prevent calcium from entering the soft tissues, as well as arrhythmias and atrial fibrillation. Nitric oxide can reduce clotting. Vitamin D, L-arginine, and sunlight can increase nitric oxide to help prevent heart attack. Polyphenols, vitamin C, and omega-3 fatty acids all support heart health and may help reduce your risk of clotting. Keto and intermittent fasting can help reduce clotting by reducing inflammation in your arteries. Regular moderate exercise is vital in preventing clotting. Garlic and onion are also essential. Nattokinase, serrapeptase, and bromelain can be taken as supplements to prevent clotting.

## What Is The 30 Day Sugar Detox Program And How Does It Help Reduce Sug 70A1B2

# What is the 30-Day Sugar Detox program, and how does it help reduce sugar intake and improve health?

What will happen if you cut sugar out of your diet for thirty days? Let’s talk about it.

Metabolic flexibility is a term used to describe how smoothly and efficiently your cells can adapt to utilize and burn fuel like fat, ketones, or glucose.

When you’re metabolically inflexible, this transition is very dysfunctional. Your ability to burn fat in a fasting state will be very difficult. If you can’t lose weight when fasting or exercising, this could be why.

Metabolic inflexibility can lead to diabetes, obesity, loss of muscle protein, and chronic illnesses. It can also cause irritability, fatigue, anxiety, and hunger. When you try to fast, you won’t feel very good, and you’ll miss out on certain benefits if you’re not metabolically flexible.

Insulin resistance is at the heart of this problem. Insulin controls whether you burn fat or not. If someone is metabolically inflexible, they have insulin resistance. Insulin tells the body not to burn fat and to store fat instead.

On the flip side, metabolic flexibility is really insulin sensitivity, and there are ways to make the body more metabolically flexible or insulin sensitive.

When you become more metabolically flexible, you’ll be able to fast for longer without hunger or cravings, burn fat, and burn sugar more efficiently.

How to transition your body into a state of metabolic flexibility and insulin sensitivity:

1\. Eat less frequently

2\. Eat fewer carbohydrates

3\. Eat sufficient amounts of fat, but not excessive amounts of fat

4\. Try exercise snacking (do short bouts of exercise throughout the day)

## Can Apple Cider Vinegar Boost Energy And How Might It Affect Metabolis Aada26

# Can apple cider vinegar boost energy, and how might it affect metabolism and energy production?

If you’re tired all of the time or lack energy, this one is for you.

It turns out that apple cider vinegar also supports energy. Apple cider vinegar is basically acetic acid, which can be absorbed by most of your tissues as fuel. If you’re on keto and fasting but lack energy, consuming apple cider vinegar is a great way to feel more energetic. On top of increased energy, you’re getting all the tremendous health benefits of apple cider vinegar.

**How to boost your energy levels using apple cider vinegar:**

Add one to two tablespoons of apple cider vinegar to a 16-ounce glass of water, and drink the mixture once a day. You can also add lemon and electrolyte powder for added benefits, but that’s optional.

## What Is The 1St Sign Of Fatty Liver

# What is the 1st sign of fatty liver?

There really is no “first sign” of a fatty liver. When you first start developing a fatty liver, there are no symptoms at all. It’s important to be aware of this because many people have a fatty liver and don’t even know it. People will start to notice signs once the condition has progressed.

Signs of a fatty liver:

• A protruding mid-section

• Insulin resistance

Fifty-nine percent of the fat in your liver originates from outside your liver—it’s fat from other places in your body that end up in the liver. Twenty-six percent of fat in the liver comes from the liver itself. The liver makes fat from glucose, and insulin is supposed to stop this process. But, because of dysfunctional fat and insulin resistance, the liver is making sugar uncontrollably. The third source of fat in the liver is dietary fat from consuming sugar. I believe the top cause of a fatty liver is a high-carb diet. The good news is that the liver is the only organ that can completely regenerate. However, there is a point of no return, so it’s time to act now.

**Natural things to do for a fatty liver:**

1\. Get on the Healthy Keto® diet and do intermittent fasting

2\. Exercise regularly

3\. Consume one to two tablespoons of apple cider vinegar in your water a few times a day

## What Is The Vitamin Deficiency Behind The Bladder Issues

# What is the vitamin deficiency behind the bladder issues?

**A vitamin B1 deficiency could lead to problems, including:**

• Leaky bladder

• Incomplete urination

• Frequent urination

• Getting up in the middle of the night to urinate

The common thread behind these bladder issues is actually a problem with the nervous system. The main control with urine elimination stems from the brain, and this part of the brain is very sensitive to a vitamin B1 (thiamine) deficiency. A thiamine deficiency in the brain can even starve off certain neurons, causing a lack of function. The part of the brain that controls the bladder can shrink, leading to a loss of control of the bladder. This situation is common with age and in those with diabetes, prediabetes, or chronic insulin resistance.

**Natural tips to get rid of bladder issues:**

1\. Take vitamin B1 (benfotiamine and natural B1)

2\. Get on the Healthy Keto® diet and do intermittent fasting

3\. Drink 2.5 liters of fluid a day (not past 6 pm or 7 pm)

4\. Consume apple cider vinegar (1 to 2 TBSP in water)

5\. Reduce caffeine consumption

6\. Massage the bladder

## What Is An Autophagy On Steroids

# What is an autophagy on steroids?

Water fasting is when a person only consumes liquids for a period of time. When a person does dry fasting, they’re not consuming food or liquids. One of the biggest benefits of fasting is autophagy. Autophagy is a condition where your body recycles damaged proteins and turns them into new enzymes and structural proteins. Autophagy also helps you get rid of pathogens. Detoxification is just as important, if not more important, in some cases, as getting plenty of nutrients. One of the big purposes of sleep is to detoxify your cells. Fasting, especially dry fasting, mimics a lot of the benefits of sleep.

It’s important to note that about eight to ten percent of the water you get is produced by your own cells, which also enhances detoxification. But, if you drink a lot of water, your body doesn’t get a chance to produce metabolic water.

Dry fasting is essentially enhanced autophagy. Anything you can do to remove extra waste from the body is a great thing, especially for longevity.

**Top benefits of dry fasting:**

• It can help remove intracellular toxicity

• It can help strengthen biochemical machines

• It can help improve mitochondrial function

• It’s a strong epigenetic stimulus

• It can mimic some of the benefits of a deep sleep

## What Is The Real Reason For Rosacea

# What is the real reason for rosacea?

Rosacea is when your cheeks become really red and it looks like there’s a broken blood vessel. There is a huge connection between rosacea and SIBO or small intestinal bacterial overgrowth.

SIBO is a situation where the bacteria that should be in the large colon are growing in the small intestine. The main cause of SIBO is malnutrition.

What NOT to do:

1\. Add Probiotics – You already have too many microbes.

2\. Add Fiber – These microbes in the small intestine eat fiber.

What you SHOULD do:

1\. Smaller Vegetables – Cut down the amount of vegetables that you are consuming.

2\. Clove, Oregano, Garlic – These are great natural antibiotics

3\. Intermittent Fasting – There is a certain process that happens between meals that occurs in the gut and cleanses any residue of food and particles and pushes it down into the digestive tract into the large bowel.

4\. Apple Cider Vinegar (and Betaine Hydrochloride) – One of the most important things to do is to acidify the stomach because these microbes can’t live in an acidic environment.

One of the causes of SIBO is low stomach acid.

Causes of Low Stomach Acid:

• Antibiotics

• Anti-acids

• Junk food

• Too much baking soda

## What Is Glycine And What Are Its Essential Roles And Significance In P 1Fa4D5

# What is glycine, and what are its essential roles and significance in physiological processes, including metabolic functions, neurotransmission, and tissue repair?

**Glycine, beyond its crucial role in collagen production, supports various body functions contributing to overall health and disease prevention.**

**Antioxidant Production and Inflammation Reduction**

Glycine is essential for producing glutathione, the body's primary antioxidant, protecting cells from oxidative stress and inflammation. By supporting glutathione synthesis, glycine enhances the body's defenses against chronic diseases.

**Enhancing Sleep Quality**

Glycine improves sleep quality by promoting deeper, more restful sleep. Studies indicate that taking glycine before bed can help individuals fall asleep faster and achieve more restorative slow-wave sleep, crucial for repair, hormone balance, and cognitive function.

**Detoxification and Uric Acid Management**

Glycine aids liver detoxification processes, helping eliminate toxins and excess uric acid. This detoxification role may prevent conditions such as gout and kidney stones, illustrating glycine's impact on overall health.

**Regulating Blood Sugar Levels**

Glycine enhances insulin effectiveness and stabilizes blood sugar levels, essential for individuals with type 2 diabetes or those at risk. By supporting healthy insulin function, glycine may prevent diabetes and aid in weight management by reducing cravings and promoting satiety.

## What Is The Optimal Timing For Taking Specific Vitamins To Maximize Th C44Fad

# What is the optimal timing for taking specific vitamins to maximize their effectiveness and absorption, and how does timing impact their benefits?

**Optimizing Supplement Timing**

**Morning Supplements**

For energy and metabolism, take B-complex vitamins, especially B12, in the morning with breakfast. Research shows B vitamins can reduce fatigue and improve cognitive performance.

**Evening Supplements**

For relaxation and better sleep, consider magnesium before bedtime. Studies indicate magnesium can enhance sleep quality, particularly in those with sleep disturbances.

**Supplement Intake Considerations**

\- **With Food vs. Empty Stomach:** Iron is best absorbed on an empty stomach, while calcium should be taken with food to increase absorption. A 2015 study showed a 22% increase in calcium absorption when taken with a meal.

\- **Health Conditions:** Adjust supplement timing based on health conditions and medications. For instance, thyroid medication should be taken on an empty stomach, with a wait of 30 minutes before consuming other supplements or food. Consult a healthcare provider for personalized advice.

## What Is Metabolic Consistency

# What is metabolic consistency?

Consistency is crucial to maintaining the metabolic benefits of keto and intermittent fasting. When you consistently follow a [keto diet](https://www.drberg.com/blog/dr-berg-the-benefits-of-healthy-keto-part-1) and stick to your fasting schedule, your body adapts to using fat for fuel efficiently.

However, your metabolism can become confused if you frequently deviate from your keto diet or intermittent fasting routine. This inconsistency can lead to a slowdown in weight loss and a decrease in energy levels. Also, you should avoid doing the [dirty keto diet](https://www.drberg.com/blog/dirty-keto-diet).

Staying consistent with your keto and intermittent fasting practices is essential to maintain optimal metabolic health. This means sticking to your macronutrient ratios, avoiding cheat meals, and adhering to your fasting schedule as much as possible.

Remember, your metabolism is a dynamic system that adapts to your dietary habits. Consistency in your keto and intermittent fasting journey can achieve your desired health outcomes and keep your metabolism running efficiently.

## What Is Metabolic Adaptation

# What is metabolic adaptation?

### **Understanding Metabolic Adaptation**

Your body's metabolism is incredibly adaptable. When you change your diet or fasting routine, your metabolism adjusts accordingly. This process is known as metabolic adaptation.

[During ketosis](https://www.drberg.com/blog/how-to-know-you-are-in-ketosis), your body shifts from using glucose as its primary fuel source to [burning fat for energy](https://www.drberg.com/blog/7-surprising-ways-to-speed-up-fat-burning-and-lose-weight-faster). This metabolic switch can initially lead to decreased energy levels as your body adapts to using fat for fuel.

However, as you become more fat-adapted, your energy levels stabilize, and you may experience increased mental clarity and physical endurance. [Intermittent fasting](https://www.drberg.com/blog/is-intermittent-fasting-okay-for-a-diabetic) also triggers metabolic changes.

When you fast, your body enters a ketosis metabolic state, breaking down fat for energy. This process can lead to increased fat burning and potential weight loss.

## What Health Benefits Are Associated With Omega 3 Fatty Acids And How D 427Fdc

# What health benefits are associated with omega-3 fatty acids, and how do they contribute to overall well-being?

## **The Essential Role of Omega-3s in Brain Health**

[Omega-3 fatty acids](https://www.drberg.com/blog/basics-of-omega-3-fatty-acids), particularly DHA and EPA, are like the VIP nutrients for your brain. Omega-3s aren't merely beneficial but indispensable for nurturing and enhancing mental faculties like recollection, concentration, and emotional balance.

### **Understanding DHA's Impact on Cognitive Functions**

DHA acts as a cornerstone in brain health. It forms the building blocks of the brain itself, influencing how well we remember things, our ability to concentrate, and even our emotional stability.

[Studies](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4404917/) show that adequate levels of DHA can improve learning abilities, suggesting its significance cannot be overstated.

This fat isn't just sitting there; it's actively involved in creating cell membranes around neurons—think of it as insulation on wires that helps signals travel faster and more efficiently across your brain.

### **The Functional Benefits of EPA on the Brain**

EPA supports cognitive health from another angle—it plays a crucial role beyond structure by fostering an environment conducive to mental functioning.

While less direct than DHA’s structural benefits, research highlights the EPA’s importance in modulating mood disorders, which can indirectly impact cognitive function through improved mental well-being.

![Human eye illustration](https://drberg-dam.imgix.net/others/realistic-hologram-human-eye-real-close.jpg?w=992&auto=compress,format)

## **Nutritional Powerhouses for Brain and Eye Health**

Fish, especially those high in omega-3 fatty acids like DHA and EPA, resemble nature's brain food. DHA and EPA, abundant in certain fish, are essential for mental sharpness and keeping our vision clear.

### **Top Sources of DHA**

Not all fish swim the same course when it comes to boosting brain and eye health. [Salmon](https://www.drberg.com/blog/why-the-1-best-brain-food-to-boost-memory-focus-is-salmon), mackerel, and sardines lead the pack as they're rich in DHA. Including these fish in your diet can help enhance memory and focus and prevent age-related vision decline. 

### **Exploring Vegan Options for Omega-3s**

Vegans needn't miss out on the benefits of omega-3s for their brains and eyes. [Microalgae](https://www.drberg.com/blog/microalgae-pond-scum-or-superfood) supplements offer a plant-based source of DHA that supports cognitive function without compromising dietary principles.

## What Are The Least Effective Fasting Patterns For Beginners

# What are the least effective fasting patterns for beginners?

## **The Least Effective Fasting Patterns for Beginners**

While intermittent fasting can be a game-changer for many people, not all fasting patterns are created equal. Some methods may be too extreme or unsustainable for beginners, leading to frustration and potential health risks.

Choosing a fasting pattern that aligns with your goals, lifestyle, and individual needs is important. Here are two fasting methods that may not be the best choice for those just starting out:

### **The Five and Two Diet's Limited Ketosis Impact**

The five-and-two diet, also known as the 5:2 diet, involves eating normally for five days a week and restricting calorie intake to 500-600 calories on the other two non-consecutive days.

While this method may lead to some weight loss, it has limitations when it comes to achieving ketosis, a metabolic state where your body burns fat for fuel.

To enter ketosis, you typically consume fewer than 50 grams of carbohydrates daily for several days. With the five-and-two diet, the fasting days may not be long enough or consistent enough to trigger this fat-burning state.

As a result, beginners may not experience the full range of benefits associated with intermittent fasting, such as increased energy and improved mental clarity.

### **Alternative Day Fasting's Sustainability Concerns**

Alternative day fasting (ADF) is another popular method that involves alternating between "fast" days, on which you consume only 25% of your normal calorie intake, and "feast" days, on which you eat without restriction.

While some studies have shown that ADF can lead to weight loss and improved health markers, it may not be the most sustainable approach for beginners.

The drastic calorie restriction on fasting days can be challenging to stick to long-term, leading to feelings of deprivation and even binge eating on feast days. This yo-yo effect can make establishing healthy eating habits difficult and may lead to weight regain over time.

Additionally, the constant fluctuation in calorie intake can be stressful on the body and may not be suitable for those with certain health conditions or a history of disordered eating.

For beginners, a more moderate and consistent approach to fasting may be a better choice for long-term success.

## **Recommended Fasting Patterns for Optimal Benefits**

Finding the right approach to intermittent fasting is key to unlocking its full potential. While some methods may be too extreme for beginners, several fasting patterns offer a more sustainable and effective way to reap the benefits of this lifestyle.

Here are three recommended fasting methods that have been shown to deliver optimal results:

### **The 18/6 Fasting Pattern**

The 18/6 fasting pattern, or the Leangains protocol, involves fasting for 18 hours and eating within a 6-hour window each day. For example, you might finish your last meal at 8 pm and not eat again until 2 pm the following day.

This method is popular among those looking to build muscle and lose fat, as it allows for more flexibility in meal timing and macronutrient intake.

Fasting for an extended period also gives your body ample time to enter a fat-burning state and experience the benefits of [increased growth hormone levels](https://www.drberg.com/blog/increase-growth-hormone-as-you-age) and [autophagy, a cellular cleanup process](https://www.drberg.com/blog/the-real-reason-why-autophagy-exists) that helps remove damaged proteins and organelles.

### **The 20/4 Fasting Strategy**

The 20/4 fasting strategy may be a good fit for those looking for a more aggressive approach. This method involves fasting for 20 hours and eating within a 4-hour window daily.

While this may sound intense, many people find that the longer fasting helps them feel more focused and energized throughout the day.

The 4-hour eating window also allows for larger, more satisfying meals, which can be especially appealing for those who enjoy the social aspect of dining.

Research has shown that the 20/4 method can be highly effective for weight loss and improving markers of metabolic health, such as insulin sensitivity and blood sugar control. It may also offer cognitive benefits, such as improved brain function and memory.

## What Is The Role Of Diet Plans

# What is the role of diet plans?

Adopting a specific diet plan can be a powerful tool in managing your child's sugar intake and improving their overall health and behavior. The **Healthy Keto diet**, which emphasizes whole, nutrient-dense foods while limiting sugar and processed carbohydrates, is one such plan. By focusing on healthy fats, proteins, and non-starchy vegetables, this diet can help stabilize blood sugar levels, reduce inflammation, and enhance brain function.

Many parents have observed significant improvements in their children's focus, calmness, and self-control after implementing the Healthy Keto diet. If your child struggles with mood issues related to high sugar intake, it’s advisable to check their blood sugar levels and consult with a healthcare professional to determine if this diet may be suitable.

**Managing Sugar-Related Mood Swings:**

Excessive sugar consumption is often linked to mood swings, irritability, and hyperactivity in children. Reducing sugar intake and incorporating healthier options can promote more stable moods.

For example, try a **keto pancakes recipe** as a nutritious and satisfying alternative to traditional high-sugar breakfast choices. By integrating such healthy options, you can support your child's mood stability and overall well-being.

## How To Break Your Prolonged Fast

# How to Break Your Prolonged Fast

Breaking a prolonged fast safely is crucial to avoid potential health issues such as refeeding syndrome.  This severe and potentially fatal medical condition happens when you start to increase your calorie intake after a prolonged fast. The reintroduction of carbohydrates triggers a shift from fat to carbohydrate metabolism, leading to severe electrolyte imbalances and fluid alterations. These imbalances can cause complications such as heart failure, seizures, and, in extreme cases, death. A crucial factor contributing to refeeding syndrome is nutrient deficiency, particularly phosphorus, potassium, and magnesium, which are rapidly depleted as they are used in metabolizing glucose upon resuming eating. This condition underscores the importance of carefully planning and executing the transition from fasting to a typical eating pattern to avoid such risks. 

Please review “[The #1 Danger of Prolonged Fasting You HAVE to Know About](https://youtu.be/ldi9vElgemE?si=Vvq1e-m8sgxxv15J)” to learn more about refeeding syndrome, its risks, and ways to help avoid it. 

Here are the steps to safely break a prolonged fast, based on Dr. Berg's advice: 

1. **Start Slowly**: Begin by consuming small amounts of food. It's important not to overwhelm your digestive system, which has been resting during the fast. 

2. **Supplement with Vitamin B1 (Thiamine)**: Essential for glucose metabolism and helps convert food into energy. It is particularly crucial during refeeding to help prevent refeeding syndrome. 

3. **Avoid High-Carbohydrate Foods**: Avoid foods high in carbohydrates immediately after a fast. They can rapidly deplete minerals like potassium, phosphorus, magnesium, and B1, increasing the risk of refeeding syndrome. 

4. **Choose the Right Foods**: 

1. **Keto-Friendly Foods**: [Keto-friendly foods](https://www.drberg.com/ketosis-approved-foods) help maintain stable blood sugar levels and prevent sudden depletion of essential minerals. 

2. **Easy-to-Digest Foods**: Foods like soups, smoothies, or bone broth are recommended as they are gentle on the stomach and more easily digested. 

3. **Gradual Increase**: Gradually increase the quantity and variety of foods over several days. This allows your body to adapt without causing undue stress on your metabolic system. 

4. **Listen to Your Body**: Pay close attention to how your body reacts during refeeding. If you experience any adverse symptoms, you may need to adjust and consume less food and/or space out your intake of nutrients. 

These steps can help reintroduce food to support your body’s needs and minimize potential risks. Consult a healthcare professional before starting or ending a prolonged fast, especially if you have pre-existing health conditions.

## What Is A Prolonged Fasting

# What is a Prolonged Fasting?

Prolonged fasting refers to not eating food for extended periods, typically 48 to 72 hours or longer.  Depending on individual goals and health conditions, it may extend to a week or more.   

Fasting to prolonged fasting can be thought of similarly to walking and running.  Fasting from your last meal of the day, overnight to the first meal of the next, is something we all do without much thought.  Walking and running are things an able-bodied person can typically do without much thought.   

Intermittent fasting is more like walking or running for regular exercise.  There is more thought into when and how long you will perform the exercise, and specific goals are made around it.  OMAD is like a 20 km or 12.4-mile walk or run.  While a 20 km walk or run and OMAD intermittent fasting are challenging, they are doable for many who have planned, prepared and practiced shorter distances or fasting durations.   

Prolonged fasting is comparable to marathon walking or running.  Proper planning, preparation, practice, health monitoring, and recovery are essential to fasting and a marathon.  If a marathon (26.2 miles or 42.2 km) seems daunting, you should think similarly of a 48- to 72-hour prolonged fast.  Longer prolonged fasts should be viewed as entering an ultramarathon. The longer you go, the more preparation, planning, practice, health monitoring, and recovery are needed.

## What Is The Optimal Time To Take Probiotics For Maximizing Their Effec C9D478

# What is the optimal time to take probiotics for maximizing their effectiveness, and how does timing impact their benefits?

Probiotics are microbes. Microbes are a crucial part of our world. They convert carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, and sulfur into forms that living things can use. We have ten times more microbes living on and inside our bodies than we have cells.

**Microbes have many functions and help us in various ways, including:**

• Helping to make nutrients available

• Providing immune protection

• Protecting against pathogens

• Supporting detoxification

• Improving digestion

• Helping to make vitamins

Strong hydrochloric acid in the stomach can kill a good portion of microbes. Bile salts also affect the microbiome. But, some microbes are resilient and can even live without oxygen.

**How to support the survival of probiotics in the stomach:**

1\. Take a probiotic supplement or consume probiotic foods at the end of your meal

2\. Consume probiotics earlier in the day

3\. If fasting, drink more water with your probiotics

4\. Don’t take probiotics with lemon water or apple cider vinegar water

5\. Consume raw plants grown in soil

## What Is Your Advice For Someone Who Has To Take Meds At A Certain Time 6558Af

# What is your advice for someone who has to take meds at a certain time while doing IF?

If you're taking medication while practicing intermittent fasting, it's crucial to prioritize liver and kidney health. While specific timing for medication intake varies, supporting your body with protective nutrients like milk thistle is beneficial. Milk thistle contains powerful phytonutrients that help mitigate the potential side effects of medications by reducing free radical damage and toxicity. This plant is well-known for its ability to protect against various toxins, making it a valuable supplement for those on medication.

## Crafting Your Intermittent Fasting Schedule

# Crafting Your Intermittent Fasting Schedule

Intermittent fasting (IF) offers versatile options that can align with your lifestyle. Choosing the right fasting window and incorporating supportive supplements can optimize your IF plan for sustainable results.

**Selecting Your Fasting Window**

Consider your daily routine and preferences when choosing a fasting window:

\- **16/8**: Fast for 16 hours and eat within an 8-hour window, typically skipping breakfast and starting your first meal at lunchtime.

\- **18/6**: Fast for 18 hours with a 6-hour eating window.

\- **20/4**: A more advanced method with a 20-hour fast and a 4-hour eating window, known as the Warrior Diet.

\- **OMAD (One Meal A Day)**: Consume all daily calories in a single meal within a 1-hour window.

Starting with a 16/8 schedule is often advisable for beginners, gradually progressing as your body adapts. The key is to find a plan that is both sustainable and enjoyable.

**Supporting Supplements**

To enhance your fasting experience, consider these supplements:

\- **Electrolytes**: Sodium, potassium, and magnesium help prevent dehydration and maintain electrolyte balance.

\- **Omega-3 Fatty Acids**: Found in fish oil, these support brain health and reduce inflammation.

\- **Probiotics**: Improve gut health and nutrient absorption.

Before adding new supplements, consult with a healthcare professional, especially if you have existing health conditions or are on medication.

By customizing your fasting schedule and supporting it with appropriate supplements, you can maximize the benefits of intermittent fasting and improve overall well-being.

## What Is The Initial Symptom That Typically Indicates The Presence Of G 841378

# What is the initial symptom that typically indicates the presence of gallstones?

Gallstones often present without symptoms in 80% of cases, but symptoms can include pain under the right ribcage and rhomboid, nausea, vomiting, and digestive issues like bloating and belching. The formation of gallstones is linked to high cholesterol and insufficient bile production, which is crucial for cholesterol metabolism. Bile sludge, a precursor to stones, can persist even after gallbladder removal, causing similar symptoms.

Natural approaches to manage gallstones include taking purified bile salts and probiotics, consuming salads, using acupressure, and reducing insulin levels through methods like intermittent fasting and the ketogenic diet.

## What Are The Potential Therapeutic Benefits Of Vitamin E Supplementati 126893

# What are the potential therapeutic benefits of vitamin E supplementation in the context of hepatic health and liver disease management?

There is a condition called NASH (non-alcoholic steatohepatitis), which is basically a fatty liver that has some inflammation. There have been many studies on using vitamin E for NASH.

Vitamin E has demonstrated significant improvement in:

1\. Steatosis (the fatty liver portion)

2\. Inflammation

3\. Ballooning of the liver cells (degeneration)

Essentially, vitamin E may have the power to reduce the fat, inflammation, and the death of the liver cells in adult patients with NASH that don’t have diabetes or cirrhosis. In one study, they used a natural version of only one part of the vitamin E complex. However, it may be beneficial to have the whole complex. They also used 800 IUs of this one part. Other studies have used up to 1000 IUs, while others only used 400 IUs. Between 800 and 1000 IUs may be the best idea.

Vitamin E may help stop the transition of going from having a fatty liver to an inflamed liver. It’s a very powerful antioxidant that may help calm free radicle damage, prevent inflammation, and prevent fibrosis.

Taking vitamin E alone may not change anything very much. But, changing the diet as well may make a more significant difference. The healthy keto diet with intermittent fasting may be the best way to go. Adding vitamin C in a food complex with choline may also be beneficial.

## How Can I Help A Friend To Lose Weight

# How can I help a friend to lose weight?

The #1 thing to do is help educate them about these problems. I’m going to talk about these issues in detail. Take a look. 

**1\. Cutting Calories** 

The most common mistake people make with weight loss is cutting calories. It is true that you want to reduce the frequency of meals, but you don’t want to lower your calories. Calorie reductions can cause:

• Slow metabolism

• Constant hunger

• Nutrient deficiencies. 

**2\. Low Fat**

You need healthy fats in your diet. Many people try to cut back on fats like butter and animal fat, but this is a mistake. Low-fat protein is actually much higher on the glycemic index. What this means is that it will cause your insulin to spike. The more their food choices trigger insulin, the less weight they’re going to lose. Keep in mind that fat has the least effect on insulin.

**3\. High Carbs** 

In the presence of too much insulin, you cannot lose fat. Insulin is a fat-storing hormone. Carbs are very high on the glycemic index. If you are eating carbs, you don’t be able to lose weight, you will have frequent cravings, and you will likely gain even more weight. Cut out the carbs by going on a healthy keto diet.

**4\. Monitoring Steps + Drinking Lots of Water**

This happens a lot with people who try to lose weight. They count steps, hit the treadmill or stationary bike, and drink lots of water, but they still don’t see significant results. Why? Because these things are only effective if you first work on the diet. In fact, exercise only makes up about 15% of weight loss results. Put more energy into your diet, and you’ll see far more results. 

**5\. Weighing Daily**

As you’ve probably heard me say before, get healthy to lose weight—don’t lose weight to get healthy. If you put too much of your attention on losing weight, you’re doing things backward. The main thing you can do to get healthy is to work on fixing insulin resistance with healthy keto and intermittent fasting. This can take time, so be patient. 

**6\. Six Small Meals Per Day** 

Every time you eat, you trigger insulin. If you consume 6 small meals every day, you are spiking your insulin over and over. This makes weight loss very difficult. Instead, do intermittent fasting. This will help fight off cravings, fix insulin resistance, and burn fat. 

Educate your friends and family on these points. This will give them the basics to help them lose weight.

## What Is The Most Critical Supplement For Supporting Optimal Health In  D29685

# What is the most critical supplement for supporting optimal health in individuals managing diabetes?

Benfotiamine is a synthetic B1. Vitamin B1 is naturally water-soluble. Benfotiamine is a fat-soluble B1 vitamin. This is one of the only synthetic vitamins that I like because it has virtually no side-effects.

I believe every diabetic should be taking benfotiamine. Vitamin B1 is involved in the engine in the mitochondria that involves glucose metabolism. The more glucose you have running through the machine, the higher the blood sugar, and the more depleted of vitamin B1 you’re going to become.

With diabetes, there are four main tissues involved, and B1 can help with all of them:

1\. Nerves/brain - Neuropathy 

2\. Eyes - Retina

3\. Kidney - Nephron

4\. Heart vessels - Microvascular endothelial dysfunction

Benfotiamine:

• 3-5x more absorption

• Protects against oxidation and AGEs

• Decreases A1C

• Protection

When it comes to benfotiamine dosage, consider taking at least 600mg of benfotiamine per day, and you can spread it out. You should also be doing healthy keto and intermittent fasting. 

***We recommend consulting with your doctor before making any dietary changes or before you start taking any new supplements, especially if you have any existing health conditions.***

## Does Skipping Meals Slow Metabolism

# Does skipping meals slow metabolism?

[See Video/Image/Document](https://hls-player.drberg.com/asset?path=migrated-assets/will-skipping-meals-increase-your-metabolism-drberg)

We have to differentiate between skipping a meal, otherwise known as infrequent meals or intermittent fasting, from just being on a low-calorie diet. They are two different things. When you decrease the frequency of your meals you’ll probably automatically reduce your calories. When you reduce your calories and the frequency of your meals you won’t feel too good. Here’s an example. I’ve done several cleanses in the past, I think it was the lemon water, cayenne pepper, and maple syrup one. I did it for ten days and it almost killed me!

The maple syrup was enough glucose to keep me out of ketosis and keep my blood sugar up and down while I was basically starving to death. I was so hungry it was torturous. I’ve done other cleanses and also felt terrible. So if someone brought up fasting, I’d reject it. But what I didn’t know then that I know now is that if you do keto (low carb) and infrequent meals and ease gradually into fasting, your hunger goes away. You adapt to burning your own fat.

**When you eat more frequently you can’t get into fat-burning mode.** **You’ll have a lot of blood sugar issues, but you won’t on keto and intermittent fasting. When you decrease meals you decrease insulin, which automatically increases your metabolic rate. You’ll feel really good because your brain loves ketones. If you do a search on how to increase your metabolism you’ll find suggestions like drink more water, eat more protein, eat spicy foods, and drink green tea. These are trivial.**

**These are the things that affect your metabolism:**

●Age, which you can’t do much about

●Dieting; go on keto and decrease the frequency of your meals

●Your diet as an infant or your mother’s diet when she was pregnant with you. If it was high carb and she developed insulin resistance you’re at higher risk of becoming prediabetic and having a slow metabolism.

●Insulin levels; decrease your meal frequency without cutting calories and see how much weight you lose

●Cortisol levels; decrease your stress

Skipping meals doesn’t slow your metabolism!

## What Is The Recommended Protocol For Managing And Treating Calcified P Cb26D9

# What is the recommended protocol for managing and treating calcified plaque in the arteries?

**What you could do for calcification in the arteries:**

1\. Allicin  This is a phytonutrient in garlic. There is some interesting research on the association of allicin and decreased artery calcification in animals. 

2\. Butyrate  This is a compound that the microbes in the gut make when you feed them fiber (vegetable fiber). It’s a type of fat, a small-chain fatty acid. Butyrate has been associated with a decreased risk of artery disease. 

3\. Lycopene  This is a phytonutrient in certain vegetables. There is some interesting data showing how lycopene can decrease the thickness of the wall of the arteries and decrease the stiffness. 

4\. Omega-3 fatty acids  You can find this in cod liver oil or fish oils. Omega-3 fatty acids may help decrease inflammation.

5\. GLA (gamma-linolenic acid)  This is a type of omega-6 fatty acid that is actually friendly to your arteries. A few examples would be borage oil, black currant seed oil, and evening primrose oil. GLA may help decrease inflammation, decrease the thickness of the arteries, and decrease plaque formation in the arteries. 

6\. Vitamin K2 (MK-7 version) You may want to consider consuming 300mcg of vitamin K2 every day. Vitamin K2 can activate a certain protein that inhibits calcium from forming in the arteries. 

7\. Tocotrienols  This is one form of the vitamin E complex. Tocotrienols can greatly decrease inflammation in the arteries. 

8\. Decrease insulin resistance  Do whatever you can to decrease and reverse insulin resistance. There is a direct relationship between having insulin resistance and having calcification in the arteries. A lot of these other remedies may not work unless you also fix insulin resistance. You can help fix insulin resistance by doing the healthy keto diet and intermittent fasting. 

**The most important combination:**

• Address insulin resistance 

• Tocotrienols 

• Vitamin K2 

• Allicin 

• Omega-3 fatty acids 

**Secondary**:

• Butyrate 

• Lycopene 

• GLA

## What Is The Best Time Of Day To Break A Fast

# What is the best time of day to break a fast?

One of the biggest questions surrounding Intermittent Fasting is when to break the fast. However, the truth is that there is no one-size-fits-all answer to this question.

The best time of day to break a fast is wholly based on an individual's schedule, lifestyle, and preferences. Some people prefer to break their fast in the morning, while others prefer to do so in the afternoon or evening. The timing of the feeding window will also depend on the length of the fast.

Certain feeding times may have greater results for some individuals, but this doesn't mean that it's the best time for everyone. So, the key to success with intermittent fasting is finding a feeding schedule that works for you and your lifestyle.

In this video, Dr. Berg presents evidence that feeding in the morning *may* promote positive results, but he acknowledges that the results may vary by individual. [https://youtu.be/GW3UMJOJs9E?si=bBa6Ty4bAzzvdOgy](https://youtu.be/GW3UMJOJs9E?si=bBa6Ty4bAzzvdOgy)

Ultimately, listen to your body, experiment with different feeding times, and find the one that works best for you. Remember, the most important thing is to make sure you're getting the nutrients your body needs to function properly, whether it's in the morning, afternoon, or evening.

## What Are The Potential Health Benefits Of Incorporating Herbs Into One 9A8C2B

# What are the potential health benefits of incorporating herbs into one’s diet or wellness regimen?

Herbs are any plants with leaves, seeds or flowers used for flavoring, food, medicine or perfume. Out of all of the categories of foods, herbs are at the top of the list for the antioxidants they provide. Antioxidants provide health benefits in addition to the vitamins, minerals and other nutrients in the herbs.

**Various valuable herbs**

- Oregano - antimicrobial, antiviral and antifungal

- Sage - supports the nervous system and good for relaxation

- Peppermint - good for the digestive system

- Thyme - antimicrobial

- Lemon balm - can help calm the nervous system, reduces stress and promotes sleep

- Rosemary - antimicrobial and the oil can help stimulate hair growth

- Clove - high in antioxidants, antimicrobial, antiparasitic and has a numbing effect, can help with toothache

- Allspice - good for pain and inflammation

- Gymnema - good for sugar and carb cravings

- Cinnamon - especially good for blood sugar issues

- Garlic - antifungal, antimicrobial, antiviral, anticancer and supports lungs

- Cumin - high in nutrients, powerful antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, good for digestion, antifungal, antiparasitic, antimicrobial, antidiabetic and may help lower blood pressure

**Best herbs for parasites**

A parasite is a microorganism like a worm or bacteria that basically lives on the energy of your body, but doesn’t give anything back. Even though your friendly bacteria live on energy from your body, they are not parasites because they are actually providing a lot of benefits in exchange.

Herbs for parasites include:

- Wormwood

- Black walnut hulls

- Garlic

- Clove

Before you start these herbs, you may want to take purified bile salts. You can take it 3 times a day on an empty stomach. Then the next day, you could try taking the herbs. You may want to start slowly and gradually work your way up to the recommended dose on the package.

When you do a parasite cleanse, you may want to do it for at least one month. You could even do it for six weeks before you stop taking the herbs and see how you do. It’s not a bad idea to do this every 6 months or so.

**Spices and herbs for anti-aging**

- Anise

- Cinnamon

- Allspice

- Clove

- Oregano

**Spices and herbs for gallbladder and liver**

These can be helpful if you have problems with the gallbladder and you don’t want to take purified bile salts. If you’re not a vegan, you can combine these herbs with purified bile salts.

## What Is A Reactive Hypoglycemia

# What is a reactive hypoglycemia?

I explain what reactive hypoglycemia is and why you need to understand it. There’s a condition called postprandial hypoglycemia which is different; it’s the low blood sugar that happens anywhere from immediately to four hours after a meal, especially a high carb one.

Your body tries to keep your blood sugar tightly controlled; not too high, not too low. Insulin is the hormone that tries to reduce your blood sugar. There are other hormones releasing sugar back into your blood to ensure your blood glucose doesn’t go too low.

Too low and you could experience these symptoms: tiredness, brain fog, dizziness, craving sweets, or even a coma if it goes badly low. With hypoglycemia, the insulin overreacts and pushes the blood sugar down with too much force and/or not enough adrenal support so your cortisol is low.

If you have a liver problem and your body doesn’t have enough of the hormone called IGF to counter the insulin. Or there’s another hormone produced by the pancreas called glucagon which also counters insulin.

Sometimes the medical profession doesn’t acknowledge that hypoglycemia exists. There are levels of hypoglycemia. You can’t just test fasting glucose, you have to test blood sugar at one-hour intervals for four hours after a meal. I don’t even think the test is valid because you drink a glucose mixture. Ideally your blood sugar is below 70. But even if it’s 75 or 80 and you have hypoglycemia symptoms, you could have severe insulin resistance. Because insulin controls the input of glucose into your cells, your cells could be starving for glucose yet your blood sugar tests at a normal level.

I agree that the best diet for hypoglycemia emphasizes healthy fats and protein. But it’s really as simple as cutting out carbs. I guarantee if you stop eating carbs and adapt to fat burning your blood sugar will come out nicely and you won’t have hypoglycemic symptoms anymore. Our bodies aren’t designed to run off of high carbohydrate diets. Some experts advise frequent small meals to heal longstanding hypoglycemia. I disagree. Every time you eat you stimulate insulin. If you eat less frequently you’ll keep insulin low. Without high insulin your blood sugar will be level.

## What Is Hypoglycemia Without Symptoms

# What is hypoglycemia without symptoms?

When adopting a ketogenic diet or fasting, lower blood sugar levels, even below typical thresholds, can occur without symptoms in individuals adapted to using ketones and fats for energy. Symptoms of hypoglycemia, such as confusion, irritability, and shaking, indicate true hypoglycemia despite low readings, warranting attention. Idiopathic hypoglycemia, related to insulin receptor issues, or reactive hypoglycemia post-carb meals are also considerations. Transitioning to a low-carb ketogenic diet and integrating fasting gradually can effectively manage these conditions.

## What Are The Common Symptoms Associated With A Skin Rash And How Can T 7Fd779

# What are the common symptoms associated with a skin rash, and how can these symptoms vary based on the underlying cause?

When you have poor blood clotting or nutrient deficiencies you may have red, pink or purple spots on your skin that can also itch. What is important to know is that for healthy functioning of the skin we need several vitamins. Let’s look at the known remedies for this condition.

**Cause #1: Bile deficiency**

Bile is a very important liquid that is produced in your liver and stored in your gallbladder. The main function of bile is digestion of fats as well as certain vitamins. Additionally, If you consume too much fat and are unable to digest it, this can cause skin rash. In such a case purified bile salts can help you digest fats.

**Cause #2: Vitamin B2 deficiency**

Vitamin B2 is very important for healthy levels of the skin as well as for proper digestion of fats. The more fat you eat, the more B2 you need. Lack of B2 in the body can cause skin rash.

**Cause #3: Allergies**

Allergy means intolerance to certain types of foods or environmental elements, like pollen. Your body overreacts to the thing causing allergy (allergen), creating a lot of symptoms like inflammation, irritation, etc. The best way to see if you have an allergy is to look back and see what you ate or were exposed to just before getting a rash. Chances are that there was an unusual type of food or an environmental substance you were exposed to.

**Detoxification:**

Additionally, while on keto and intermittent fasting, your body may go through a detoxification cycle. This is because you are burning and breaking down your body fat, which releases toxins that were stored in the fatty tissue. Therefore, fat-burning can cause this reaction.

- Increase vegetables

- Take bentonite clay on an empty stomach

## What Is The Most Potent Treatment For Eradicating Candida Infections

# What is the most potent treatment for eradicating candida infections?

Now, we normally have candida living in our bodies without any issue. But when you take an antibiotic, your defenses are lowered and you end up with an overgrowth of candida. This is a fungal infection caused by yeast, the most common being candida Albicans.

If this infection turns your tongue white, that’s a condition called thrush. Sometimes the white patches are on the inside of your cheek; sometimes there are small red patches on your tongue. If the infection is in your vagina, it’s called a yeast infection. If in your esophagus, it’s called candida esophagitis.

Garlic is, hands down, the most powerful fungus killer. It also works on toenail fungus. Garlic has a natural phytochemical called ajoene that’s responsible for its power to kill fungus. Ajoene is also a natural blood thinner; drug companies are researching it to use in medication for blood clotting disorders.

Crush up fresh garlic and put it in your food on a regular basis. But you also have to fix your diet! Lower your sugar intake. Reduce your consumption of milk sugar. I recommend a healthy keto plan with intermittent fasting. If you’re consuming garlic but your sugar and carb consumption is still high, I doubt your fungal infection will go away. You want to starve off the fungus and re-establish the friendly flora in your body.

I also recommend a type of probiotic called effective microbes, to help your gut flora. Garlic has many other phytochemicals that provide you with health benefits. Not only is it anti-fungal, but antibacterial and antiviral as well. Garlic has been shown to be very effective for basal cell carcinoma, the most common type of skin cancer.

Now you can see how effective garlic is to kill candida.

## What Is Glucagon And What Is Its Role In The Body

# What is glucagon and what is its role in the body?

The pancreas has two cells: Beta cells, which make insulin, and Alpha cells, which make another hormone called glucagon.

Glucagon opposes insulin, which means insulin lowers blood sugar, and glucagon raises it by breaking down glycogen, stored sugar in the liver. Glucagon also makes new glucose if needed, and that process is called gluconeogenesis.

Ways Glucagon Raises Blood Sugar:

1\. Breaks down glycogen

2\. Makes new glucose (gluconeogenesis)

3\. Activates fat release

4\. Inhibits fat storage

5\. Increases bile release

What Triggers Glucagon:

1\. Lower blood glucose or lower insulin

2\. Amino Acids (Moderate amount)

3\. Exercise – The more exhaustive it is, the more triggering, up to 4 to 5x.

## What Is The Timeline For Potential Vision Loss In Individuals With Dia 304Bef

# What is the timeline for potential vision loss in individuals with diabetes, and what factors can influence the onset and progression of diabetic retinopathy?

Normally, it takes 10 years of exposure to high blood sugar before you notice very serious complications to your nervous system, eyes, kidney, and even the brain.

**Some Complications of High Sugar:**

• Numbness in Fingertips and Toes

• Infections

• Kidney Leaks Protein

• Nerves of the Eyes get destroyed

High levels of glucose combined with proteins in the tissue create this situation called Glycated Proteins. The nerves of the eye are fed to the vascular system, if the blood vessels to the nerve can’t flow blood anymore, the nerves die – which causes blindness in a diabetic person. It is a condition called diabetic retinopathy.

• Normal Fasting Blood Glucose: Between 70 – 90

• Prediabetic: 100 – 125

• Diabetic: Over a 125

## What Are The Underlying Causes Of Leaky Gut Syndrome

# What are the underlying causes of leaky gut syndrome?

Leaky gut is a digestive condition in which bacteria and toxins are able to “leak” through the intestinal wall. This condition can create food sensitivities and an immune system response, causing discomfort and inflammation. This is basically a scurvy in the colon.

**Symptoms:**

- Chronic diarrhea, constipation, or bloating

- Food sensitivities

- Scar tissue in the colon

- Nutritional deficiencies

- Fatigue

- Headaches

- Confusion

- Difficulty concentrating

- Skin problems

- Joint pain

- Widespread inflammation

**Cause #1: Vitamin C deficiency**

A lack of vitamin C can cause a loss of collagen in the lining of the intestines, opening gaps in the intestinal walls that allow undigested proteins or harmful bacteria to enter the intestinal cavity. So you have leaks that go into the blood vessels and that creates an immune reaction or food sensitivities.

**Remedies:**

- Take natural vitamin C complex (not ascorbic acid)

- Consume the following foods with bioflavonoid (the component of vitamin C that helps with leaky gut):

    - sprouted buckwheat

    - quercetin

    - parsley

    - onions

    - green tea

    - citrus

    - cruciferous vegetables

- Avoid things that will deplete you of vitamin C:

    - smoking

    - carbs and sweets

    - snacking

(Note: If you try the above remedies, consuming natural vitamin C complex and the foods above, and leaky gut does not resolve, the issue can be insulin resistance in the body. When you have insulin resistance, vitamin C is depleted by the high level of insulin produced in the body. In this case you should do a Healthy Keto® diet and intermittent fasting plan.)

**Other causes:**

- Insulin resistance

## What Is Rheumatoid Arthritis And What Are The Common Symptoms Associat 8Ced0E

# What is rheumatoid arthritis, and what are the common symptoms associated with this autoimmune condition?

**Rheumatoid Arthritis**

Rheumatoid arthritis is an autoimmune disease causing joint pain on both sides of the body due to immune system attacks on healthy cells.

**Microbial Connection**

Studies link knee rheumatoid arthritis to bacteria like porphyromonas gingivalis found in knee and heart joints.

**Natural Antibiotics**

Test with natural antibiotics like goldenseal, tea tree oil, myrrh, garlic, thyme, oregano oil, and olive leaf extract to check if microbes are the cause.

**Supporting Immune System**

Boost immune health and reduce inflammation with vitamin D (20,000-60,000 IU/day), vitamin K2 (300 mcg/day), zinc (200 mg 3x/day for 1-2 weeks), Healthy Keto® diet, intermittent fasting, potassium (6,000 mg/day), ginger, turmeric, cinnamon, omega-3 fatty acids, ozone therapy, and thunder god vine (570 mg).

## What Is Atrial Fibrillation And How Does It Affect Heart Rhythm And Ov 1613Aa

# What is atrial fibrillation, and how does it affect heart rhythm and overall cardiovascular health?

Atrial fibrillation is when the beats of the heart’s upper chambers—known as the atria—are out of sync with the lower chambers. This causes an erratic and abnormally fast heartbeat. This condition is usually triggered by a magnesium deficiency. It can also be a potassium deficiency. However, it is difficult to determine these mineral differences because of where most of the minerals are located - inside the cell. It is recommended to take a type of magnesium called angstrom, which is 1 million times smaller than other forms.

## What Is The Relationship Between Glycogen Stores And Electrolytes When 9C1781

# What is the relationship between glycogen stores and electrolytes when doing Keto and Intermittent fasting?

**Glycogen is series of glucose molecules linked together as a group. When you have more glycogen, you are going to hold more water. Doing ketogenic diet and intermittent fasting will shrink down glycogen that could cause the symptoms in transitioning from sugar burning to fat burning.**

**Problems of Deplete Minerals:**

• Sodium – Weaker muscles, keto flu, dizziness, low blood pressure

• Potassium – Fatigue, Sleep problems, higher pulse rate. Potassium is needed for energy and also calmness when sleeping.

• Calcium – Cramps

• Magnesium – Sleep problem, cramps, heart rhythm

## What Is Usually The Initial Sign Of Magnesium Deficiency And How Can I 47A793

# What is usually the initial sign of magnesium deficiency, and how can it manifest in individuals?

The first sign of a magnesium deficiency is getting tired more easily when exercising.

**Aside from this symptom, you may also experience:**

• Poor memory

• High blood pressure

• Higher risk of soft tissue calcification

• Poor sleep

• Irritability

• Arrhythmias

• Cramps and tetany

• Tremors

There are over 300 enzymes that depend on magnesium to function. 65% of patients in intensive care are magnesium deficient. It is estimated that over half of the world’s population is low on their RDAs of magnesium. If you’re doing intermittent fasting and you’re low on magnesium, the negative effects can be magnified. Also, keep in mind that 80% of alcoholics are magnesium deficient.

## What Is The Remedy For The Liver Cirrhosis Caused By Hepatitis C

# What is the remedy for the liver cirrhosis caused by Hepatitis C?

When you have hepatitis C or some other virus attacking the liver, this may cause high amounts of iron in the body. The iron is inflammatory and creates oxidative damage. Normally your liver gets rid of excess iron in the body. However if your liver is infected, for example with hepatitis C, it will not be able to remove this iron, which will cause further damage. One thing to know is that viruses and bacteria grow by consuming iron. This situation can eventually turn into cirrhosis of the liver.

**Remedies:**

- Consume lactoferrin

- Do an intermittent fasting plan

- Do periodic prolonged fasting

- Consume vitamin D (at least 20,000 IU / day)

- Consume natural antibiotics

    - garlic

    - clove

    - thyme

    - oregano oil

    - grapefruit seed extract

**\*We recommend consulting with your doctor before making any dietary changes or before you start taking any new supplements, especially if you have any existing health conditions.**

## What Is The Most Effective Remedy For Depression

# What is the most effective remedy for depression?

There is an interesting link between BDNF and depression. It’s been found that there is no way to diagnose depression. But, it was also found that people who are depressed have low levels of BDNF. Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) is an important molecule involved in learning and memory.

So an interesting question is how to enhance BDNF. All of the trials delivering BDNF into the central nervous system have failed. So, how can we enhance it naturally?

BDNF is basically a fertilizer for the brain. It helps with nerve growth, nerve differentiation, and the maintenance of the synapse between the nerves.

**Benefits of BDNF:**

- It can help improve learning

- It can help improve long-term memory

- It helps higher thinking

- It helps you think more clearly

- It helps you become more mentally alert

- It can decrease inflammation

- It can increase the absorption of neurotransmitters

**Things to help enhance BDNF and get out of depression:**

- Deep sleep (at least 7 high-quality hours of deep sleep)

- Exercise (the fastest and most effective method of increasing BDNF)

- Sunlight

- Intermittent fasting and periodic prolonged fasting

- Healthy Keto®

- Avoiding sugar

- Magnesium

***We recommend consulting with your doctor before making any dietary changes or before you start taking any new supplements, especially if you have any existing health conditions.***

## Is Losing 5 Pounds Per Month Normal

# Is losing 5 pounds per month normal?

It depends. Some people would say that it’s not normal and that you should be losing a lot more.

When you evaluate anything, you’re comparing what’s normal and what’s going on with you. So, it’s very important for you to know what is normal and what’s not. Someone with a healthy fast metabolism could lose about two pounds of fat per week. If a person is fasting for a week, they might lose about 3.5 pounds.

But, you might have a slow metabolism, which means you might only lose one pound per week. Normal weight loss for someone with a slow metabolism is half a pound to one pound of fat per week. So, four pounds of fat loss per month isn’t bad for someone with a slow metabolism.

It’s important to keep in mind that it only takes a tiny amount of carbohydrates to block fat burning for two to three days. There are different factors like this to look at, so you can know what normal actually is and so you don’t get frustrated and give up when it’s actually working.

## What Is A Keto Fat Bomb

# What is a keto fat bomb?

A keto fat bomb is a keto dessert that is loaded with healthy fats. It is a great way to stay satisfied between meals if you’re doing the keto diet and intermittent fasting.

Just remember to only have one with your meal, as a keto dessert, and not as a snack between meals.

There is no sugar in these tasty keto-friendly treats – only healthy fats to help get your body move into fat-burning and stay in fat-burning.

**Chocolate Keto Fat Bombs Ingredients:**

1⁄2 cup coconut oil

1⁄2 cup peanut butter

2 Tbsp cocoa powder

3 Tbsp xylitol or other sweetener

1⁄4 tsp vanilla

**Instructions:**

Mix it all up, pour into a tray and put into freezer.

## Why Do I Have Digestive Issues When Im Breaking My Fast

# Why do I have digestive issues when I’m breaking my fast?

This could happen because, basically, your digestive system has gone to sleep and it hasn’t woken yet. You don’t want to eat a large meal after a long fast because you will overload your system. You need to start small.

After a long fast, you may also want to take certain things, such as:

- Apple cider vinegar (ACV) or betaine hydrochloride

- Bile salts

- Enzymes

- Probiotics

Foods to avoid after a long fast:

- Nuts and nut butters

- Red meat

- Raw cruciferous vegetables

- Dairy products

## Can I Eat Cornstarch On Keto

# Can I eat cornstarch on keto?

You can’t. Starch is a bunch of glucose molecules stuck together. It’s basically concentrated sugar. It breaks down a little slower than pure sugar, but it will still raise insulin.

---

## Can I Add Carrots To My Salad On Keto

# Can I add carrots to my salad on keto?

Yes in moderate amounts.

**What is the glycemic index of carrots?**

It’s 72, which is high.

**What is the glycemic index?**

It’s a scale of carbohydrates and how fast each carbohydrate will raise your blood sugar. Below 55 is low, above 70 is high.

But, we need to look at the whole picture.

The glycemic load is the concentration of carbohydrates in a food. The glycemic load will take into consideration the fiber, as well.

The calculation for glycemic load is:

The glycemic index multiplied by the number of carbs divided by 100. Less than 10 would be low, over 21 would be high.

**For carrots:**

72 multiplied by 4 g divided by 100 = 2.88 (very low)

Even though carrots are high on the glycemic index, they have a lot of fiber which inhibits the glycemic reaction.

But, different variables, like taking the carrot juice out of the carrot fiber, or cooking the carrots, can raise the glycemic index.

Overall, are carrots healthy? Yes.

Are carrots one of the keto-friendly vegetables? Yes. 

Can I eat corn on keto? No, due to the high carbohydrate content.

Corn nutritional profile:
Potassium 476 mg
Carbohydrates 123 g
Sugar 1 g
Protein 16 g

## What Is The Difference Between Keto And Atkins

# What is the difference between keto and Atkins?

Here are some of the characteristics of the Atkins diet:

1\. The Atkins diet only recommends 1 to 3 cups of vegetables per day. This is way too low; it can cause a fatty liver.

2\. If you are not hungry, add a protein snack – bad advice because this will stimulate insulin. Protein does increase insulin, which will then cause a lowering of the blood sugars, making you hungry again.

3\. Atkins recommends artificial sweeteners as okay – but most will trigger insulin.

4\. The Atkins diet gives the option of 5 small meals a day. These will trigger insulin release 5 times, knocking you out of fat burning.

5\. Atkins also recommends that you not skip a meal – bad advice because eating in general stimulates insulin. If you’re fasting and burning fat and not hungry why not skip a meal? Your body will then eat its own fat. What do you think you do when you eat breakfast? – You have been fasting all night and you break the fast by eating, hence the name “break-fast.”

6\. The Atkins diet does not put a limit on protein – another bad idea because excess protein blocks fat burning.

## What Is A Speed Keto Diet Plan

# What is a speed keto diet plan?

For those on the Healthy Keto® diet seeking to enhance intermittent fasting, ensure you're already following these steps:

\- Intermittent fasting with 1 to 2 meals within 4 hours

\- Ketogenic diet with less than 20 grams of carbs per day

\- Plenty of salad, moderate protein, and sufficient healthy fats

\- Avoidance of soy oil and regular exercise

To elevate your progress:

1\. Avoid starchy vegetables like squash, corn, and carrots.

2\. Enhance insulin resistance with potassium, Vitamin D, plant-based trace minerals, and Vitamin B1.

3\. Incorporate full-body high-intensity exercise twice a week with adequate recovery.

4\. Manage stress using techniques like acupressure to reduce cortisol levels.

5\. Consider choline supplements if you have a fatty liver.

**\*We recommend consulting with your doctor before making any dietary changes, especially if you have any existing health conditions.**

## What Is The Most Effective Diet For Reducing Belly Fat During Menopause

# What is the most effective diet for reducing belly fat during menopause?

The keto diet is the best diet for menopausal women.

During menopause, women experience a sudden loss of ovarian function. With that comes a spike in insulin, which causes belly fat.

When you go through menopause, your insulin is going to be higher and you’ll have insulin resistance. Here’s the Healthy Keto® way to handle it:

- Cut carbs down to 20 to 50 g per day (eat plenty of vegetables though)

- Moderate protein

- Don’t go low-fat

- Intermittent fasting: 3 meals with no snacks (and if you’re not hungry, don’t eat)

Is keto beneficial to menopausal women? Yes. You want to do keto and get into ketosis, especially if you’re going through menopause. Healthy Keto is the healthiest way, and the lowest- stress way, to lose belly fat.

## Can I Consume Breakfast On Keto

# Can I consume breakfast on Keto?

Many people say it’s the most important meal of the day–right? Some people will say that there are a lot of negative health consequences associated with skipping breakfast.

The idea that breakfast is the most important meal of the day and that skipping breakfast is a bad thing basically started with a fear campaign to get people to eat more cereal and bacon.

Dr. Berg believes it’s false that eating breakfast is important. If you skip breakfast, you could potentially help prevent certain health problems.

The real benefits of skipping breakfast:

- Weight loss

- Less appetite

- Mental clarity

- Faster metabolism

- Fewer cravings

- Better mood

- Less tendency toward metabolic syndrome

## What Is The Best Food For Me To Eat To Get Calcium

# What is the best food for me to eat to get calcium?

Cheese is the food highest in calcium. In particular, Parmesan cheese. You can also get calcium from leafy greens, nuts and seeds.

---

## What Is Too Much Fat On A Ketogenic Diet

# What is too much fat on a ketogenic diet?

Too much dietary fat can cause:

\- Floating stool

\- Bloating

\- No weight loss

\- Right shoulder/rib pain

\- Nausea

\- Oily stool

\- Lack of appetite

If you have these symptoms, reduce fat to 75 grams per day.

For hypoglycemia, you might need more fat but avoid gallbladder overload. Excess fat between meals prevents burning body fat in ketosis. Combine ketosis with intermittent fasting.

Aim for 70% of calories from fat (20-40g per meal). Gradually increase fat to adapt. Once adapted, you'll burn stored fat more efficiently.

## What Is Bulletproof Coffee And Is It Recommended For A Ketogenic Diet

# What is bulletproof coffee, and is it recommended for a ketogenic diet?

Bulletproof coffee is coffee with grass-fed butter, MCT oil / coconut oil, and cream blended into it. It’s consumed in the morning as a meal replacement. It’s a good thing, and can be a great first step to start out with because the fat in the coffee will allow you to go a longer period of time before feeling hungry again.

You should know that bulletproof coffee will trigger insulin a little bit. For most this will not raise blood sugars, but will raise ketones. The added fat can cause your weight loss to slow because your body will convert this fat into ketones and burn it as fuel instead of using your own fat reserve. Once you have become fat-adapted you may want to remove the butter and MCT oil from your coffee.

One bulletproof coffee hack is coffee, MCT oil, xylitol and 100% cacao powder. Xylitol is 30 on the glycemic index, not zero, so it does influence the blood sugars a little bit, but not in a significant way. The 100% cacao enhances cognitive function, it has cardiovascular protection, it helps your blood sugars, it’s anti-inflammatory and it can improve your mood.

## How To Overcome No Will Power To Start Intermittent Fasting

# How to overcome no will power to start Intermittent Fasting?

Fasting is an exercise for willpower. Willpower is the ability to control your thoughts and actions in order to do what you want. It's the power of self-control. It's your personal power to overcome things like temptations, addictions, and cravings. 

Willpower helps you stick to something, but it's like a muscle that needs to be developed and strengthened. You can do this through intermittent fasting. Intermittent fasting is basically a workout to improve your willpower. 

**Fasting removes barriers that keep people from doing fasting in the first place, such as:**

• Hunger

• Cravings

• Bad habits 

**Tips to help with fasting and enhance your willpower:**

1\. Start doing intermittent fasting (skip breakfast and don't consume snacks) without keto 

2\. Add MCT oil 

3\. Start Healthy Keto

4\. Find keto-friendly replacements for your favorite foods

## What Is The Fasting Mimicking Diet

# What is the fasting mimicking diet?

**FMD, developed by Valter Longo, is a diet where you basically consume 800 calories for five days and then go back to regular eating for the rest of the month. This will be done for 3 months. Problems with the Fasting Mimicking Diet program will also be tackled.**

**Fasting Mimicking Diet (FMD)**

Macros: • 9%

Protein • 44%

Fat • 47% Carbs

**Diet Foods:**

• Vegetables Soup

• Energy Drink

• Energy Bar

• Chip Snack

• Tea

• Supplement

**Problem with Fasting Mimicking Diet (FMD):**

1\. Overpriced

2\. Contains sugar – low-quality foods that stimulate insulin

3\. Low-calorie diet – It is not fasting but it is a fasting-mimicking program.

4\. Very painful - People who are doing this are suffering because they are not going into a gradual adaptation process.

5\. This does not teach healthy lifestyle.

## Whats The Difference Between Dry And Wet Fasting

# What's the difference between dry and wet fasting?

**What is dry fasting?** Dry fasting is fasting (not eating) without any water or liquids of any kind.

**What is water fasting?** Water fasting is when you’re fasting, but you’re drinking water.

**There are also two types of dry fasting:**

**Soft dry fasting:** This is when you’re allowed to use water when you brush your teeth or take a shower.

**Hard dry fasting:** This is when you do not expose any part of your body to water at all.

The body can typically only go around three days without water. But, your body will go a lot longer if you’re just restricting food and not water because you still have a fat reserve to live off of.

There is no research or studies comparing dry fasting and wet fasting side by side. But, that doesn’t necessarily mean that it’s a bad thing or that you won’t get amazing results. In theory, dry fasting may work well for some people for one day. If you wanted to try dry fasting, I wouldn’t go longer than one day. Then, you can compare a day of doing a dry fast and a day of doing a wet fast and see what works best for you.

## Does Fasting Help With Adhd

# Does fasting help with ADHD?

Some fascinating research shows that intermittent fasting and prolonged fasting may significantly affect the brain's frontal lobe and create significant improvements in cognition. 

**Fasting may potentially help improve cognitive functions, including:**

• Focus 

• Memory 

• Concentration

• Clarity 

• Creativity 

**The study relates to improving the front part of the brain, which is involved with:**

• Paying attention

• Making decisions

• Organizing 

• Planning 

Experts will say that ADHD is a chemical imbalance, that it's genetics, or that the brain is somehow rewired for these symptoms. But, these theories have never been proven. There are medications, but they have side effects that may even potentially create the same symptoms they're supposed to get rid of. 

Basically, with fasting, you stop feeding the brain glucose. As a survival mechanism, the body switches over to making a preferred source of fuel called ketones.  Certain parts of the brain need glucose, but the body can make the glucose it needs from non-carbohydrate sources like fat and protein. You don't need to consume glucose to feed the brain glucose. 

When you fast, you give the brain ketones. Ketones can do many incredible things, including potentially improving cognitive functions. 

**If you have any problems with focus, concentration, or clarity, you may want to try fasting as well as a few other things, including:**

• Vitamin B1 (nutritional yeast) 

• Zinc 

• Omega-3 fatty acids

## Can Intermittent Fasting Reverse A Poor Age Related Memory Loss

# Can intermittent fasting reverse a poor age-related memory loss?

**Age-related memory loss is not normal.** You can improve memory loss, and if it’s not too far gone, you may even be able to reverse poor memory. The key to getting memory, focus, and concentration back is to understand the basic problem and the different factors that relate to it. 

Certain areas in the brain make insulin. These areas are also the same areas that are involved with memory problems that are related to diseases like Alzheimer’s. 

**Areas of the brain that make insulin:**

• Hippocampus – memory, and learning 

• Prefrontal Cortex — short term memory, planning, decision making, goals, differentiating good and bad, trivial vs. important, consequences, selective attention 

• Olfactory Bulb – Sense of smell

If there’s too much insulin, the body protects itself by developing insulin resistance around the blood-brain barrier. After that, the body may start to develop amyloid plaques. Amyloid plaque is a type of protein that sticks together, making the protein unusable and difficult to leave the body. 

**Fasting is one of the most powerful things you can do to avoid amyloid plaques. Starting at 16 hours of fasting, the body starts the process of autophagy (the body starts eating up damaged and misfolded proteins that turn into amyloid plaque).**  

**Action steps for those with Alzheimer’s disease or memory loss signs:**

• Get on healthy keto

• Start fasting

• Take MCT oil

• Take exogenous ketones

## What Is The Most Effective Way To Lose Weight

# What is the most effective way to lose weight?

## **A Better Strategy for Weight Loss**

Strategy is a higher level thing you do to get an advantage over things. Belly fat is not a weight problem; it is a high cortisol problem.

Diets don’t help with this. ***Diets don’t lower cortisol; they lower calories*** so they create stress and belly fat is held there for survival mechanism**.**

> One of the ***purposes of  the body is holding fat in your belly which protects you against*** ***starvation***. 

What’s starvation? That’s a diet.

Every time you deprive yourself of food and you lower your calories too much, it won’t help the cortisol. The other thing you need to ***be careful with is  to do too much exercise.*** You may want to do long walks instead. Exercise is a type of stress that can aggravate the belly.

---

## **What to do?**

Cortisol is a hormone from the adrenal that is jacked up way too high. It is an overactive gland.

We have to realize that the gland is triggered by all stresses. The biggest stressor are other people. Avoid stressful people. They will aggravate the adrenals. 

> ***Try to minimize the amount of exposure*** *you have to stressful personalities.*

If you are in a relationship or have an aggravating boss, I know it’s difficult so you have to counteract by doing things that are anti-stress like sleeping longer.

If you have sleep problems, you can use acupressure or my "***Adrenal Fatigue Formula".*** There are no side effects.

Acupressure will literally ***pull stress out of your body and help you sleep***. You can have it done right here in my office or do it yourself.

## Is Ketogenic Diet Safe For Thyroid

# Is Ketogenic diet safe for thyroid?

**What is the thyroid?** The thyroid is in the base of the neck, and it’s controlled by the pituitary. The thyroid makes T4, but T4 is inactive. T4 has to be converted to the active form, which is T3. 80% of the conversion happens through the liver, and 20 % happens through the kidney.

**How does keto affect thyroid function?** When you go on a ketogenic diet, T4 will decrease up to 40%.

But let’s look at the big picture. There are no studies out there that show any negative effects on the thyroid when you go on a keto or low-carb diet. Also, despite the 40% drop, there is no drop in metabolism. T3 is becoming more sensitive and more effective.  I believe that high carb diets increase the need for more thyroid hormone, so T3 is higher. With a keto diet, T3 goes down, but I think that’s not actually abnormal. I believe that number is normal for what our bodies are designed to use. 

**So, is keto safe for thyroid function?** Yes. When you’re on the ketogenic diet, you’re actually improving the efficiency of the thyroid.

## What Is The Main Cause Of High Blood Glucose Levels When I Am In Ketosis

# What is the main cause of high blood glucose levels when I am in ketosis?

When you do a healthy ketogenic plan and intermittent fasting, you are lowering insulin levels. Insulin suppresses blood sugars but insulin resistance ma still be an issue your body is dealing with. Lower amounts of insulin and insulin resistance cause the blood sugar to spike a little bit higher while you are still in ketosis. In addition, high blood sugar on keto can be caused by excessive protein, too many carbs, frequent meals, or high stress levels.

## What Is Autonomic Neuropathy

# What is autonomic neuropathy?

Neuropathy means nerve damage. With autonomic, we’re dealing with a part of the nervous system called the autonomic nervous system, which controls things automatically. It works on its own. 

The #1 cause of autonomic neuropathy is diabetes. But, you don’t end up with diabetes overnight. It’s a gradual condition that starts with high insulin, which leads to insulin resistance, then prediabetes, and finally, diabetes. Autonomic neuropathy is also a condition that gradually occurs. You could have one or more symptoms, which are really the beginning of this condition. 

**Symptoms of autonomic neuropathy:**

1\. Urinary retention 

2\. Hypertension

3\. Abdominal pain 

4\. Malabsorption 

5\. Gastroparesis 

6\. Constipation

7\. Sleep apnea 

8\. Abnormal sweating 

9\. Orthostatic hypotension (POTS) 

10\. Arrhythmias 

**What you could do about autonomic neuropathy:**

1\. Benfotiamine 

2\. Alpha-lipoic acid  + Keto and intermittent fasting

## What Is The Most Effective Remedy To Reverse Wrinkles

# What is the most effective remedy to reverse wrinkles?

In this video, we’re going to talk about how to reverse wrinkles. GAG (glycosaminoglycan) helps hydrate and repair the skin and collagen, and helps make collagen. The hormone that controls GAG is IGF-1 (insulin-like growth factor 1). IGF-1 is triggered by growth hormone, which is the anti-aging hormone. There are a few things you can do to actually trigger this hormone naturally. 

How to reverse wrinkles:

1\. Lower insulin (do healthy keto and intermittent fasting) 

2\. Enhance your sleep and lower cortisol 

3\. Do HIIT (high-intensity interval training) 

4\. Consume a moderate amount of quality protein (3-6 oz. with each meal) 

5\. Enhance the liver (avoid alcohol, eat organic, consume a lot of vegetables, take supplements to support the liver) 

6\. Do Intermittent fasting (IGF-1 is stimulated when you’re not eating) 

7\. Take fat-soluble vitamins (vitamin A, vitamin D, and vitamin K2)

## What Is A Recommended Fat Intake On A Keto Diet

# What is a recommended fat intake on a Keto diet?

When you first start keto and intermittent fasting, you’re going to need more fat. As you progress, you’ll need to consume less fat because your body is eating its own fat. The best way to judge how much fat you need is to base it on your hunger.

Eat enough fat to keep you comfortable and full between meals but not so much that you feel stuffed. On average, you’d consume:

**140 grams per day if you’re consuming three meals; 113 grams per day if two meals;**

**86 grams per day if you’re eating one meal per day.**

The meal plans on drberg.com, under Recipes, already have these keto macro amounts built into them.

## What Is The Leading Ingredient Other Than Sugar That Contributes To We 25Cba8

# What is the leading ingredient, other than sugar, that contributes to weight gain?

## Hidden in Plain Sight: The Flavor Enhancer That Could Be Sabotaging Your Health

It's lurking in your favorite snacks, convenience foods, and even restaurant meals – a seemingly innocent ingredient that could be contributing to weight gain and a host of health issues.

**Monosodium Glutamate (MSG): A Wolf in Sheep's Clothing**

Despite being classified as "generally recognized as safe" (GRAS) by the FDA, MSG, a common flavor enhancer, has a dark side. Studies have linked MSG consumption in mice to:

- **Obesity**

- **Diabetes**

- **Metabolic disorders**

- **Fatty liver disease**

**How Does MSG Impact the Body?**

- **Disrupts appetite regulation:** MSG overstimulates the hypothalamus, the brain region responsible for controlling hunger and satiety, leading to overeating.

- **Hinders energy utilization:** MSG can interfere with the body's ability to burn calories effectively.

- **Affects fertility:** Research suggests that MSG may have negative impacts on reproductive health.

The average person consumes a staggering 590 mg to 2330 mg of MSG daily, with some individuals ingesting up to 5000 mg! And when combined with carbohydrates, MSG's effects are amplified.

**Beyond Weight Gain: The Hidden Dangers of MSG**

MSG isn't just a concern for your waistline. It has also been linked to:

- **Headaches**

- **Allergy-like symptoms**

- **Irritability**

- **Sleep disturbances**

- **Dizziness**

**Unmasking Hidden MSG**

Food manufacturers are allowed to hide MSG under different names or omit it from the ingredient list altogether if it's present in small amounts. This makes it difficult to avoid.

**Foods That Often Contain MSG:**

- Instant noodles

- Chips

- Flavored popcorn

- Canned soups

- Bouillon cubes

- Processed meats

- Fast food

- Seasonings

- Salad dressings

- Frozen dinners

- Gravy

- Appetizers

- Flavored crackers

- Canned vegetables

**Protecting Your Health:**

Become a savvy label reader and be mindful of the processed foods you consume. Choose whole, unprocessed foods whenever possible to minimize your MSG intake and safeguard your health.
