## How To Get Rid Of Sebaceous Filaments

# How to get rid of sebaceous filaments?

Many people mistake sebaceous filaments for blackheads and try to remove them by using tweezers or other methods. However, this can damage the skin. The presence of sebaceous filaments and blackheads is often linked to the overproduction of sebum. This production is regulated by a hormone called androgens, which can increase during puberty, pregnancy, or other hormonal imbalances. So, how do we address the root cause of sebaceous filaments? One way is to regulate and balance our androgen levels through dietary changes. Consuming foods high in vitamin A, D, and omega-3 fatty acids while reducing the intake of seed oils found in processed foods can help decrease sebum production. Another way to reduce and balance androgen levels is through intermittent fasting and the keto diet, which helps lower insulin levels. High levels of insulin can also contribute to the overproduction of sebum. Additionally, zinc deficiency has been linked to raised sebum production. Consuming zinc-rich foods such as shellfish and red meat can help address this deficiency. Managing stress levels is also essential, as chronic stress can deplete our zinc levels.

## How To Tighten And Flatten Stomach Just In A Few Days

# How to tighten and flatten stomach just in a few days?

A caloric deficit is not a sustainable way to lose weight or get a flat stomach! Most people find that their metabolism slows down in their 20s and 30s after a series of calorie-restrictive diets. Lowering calories increases hunger and cravings, which will require immense willpower and can stifle weight loss. The caloric deficit model is not sustainable!

Insulin is the hormone that controls whether you burn or store fat. If you reduce insulin, you can tap into your body fat for energy. Carbohydrates have the most significant effect on insulin, while fat is neutral and protein has a moderate impact. All calories are not the same! To lose weight, you must lower insulin, which means you must reduce your carb intake. If you’re on a low-carb diet, your body can use both food and body fat for fuel. This eliminates hunger and cravings between meals. Fat provides more than double the energy of glucose.

It takes 2 to 3 days to get into ketosis and 2 to 3 weeks for fat adaptation. Fat adaptation means your body is burning the most fat possible. Your body can burn ketones and fat, which are two different fuel sources. To get your body into ketosis, carbohydrates should make up about 5% of your diet, protein 20%, and fat 75%. Visceral fat in the abdomen may prevent a flat belly, but you can eliminate it with this diet. The dead bug exercise stimulates the fascia and muscles that can act as a girdle, giving you a flat belly fast! Do this exercise every day, and within 1 to 2 weeks, you will start to see amazing results!

## How To Get Rid Of Mucus Fast

# How to get rid of mucus fast?

NAC works similarly to salt by thinning mucus, but it also stops its production. It’s a potent anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, antibacterial, and antiviral agent that can even break up biofilms. NAC also strengthens the cilia in the respiratory system, which helps to move mucus.

NAC can be taken orally, injected, or inhaled through a nebulizer. It can be beneficial for respiratory congestion related to an infection or for diseases like COPD or cystic fibrosis. NAC is also used in hospitals as an antidote for Tylenol poisoning. NAC helps enhance brain function and may be beneficial for people with Alzheimer’s, Parkinson's, OCD, addictions, depression, and schizophrenia. NAC can improve insulin sensitivity, which helps regulate blood sugar and prevent a fatty liver. It promotes healthy blood pressure and cholesterol, and can even help with asthma.

You can reduce respiratory mucus with salt if you’re dealing with an acute infection, but NAC can eliminate mucus and the inflammation behind it. Vitamin C, curcumin, probiotics, magnesium, quercetin, and vitamin D can all improve the effectiveness of NAC.

## How Can I Regenerate My Stem Cells

# How can I regenerate my stem cells?

Here's how to keep your stem cell population at the highest level.

1\. Fasting

Prolonged fasting can boost stem cells naturally. If you can fast for 72 hours, you can boost stem cell production primarily for the gastrointestinal tract, brain, and immune system.

2\. Exercise

Intense exercise is the best way to boost stem cells for your muscles and brain. Exercise also stimulates BDNF (brain-derived neurotrophic factor), which allows you to make new nerve and brain cells.

3\. Deep sleep

Sleep increases melatonin, which stimulates stem cell regeneration in your brain. Sleep also increases immune and cardiovascular stem cells.

4\. Green tea

Green tea contains the phytonutrient EGCG, which has potent anti-inflammatory properties and can increase stem cells for your brain and liver.

5\. Omega-3 fatty acids

Decreasing inflammation can boost stem cell production. Omega-3 fatty acids are anti-inflammatory and can increase stem cells for your bones, cartilage, brain, and skin.

6\. Vitamin D Vitamin

D and the sun help maintain blood stem cells that are involved with the immune system. Vitamin D increases new immune cells, prevents the exhaustion of stem cells, and can even increase longevity.

7\. Cold therapy

The cold stimulates brown fat stem cells, which support muscle repair and the mitochondria, decrease inflammation, and increase blood flow.

## How Can I Unclog My Colon

# How can I unclog my colon?

Digestion starts in the mouth, where food is broken down and then transferred to the stomach. The highly acidic stomach acid aids in protein digestion. The valve at the top of the stomach plays a vital role in keeping food in the stomach and preventing it from backing up into the esophagus. Many people think antacids are the solution to acid reflux or heartburn. Diluting stomach acid worsens this problem by inhibiting this valve from closing tightly.

If you have acid reflux, you want to increase the acidity of your stomach. Diluted apple cider vinegar and betaine hydrochloride are effective remedies for this problem. Ninety percent of all digestion occurs in the small intestine. This is also the location of a leaky gut. Grains, gluten, junk food, refined sugar, and seed oils can cause a leaky gut. The liver makes bile, which is stored and concentrated in the gallbladder. Bile helps break down fats, extract nutrients from fats, and kill pathogens. Bile deficiency symptoms include bloating, burping, vision problems, and gallstones. Bile salts such as TUDCA can help digestion by breaking down cholesterol.

Microbes break down food in the large intestine through fermentation. These microbes comprise 80% of your immune system and help make neurotransmitters like serotonin and dopamine. After your food travels through this intricate assembly line, it becomes stool. Your stool is mostly water and gets its pigment from your red blood cells. The smell is caused by gas from bacteria. Constipation and diarrhea are usually related to missing microbes. Antibiotics and chemicals like glyphosate can deplete microbes. Fermented foods and the L. reuteri microbe are great ways to increase microbes and improve digestion naturally. Intermittent fasting can also significantly improve digestion.

## How To End Dry Cough Fast

# How to end dry cough fast?

Most dry cough remedies involve medication that suppresses the cough. However, suppressing the cough is not always best because coughing is one of the body’s vital defense mechanisms. A cough can result from a post-nasal drip caused by an allergy, cold, virus, or fungal infection. It can also be a side effect of certain medications or be related to GERD or asthma.

Many children have asthma because their mothers did not get enough vitamin D during pregnancy. Vitamin D is essential for lung formation. If a cough is caused by croup, vitamin D is also an excellent home remedy. Some coughs are caused by low humidity. In this case, try a humidifier.

Laryngospasms can also cause a dry cough. These spasms are often caused by low calcium in the blood. A deficiency in vitamin D3 can cause low blood calcium. Take 20,000 IU of vitamin D3 daily if you’re dealing with a cough related to laryngospasms. Always take magnesium and vitamin K2 with vitamin D3. Chronic dry cough can also be caused by perfumes, smoke, new furniture, or tic disorders.

NAC (n-acetyl-cysteine) is a potent antioxidant and anti-inflammatory that breaks up mucus in the lungs. To use NAC for a cough, dissolve ¼ teaspoon of NAC powder into 4 ounces of water. Once dissolved, add ⅛ teaspoon of magnesium in the form of Epsom salt. Add this liquid to a nebulizer and breathe in for 5 minutes, 1 to 2 times daily.

• Be sure to use food-grade Epsom salt.

• Make sure the NAC and Epsom salt are fully dissolved before nebulizing.

• Use sterile or distilled water to prevent contamination.

• Consult a healthcare professional before nebulizing any homemade solution.

Black seed oil and white horehound are also good home remedies for a cough if taken with vitamin D3, K2, magnesium, and zinc.

## How To Stop Frequent Night Time Urination

# How to stop frequent night time urination?

Frequent urination is often blamed on an enlarged prostate, UTIs, or kidney stones, but there’s a much more common root cause.

The most common cause of frequent urination at night is too much insulin in your blood. Insulin resistance is a condition where your insulin receptors no longer accept insulin. To compensate, the pancreas produces more insulin. This is why many diabetics have a problem with urinary frequency at night.

When blood sugar is high, the kidneys remove the sugar from the blood to eliminate it from the body. This increases urination frequency. Insulin resistance causes an overactive bladder, even if your blood sugar is normal. Increased urinary frequency at night is an early sign of insulin resistance, which is a precursor to diabetes. Insulin resistance increases stress on the kidneys, which is why diabetes is the leading cause of kidney disease. Insulin resistance can also cause electrolyte imbalances, blood pressure changes at night, and increased cortisol.

Snacking at night is the single most significant cause of frequent urination at night. Eliminate all snacks and beverages after dinner to decrease urination frequency at night. Snacking at night can also cause bloating and interrupted sleep.

A low-salt diet can also increase urination frequency at night. If you think your nocturia is due to low salt, add more sea salt to your meals throughout the day.

A low-carb diet can help reduce nocturia symptoms. Keep your carb consumption under 30 grams per day. Healthy Keto® can combat insulin resistance, improve your health, and reduce frequent urination at night.

Intermittent fasting is equally important in reversing insulin resistance. Aim for 3 meals with no snacks, eventually dropping down to 2 meals each day. Ending nocturia will significantly enhance your sleep, which is vital for your heart, blood sugar, stress levels, energy, cognitive function, and more. Don’t forget to get plenty of vitamin D with magnesium.

## Pfas Or Per  And Polyfluoroalkyl Substances

# PFAS, or per- and Polyfluoroalkyl Substances

PFAS, or per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances, are a group of man-made chemicals that have earned the nickname "forever chemicals" due to their extreme persistence in the environment and our bodies. They've been linked to a range of serious health issues, including:  

- **Cancer**

- **Hormone disruption**

- **Liver damage**

- **Reproductive problems**

**Where are PFAS found?**

These chemicals are surprisingly pervasive, found in:

- **Everyday products:** Teflon cookware, food packaging, canned goods, stain-resistant fabrics, firefighting foam

- **Our environment:** Drinking water, soil, air

- **Our bodies:** Fat cells, breast milk

**How to Minimize Your Exposure and Support Detoxification**

While it's impossible to completely avoid PFAS, you can take steps to limit your exposure and support your body's natural detoxification processes:

**1\. Reduce your exposure:**

- **Filter your drinking water:** Invest in a high-quality water filter certified to remove PFAS, such as those from Travel Berkey, Clearly Filtered, or Zero Water.

- **Choose PFAS-free products:** Opt for cookware, food packaging, and other products that are PFAS-free.

- **Minimize processed foods:** Processed foods often contain higher levels of PFAS.

**2\. Support your body's detoxification:**

- **Boost your glutathione levels:** This crucial antioxidant helps neutralize toxins.

    - Consume foods rich in sulfur: Eggs, garlic, onions, cruciferous vegetables (cabbage, broccoli, Brussels sprouts).

    - Increase your intake of glutamine: Found in red meat, glycine, and probiotics.

- **Enhance elimination:**

    - **Sweat regularly:** Through exercise or sauna use.

    - **Support autophagy:** Intermittent fasting can help promote this cellular cleaning process.

    - **Consider infrared light therapy:** May aid in detoxification.

    - **Consume spirulina and chlorella:** These algae are known for their detoxifying properties.

**3\. Support your overall health:**

- **Eat a nutrient-rich diet:** Focus on whole, unprocessed foods, including plenty of fruits, vegetables, and lean protein.

- **Ensure adequate intake of trace minerals:** Selenium, iodine, and copper, found in seafood and grass-fed red meat, support detoxification pathways.

While a completely toxin-free environment may be unattainable, taking proactive steps to minimize your exposure and support your body's natural defenses can help reduce the health risks associated with PFAS.

## How To Reshape Your Face

# How to Reshape Your Face

**High Cortisol and Moon Face: Understanding the Connection**

One of the most noticeable signs of Cushing's syndrome, a condition caused by elevated cortisol levels, is a "moon face." This facial fullness is due to fat redistribution triggered by chronically high cortisol. The medication Prednisone can also cause a similar effect.

**Cortisol's Impact on Your Body**

Cortisol not only shifts fat to your face and midsection, creating a hump on your back and red cheeks, but it also weakens your muscles and thins your legs. Internally, it can raise your cholesterol and lipids, disrupt your sodium and potassium balance, elevate your blood pressure, and compromise your immune system.

**The Insulin Connection**

High cortisol indirectly contributes to facial puffiness by converting protein into glucose. This elevates insulin levels, promoting fat storage and making fat loss more difficult. Factors like carb intake, frequent eating, certain oils, nutrient deficiencies, stress, overexercising, and medications can also trigger insulin.

**5 Strategies for a Leaner Face**

1. **Reduce Meal Frequency:** Implement intermittent fasting and avoid snacking to encourage your body to burn stored fat for energy.

2. **Dietary Changes:** Cut down on carbohydrates, especially sugar and starch. Refer to my card cutout for a list of ingredients to avoid.

3. **Boost Protein Intake:** Include high-quality, grass-fed meat like beef, lamb, or goat in your diet.

4. **Manage Stress:** Engage in activities that promote relaxation and well-being, such as walking, exercise, and physical work. Reduce time spent on your phone.

5. **Prioritize Sleep:** Ensure you're getting adequate sleep. If possible, even try to go back to sleep if you wake up early.

## What Strategies Improve Probiotic Survival In The Stomach And Boost Th 03Ea5B

# What strategies improve probiotic survival in the stomach and boost their effectiveness in digestion?

Probiotics are microbes. Microbes are a crucial part of our world. They convert carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, and sulfur into forms that living things can use. We have ten times more microbes living on and inside our bodies than we have cells.

Strong hydrochloric acid in the stomach can kill a good portion of microbes. Bile salts also affect the microbiome. But, some microbes are resilient and can even live without oxygen.

How to support the survival of probiotics in the stomach:

1\. Take a probiotic supplement or consume probiotic foods at the end of your meal

2\. Consume probiotics earlier in the day

3\. If fasting, drink more water with your probiotics

4\. Don’t take probiotics with lemon water or apple cider vinegar water

5\. Consume raw plants grown in soil

## What Are The Five Main Causes Of Bloating And What Strategies Can Quic 8489Dd

# What are the five main causes of bloating, and what strategies can quickly alleviate it?

Bloating can be a frustrating and uncomfortable experience. It can be caused by various factors, making it difficult to pinpoint the exact trigger. This post explores different causes of bloating, from dietary changes to issues within your digestive system, and provides insights on how to identify and manage them.

**Understanding Bloating Causes**

- **Recent Dietary Changes:** Consider if bloating coincided with new foods or dietary habits, such as incorporating keto snacks, salads, cruciferous vegetables, dairy products, or sugar alcohols.

- **Stomach Issues:** Inadequate stomach acid or an overly alkaline pH can cause indigestion, acid reflux, and bloating. Consider Betaine Hydrochloride supplements or apple cider vinegar to support stomach acid production.

- **Gallbladder Problems:** A sluggish gallbladder or inadequate bile production can disrupt fat digestion and cause bloating. Gentle massage under the right ribcage and bile salt supplements might help. Consult a healthcare provider for diagnosis and treatment.

- **Pancreatic Insufficiency:** Insufficient pancreatic enzymes can lead to diarrhea, floating stools, and bloating. Reduce carbohydrate intake and consider enzyme supplements.

- **Small Intestinal Bacterial Overgrowth (SIBO):** This condition can cause fermentation in the small intestine, leading to bloating, gas, and stomach pain. A temporary carnivore diet, antibacterial herbs, and fasting might help.

- **Large Intestine Imbalance:** Bloating can result from fermentation in the large intestine. Consuming probiotic-rich foods and increasing vegetable intake can promote microbial diversity and ease discomfort.

- **Stress:** High stress levels can trigger cortisol release, leading to inflammation and bloating. Stress management techniques like spending time outdoors and relaxation exercises can be beneficial.

**Other Bloating Triggers**

- **Overeating**

- **Eating too quickly**

- **Carbonated beverages**

- **Food intolerances (lactose, gluten)**

- **High-fiber foods**

- **Artificial sweeteners**

- **Iron-fortified cereals**

**Key Takeaway**

Understanding the potential causes of bloating and making informed dietary and lifestyle changes can lead to significant relief. Remember, consult a healthcare professional for any health concerns or before making any decisions related to your health or treatment.

## Do Keto And Fasting Increase Stress Hormones

# Do Keto and fasting Increase stress hormones?

Do keto and fasting increase stress hormones? The answer is no.

Some people believe that it appears to be stressful on the body because you're starving the body of glucose. However, a person has fat on their body to be used as fuel. Logically, our bodies are meant to run off of fat between meals.

Cortisol is a stress hormone. It is also called glucocorticoid. One of the major functions of cortisol is to keep your blood sugars from getting too low. It releases stored glucose or causes the production of glucose to maintain blood sugar levels. This isn't a stress event; it's a normal thing that occurs in the body.

It takes about three days for the body to adapt from burning glucose to burning fat. Cortisol can rise a little bit when a person goes through the three-day keto-adaptation phase, but then it levels out.

When you run your body on glucose, it is very stressful for the body, and you can't tap into your own fat. However, when you get into ketosis, you could go from a stress state to a much higher level of calmness and a state of well-being. Burning fat or being in ketosis is a non-stressful state. Keep in mind, that when you start keto and fasting, it's important to take electrolytes and B vitamins.

## Can A 16 Hour Fast Start Autophagy

# Can a 16-Hour fast start autophagy?

Yes, inducing autophagy may be possible with a 16-hour fast, especially for those following a low-carb ketogenic diet. 

Depleting blood sugar and glycogen stores is key for activating autophagy, which explains why consuming a low-carb diet can help promote autophagy.

---

## How Long Does It Take To Start Autophagy

# How long does it take to start autophagy?

There’s no proven timeframe for when autophagy starts in humans, as it depends on the individual's metabolism, activity levels, and nutritional status.

However, animal studies suggest that advanced autophagy occurs around 24 hours of fasting and increases with prolonged caloric restriction.

## What Are The Early Stages Of Potassium Deficiency

# What are the early stages of potassium deficiency?

In its early stages, a potassium deficiency, also known as mild hypokalemia, often manifests as subtle but noticeable changes in how you feel:

- [Muscle Cramps](https://www.drberg.com/blog/taking-electrolytes-yet-still-cramping): One of the initial and noticeable potassium deficiency symptoms is muscle cramping. Muscles rely on the proper balance of electrolytes, particularly potassium, to function smoothly. When blood potassium levels drop, your muscles may start to spasm or feel tight. If you've ever experienced a sudden, painful charley horse in your calf, you've felt a mild form of muscle cramping. These cramps can occur in various muscle groups, including your legs, arms, or even your abdomen.

- [Fatigue](https://www.drberg.com/blog/fatigued-on-keto-and-when-fasting): Potassium is crucial in energy production. It helps convert the food you eat into usable energy your cells can utilize. Low potassium disrupts this energy conversion process, often leaving you feeling drained and lethargic. This lack of energy might manifest as difficulty concentrating or simply feeling less motivated throughout the day.

- [Constipation](https://www.drberg.com/blog/constipation-is-not-just-a-lack-of-fiber): Ever notice how dehydration can back you up? Well, low potassium can have a similar effect on your digestive system. Potassium is involved in muscle contractions that help move food through your digestive tract. Low potassium levels can slow things down, leading to discomfort, bloating, and those dreaded irregular bowel movements we know as constipation.

## What Does A 24 Hour Fast Do

# What does a 24-Hour fast do?

Not consuming calories for 24 hours forces your metabolism to utilize stored body fat as a primary fuel source.  

Once the liver depletes all the glucose and starts burning fat, ketone levels rise and provide your cells and tissues with energy—this metabolic state is known as ketosis.

## How Can I Speed Up Muscle Growth

# How can I speed up muscle growth?

**Skeletal muscle is crucial for movement, posture, and metabolism. Building muscle requires a combination of high-intensity exercise and adequate protein intake. Aim for 0.8 to 1.5 grams of high-quality protein per kilogram of lean body mass (athletes may need up to 2 grams). To further optimize muscle growth, consider the following strategies:**

- **Creatine Supplementation:** Creatine boosts energy during intense exercise. Load with 20 grams for five days, then maintain with 3 grams daily in a cyclical pattern.

- **Cold Therapy:** Cold showers, immersion, or cryotherapy stimulate fat burning and muscle development by increasing muscle gene expression and reducing inflammation.

- **Intermittent Fasting:** Fasting boosts growth hormone for muscle growth and improves insulin sensitivity, aiding muscle recovery. Aim for two calorie-dense meals daily without snacking.

- **Arginine:** This amino acid promotes growth hormone production. Take 3-6 grams daily on an empty stomach, 30 minutes before workouts.

**Important Note:** Always consult a healthcare professional before starting any new supplement or dietary regimen.

## The Adaptation Period Of Periodic Fasting

# The Adaptation Period of Periodic Fasting

Starting a periodic fasting regimen involves a significant metabolic shift as the body transitions from using glucose to burning fat for fuel. This adaptation process, known as ketosis, typically takes between three to seven days.

**Understanding the Shift to Fat Burning**

Initially, fasting depletes glycogen stores in the liver and muscles. Once these reserves are low, usually within 24-48 hours, the body begins lipolysis, breaking down fat into fatty acids. The liver then converts these fatty acids into ketones, providing an alternative energy source for the brain and organs.

**Navigating Early Side Effects**

During this transition, you may experience temporary side effects, including fatigue, irritability, brain fog, and symptoms akin to the "keto flu." Hypoglycemia, characterized by shakiness, dizziness, and lightheadedness, is also common as insulin levels drop and glucose intake ceases.

These symptoms generally subside within the first week as the body adapts to fat metabolism. Staying hydrated, getting adequate rest, and monitoring your body's responses can help alleviate discomfort during this adaptation phase.

---

## The Transition To Ketosis During Fasting

# The Transition to Ketosis During Fasting

During fasting, glycogen stores are depleted, prompting the body to produce ketones from stored fat. This process, known as ketosis, allows the brain and other organs to use ketones as an alternative fuel source when glucose is scarce.

**Glycogen Depletion and Ketone Production**

Within the first 12 to 24 hours of fasting, glycogen stores are exhausted, leading to lipolysis, where fat is broken down into free fatty acids and glycerol. The liver then converts these fatty acids into ketones through ketogenesis, typically starting around 12 to 24 hours into the fast.

As fasting continues, glucose and insulin levels decrease, prompting the body to use fat for energy. By 12 to 72 hours, approximately 40% of fat is utilized for ketone production. Prolonged fasting promotes adaptation to ketosis, enhancing the body's efficiency in using ketones and fat for energy.

## The Brains Unique Nutritional Needs

# The Brain's Unique Nutritional Needs

## **The Brain's Unique Nutritional Needs**

Our brains are fascinating, complex organs. Despite making up just 2% of our body weight, they use a whopping 20% of the energy we consume. But that's not all; the brain has other unique characteristics.

### **The Brain's High Energy Consumption**

A high-performance engine needs top-quality fuel to run efficiently; your brain is no different. It consumes about one-fifth of your daily calorie intake. That's quite impressive, given its tiny size compared to the rest of your body.

This high demand for energy underscores how important it is to feed your mind with nutrient-rich foods. Doing so, you help ensure optimal performance and health for this critical organ.

### **Brain Regeneration and Size**

Contrary to popular belief, intelligence is not determined by the size of one's brain. No correlation exists between intellect and brain size. What matters more is the complexity within our grey matter.

Fascinatingly, certain parts of our brains can regenerate, too – something once thought impossible in neuroscience. While not all areas have this capability, some regions, like the hippocampus, show promising signs of regrowth under specific conditions.

## **Harmful Foods for Brain Health**

Despite weighing only 2% of your body mass, the brain is an enormous energy consumer, devouring up to 20% of your daily caloric intake. It gobbles up to 20% of your daily calorie intake. However, not all foods are beneficial for this vital organ.

### **The Impact of Omega-6 Fatty Acids**

[Omega-6 fatty acids](https://www.drberg.com/blog/omega-6-fats-and-inflammation) can be tricky. They're essential fats our bodies need but can't produce - so we must get them from food. Excess consumption of omega-6 fatty acids relative to [omega-3s](https://www.drberg.com/blog/omega-3-fatty-acids-reduce-insulin-resistance) can lead to inflammation in the brain.

Foods like vegetable oils (think soybean or corn oil) and certain nuts and seeds are high in omega-6s.

When these foods dominate our diet without adequate counterbalance from omega-rich fish or flaxseeds, it's like inviting a rowdy party-goer into your home who starts throwing furniture around—that's what inflammation does to your delicate brain cells.

### **Sugar and Refined Carbohydrates' Role in Insulin Resistance**

Next on the 'bad guys' list are sugar and refined carbohydrates—these culprits aren't just waistline expanders but also dangerous for the mind.

[Research shows](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5133120) that diets high in sugar lead to [insulin resistance](https://www.drberg.com/blog/insulin-resistance-and-gluconeogenesis) over time—a condition where cells stop responding effectively to insulin signals. The result? Your neurons starve as they struggle with glucose uptake, impacting cognitive function negatively.

Frequent consumption of sodas, candy bars, pastries—even seemingly healthy foods like some breakfast cereals—can be akin to signing a 'do not disturb' sign for your brain cells. The takeaway? Be mindful of what you feed your body—it directly impacts your mind's health and function.

## Can Alcohol Induced Gastrointestinal Damage Be Corrected With Keto And If

# Can alcohol-induced gastrointestinal damage be corrected with keto and IF?

To a large degree it can. But I think you're going to need some additional things to help correct it. If you do the healthy version of keto and you include more probiotics, and get a nice diversified group of microbes living in your intestine testes that can actually help fortify and help build up the mucus layer that's needed in the GI tract. That mucus layer is really what's missing with so many people and their health problems. And that mucus layer is generated by eating healthy and having enough microbes and making sure they're doing their job. When you lose the mucus layer, you lose your immune system because then you have less of a buffer for these pathogens to invade. And then you start getting autoimmune diseases and inflammatory diseases. That mucus layer is going to be really key to maintain your health and you can have a good start by doing the healthy keto.

## How To Break A Prolonged Fast  Refeeding

# How to Break a Prolonged Fast & Refeeding

**Understanding Refeeding Syndrome After Prolonged Fasting**

Prolonged fasting (4-7+ days) carries the risk of refeeding syndrome, a rare but potentially serious condition. This occurs when your body rapidly shifts nutrients from the bloodstream into cells, especially if you were already nutrient deficient before the fast.

**Why It Happens:** Pre-existing nutrient deficiencies worsen during a fast. When you suddenly reintroduce food, your body can experience dangerous imbalances. People with known vitamin deficiencies should avoid prolonged fasting.

**Prevention is Key:** During a prolonged fast, it's crucial to supplement with vitamins, electrolytes, and sea salt. This helps maintain balance and won't break your fast.

**Breaking Your Fast Safely:** Ease back into eating slowly with keto-friendly foods. Avoid carbohydrates, sugars, and non-keto foods, as they can worsen nutrient depletion. Start with small portions and gradually increase as your body adjusts.

**Important:** If you have any underlying health conditions, always consult your doctor before starting a prolonged fast.

## The Biggest Research Study Scam

# The Biggest Research Study Scam

**Understanding Research Manipulation and the Importance of Critical Evaluation**

Dr. Westman, an M.D. and Master's-level statistician, highlights how data in research studies can be manipulated to present misleading information. He emphasizes the crucial distinction between absolute risk and relative risk and how this difference can be exploited.

**The Limitations of Observational Studies**

Dr. Westman points out that observational studies often cannot prove causation. He cites examples like recent headlines demonizing red meat and fasting, which frequently stem from self-reported observational studies with unreliable dietary recall data.

While observational studies cannot establish definitive cause-and-effect relationships, they serve a purpose as "hypothesis-generating studies," providing a potential starting point for more rigorous experimental research.

**Case Study: The Stanford Twin Experiment**

Dr. Westman discusses the Stanford twin experiment, a study with flaws and funding from a plant-based interest group, as a recent example of potentially misleading research.

**Nutritional Epidemiology and its Weaknesses**

Harvard University's School of Public Health conducts research based on observational studies linking dietary elements to health outcomes. Dr. Westman cautions that nutritional epidemiology often only reveals weak associations and shouldn't be treated as definitive fact.

**Dr. Westman's Approach**

Dr. Westman's clinic uses a low-carb keto diet to successfully treat numerous chronic health conditions, including diabetes, obesity, heartburn, and IBS. He focuses on both treating and educating patients, offering online courses on health topics through his Adapt Your Life Academy.

**Disclaimer: It's important to critically evaluate all health-related information and consult with qualified medical professionals when making decisions about your health.**

## Which Vitamin Is Most Effective For Promoting Healthy Skin And How Doe A8E9C4

# Which vitamin is most effective for promoting healthy skin, and how does it contribute to skin health and appearance?

**If you are deficient in vitamin B3, you can end up with pellagra. However, there’s also a subclinical version of this B3 deficiency. This is a situation where you have dermatitis—dry, brittle, scaly, and red skin.**

**Vitamin B3 helps protect and restore your DNA, which results in your skin feeling and looking vibrant and healthy.**

Studies show that those with pellagra see amazing results when taking vitamin B3. Those with pellagra often consume too much corn, flour, rice, and alcohol. To fix this problem, people started adding synthetic vitamin B3 to enhance these foods. The problem is, synthetic vitamins don’t have the same effects as natural ones.

**A healthy keto diet and intermittent fasting eliminate this problem. You should know that the best form of vitamin B3 is niacinamide.**

**Vitamin B3 can also help with:**

• Brown spots

• Skin cancer

• Anti-aging

• Decreased acne

## What Are The Most Effective Methods For Detoxifying The Kidneys From E Ad65Ea

# What are the most effective methods for detoxifying the kidneys from elevated levels of uric acid and oxalates, while also preventing their accumulation?

The kidneys can take a beating and can even regenerate. They are composed of roughly one million tiny filters, which filter your blood. But as you age, you start losing these filters—so it becomes even more important to start eating better and decrease exposure to toxins. The two worst things for your kidneys are sugar and oxalates. It’s crucial to stop consuming sugar and high-carb foods and to start limiting your exposure to high-oxalate foods.

However, consuming cheese or dairy with foods that are high in oxalates, but are otherwise healthy, can help counter kidney damage from oxalates.

The best ways to protect your kidneys:

1\. Consume lemon water every morning

2\. Consume apple cider vinegar mixed in water

3\. Consume 2.5 liters of water a day

4\. Avoid high-oxalate foods or add dairy to high-oxalate foods

5\. Get on the Healthy Keto® diet and do intermittent fasting

6\. Avoid fructose

7\. Avoid consuming high levels of vitamin C

8\. Consume potassium (not for end-stage kidney disease)

9\. Consume plant foods and microgreens

## What Strategies Can I Employ To Enhance The Diversity Of My Gut Microb 21350D

# What strategies can I employ to enhance the diversity of my gut microbiome, including dietary adjustments, lifestyle changes, and probiotic or prebiotic supplementation?

Ideally, you want a rich microbiome with a lot of different species. Without this diversity, you’ll provide the perfect space for harmful bacteria to thrive.

This lack of diversity is called dysbiosis, and it’s associated with many different serious health conditions.

**How to increase the diversity of microbes in your gut and boost your health:**

1\. Consume food that has been grown on soil that has a diverse microbiome

2\. Increase the diversity of plant foods in your diet

3\. Exercise

4\. Get plenty of quality sleep

## What Are The Important Factors In Building Muscle Mass Beyond Protein

# What are the important factors in building muscle mass beyond protein?

We often think that increasing protein helps build muscle because muscle is made of protein. But this doesn’t always work. Some people that eat more protein may even suffer from amino acid deficiency. You need sufficient amounts of protein to build muscle, but, more importantly, you need sufficient amino acids.

The general thought is that you need .8 grams of protein per kilogram of lean body mass—not overall weight. This might look like around 50 grams of protein per day. A moderate amount of protein would be between 1.2 and 1.7 grams per kilogram of lean body mass. High protein would be about 2 grams per kilogram of lean body mass.

**It’s essential to focus on consuming quality protein from eggs, meat, fish, and dairy. It’s not ideal to rely on getting your protein from plant sources or protein powder to build healthy muscles.**

**Factors that influence the production of muscle protein:**

**1\. Insulin resistance**

What to do:

• Get on a low-carb diet (Healthy Keto®)

• Do intermittent fasting

**2\. Growth hormone**

What to do:

• Intense exercise

• Get plenty of sleep

• Do intermittent fasting

**3\. Testosterone**

What to do:

• Consume zinc (red meat, shellfish, seafood)

• Avoid refined carbs and sugar

• Lower your stress

• Avoid soy protein isolates, soy milk, beer, and alcohol

**4\. Stress**

What to do:

• Take a look at my other videos on how to lower stress

**5\. The microbiome**

What to do:

• Consume probiotic foods

**6\. Low stomach acid**

What to do:

• Take betaine hydrochloride

**7\. Low enzymes in the pancreas or small intestine**

What to do:

• Consume enzyme-rich foods

• Take an amino acid supplement

**8\. Lean protein**

What to do:

• Consume fattier protein sources

## Is It Ok To Take Testosterone

# Is it ok to take testosterone?

When considering testosterone supplementation, it's crucial to understand potential side effects, including worsened sleep apnea, mood swings, acne, and increased cardiovascular risk. Other effects may include reduced fertility, blood thickening, testicular atrophy, and erectile dysfunction.

Before starting testosterone supplements, identifying the underlying causes of low testosterone is essential. Factors such as aging, insulin resistance, low zinc or protein intake, a low-fat diet, statin use, high soy consumption, and deficiencies in vitamins A or D should be addressed.

Boosting testosterone naturally involves strategies like weight training, increasing zinc and vitamin D intake, prioritizing healthy fats over carbohydrates, using DHEA supplements, improving REM sleep, managing weight through a ketogenic diet and intermittent fasting, and ensuring adequate protein intake. These methods support natural hormone production and overall health without the potential risks associated with exogenous testosterone.

## What Are Effective Methods For Eliminating Blackheads And Sebaceous Filaments

# What are effective methods for eliminating blackheads and sebaceous filaments?

We will also explore the root causes and how to address these issues to achieve long-term results.

**Many people mistake sebaceous filaments for blackheads and try to remove them by using tweezers or other methods. However, this can damage the skin.**

**The presence of sebaceous filaments and blackheads is often linked to the overproduction of sebum. This production is regulated by a hormone called androgens, which can increase during puberty, pregnancy, or other hormonal imbalances.**

So, how do we address the root cause of sebaceous filaments? **One way is to regulate and balance our androgen levels through dietary changes. Consuming foods high in vitamin A, D, and omega-3 fatty acids while reducing the intake of seed oils found in processed foods can help decrease sebum production.**

**Another way to reduce and balance androgen levels is through intermittent fasting and the keto diet, which helps lower insulin levels. High levels of insulin can also contribute to the overproduction of sebum.**

Additionally, zinc deficiency has been linked to raised sebum production. Consuming zinc-rich foods such as shellfish and red meat can help address this deficiency. Managing stress levels is also essential, as chronic stress can deplete our zinc levels.

## Does Brain Need To Adapt To Ketosis Too

# Does brain need to adapt to ketosis too?

**The brain has the capacity to run on ketones immediately. It even prefers ketones as its fuel source.** 

• 1/3 of the brain will always run on glucose, but 2/3 of the brain runs on ketones. 

• 23% of all the energy that is generated is used by the brain. 

**Sources of ketones:**

1\. Endogenous ketones – Meaning the body can make them if you lower your carbohydrates.

2\. Exogenous ketones – Meaning ketones outside of the body like ketone salts and MCT oil. 

Your blood ketone level is what determines how many ketones are in the brain—this level should be high. Your blood ketone level is determined by your insulin and glucose levels. Your insulin levels should be on the low side of the normal range, and your glucose levels need to be low. 

The more ketones you have in the blood, the better and faster the brain will be able to use them. The brain does not need time to keto adapt. Still, you can assist this process and prevent brain fog or keto fatigue by taking ketones or MCT oil. 

Another situation where it would be a good idea to start taking exogenous ketones is if you need to improve brain function or improve memory. For example, in cases where you have memory problems or even Alzheimer’s. 

**Parts of the brain that use ketones:**

1\. Cerebral Cortex 

2\. Hypothalamus 

3\. Pituitary Gland 

4\. Pineal Gland

## Why Do I Have High Blood Glucose Levels On Keto

# Why do I have high blood glucose levels on Keto?

First, let’s quickly go over insulin resistance. **If a person is insulin resistant, they typically have very high insulin in their body—around 5 to 9x the normal amount.**

Insulin regulates blood sugars by lowering them and keeping them down. Over time, this mechanism weakens and your insulin levels drop. This leads to high blood sugar, prediabetes, and eventually diabetes.

**If you have high blood glucose on keto, you probably had high insulin before you started the keto diet. Once you begin a ketogenic diet and intermittent fasting, your body is no longer spiking insulin. Without high insulin, there is nothing keeping your blood sugars down.**

The good news is that high blood glucose on keto is temporary as your body transitions into ketosis. Your blood sugar will eventually stabilize.

## Can Too Much Protein Make You Fat

# Can too much protein make you fat?

**The hormone insulin has several functions. It converts what you eat to fat, and it prevents the release of fat from your body. Excessive amounts of protein will trigger insulin. But many people eat large amounts of protein without getting fat. Here’s why: protein triggers another hormone called glucagon, which is produced by alpha cells in your pancreas. Insulin is also produced in your pancreas, but by beta cells.**

**Glucagon helps you burn fat. If you eat a lot of protein, you trigger both of these hormones.** **You may not gain weight, but you might not lose it either because insulin prevents the fat-burning effect. It depends on what else you’re eating with the protein. If you’re eating carbohydrates, you’ll gain weight.** It also depends on how often you’re consuming protein. If you’re doing intermittent fasting, eating just one meal a day, you may still lose weight. But if you’re eating three meals per day with too much protein, you’ll have a hard time losing weight.

Carbohydrates trigger insulin, which is why overall it’s carbs instead of protein that causes weight gain. The big problem with eating too much protein over time is that you’ll overload your stomach, because you need a certain amount of hydrochloric acid to break down the protein. You may get putrefaction, body odor, or feel tired after eating. You could also overload your kidneys and liver because of too much nitrogen byproduct in your body, leading to a build-up of uric acid and even gout. How to check if you’re eating too much protein: you feel tired after you eat. Your urine is foamy. You may even get constipation. These are some points to consider if you wonder whether you’re eating too much protein.

**I typically recommend three to six ounces of protein per meal, but some people need more depending on their fitness level, metabolism, and ability to digest protein. Be sure to check to see if you’re eating too much protein, which can be detrimental to your health.**

## Keto Is Beneficial For Athletic Performance

# Keto is Beneficial for Athletic Performance

In 2012 there was a study, which I linked to below this video, that keto doesn’t affect the strength performance in elite gymnasts. A 2018 study, also linked below, shows that keto reduces oxidative stress and inflammation in deep sea divers. When you run your body on ketones, you get less oxidative stress, meaning that your organs and tissues don’t break down as easily.

Yet another study of cyclists showed that keto didn’t compromise their endurance. Two of the top ultramarathon runners are both on keto. One of them, Zach Bitter, took the US record for a 100 mile event. It’s not carbs that build muscle, it’s protein. Strength training also builds muscle. While it’s true that insulin is anabolic, which helps your muscles grow, Two things stimulate insulin; one is carbs, the other is protein.

When you do the keto diet, you go low carb. When you go low carb, and combine it with intermittent fasting, you fix something called insulin resistance. Most of the population has this. Your cells need evermore insulin to offset the effect of eating too many carbs. When you fix insulin resistance, you increase the absorption of amino acids. Your body uses insulin more effectively. When you do a healthy keto plan, your body runs on ketones, fatty acids, and part of it still uses a little bit of glucose. Even though you’re not consuming glucose, your body has the ability to make its own in the liver, a process called gluconeogenesis.

When you start keto, you go through keto adaptation. You may experience fatigue. Increase your B vitamins and minerals. This is a temporary phase. Once you tap into your fat reserves, your performance will improve. You’ll have more endurance. Some athletes become fat burning machines. The truth is, when you eat high carb, you’ll feel more fatigued and your performance will suffer. You’ll have higher insulin along with blood sugar issues and more oxidative stress. Now you can see why the keto diet is actually beneficial for athletic performance.

## What Exercises Do You Recommend For Love Handles

# What exercises do you recommend for love handles?

Love handles result from fat accumulation in the liver that spills off in and around the organs in your mid-section.

The primary cause of love handles is a diet that’s high in sugar and refined carbs. Sugar and refined carbs cause high insulin, which causes stored fat. But, stress and a lack of sleep also cause high insulin and lead to love handle.

To get rid of love handles, you need to get on a Healthy Keto diet, do intermittent fasting, lower your stress, improve your sleep, and start exercising. The exercises I’m going to share with you are intense and will focus on your core to get rid of love handles.

**Exercises to get rid of love handles fast:**

1\. Side planks

2\. Bicycle crunches

3\. Russian twists

4\. Mountain climbers

5\. Woodchoppers

6\. Bulgarian bag

## What Approaches Can Be Utilized To Enhance The Levels Of Glutathione I E80864

# What approaches can be utilized to enhance the levels of glutathione in the body?

Glutathione is the most abundant antioxidant in the liver, but all of the cells make it. It reduces oxidative stress. Glutathione can help neutralize toxins that your body actually makes for various things. Glutathione also helps maintain exogenous antioxidants like vitamin C, and vitamin E. It not only acts as an antioxidant, but it also helps in detoxification. Because glutathione is sulfur, when you eat certain foods high in sulfur, you will give your body the raw material it needs to make more glutathione.

**How to boost glutathione naturally:**

• Sulfur-based vegetables (cruciferous vegetables)

• Vitamin C

• Selenium

• Milk thistle

• Fasting

**What decreases glutathione?**

• Alcohol

• Stress

• Age

• Drugs

• Toxins

## What Steps Can I Take If Im So Exhausted That I Struggle To Fall Asleep

# What steps can I take if I’m so exhausted that I struggle to fall asleep?

While some people have too much energy to fall asleep, others are actually too tired to fall asleep. It takes a healthy amount of energy in your energy factories, your mitochondria, to sleep well. The organs that have the most mitochondria are your heart and brain. This means that both of these organs need a lot of oxygen to function properly. Thankfully, there are several things you can do to increase oxygen into the mitochondria in the brain to help you fall asleep fast and have a good night’s sleep. There is also, essentially, a clock in your brain that tells you when to sleep and when to wake up—we need to get this clock to work better.

**How to sleep better at night:**

• Exercise

• Consume vitamin B1 before bed

• Sleep with the window open

• Put plants in your room

• Consume CoQ10

• Take methylene blue

• Use dim lights after sunset

• Replace certain lights in your house with incandescent lights

• Avoid blue light before bed

• Use red lights

• Use the light from a fireplace if possible

• Use blue blockers

• Don’t consume any food 5 hours before bed

• Take vitamin D3 while traveling

• Go to bed before midnight (around 10 pm works for many people)

## What Are The Most Common Keto Mistakes That Slow Your Progress Down

# What are the most common Keto mistakes that slow your progress down?

Common mistakes on keto and how to address them:

1\. **Excessive Fat Consumption:** Focus on reducing carbs rather than adding more fat. Only increase fat intake if you're new to keto and need support during fasting.

2\. **Snacking:** Avoid keto snacks and stick to regular meals to minimize insulin spikes.

3\. **Hidden Carbs:** Check food labels for hidden carbs like maltodextrin. Avoid fruits, berries, and agave nectar.

4\. **Inadequate Protein Intake:** Ensure you're consuming enough quality protein to signal satiety to the brain and prevent deficiencies. Consider amino acid supplements if needed during fasting.

## When Is The Optimal Time To Take Probiotics To Maximize Their Effectiveness

# When is the optimal time to take probiotics to maximize their effectiveness?

Probiotics are microbes. Microbes are a crucial part of our world. They convert carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, and sulfur into forms that living things can use. We have ten times more microbes living on and inside our bodies than we have cells.

**Microbes have many functions and help us in various ways, including:**

• Helping to make nutrients available

• Providing immune protection

• Protecting against pathogens

• Supporting detoxification

• Improving digestion

• Helping to make vitamins

Strong hydrochloric acid in the stomach can kill a good portion of microbes. Bile salts also affect the microbiome. But, some microbes are resilient and can even live without oxygen.

**How to support the survival of probiotics in the stomach:**

1\. Take a probiotic supplement or consume probiotic foods at the end of your meal

2\. Consume probiotics earlier in the day

3\. If fasting, drink more water with your probiotics

4\. Don’t take probiotics with lemon water or apple cider vinegar water

5\. Consume raw plants grown in soil

## What Strategies Or Substances Can Effectively Enhance Insulin Sensitivity

# What strategies or substances can effectively enhance insulin sensitivity?

To understand insulin sensitivity, you need to understand insulin resistance. Insulin resistance is a situation where the receptor for insulin in your cells is blocking insulin. It’s not allowing insulin to go into the cells. You don’t have the function that insulin should have normally. Because of this, the body starts putting out more insulin. 

Insulin is very important to help regulate the blood sugars and to help with the absorption of nutrients. But, the more insulin resistance you have, the more insulin you’re going to have, and the more problems you’re going to have. For example, in the presence of insulin, you can’t lose weight. 

We want to improve insulin resistance by making insulin more sensitive.

**Help improve insulin sensitivity naturally by doing these things:**

1\. Resistance training 

2\. Fasting 

3\. Decrease inflammation 

4\. Reduce glucose (do healthy keto)

5\. Increase sleep

6\. Decrease stress (cortisol)

7\. Consume more vegetables (fiber)

**A few additional things to help increase insulin sensitivity:**

• Apple cider vinegar

• Cinnamon

• Omega 3 

• Vitamin D

## How To Get Faster Weight Loss Despite Having Hypothyroidism

# How to get faster weight loss despite having hypothyroidism?

It’s a complex subject because there are different kinds of hypothyroidism such as Hashimoto’s and non-Hashimotos. Sometimes you can’t figure out what’s important and what’s trivial information. In this video, I focus on the most important things you need to know to achieve weight loss with a hypothyroid condition.

Your thyroid is located at the bottom of your neck. It produces a hormone called T4 which is an inactive thyroid hormone. T4 converts to T3 which is the active thyroid hormone. T3 goes into your cells and speeds up your metabolism as well as weight loss. 80 percent of conversion happens through your liver, 20 percent happens through your kidneys.

So many people with hypothyroid conditions have a fatty liver. If you have belly fat chances are you have a fatty liver, which decreases the capacity to convert T4 to T3. Your focus is to get the fat off your liver and improve its function. But it could also be a function of your gallbladder, or perhaps cirrhosis of your liver.

You’d think cutting fat from your diet would make the fat on your liver go away but that’s not what you want to do. You do need to cut carbs which is why I recommend keto and intermittent fasting.

As well, here are some things to speed up the process: Choline is one of the most powerful nutrients to strip fat from your liver very quickly. Get high quality choline and start taking it. It dissolves fat. Egg yolks have the highest amount of choline in a food. If you have a choline deficiency you could potentially get a fatty liver.

Selenium is also involved in the conversion of T4 to T3. It’s an antioxidant and is especially important if you have Hashimoto’s. Also, do more strict intermittent fasting to decrease inflammation and boost your immune system.

Iodine is part of the raw material to build thyroid hormones. I recommend consuming sea kelp as a source of iodine. Next is zinc which will help with almost every single side effect of being hypothyroid such as hair loss, fatigue, and constipation. It’s in oysters, meat, and pumpkin seeds, but I recommend taking a supplement. These are the steps you can take to get faster weight loss even with hypothyroidism.

## Is It Advisable To Follow A Ketogenic Diet With Hypoglycemia

# Is it advisable to follow a ketogenic diet with hypoglycemia?

Low blood sugar comes from high blood sugar and the spike of insulin pushing it down – hypoglycemia is high insulin.

**Don’t we need sugar to balance it?**

• The actual cause of hypoglycemia is high insulin so adding more sugar to balance, it raises more insulin. Insulin resistance is also caused by too much insulin. When you have insulin resistance, the body is making 7x the amount of insulin that you need compared to a normal person.

**How to keep insulin normal?**

• Keep sugars low.

• Don’t do frequent meals.

• Consume Magnesium + Potassium + Vitamin B1 (nutritional yeast)

## Why Isnt The Ketogenic Diet Working For My Hypoglycemia

# Why isn't the ketogenic diet working for my hypoglycemia?

Someone was having an issue with keto where they said that keto didn’t work because even though they did keto and felt better after doing it for a month, they went back on their diet, and their hypoglycemia came back.

What causes hypoglycemia (low blood sugars) is something you ate that’s triggering insulin, and the insulin is pushing your blood sugars down. When you have hypoglycemia, you may think you need to consume sugar because your sugar is low. But, the problem with this is that you’re just going to activate insulin again, which will bring the blood sugar back down. I don’t believe you can correct hypoglycemia by consuming more carbs.

When someone starts the keto diet, they also really need to commit to it for longer than one month. If a person has hypoglycemia, they have very severe insulin resistance. It could take several years before this person could get into a stabilized position, and if the person was to go back to carbs, the situation would just come back. The keto and intermittent fasting plan is designed to be a lifestyle change.

## What Are The Fats That Can Help With Fatty Liver

# What are the fats that can help with fatty liver?

Many people are afraid of fat. They think that if they consume any fat, it will give them a fatty liver. But, I believe that carbohydrates are really the big cause behind a fatty liver.

Here are three fats you could start to consume in larger amounts to potentially help fix a fatty liver:

**1\. Olive oil (organic extra virgin)**

• Anti-inflammatory 

• Omega-9 fatty acid 

• Supports a fatty liver 

**2\. Fish oil or cod liver oil (wild-caught)**

• Rich in omega-3 fatty acid 

• Can help inhibit fat from accumulating on the liver 

• Can help reduce the fat in the liver

• Anti-inflammatory 

• Supports the retinas, heart, and brain 

**3\. Virgin coconut oil** 

• Can help reverse a fatty liver in rat studies 

**Other things you could do to help reduce fat on the liver:**

1\. Purified bile salts 

2\. Choline 

3\. Cutting carbs and sugar (especially fructose) 4. Fasting

## What Are The Initial Signs And Symptoms That May Indicate The Onset Of 021107

# What are the initial signs and symptoms that may indicate the onset of dementia, and how can they manifest in daily life?

**They can be:**

1\. A loss of spatial navigation (like forgetting where you parked your car)

2\. Difficulty finding the right words

3\. Confusion

4\. Repeating yourself

The first thing you want to do if you are experiencing dementia symptoms is to start feeding your brain ketones. This will help bypass the degraded glucose absorption mechanism that is starving your brain of fuel and begin to feed the neurons directly.

**There are three ways you can increase your ketones:**

1\. Lower your carbs

2\. Do intermittent fasting

3\. Supply your body with healthy fats, like MCT oil and fatty fish

## I Am Struggling To Commit To Keto And Intermittent Fasting 100. What D F13Ded

# I am struggling to commit to keto and intermittent fasting 100%. What do you suggest?

Starting gradually is key when transitioning to a ketogenic diet and intermittent fasting, especially if you're accustomed to frequent meals and a high-carb diet. Incorporating MCT oil can help reduce cravings and support longer fasting periods, but introduce it gradually to avoid digestive issues. As your body adapts to fat burning, the process becomes easier, leading to uplifted mood, reduced cravings, and increased energy. Ensure you consume enough nutrients by incorporating plenty of vegetables and nutritional yeast into your diet. Keep progressing towards your goal with consistency and patience.

## What Are The Potential Causes Of Frequent Vomiting

# What are the potential causes of frequent vomiting?

Nausea is discomfort and uneasiness that makes you want to throw up or vomit. Usually it’s a one-time event linked to something that doesn’t settle right in the stomach. Most of the time, vomiting is harmless, but if it’s recurring, it can be a sign of a more serious illness.

**Cause #1: Gallbladder problems / bile duct**

The gallbladder is a very important organ for your body as it stores bile. Bile is very important for our digestion and breakdown of fats. If you take something that your digestive system is not used to, this can overload your gallbladder ducts and cause confusion in your stomach. As a result you can feel nauseous.

**Remedies:**

- Take ginger (in a tea or supplement)

- Take peppermint (in a tea or supplement)

- Take cayenne pepper (in a supplement)

- Take chamomile tea

- Take meadowsweet tea

To avoid feeling nauseous in the future, do the following:

- Ask yourself: when did the nausea start?

- Ask yourself: what did you eat before that?

- Avoid that food if it’s unhealthy

- If it’s a healthy food, decrease it

**Other causes:**

- Motion sickness

- Food poisoning

- Chemotherapy

- Low blood sugar

- Medications/drugs

- Kidney stones

- Pregnancy

## Is It Possible To Remedy The Liver Cirrhosis Caused By High Insulin

# Is it possible to remedy the liver cirrhosis caused by high insulin?

If you have high insulin in your body this can cause inflammation and a fatty liver. Inflammation can cause damage to your liver and your body will attempt to heal it, creating scar tissue in your liver. This will result in cirrhosis. Insulin goes too high mainly due to consuming a lot of refined carbs and sugar and due to frequent eating over a long period of time.

**Remedies:**

- Avoid refined carbs and sugar

- Avoid snacking

- Do the Healthy Keto® diet

- Do an intermittent fasting plan

- Do periodic prolonged fasting

- Consume more potassium

**\*We recommend consulting with your doctor before making any dietary changes or before you start taking any new supplements, especially if you have any existing health conditions.**

## I Cant Quit Carbs. What Should I Do

# I can’t quit carbs. What should I do?

Carbohydrates are highly addictive. We are conditioned as children to feed a carb addiction – most children consume large amounts of sugar daily. Sugars and refined grains are added to baby food, cereal, candy and virtually all processed foods.

Carbs are so addictive because they trigger two hormones: dopamine and serotonin. These are pleasure and happiness hormones.

Over time, an addiction to carbs becomes stronger and stronger. So what can you do to break a carb addiction? Take a look.

- Stop eating immediately – The first thing you should do is start fasting. This will kick-start ketosis, which is when your body burns fat as fuel instead of glucose (sugar). This will begin to heal your neurotransmitter receptors that are triggering intense carb cravings.

- Exercise – This will further increase your fat-burning and allow you to get rid of any excess glucose in your system.

- Avoid triggers – Get rid of all carbohydrates and sugars in the house, avoid images of food (like commercials or unhealthy recipe books), don’t go to restaurants with unhealthy foods, avoid food smells that cause cravings, etc.

- Take B vitamins – All B vitamins are important for lessening the addiction to carbs– especially vitamin B1. Using nutritional yeast is a great way to get your B vitamins.

## What Are The Potential Consequences Of Straying From The Ketogenic Diet

# What are the potential consequences of straying from the ketogenic diet?

When you have a cheat meal and you eat carbs, you spike insulin which then reacts to store glucose. You end up with a low blood sugar situation. This is when hunger sets in, the cravings start, and other negative effects like anxiety happen.

Cheating on keto can kick you out of fat burning for 1 to 3 days.

Of course, when you eat carbs you will feel better, but not for very long. Soon after the carbs, you’re left wanting more and more. By eating carbs you’re also depleting a lot of essential nutrients.

How to recover from a cheat day on keto:

- Drink apple cider vinegar with water

- Start fasting

- Exercise

- Take potassium and sodium

- Consume B vitamins

## How Long Does It Take To See Results On Keto

# How long does it take to see results on keto?

It really depends. When someone begins to do keto and intermittent fasting, they typically lose a lot of water weight in the first week, maybe even 8 pounds.

But then, in the second week, they are hardly losing weight at all: maybe 2 pounds. Well, the maximum amount of fat you can lose per week with a healthy metabolism is only 2 pounds. One half to 2 pounds is actually very good.

Your metabolism is living and dynamic, and it adapts to the foods you eat. When you’re not consistent with keto and intermittent fasting, this can slow down the weight loss and can potentially cause problems.

## Will Bulletproof Coffee Block My Autophagy

# Will bulletproof coffee block my autophagy?

If you make bulletproof coffee with small amounts of additives, like 1 tablespoon of mct oil, 1 tablespoon of butter, this should be fine. It may inhibit the autophagy for a little bit, but it will kick back in shortly after.

Now, if you do half-and-half it may cause more difficulty due to some content of carbs and protein.

Autophagy is a state when you are in fasting mode and the body starts repairing and recycling its damaged proteins and microbes; in that state the need for vitamins and nutrients goes way down.

## How Can I Adjust To Incorporating More Fat Into My Diet While On Keto

# How can I adjust to incorporating more fat into my diet while on keto?

You may have started eating too much fat or added more too suddenly – more than your digestive system is used to. Cut back a little bit, and gradually increase it. Gallbladder or liver problems could cause difficulties with digesting fat as well.

Taking purified bile salts, choline, or lipase can help with fat digestion.

## What Are The Most Reliable Predictors Of A Heart Attack

# What are the most reliable predictors of a heart attack?

Calcium and cholesterol act as band-aids to help repair the artery. But this is late on the chain of events after inflammation and after high insulin. High insulin starts this chain of events in place with the eventual hardening of your arteries, high blood pressure, and plaquing.

The coronary artery feeds the heart muscle blood and if this muscle does not get its oxygen, then it cramps and you get a heart attack. A simple test (CAC) costing under $100 and taking 2 seconds, can give you valuable feedback on your past lifestyle and score things for you. Reducing insulin with healthy ketosis and intermittent fasting is the first action to start with since high insulin triggered this problem in the first place.

**\*The above information is not intended for diagnosis. If you have any health concerns you should consult your physician.**

## I Have No Appetite On Intermittent Fasting   What Do I Do

# I have no appetite on Intermittent fasting - what do I do?

As soon as people start doing intermittent fasting, their appetite goes away, they feel better, they have less inflammation, and they have more energy. But, the thing that most people focus on is weight loss. Many think that the more weight they lose, the healthier they are. But weight loss is just one part of getting healthy.

One problem that many people have is they begin to stop doing healthy keto. This is a huge problem, especially when you're doing one meal a day. Why? Because this can cause some serious nutrient deficiencies. Some nutrient deficiencies take a long time to develop. Others happen quickly. Vitamin B12, for instance, can be stored in the body for up to a year. Other nutrients like potassium aren't stored for very long.
If you felt great when you first started intermittent fasting, but down the road, you started to feel worse and worse, this is a sign of a nutrient deficiency.
**
Signs you may have nutritional deficiencies:**

• Tiredness

• Dizziness

• Weakness

• No endurance

• Hair loss

• Brittle nails

• Mood changes

• Cognitive issues

**If you start consuming just one meal a day on your intermittent fasting program, you should increase your intake of:**

• Omega 3 fatty acids (unless you consume salmon and other fatty fish every other day)

• Protein (8-10 oz. athletes may need more)

• Vitamin C/E/B9/D (eat your vegetables!)

• Minerals

• Trace Minerals

## What Can I Do If Im Extremely Hungry On Intermittent Fasting

# What can I do if I'm extremely hungry on Intermittent Fasting?

1\. Go slower and gradually ease into it.

2\. Increase fat in the meal or increase more protein.

3\. Decrease carbs (20-50g/day). If your carbs are too high, you'll never get into ketosis.

4\. Increase your vegetable intake (7-10 cups) to get your potassium and magnesium.

5\. Add apple cider vinegar to your meals.

6\. If you have to snack, consume fat as your snack.

**It takes 4-5 days to start getting into ketosis.**

## Does Keto And Fasting Increase Stress Hormones

# Does Keto and fasting increase stress hormones?

**The answer is no.**

Some people believe that it appears to be stressful on the body because you're starving the body of glucose. But, a person has fat on their body to be used as fuel. I believe it's logical that our bodies are meant to run off of fat between meals.

**Cortisol is a stress hormone. Cortisol is also called glucocorticoid. One of the big functions of cortisol is to keep your blood sugars from getting too low. It will release stored glucose or cause the production of glucose to maintain the blood sugars. This isn't a stress event. It's a normal thing that occurs in the body.**

It takes about three days for the body to start adapting from burning glucose to burning fat. Cortisol can rise a little bit when a person goes through the three-day keto-adaptation phase, but then it levels out.

When you run your body on glucose, it is very stressful for the body, and you can't tap into your own fat. But, when you get into ketosis, you could go from a stress state to a much higher level of calmness and state of well-being. Burning fat or being in ketosis is a non-stressful state. Keep in mind, when you start keto and fasting, it's important to take electrolytes and B vitamins.

## Can A Frail Senior Parent Do Intermittent Fasting

# Can a frail senior parent do Intermittent Fasting?

**CONS**

• If your parent is thin, you don’t want them to lose weight

**PROS**

• Neurogenesis

• Increase Stem Cells

• Extend Life

Do a version of intermittent fasting that doesn’t restrict the calories. Calculate the calories and push them into two meals or less frequently without reducing the calories. Make sure that the fat is high enough to prevent weight loss.

The key is to keep their calorie intake high which also means to keep the fat higher. Add fermented vegetables because it is very important for the elderly to start establishing the flora and getting the pH correct. Vitamin K2 is vital as well because it helps remove calcification as we age. It also improves and strengthens the output of the mitochondria.

**Recommended K2:** 100mg – 10,000IUs of vitamin D (MK7 version)

**Stomach Support:** Betaine Hydrochloride or Apple Cider Vinegar

## Does Fasting Turn Into Starving

# Does fasting turn into starving?

You first need to know that the average non-overweight person is carrying around 100,000 calories of fat on their body. They are only carrying about 1,700 calories of stored sugar.

**If you weighed 150 lbs, you would burn around 1,000-2,000 calories per day. This means that you have around 67 days worth of calories stored on your body. The difference between fasting and starving is that with fasting, you’re living off of your fat fuel. When you’re starving, you’ve already used up all of your fat fuel, and you begin burning your muscle and organs for fuel.**

If you have 100-200 lbs of extra fat, you have many calories stored. The effects of fasting and starving are different. When you’re fasting, you don’t feel hungry—when you’re starving, you do. When you’re starving, you also feel irritable, apathetic, fatigued, and weak. You also develop nutrient deficiencies when you’re starving. Fasting helps you feel energetic, focus, and calm. Intermittent fasting alone will not cause starvation. While you’re fasting, make sure you take nutrients, so you don’t develop a deficiency.

## Can Intermittent Fasting Help Reverse A Fatty Liver

# Can Intermittent Fasting help reverse a fatty liver?

Fasting is one of the most important things you can do if you have a fatty liver.  One way to know if you have a fatty liver is to simply look down at your stomach. If your stomach bulges out, chances are you have a fatty liver. You can also get a biopsy or an ultrasound to be sure.  When the liver becomes filled with fat, it spills off into areas around and inside the organs. This is why people start developing a gut. 

What causes fatty liver?

**• Sugar or refined carbohydrates**

When you consume glucose, your whole body can deal with it. But, when you consume fructose, the liver is stuck dealing with it. Indirectly your insulin will spike, and other problems with occur. The effects of fructose on the liver are very similar to the effects of alcohol on the liver. 

**A few sources of fructose you might not have thought of:**

• High fructose corn syrup 

• Fruit juice 

• Agave 

**The best way to handle a fatty liver is to reverse the flow. You have to fast. You want to work up to about 20 hours of fasting—23 hours would be even better. Don’t eat unless you’re hungry and go for as long as you can.** 

**A few more things to help speed up the process:**

• Take choline (and B vitamins in the form of nutritional yeast)

• Exercise 

• Bile salts

## How Can I Lose Weight With Intermittent Fasting

# How can I lose weight with intermittent fasting?

Intermittent fasting is a pattern of eating and not eating that doesn't dictate specific foods or calorie reduction but instead focuses on when you eat. It's a crucial factor in weight loss, influencing growth hormone stimulation for anti-aging and fat burning while decreasing insulin levels, which is essential for weight loss. Intermittent fasting can also aid in reversing insulin resistance, a condition characterized by excessive insulin production. Starting slowly and gradually extending fasting periods is recommended, progressing from fewer meals to longer fasting windows, such as 16 hours fasting with an 8-hour eating window, then eventually transitioning to two meals a day with a 20-hour fasting period and a 4-hour eating window.

## Will Fasting Slow Down My Metabolism

# Will fasting slow down my metabolism?

If you have been starving your body of nutrients, then it is true that your metabolism will slow down. You must be sure you have nutritional reserves and eat nutrient-dense foods Following a diet like Healthy Keto® will help with this. You do not want to fast for a long period of time (longer than 4-5 days), this can cause muscle loss. Start with intermittent fasting then gradually prolong to where you are comfortable.

## What Will Happen With My Body After A Week Of Fasting

# What will happen with my body after a week of fasting?

If you start cutting carbs, you could start losing a lot of fluid. Initially, a person could easily lose 13 pounds (5.89kg) in one week. This depends on how much water weight you have. 

One pound of fat is 3500 calories. An average person might burn roughly 2000 calories in a day. So, in theory, if everything goes perfectly, a person could lose 0.5-0.7 pounds per day while fasting. This would come out to just under 5 pounds (2.2kg) per week with fasting. 

**But, there are a lot of variables that can affect this, including:** 

• Exercise 

• Stress 

• Sleep 

• Age 

• Metabolism 

• History of consuming a lot of carbs 

• Health issues 

When you start fasting, you can stimulate growth hormone. Growth hormone protects against the loss of protein. Typically, the body doesn’t use protein as fuel. It uses the fat fuel until that’s gone, then it uses muscle. 

Let’s say someone is a bodybuilder, or they have a good amount of muscle on their body, and they’re exercising. But after they start the week fast, they don’t exercise. Potentially, their muscles could shrink because it’s the exercise that keeps the muscles stimulated and growing.  A good indicator to know if you’re fasting correctly is being able to exercise without feeling too weak and tired.

If you’re fasting, but you don’t have any energy, and you can’t do intense exercise, you may need more electrolytes.  It’s also important to make sure you’re taking enough sea salt regardless of whether or not you’re eating. Green powder drinks, B vitamins (nutritional yeast), and trace minerals may also be beneficial while fasting.  Some people think they need to load up on carbs to spike insulin to help their muscles grow. But, insulin comes with a package. And, insulin is also triggered by protein.

So, a better solution may be to have more protein instead of carbs. If you’re trying to lose weight, this isn’t a good idea. But if you’re trying to build muscle, it may be a better option.

## Im Losing Weight So Slowly   What Can I Do About It

# I'm losing weight so slowly - what can I do about it?

There’s a big difference between not losing any weight and losing weight slowly—and the actions you need to take for each will be entirely different. If you’re not experiencing any weight loss, you have to make a big change.

There’s something affecting your weight loss, and it could be related to your thyroid, adrenals, kidneys, and other parts of your body. To figure out what’s behind this issue, you have to dig deeper and do some testing. If you are experiencing some weight loss, you don’t want to make any huge changes. Instead, you want to strengthen your successful weight loss efforts.

Start by looking at the quality and quantity of your foods. Make sure you’re having moderate amounts of protein, plenty of healthy fats (avoid vegetable oils!), and very low amounts of carbohydrates and sugars (only get your carbs from low-carb vegetables). Avoid snacking. You should only eat 1-3 times a day. Intermittent fasting is a fantastic way to support a healthy body and avoid insulin spikes that block weight loss.

Problems with your sleep, digestion, or mensural cycle may also slow down weight loss. Insulin and Glucose Support is a great supplement for promoting weight loss if you have insulin issues.

## Why Is Having A Weight Loss Goal A Bad Idea

# Why is having a weight loss goal a bad idea?

**Your weight loss goal is setting you up for failure. I’ll explain by giving you several concepts, so you may want to take notes.** 

First, the difference between muscle and fat. One pound of fat takes up more space than one pound of muscle. Overweight people have less muscle than fat. A keto and intermittent fasting program will solve your stubborn weight and metabolism issue. When you start the program, you’ll lose fat and increase muscle because you’ll trigger certain muscle-building hormones as you train your body to use fat for fuel. You’ll also lose water weight. When you use up the stored sugar in your body, you’ll release the significant amount of water that’s attached to the glycogen. 

Most people who go on any weight loss program lose water weight for the first one to two weeks. But that weight loss isn’t consistent. Plus, when you start Keto and intermittent fasting you may or may not lose overall weight while you gain muscle. If you only focus on losing fat and not gaining muscle, you end up thinner but flabby and weak. You also may or may not lose inches. Most of the time you will, but you may plateau because you’re gaining muscle. Losing weight isn’t linear. It isn’t consistent when you’re gaining muscle along with losing fat. But this is what you want to develop a strong, healthy body. You don’t want your muscles to atrophy, although many people’s muscles do, especially women going through menopause. 

Plus, the more muscle you have, the better your metabolism. Muscle burns more calories. You want to make sure the calories being burned are from fat, not sugar. Lower your carb intake, and your body will burn fat. Hormonally, the difference between men and women comes down to two different hormones. Men have more testosterone. Women have more estrogen, which creates the fat layer around the female body. This is why men lose weight faster. They’re not dealing with the amount of estrogen that causes their body to create a fat layer. You see why I recommend not making weight loss your main goal. You’ll most likely just get frustrated and discouraged. Instead, have several goals: inches lost, weight loss, health improvement, and a strength goal. Weight loss isn’t the only measure of your success.

## Why My Hypoglycemia Is Back And Im On Keto

# Why my hypoglycemia is back and I'm on Keto?

Someone was having an issue with keto where they said that keto didn’t work because even though they did keto and felt better after doing it for a month, they went back on their diet, and their hypoglycemia came back.

What causes hypoglycemia (low blood sugars) is something you ate that’s triggering insulin, and the insulin is pushing your blood sugars down. When you have hypoglycemia, you may think you need to consume sugar because your sugar is low. But, the problem with this is that you’re just going to activate insulin again, which will bring the blood sugar back down. I don’t believe you can correct hypoglycemia by consuming more carbs.

When someone starts the keto diet, they also really need to commit to it for longer than one month. If a person has hypoglycemia, they have very severe insulin resistance. It could take several years before this person could get into a stabilized position, and if the person was to go back to carbs, the situation would just come back. The keto and intermittent fasting plan is designed to be a lifestyle change.

## Is Intermittent Fasting Good For Someone Who Is A Diabetic

# Is intermittent fasting good for someone who is a diabetic?

Diabetes is a condition of high sugar (hyperglycemia). The purpose of the medication that diabetic takes is to lower blood sugars – sometimes the medication could drive the blood sugar too low that could cause hypoglycemia.

When you do intermittent fasting, you decrease the need for insulin and the medication for a diabetic. The insulin that the diabetic is taking is not the same as the body produces.

**\*We recommend consulting with your doctor before making any dietary changes or before you start taking any new supplements, especially if you have any existing health conditions.**

## How Can I Reduce My Blood Sugar Levels On Keto

# How can I reduce my blood sugar levels on keto?

To improve lower blood sugar on keto, start by reducing your carbohydrate intake and incorporating fasting into your routine. Regular exercise is crucial, and ensure you get adequate sleep while also spending time in the sun to boost your overall well-being. Manage stress effectively, and increase your fiber intake by eating more vegetables. Consider adding apple cider vinegar (ACV) to your diet and ensure you’re getting enough potassium and Vitamin B1 to support your health.

## How Does Fasting Influence The Autonomic Nervous System

# How does fasting influence the Autonomic Nervous System?

The autonomic nervous system is part of the nervous system that works on automatic. It does many different things.

**The three divisions of the autonomic nervous system:**

1\. Sympathetic (fight or flight)

2\. Parasympathetic (rest and digest)

3\. Enteric (part of the digestive system)

There is a condition called diabetic autonomic neuropathy that occurs with diabetics. It’s well known that diabetes can cause peripheral neuropathy. But, diabetes can also destroy the nerves of the autonomic nervous system. This can greatly influence your heart, digestion, and other organs.

**Diabetic autonomic neuropathy can potentially lead to health problems, such as:** • Increased pulse rate • High blood pressure • Erectile dysfunction • Orthostatic hypotension • Constipation • Gastroparesis • Hypoglycemia • Thermoregulation problems

If you have any of the above symptoms, you may want to start fasting. Fasting may help improve your overall autonomic nervous system.

**Natural remedies for diabetic autonomic neuropathy:** • Benfotiamine • Alpha-lipoic acid

## Is It Possible To Get Rid Of Cellulite On Hips Thighs And Buttocks

# Is it possible to get rid of cellulite on hips, thighs and buttocks?

With cellulite, the collagen bands are partially or entirely dissolved.

Overall, cellulite is not a fat disorder—it’s a collagen disorder caused by excess estrogen. Two main things are going on:

1\. Excess estrogen that destroys collagen fibers and elastin.

2\. Excess aromatase that destroys the fibroblasts that make collagen under the skin. 

How to get rid of cellulite:

**1\. Fix the atrophy problem** 

• Do lunges 

• Do squats 

• Start retro walking 

• Try sprinting

**2\. Fix the circulation problem** 

• Do rebound exercises 

• Do red light therapy 

• Use a dry brush on your skin 

• Get a massage on the area regularly 

**3\. Fix the collagen problem**

• Do intermittent and prolonged fasting 

• Use an aromatase inhibitor cream (massage onto the area before bed)

## What Should I Do If Im Experiencing Hunger And Frequent Cravings

# What should I do if I'm experiencing hunger and frequent cravings?

Many people worry about cravings when starting a ketogenic diet, but both keto and intermittent fasting can help eliminate them.

High insulin levels lower blood sugar, leading to cravings. Reducing insulin through a low-carb diet is key, as carbs trigger insulin release. While protein can also spike insulin if consumed excessively, it’s important to keep protein intake moderate. Increasing fat consumption is crucial, as fat does not affect insulin, and including plenty of vegetables is beneficial.

The transition from sugar-burning to fat-burning may come with cravings, often lasting about three days. To speed up this process, use electrolyte powder, B vitamins from nutritional yeast, and apple cider vinegar with meals.

If you still feel hungry despite following a low-carb diet, consider these factors:

\- Not practicing intermittent fasting

\- Consuming hidden carbs

\- Low dietary fat

\- Insufficient adaptation time

\- Eating low-nutrient foods

\- Insulin resistance

\- Low bile production

Addressing these issues can help manage cravings and improve your success on keto.

## What Are The Skin Problems That Are Caused By Diabetes

# What are the skin problems that are caused by diabetes?

High blood glucose affects the skin both directly and indirectly. Insulin, a hormone that helps lower glucose, can also affect the skin. When you have high blood glucose, you’ll typically also have high insulin and insulin resistance, at least in the beginning.

**Skin conditions that can be related to high insulin:**

1\. Acanthosis nigricans

2\. Skin tags

3\. Digital sclerosis

4\. Acne

5\. Baker’s cysts

**Skin conditions that can be related to high blood sugar:**

1\. Petechiae and purpura

2\. Gangrene

3\. Ulcers in the legs or feet

4\. Swollen red eyelids

**The best remedies for skin conditions related to diabetes:**

• Get on the Healthy Keto® diet

## What Strategies Can Be Employed To Effectively Stimulate And Enhance T E5Ff91

# What strategies can be employed to effectively stimulate and enhance the process of autophagy for optimal cellular health and longevity?

Autophagy means “self-eat.” This is the state in which your body begins to recycle damaged proteins and pathogens.

When proteins become damaged, they can wreak havoc on your body. To prevent this harm, your body breaks down damaged proteins with enzymes and creates new healthy proteins.

There are several ways you can promote autophagy naturally:

1\. Fasting - Fasting is a fantastic way to induce autophagy. It’s my opinion that fasting for 16-18 hours is ideal for autophagy—although few studies show an exact length of time for peak autophagy.

2\. Exercise - Exercise is another excellent way to promote autophagy.

3\. Coffee - Drinking coffee may help induce autophagy to some degree. I don’t recommend having much more than one cup of coffee each day. Way too much caffeine will affect your sleep, which can actually reduce autophagy.

4\. Sulforaphane - This compound is a phytochemical that has health-protecting effects, including the ability to induce autophagy. You can get sulforaphane from fresh cruciferous vegetables or cruciferous supplements. You should be consuming plenty of vegetables (7-10 cups) every day.

5\. Green tea (EGCG) - EGCG, or epigallocatechin gallate, is a powerful autophagy-inducing compound found in green tea. Additionally, EGCG is great for reducing inflammation and fighting off cancer cells.

6\. Curcumin - Curcumin is a potent autophagy-promoting compound found in turmeric. Turmeric is often found in Indian foods like curry.

7\. Resveratrol - This compound is primarily found in the skin of black grapes and red wine. Resveratrol has antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and autophagy-promoting properties.

## When Should Magnesium Not Be Taken For Sleep And Anxiety And What Are  29Bb1C

# When should magnesium not be taken for sleep and anxiety, and what are the potential risks or contraindications to consider?

Sometimes, low magnesium is not the cause of your anxiety or sleep problems, and taking it can even worsen your symptoms. The second part of sleep is called REM sleep. People with higher levels of adrenaline and cortisol tend to wake up around 2:00 am during REM sleep. Magnesium will not fix this problem because the high cortisol levels are not caused by low magnesium.

Stress and lack of exercise can cause poor sleep. Exercise, long walks, and physical labor can reduce stress and improve sleep. If you find that you have difficulty getting to sleep because of racing thoughts and overthinking, you may be low in vitamin B1. Carbs, sugar, and caffeine can deplete vitamin B1. Taking B1 before bed can provide an immediate sense of calmness. Always choose a natural B1 supplement, not synthetic.

Instead of taking a melatonin supplement, it can be more beneficial to address why you do not have enough melatonin in the first place. Melatonin is inhibited by blue light. Darkness and infrared light recharge melatonin, so try getting sunlight or sitting by a fire. Vitamin D before bed can help you sleep. Magnesium will not work if you're very low in vitamin D and vice versa.

If you're new to fasting and you go to bed hungry, it can interfere with your sleep. If fasting triggered your sleep problem, scale back, and begin fasting more gradually over time. Try incorporating more carbs at your last meal and increasing your carb intake to 50 grams per day. Having plenty of sea salt on keto and intermittent fasting is vital. Salt causes your body to retain fluid, so not only will it help you sleep, but it can also help prevent waking to use the bathroom. If you do need magnesium, try taking magnesium glycinate to help support sleep and reduce anxiety.

## At What Blood Sugar Levels Does The Risk Of Damage To Bodily Systems Increase

# At what blood sugar levels does the risk of damage to bodily systems increase?

The American Diabetes Association (ADA) recommends an A1C below 7.4, equivalent to a blood sugar level of 166, which is too high. Damage from high blood sugar begins above 100. A study shows that fasting blood glucose between 110 and 125 can destroy 40% of pancreatic beta cells, leading to less insulin and more damage. The ideal A1C is under 5%. To improve your levels, consider reducing refined carbs and sugar, and try intermittent fasting, which may help reverse damage if addressed early.

## How Does Intermittent Fasting Affect The Gut Flora

# How does intermittent fasting affect the gut flora?

Intermittent fasting is one of the best ways to ensure the health of your gut. When you begin fasting regularly, this helps your gut increase resistance to oxidative and xenobiotic stress. It also increases the diversity of microbes in the gut while helping tolerance for bad bacteria. If you struggle with a weak intestinal lining, fasting can help your body repair this as well. Regular fasting also helps reduce *Candida* infections and allows healthy gut microbes to live longer.
