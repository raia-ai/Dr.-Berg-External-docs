## I Ate When I Was Not Hungry While On Keto And Intermittent Fasting Is It Bad

# I ate when I was not hungry while on Keto and Intermittent fasting, is it bad?

Our body is not designed to eat at the frequency that people eat. You have social events, social events, birthdays, vacations, holidays, going out to dinner, etc.

**One of the best habits you can implement is:**

1\. Only eat when you are hungry

2\. Don't eat unless you are hungry.

If you are doing intermittent fasting and not hungry anymore, then do a gradient approach. The main point is keeping your nutrients high, but just eating less frequently. Eating spikes insulin.

## How Do You Know That You Are In Ketosis

# How do you know that you are in ketosis?

The biggest indicator is that you are no longer hungry! If you are on ketosis, you will be able to fast longer between meals without even the need for a snack. You will no longer crave carbs. This is because your body is now burning fat reserves. Additionally, you will feel uplifted and more energetic and your cognitive function will improve.

## Minutes Of The Meeting July 17 2025

# Minutes Of The Meeting July 17, 2025

**Adverse Reaction Log usage reminder**

- Reminder to keep using the **Adverse Reaction Log** for any product-related complaints or reactions.

This data is reviewed by Steve and Maria, and it’s important to complete all required fields in the Excel file.
Even if the report is over 30 days old, a refund may still be processed—just make sure the full procedure from the KB article is followed.

---

**II. Performance Stats Update**

- **Missed calls** will now be counted under **outbound call stats** and no longer reflected as a separate stat in the overall performance numbers.

This avoids double credit and ensures more accurate reporting. A quick audit confirmed that missed calls were already being credited under outbound.

---

**III. Feedback Survey & Call Closings**

- Reminder to be intentional about **adding survey reminders** during call closings.

The company’s goal is to reach 25–30% feedback response rate. Closing spiels should be warm, concise, and encourage customers to respond to the one-question survey sent after the call. See Section VI for examples shared by the team.

---

**IV. System & Process Updates**

**Replacement Processing & Expiration Management**

- When sending replacements, manually edit the **expiration or lot number** in propack before the item is shipped.
    This only applies if the order is still in “Accepted” status. If it’s not, reach out to the warehouse to request that they revert the order to accepted so edits can be made.
    Wait for the replacement to sync with ProPack (about 10 minutes) before making updates.

**Amazon Reshipments**

- Tag **CS Leadership** (Ava, Jane, or Cathy) for Amazon reshipments. Do **not tag Roxanna M.** anymore.

These requests will now be entered manually in NetSuite by the CS team for faster turnaround. The same “Amazon Reshipment” work item can be used, just assign it to one of the current processors moving forward.

---

**V. QA & CS Best Practices Reminders**

**Missing Items (Undamaged Packages)**

- If a customer reports missing items but the package is **not damaged or tampered with**, send an email to PROPACK.
    Include the **order number**, **replacement number** (if already processed), and a list of the **missing items**. This allows PROPACK to issue a refund to the company.

**Order & Refund Calls**

- For phone orders:

- Always verify the customer’s **email address** and **shipping address**.

- Inform the customer of the **expected delivery timeframe** (3–8 business days).

- For refunds:

- Clearly state the **refund timeline** (typically 3–5 business days depending on the bank).

- Let the customer know they can check with their bank or contact us if the refund hasn’t posted by then.

**First Contact Resolution (FCR)**

- Always aim to resolve issues on the **first customer interaction**.

Offer appropriate options (refund/replacement) immediately if the issue is valid. If images are needed, the core resolution should still be provided upfront.
Avoid responses like “we’ll check with the warehouse” unless truly needed, and make sure subscriptions are cancelled during the same call if the refund is related to an unwanted recurring order.

**Account Notes & Documentation**

- When customers use **multiple email addresses**, make sure to **notate both accounts** in CRM.
    This avoids confusion in future tickets or calls and ensures all relevant data is accessible.

**Troubleshooting Resource Links**

- If a customer reaches out about **broken or missing links** from Dr. Berg’s website or YouTube channel, check the content yourself before escalating.
    Many customers get confused when Dr. Berg references a “link below” that may not be there or doesn’t work. Escalate only when necessary and after verifying the issue.

**System Issue Validation**

- Before escalating system concerns (e.g., CRM issues or loading errors), **test across multiple browsers or channels**.
    Confirm the issue internally before submitting a critical ticket or tagging IT.

---

**VI. Sample Call Closings**

Here are some of the common call closing lines shared by the team:

- “Thank you for calling Dr. Berg Nutritionals. You’ll receive a one-question email survey after this call—we’d really appreciate your feedback!”

- “Your order confirmation and tracking details will be emailed to you shortly. And once we hang up, a short survey will be sent to your inbox.”

- “If you could take a moment to complete the survey after this call, it really helps us out. Thank you again for choosing Dr. Berg!”

Friendly touches such as “Have a great day!” or “Enjoy your weekend!” help make the conversation feel warmer and more personal.

## Folic Acid And B12 Deficiency

# Folic Acid and B12 Deficiency

## **The Masking Effect of Folic Acid on B12 Deficiency**

[Folic acid is a synthetic form of folate](https://www.drberg.com/blog/avoid-folic-acid-and-take-folate-as-methyl-folate), a B vitamin that's essential for DNA synthesis and red blood cell production. It's often added to fortified foods like breakfast cereals and breads to help prevent neural tube defects in pregnancy.

But while folic acid fortification has been successful in reducing the incidence of these birth defects, it may also be masking a hidden problem: vitamin B12 deficiency.

![Pills forming B12 shape](https://drberg-dam.imgix.net/others/yellow-pills-forming-shape-b12-alphabet-0.jpg?w=992&auto=compress,format)

### **Fortified Foods and Nutrient Interactions**

The problem with folic acid is that it can correct the megaloblastic anemia caused by B12 deficiency, but it doesn't address the underlying deficiency itself.

This means that someone could have a serious B12 deficiency but not show any obvious symptoms because the folic acid is masking the anemia.

Over time, untreated B12 deficiency can lead to irreversible neurological damage, even if the anemia is being corrected by folic acid. This is why it's so important to test for B12 deficiency, especially in older adults and vegetarians/vegans who may be at a higher risk.

While food fortification can be a useful tool for preventing nutrient deficiencies, it's important to be aware of potential interactions between nutrients like folic acid and B12.

If you're relying on fortified foods as a major source of your B vitamins, make sure also to include plenty of B12-rich foods in your diet or consider supplementing to ensure you're meeting your needs.

## Is There Any Maltodextrin In Keto Foods

# Is there any maltodextrin in Keto foods?

## **The Hidden Truth About Maltodextrin in Keto Foods**

Maltodextrin sneaks into keto-friendly foods, masquerading as an innocent additive. But don't be fooled. With a glycemic index soaring at 110, it's anything but friendly to your ketosis goals, outranking even table sugar on the blood sugar spike meter.

Most troubling is its origin story—often derived from corn or wheat that's been genetically modified (GMO). This means not only are you grappling with potential blood sugar issues, but you're also possibly consuming GMOs and glyphosate residues without realizing it.

If staying in [ketosis](https://www.drberg.com/blog/how-to-know-you-are-in-ketosis) matters to you, reading labels becomes more than a habit; it's your shield against hidden disruptors like maltodextrin. Opt for whole-food ingredients and sidestep this unwelcome guest hiding in your so-called "keto" treats.

## **Dextrose: The Hidden Sugar Impacting Ketosis**

Imagine you're on a keto diet, carefully picking your foods to stay in ketosis. But here's the kicker: some "keto-friendly" products might pull the wool over your eyes with dextrose.

This sweet devil has a glycemic index of 100, which is like inviting sugar to crash your low-carb party uninvited.

[Dextrose](https://www.drberg.com/blog/can-a-product-with-dextrose-still-be-keto) sneaks into various foods under the guise of being harmless or even beneficial. Yet, its high glycemic index means it can spike [blood sugar levels](https://www.drberg.com/blog/blood-sugar-levels-high-despite-keto-and-fasting) fast and hard, throwing you out of ketosis quicker than you can say "carbs." Here’s why that matters for keto followers.

This synthetic sugar is often found where you least expect it - from processed meats to salad dressings. The necessity of diligently scrutinizing labels and opting for unadulterated, natural edibles becomes evident due to their ubiquity.

![Image](https://drberg-dam.imgix.net/video-thumbnails/88e115dd-2984-4509-85f8-e2cdda94ebcd.jpg?w=992&auto=compress,format)

## **The Deceptive Nature of Maltitol in Keto Products**

Maltitol might seem like a keto dream come true, but it's more of a wolf in sheep's clothing. With a glycemic index ranging from 57 to 70, maltitol isn't as innocent as it appears.

For perspective, pure glucose sits at the top with an index of 100. Maltitol, though seemingly harmless, can still cause a surge in your blood sugar, jeopardizing your state of ketosis.

### **Glucose Content in Maltitol**

Buckle up because here’s where things get tricky: half of maltitol is glucose. Yes, that molecule with a glycemic index score hitting the roof at 100. If staying in ketosis was your goal, maltitol could be secretly sabotaging your efforts without you even realizing it.

## What Could Cause Heart Palpitations While Fasting

# What could cause heart palpitations while fasting?

Heart palpitations during fasting may be caused by deficiencies in key nutrients, particularly potassium and vitamin B1. These water-soluble nutrients are not stored in the body for long periods and can become depleted, leading to elevated pulse rates. To address this, consider supplementing with electrolytes containing potassium and B vitamins. This approach should help mitigate the issue effectively.

## Have You Seen Any Data That Indicates Intermittent Fasting Increases T 9592Fe

# Have you seen any data that indicates intermittent fasting increases the risk of gut and liver cancer?

There is no evidence to suggest that intermittent fasting increases the risk of gut or liver cancer. In fact, throughout human evolution, periods of fasting were common, and our genes are well-adapted to this pattern. Intermittent fasting can help regulate insulin levels, unlike frequent eating, which can lead to constant insulin spikes. Humans, like animals in the wild, are not designed to graze continuously but to eat when genuinely hungry.

## Can Fasting Mess With A Womans Hormones

# Can fasting mess with a woman’s hormones?

Fasting can actually promote a sense of calm and reduce stress, as it often leads to a state of increased tolerance and serenity. Some concerns arise from the temporary increase in cortisol levels, a counter-regulatory hormone, when blood sugar levels drop due to not eating. However, this is typically not an issue once the body adapts to fasting and enters ketosis, usually within two to three days. At this point, the body efficiently runs on fat as fuel instead of relying solely on blood sugar, stabilizing cortisol levels. The key is to adapt to a ketogenic diet, which helps maintain hormonal balance during fasting.

## Whats The Relation Between Extreme Hunger And Intermittent Fasting

# What's the relation between extreme hunger and intermittent fasting?

Hunger is a great indicator of whether you are doing intermittent correctly. If the hunger is too high and severe WITH additional blood sugar issues (dizziness, lightheadedness, irritability, sugar cravings, and brain fog), then you need to cut back and add a meal or add more fat with a meal.

The other thing to do is add electrolytes to your fasting period and some bone broth as this will make it easier to go from 1 meal to the next. If you just have some hunger and it's not too severe - ride the wave and keep going.

## What Methods Can Quickly Relieve Bloating And Address Its Underlying C 034470

# What methods can quickly relieve bloating and address its underlying causes for long-term relief?

Bloating, that uncomfortable feeling of fullness and tightness in your abdomen, can be a real mystery. But don't worry; we're here to decode this common issue so you can say goodbye to it for good.

**What Triggers Bloating?**

- **Diet:** Certain foods, like those high in fiber, fat, or specific carbs, can lead to excess gas and bloating. Eating too quickly or not chewing properly can also make you swallow air, adding to the problem.

- **Gut Microbes:** The billions of bacteria in your gut play a crucial role in digestion. Sometimes, their gas production gets a little too enthusiastic, causing bloating.

- **FODMAPs:** These carbohydrates found in various foods like fruits, grains, legumes, and dairy can be major bloat culprits. A low-FODMAP diet might help, but remember, it's not one-size-fits-all.

- **Allergies & Sensitivities:** If you're allergic or sensitive to gluten, lactose, or nuts, your gut can become inflamed and lead to bloating.

- **Stress:** Chronic stress slows down digestion, causing food to linger in your system longer and gas to build up. Vitamin B1 might help with stress-related bloating.

- **Constipation:** When waste gets backed up in your intestines, it can lead to bloating. Instead of relying on laxatives, address the root cause of constipation with fiber, hydration, and exercise.

- **Menstrual Cramps:** Cramps can also cause bloating. Calcium and magnesium supplements might help alleviate cramps and reduce associated bloating.

- **Vegetables:** Some veggies, like broccoli and cauliflower, are high in fiber and can cause gas and bloating. However, others, like cabbage, might help reduce bloating due to their anti-inflammatory properties.

**The Bottom Line**

Bloating is a complex issue with various causes. By understanding these factors, you can take steps to prevent and manage it. Remember, it's about finding what works best for your body and making adjustments to your diet and lifestyle.

So, the next time you feel like you've swallowed a balloon, don't despair. Armed with this knowledge, you can take control and bid farewell to bloating for good.

## How Much Water Do I Drink On Keto

# How much water do I drink on Keto?

Some people drink about 2 to 3 cups of water a day. Your body adjusts to maintain a natural balance. Just make sure only to drink when you’re thirsty.

But when fasting, you’re losing glycogen. With the glycogen loss (stored sugar), you’re also going to lose a lot of fluid. This fluid isn’t just water. It’s a combination of water, electrolytes and salts – which need to go back into the body.

It would be a good idea for someone to consume between 2 and 3 liters of water per day while fasting. This quantity could also help prevent kidney stones. You would want to be sure to add electrolytes and sea salt. Forgetting electrolytes and sea salt can potentially lead to keto fatigue, keto flu and overall weakness.

Make sure to consume water when you are thirsty only, to avoid overhydration with its problems.

## How Much Is Too Much Fat On Keto

# How much is too much fat on Keto?

This is a balance of enough versus too much and getting your sweet spot (no pun intended).

If you have hypoglycemia (low blood sugars) you will need a bit more to go from one meal to the next. However, you also need to make sure you do not have too much, thus overloading the gallbladder and causing (bloating, right shoulder pain, etc). Also, if you consume too much fat, esp. between meals or after meals, you will end up burning dietary fat and NOT your own fat despite being in ketosis.

This is why I recommend always doing intermittent fasting with ketosis. So in other words - you'll have to adjust your fats until it's just right - no gallbladder issues, but allowing you to go from one meal to the next. If you are new to this, you may want to get my booklet or even my bigger book either on the website - drberg.com or amazon. On my website - you can get both as a discount, but not on amazon.

## Why Is Lemon Juice Beneficial For Managing Gout Arthritis But Potentia 4B41C2

# Why is lemon juice beneficial for managing gout arthritis but potentially detrimental for osteoarthritis?

Well, it’s actually both. In this video, I want to explain why lemon juice is both good and bad for arthritis.

Gout arthritis - High levels of uric acid.  Gout symptoms get better when you make things alkaline. When you consume lemon juice and it’s metabolized, it turns into an alkaline substance. This makes lemon juice a good remedy for gout. But, the lemon juice remedy for gout is really just a quick fix. It will help you feel better, but you still need to work on the real cause of the issue.

Osteoarthritis - Calcium deposits within the joints.  Osteoarthritis symptoms get worse when things are more alkaline. When you alkalize the body, you can create a flare-up of osteoarthritis. With osteoarthritis, you need to acidify the body by taking apple cider vinegar. 

As a side note, when doing intermittent fasting, your body will produce more uric acid. If you’re sensitive to uric acid, it may cause a flare-up of gout. In this case, you can take lemon juice or potassium citrate to alkalize the body.

## Does Intermittent Fasting Increase Gallbladder Sludge

# Does intermittent fasting increase gallbladder sludge?

Intermittent fasting can lead to gallbladder sludge due to concentrated bile during periods of fasting, typically peaking around 10 to 15 hours after the last meal. Symptoms include right shoulder and abdominal pain, bloating, burping, and nausea. To mitigate these issues:

1\. Add lemon or apple cider vinegar to water during fasting to help thin bile.

2\. Gradually introduce fats in a ketogenic diet to avoid overwhelming the gallbladder.

3\. Keto and intermittent fasting can lower insulin levels, reducing the risk of gallstone formation typically associated with high insulin.

## Why Can Stomach Problems Happen On Keto

# Why can stomach problems happen on keto?

Digestive issues on keto, like bloating and nausea, often stem from sugar alcohols and excessive fiber intake. Erythritol and xylitol can cause diarrhea, while too much fiber from veggies or keto products may overwhelm digestion. Opt for whole foods, avoiding synthetic sugars like dextrose and maltodextrin. Moderating MCT oil intake and gradually introducing new fats can help. Consider purified bile salts and betaine hydrochloride supplements. Apple cider vinegar aids digestion. Intermittent fasting can aid digestion by allowing breaks between meals. Limit nuts, peanut butter, almond flour, and cheese initially.

## Can I Eat Tofu When I Am Fasting

# Can I eat tofu when I am fasting?

Dr. Berg does not recommend it as it is a soy product. Although tofu is fermented, which buffers some of the bad effects, lots of the soy products in the market are GMO. Soy can create a lot of inflammation and other issues in the body.

## Why Sit Ups Are Bad Exercise To Reduce Belly Fat

# Why sit ups are bad exercise to reduce belly fat?

Sit ups are actually the worst exercise to help reduce belly fat. This goes against so many philosophies. But, when you think about it, you’re getting the abdominal muscles contracted, but that skin is actually getting looser. I’m going to show you a much better way to lose belly fat fast, and it’s called reversed sit ups. 

While standing, you want to tighten your abdominal muscles and stretch backward and then forward. You’ll want to do this about 25 times, rest for about 3-4 minutes, and then do another set of 25. Try doing 3 sets every day. If you have lower back pain, you want to go really light, like maybe just 3 sets of 5-10. You can also lay on your stomach and arch up. 

Doing regular sit ups can give you an imbalance and lead to back pain. This is a fantastic exercise for loose skin in the lower part of your stomach that’s really difficult to tighten.

## How Much Fat Per Day Is Best On Keto

# How much fat per day is best on keto?

On average, consume 20 to 40 grams of fat per meal. Multiply by how many meals you eat to get the total.

However, the best way to determine how much fat you need to consume is to base it on how you feel. If you feel satisfied with the meal and it allows you to not be hungry until the next meal, then that might be the best amount for you.

## Is It Normal To Bloat While Fasting

# Is it normal to bloat while fasting?

Yes, bloating while fasting is normal and can occur as the digestive system adapts to the change in eating frequency. However, persistent bloating may indicate a more serious issue, such as gut dysbiosis, food allergies, or chronic constipation.

## What Are The Quickest Methods To Relieve Bloating Immediately

# What are the quickest methods to relieve bloating immediately?

You can try consuming fewer foods to help isolate what’s causing you to bloat the most. It’s important to consider what you ate just before you noticed you were bloated. This will give you a big clue as to what’s causing you to bloat.

One of the best things to do for bloating is intermittent fasting. The more frequently you eat, the more bloating problems you’ll have. Gas produced by microbes in your gut can also cause bloating. When trying to get rid of bloating, avoiding certain things is way more important than taking certain things.

**Common foods to avoid to help with bloating:**

• Fruit

• Beans

• Grains

• Refined sugars

• Sugar alcohols

• Starches

• Maltodextrin or dextrin

• Functional fibers

• Prebiotics

• Gluten

• Lactose

• Casein

• Nuts or nut butter

• Vegetables

**Other potential causes of bloating:**

• Stress

• Constipation

• Menstrual cramps

## Do Medications Slow Down Results From Keto And Intermittent Fasting

# Do medications slow down results from Keto and Intermittent Fasting?

Metformin and Insulin will definitely slow the results because the goal is to lower insulin. Steroids are an injection for inflammation and skin problems can block your keto results. Anti-Depressants could slow the results and will give you side effects such as weight gain and statins worsen the results.

**Some Top Medications:**

- Metformin

- Insulin

- Steroids

- Anti-Depressants

- Statins
