\[SHOP\_MISC] # About Dr. Berg ## Pioneering a health revolution Dr. Eric Berg, D.C., also known as The Knowledge Doc®, is a pioneering force in the field of health and wellness, distinguished for his innovative approaches to nutrition. Driven by his own health challenges and a profound commitment to understanding biochemistry and nutritional science, Dr. Berg has amassed a wealth of knowledge and expertise that has reshaped his approach to healthcare. ## Where it all started Following his pre-med studies at the University of Wisconsin-Parkside, Dr. Berg decided to pursue chiropractic care for a more holistic approach to wellness. He earned his Doctor of Chiropractic degree from Palmer College in 1988 and maintained a successful practice for over 30 years. His advanced training includes institutions such as the National-Lincoln School of Postgraduate Education and Southern California College of Chiropractic. He is certified by the National Board of Chiropractic Examiners and holds practicing licenses in several states. ## Inspiring global wellness through knowledge Dr. Eric Berg's dedication to promoting wellness extends beyond his professional endeavors. \* ![](https://43dd65-a1.myshopify.com/cdn/shop/files/dr-berg-seminar.webp?v=1725457232\&width=700) ### Dedication to education After transitioning from his chiropractic practice, Dr. Berg became an associate professor at Howard University and authored several influential and best-selling books, including [_The Healthy Keto Plan_](https://shop.drberg.com/product/the-healthy-keto-plan) and _The 7 Principles of Fat Burning_. Since 2008, his main [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC3w193M5tYPJqF0Hi-7U-2g) has grown to include over 6,000 videos, with 13 million subscribers. He dedicates hours each day to immersing himself in the latest natural health research, transforming complex topics into easily digestible information for his audience. Dr. Berg's global reach extends through his [training programs](https://shop.drberg.com/product/keto-coach) for health coaches and his seminars, which have educated more than 2,500 healthcare professionals, showcasing his dedication to advancing holistic health education. \* ![](https://43dd65-a1.myshopify.com/cdn/shop/files/dr-eric-berg-has-trained-health-professionals-in-his-methods-and-techniques_copy.webp?v=1725458283\&width=700) ### Making a difference Through their philanthropic efforts, Dr. Berg and his wife, Karen, have significantly contributed to the natural health and wellness movement. Dr. Berg established the Ultra-Processed Free Initiative (UPFI), a charity that raises awareness about the negative impacts of [ultra-processed foods](https://www.drberg.com/resources/upf?queryID=4c6b7c23036d79e0c00ca0df4a64f864\&objectID=res_89) and promotes healthier dietary choices through community outreach and educational campaigns. Dr. Berg is also the CEO of the Berg Institute of Health & Wellness, where he remains a key figure in advancing holistic health. \* ![](https://43dd65-a1.myshopify.com/cdn/shop/files/dr-berg-farm-greenhouse-watering.webp?v=1725456216\&width=700) ### Passion for nutrition Dr. Berg’s dedication to holistic wellness deeply influences his personal and professional life. At his farm, he conducts soil research to optimize the growth of nutrient-rich produce and the well-being of his animals, underscoring his commitment to foundational health principles. He applies his farm-to-table philosophy to creating health-infused recipes. By utilizing the foods he grows, he develops delicious and nutritious meals that support optimal nutrition. Dr. Berg’s recipes emphasize natural, wholesome ingredients and offer practical ways for individuals to incorporate nutrient-rich foods into their daily diets. \* ![](https://43dd65-a1.myshopify.com/cdn/shop/files/wheatgrass-quality-control.webp?v=1725981288\&width=700) ### Commitment to quality Dr. Berg recognized a significant gap in the market for products that truly support optimal health. Many supplements contain artificial additives, preservatives, and other harmful ingredients. He wanted to create quality products that people trust. All Dr. Berg supplements, from [Adrenal & Cortisol Support](https://shop.drberg.com/product/adrenal-cortisol-support) to [Electrolyte Powder](https://shop.drberg.com/collections/electrolytes), are meticulously crafted with carefully selected premium-quality ingredients and manufactured in cGMP-certified facilities. Many of his products are USDA organic and cater to various lifestyles, including gluten-free, vegan, vegetarian, kosher, and halal options. His products reflect Dr. Berg’s commitment to promoting natural health through science-backed nutrition. ## Transforming health and wellness His innovative approach to healthy eating, called the Healthy Keto® diet, is rooted in evidence-based health solutions and has been refined through years of clinical application and feedback. Healthy Keto uses ketogenic diet principles, focusing on nutrient-dense, whole foods to optimize metabolic function and support health. Throughout his career, Dr. Berg has established himself as a prominent speaker and expert in nutrition and intermittent fasting. He has been featured in leading magazines and appeared on major TV and radio programs, including CBS Nightly News, Channel 9, and Channel 8 News. His work has significantly raised awareness about the benefits of healthy eating plans for promoting health and well-being. Learn more: https://shop.drberg.com/pages/about-dr-berg

## \[SHOP\_MISC] # Dr. Berg’s Farm – About ## Our mission: Cultivating fertile soil for nutritious food K

\[SHOP\_MISC] # Dr. Berg’s Farm – About ## Our mission: Cultivating fertile soil for nutritious food Knowing the devastating impact of soil degradation on plant and livestock quality, Dr. Berg embarked on a mission to grow fertile soil and nutritious, flavorful foods on his farm in Western Virginia. Modern agriculture results in infertile soils that yield nutrient-poor crops containing up to 40 percent fewer essential vitamins and minerals than produce harvested only five decades ago. Poor soil quality diminishes the nutrient density of crops and the livestock that feed on them, perpetuating a cycle of declining nutritional value in the food supply and compromising health. ## Dr. Berg’s approach to living soil ![](https://43dd65-a1.myshopify.com/cdn/shop/files/dr-berg-farm-hands-in-fertile-soil.webp?v=1725493213\&width=896) Soil is more than the dirt under your feet; it’s a living ecosystem with water, minerals, gasses, microorganisms, and insects that work synergistically. ## Nurturing nutrient rich soil Dr. Berg conducts soil research to optimize the growth of nutrient-rich produce and the well-being of his animals, underscoring his commitment to foundational health principles. \* ![](https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0559/4418/3880/files/greenhouse.jpg?v=1725993032\&width=700) ### Greenhouse innovations for exceptional nutrition Dr Berg’s farm thrives on cutting-edge greenhouse techniques for nutrient-rich crops. Crop cultivation begins in a specialized greenhouse, where groundbreaking lighting techniques manage plant growth and nutrition. Intense red-spectrum grow lights mimic the sun's light spectrum, encouraging photosynthesis, boosting seedling development, and enhancing budding and flowering. The addition of blue light exposure increases the plants' phytonutrient content, supercharging their antioxidant capacity and nutritional value. \* ![](https://43dd65-a1.myshopify.com/cdn/shop/files/Compost-soil-farm.jpg?v=1746202905\&width=700) ### Turning waste into health Composting recycles decomposing organic matter, such as plant scraps and livestock manure, into a nutrient-rich amendment to increase soil fertility. The soil on Dr. Berg’s farm is carefully composted to ensure soil recovery and nutrient regeneration, providing maximum benefits for plant growth. Biochar, made from wood scraps heated to create charcoal, is also added to the soil as an eco-friendly alternative to perlite, which is energy-intensive to produce. Biochar stores carbon, increases soil porosity, improves water retention, and provides a habitat for beneficial microbes to flourish. It also enhances composting efficiency, shortening the timespan needed to create compost by 30 percent so nutrients can be added back into the soil more quickly. \* ![](https://43dd65-a1.myshopify.com/cdn/shop/files/dr-berg-farm-greenhouse-watering.webp?v=1725456216\&width=700) ### Every drop counts Water efficiency is foundational at Dr. Berg’s farm, where continuous developments are made to preserve and harvest mineral-rich water to drive plant growth and nutrient density. Biochar in the soil increases water retention by up to ten percent, requiring less frequent watering and moderate plant stress. This adaptive response produces crops richer in health-supporting phytonutrients. Rainwater is also harvested from the greenhouse and is funneled into an irrigation pond populated with bluegill fish, which fortify the water with nutrient-rich waste, reducing the need for soil amendments and fertilizer. \* ![](https://43dd65-a1.myshopify.com/cdn/shop/files/dr-berg-farm-panoramic..webp?v=1725464385\&width=700) ### Inspiring the future and educating tomorrow’s farmers Dr. Berg plans to open his farm to local students, helping to shape the minds of the next generation of farmers, homesteaders, and suburban gardeners. Students will discover where their food comes from by engaging in greenhouse activities, exploring the microscopic world of plant fertility, and learning about the intricacies of sustainable practices to enhance the health, nutritional value, and flavor of food. ## Meet Dr. Berg’s farm manager Dr. Berg is passionate about knowing where food comes from and talking to the people at the heart of the process—the farmers. That’s how Dr. Berg met Taco. Dr. Berg first came to him for fresh produce at the local Farmer’s Market where Taco shared a passion for nutrition and healthy growing practices that couldn’t be ignored. Now, he plays a vital role in making the Berg farm thrive. Taco has a deeply personal connection to the power of plants. When his wife was diagnosed with triple-negative breast cancer in 2018, Taco delved into the world of holistic healing. He discovered the incredible benefits of sulforaphane from broccoli sprouts and the therapeutic properties of Turkey tail mushrooms. His wife’s tumor shrank dramatically, and today she is cancer-free. Taco's journey with his wife fuels his dedication to cultivating life-enhancing crops on the farm.

## \[SHOP\_MISC] # Returns & Satisfaction Guarantee – Dr. Berg ## Purchasing multiple units Customers are

\[SHOP\_MISC] # Returns & Satisfaction Guarantee – Dr. Berg ## Purchasing multiple units Customers are encouraged to try our products and ensure they meet their expectations before making a large purchase of 3 or more units. Please be aware that purchasing multiple units of a product may disqualify you from being eligible for a refund. Additionally, we may require any unopened products to be returned at your expense. Our refund policy is designed to allow customers to try our products and make an informed decision about their suitability. When you purchase multiple units, it signifies a higher level of commitment, and it is assumed that you have already tested and approved the product. ## Non-refundable shipping costs Please note that while we offer a 30-day refund policy, shipping costs are non-refundable. This means that we will refund the purchase price of the product(s) but not the shipping charges associated with the original purchase. We believe in transparency, and we want to ensure that you are fully informed of our refund policy. If you have any questions regarding this policy or need assistance with a refund request, please do not hesitate to reach out to our customer support team. ## Undeliverable shipments policy: At Dr. Berg Nutritionals, we strive to ensure that your orders reach you in a timely and secure manner. In some cases, shipments may become undeliverable due to various reasons such as incorrect address information, failed delivery attempts, or other unforeseen circumstances. This policy outlines the steps we take to address undeliverable shipments within the United States: \* **Reshipment option:** If a shipment is deemed undeliverable by our shipping carrier, we offer the option to reship the package to an alternative address provided by the customer. You may choose to have the package delivered to a different location, such as your workplace or the address of a trusted friend or family member. To request a reshipment, please contact our customer support team at \[orders@drberg.com]\(mailto: orders@drberg.com). \* **Refund option:** Alternatively, if you prefer not to have the undeliverable shipment reshipped, we can issue a refund for the product's cost minus the initial shipping charges. If you choose the refund option, the following conditions will apply: \* The refund will be processed to the original payment method used for the order \* Shipping charges are non-refundable, and they will be deducted from the refund amount \* Please allow a minimum of 3 business days for the refund to be processed, as it may vary depending on your payment provider. To request a refund for an undeliverable shipment, please contact our customer support team at \[703-354-7336]\(tel: 703-354-7336). We will guide you through the refund process and provide any necessary information. ## Refused shipments policy: Please be aware that when a shipment is refused by a customer, we do not refund the shipping charges associated with the order. The shipping charges are non-refundable, and they will be excluded from any refund issued for the refused shipment. ## International undeliverable shipment and refusal policy: At Dr. Berg Nutritionals, we understand that international shipping can come with unique challenges. In the event of an undeliverable shipment or refusal by an international customer, we have established a policy to ensure transparency and clarity regarding refunds and potential fees. \* **Refund of product costs:** When an international shipment is undeliverable or refused by a customer, we will process a refund for the cost of the product(s) in the order. This refund will be issued to the original payment method used for the purchase. \* **Additional fees may apply:** Please be aware that additional fees may apply in the case of an undeliverable shipment or a customer refusal. These fees are typically associated with the cost of returning the package to our facilities, as well as any customs-related charges incurred during the return process. These fees will be deducted from any potential refund issued for the product costs. The same rules apply if a shipment is destroyed by the carrier. To minimize the occurrences of undeliverable shipments and potential fees, please ensure that the shipping information provided during checkout is accurate and complete. Verify that the recipient's address is correct and that it is the intended delivery location. Make note of any customs or import fees that may apply during delivery. We value our international customers and are committed to ensuring your satisfaction with our products. ## Cancellation policy We understand that sometimes you may need to cancel an order, and we aim to provide flexibility while ensuring efficient order processing. Please take note of the following cancellation policy. Once an order has entered our warehouse and the processing has begun, it cannot be canceled. Our team works diligently to prepare and ship our order promptly, and at this stage, we are unable to stop the process. We apologize for the inconvenience this may cause. Please contact our customer support team with your order details, and they will assist you with the status of your order. If the order has not reached our warehouse, we will issue a full refund, including any shipping charges. We are dedicated to providing a seamless shopping experience and are committed to assisting you with any inquiries or concerns you may have. Do not hesitate to contact our customer support team for guidance or support regarding your orders at \[orders@drberg.com]\(mailto: orders@drberg.com).

## \[SHOP\_MISC] # Shipping Information – Dr. Berg ## United States shipments ### Flat rate shipping now

\[SHOP\_MISC] # Shipping Information – Dr. Berg ## United States shipments ### Flat rate shipping now available – plus free shipping on orders over $160 ### We’re making shipping simple. 1. **Flat Rate Shipping** – for just $4 on all orders under $160. Enjoy a low and consistent fee, no matter the size of your order. 2. **Free Shipping** – on all orders over $160. ### US shipping methods For both Flat Rate and Free Shipping orders, the shipping method we use is based on your destination and the most efficient carrier available. Our warehouses use the following shipping methods: 1. **DHL eCommerce (Domestic)** - used for shipments under 1lb, offering affordable shipping with reliable tracking. Orders are transported through DHL’s network and handed off to USPS for final delivery. Typical delivery times range from 3 to 8 business days depending on your location. 2. **UPS SurePost** – This combines the reliability of UPS Ground with the efficiency of USPS for final delivery. Delivery time is typically 2–5 business days. This shipping option handles medium size orders (3–9 lbs). 3. **USPS Priority Delivery** – This option provides reliable and affordable service with tracking and delivery within 3–4 business days. This option is mainly used for orders going to a military address or a US territory. 4. **USPS Ground Advantage** – This option is relatively new and designed to simplify options for packages up to 70 lbs. Packages deliver within 2–5 business days to all 50 states, U.S. military bases, and territories. 5. **Free Shipping** – The shipping method used on these orders is typically UPS SurePost or USPS Ground Advantage. 6. **Buy with Prime** – Amazon Prime members can now enjoy fast, free shipping and a trusted checkout experience directly on our website. Orders placed using Buy with Prime are processed and shipped by Amazon. Most orders are delivered within 1-2 business days, depending on your location.

These locations were selected to give our customers the quickest transit time within the United States. We take pride in our efficient processing system. Orders that are received are swiftly prepared for shipment, as we are committed to dispatching them within 24 hours or less. Our warehouses do not ship out on weekends. Orders received on Friday after 1 pm EST will be shipped out Monday morning. Our warehouses are closed on federal holidays, which may cause delays in processing time. Please be aware that shipping delays may occur during peak seasons due to high demand faced by freight carriers. We are committed to processing your orders promptly, but delays with carriers may impact delivery times. Thank you for your understanding. ### Address accuracy Smooth shipping starts with an accurate address. We understand the importance of receiving your supplements promptly, which is why we emphasize the importance of providing precise and complete shipping information. Your shipping address acts as the roadmap for your package's journey from our warehouse to your hands. Even the smallest error or omission could lead to delays or even misdelivery. ## International shipments We’ve partnered with Global-E to offer a seamless shopping experience for our international customers. Global-E helps make your shopping easy by allowing you to: 1. **Shop in your local currency** – No need for conversion calculations. Prices are displayed in your preferred currency. Please note that the shipping address determines which currency you will be charged. 2. **Pay taxes and duties at checkout** – Say goodbye to surprise fees upon delivery. All taxes and import duties are calculated and paid during checkout, so no extra charges show up later. 3. **Multiple payment options** – You can use your preferred payment methods, from credit cards to local options, for a smoother transaction. Duties and taxes are calculated based on the items ordered, shipment destination, and the value of the purchase. If duties and taxes are charged at checkout, they will appear as a separate line item. If they are already included in the product price, there will be a note at checkout clarifying. Some countries require duties and taxes to be paid upon delivery and they will be the customer's responsibility. It will be noted at checkout for full transparency before you order. Please select the country switcher dropdown to see which countries we ship to and select accordingly. ### International shipping method DHL Express will be our preferred shipping method for all international orders, ensuring fast and dependable delivery for our customers. Here is why DHL Express is the perfect choice: 1. **Fast delivery** – DHL Express is known for its speed. Your package will reach its destination quickly, often within just a few days, no matter where you are in the world. 2. **Real-time tracking** – You can track your package every step of the way. DHL Express provides detailed updates from the moment your order leaves our warehouse to when it arrives at your doorstep. 3. **Customs expertise** – DHL Express has extensive experience handling customs clearance, helping to ensure that your package moves smoothly through international borders without delays. 4. **Worldwide reach** – With a presence in over 220 countries and territories, DHL Express can deliver to even the most remote locations. 5. **Secure and reliable** – DHL Express offers reliable delivery, ensuring your package arrives safely. Their advanced tracking and handling systems minimize the risk of lost or delayed shipments. ### Product restrictions Global-E is an expert in international commerce and helps ensure that your order complies with the regulations in your country. They do this by: 1. **Constantly monitoring import laws** – Global-E keeps up-to-date with the product restrictions and import regulations of countries around the world. This means they know which items are allowed or restricted in each country. 2. **Automatically filtering products** – When you shop from an international location, Global-E checks your shipping destination and makes sure the products you want to buy can be legally imported to your country. If an item is restricted, you won’t be able to add it to your cart. 3. **Handling necessary documentation** – If your order includes items that require special paperwork, Global-E manages the necessary customs forms and ensures your shipment meets all legal requirements. This allows you to shop with confidence, knowing that Global-E ensures everything you buy follows your country’s laws and regulations. #### Current countries restricted: \* Afghanistan \* Belarus \* Bonaire, Saint Eustatius and Saba \* China \* Congo, Democratic Republic \* Greece \* Hong Kong \* Iran \* Malaysia \* Mali \* Marshall Islands \* Mexico \* Micronesia \* Myanmar \* Netherlands Antilles \* New Zealand \* Niger \* Palau \* Peru \* Russia \* Somalia \* Spain \* Sudan \* Taiwan \* Thailand \* Türkiye\* \* Ukraine \* Venezuela Learn more: https://shop.drberg.com/pages/shipping-information

Your use of the Program constitutes your agreement to these terms and conditions (“Program Terms”). We may modify or cancel the Program or any of its features without notice. To the extent permitted by applicable law, we may also modify these Program Terms at any time and your continued use of the Program following the effective date of any such changes shall constitute your acceptance of such changes. By consenting to the Program, you agree to receive recurring SMS/text messages from and on behalf of Dr. Berg Nutritionals through your wireless provider to the mobile number you provided, even if your mobile number is registered on any state or federal Do Not Call list. Text messages may be sent using an automatic telephone dialing system or other technology. Program-related messages may include updates, alerts, and information (e.g., order updates, account alerts, etc.). Promotional messages may include promotions, specials, and other marketing offers (e.g., cart reminders). You understand that you do not have to sign up for this program in order to make any purchases, and your consent is not a condition of any purchase with Dr. Berg Nutritionals. Your participation in this program is completely voluntary. We do not charge for the Program, but you are responsible for all charges and fees associated with text messaging imposed by your wireless provider. Message frequency varies. Message and data rates may apply. Check your mobile plan and contact your wireless provider for details. You are solely responsible for all charges related to SMS/text messages, including charges from your wireless provider. You may opt-out of the Program at any time. Text the single keyword command STOP to +18557171456 or click the unsubscribe link (where available) in any text message to cancel. You'll receive a one-time opt-out confirmation text message.

You acknowledge that any messages, including any STOP or HELP requests, you send to a short code or telephone number we have changed may not be received and we will not be responsible for honoring requests made in such messages. The wireless carriers supported by the Program are not liable for delayed or undelivered messages. You agree to provide us with a valid mobile number.

To the extent permitted by applicable law, you agree that we will not be liable for failed, delayed, or misdirected delivery of any information sent through the Program, any errors in such information, and/or any action you may or may not take in reliance on the information or Program. We respect your right to privacy. To see how we collect and use your personal information, please see our Privacy Notice. ### Program dispute resolution 1. General. In the interest of resolving disputes between you and Dr. Berg Nutritionals in the most expedient and cost effective manner, you and Dr. Berg Nutritionals agree that any dispute arising out of or in any way related to these Program Terms or your receipt of text messages from Dr. Berg Nutritionals or its service providers will be resolved by binding arbitration. Arbitration is less formal than a lawsuit in court. Arbitration uses a neutral arbitrator instead of a judge or jury, may allow for more limited discovery than in court, and can be subject to very limited review by courts. Arbitrators can award the same damages and relief that a court can award. This agreement to arbitrate disputes includes all claims arising out of or in any way related to these Program Terms, or your receipt of text messages from Dr. Berg Nutritionals or its service providers whether based in contract, tort, statute, fraud, misrepresentation, or any other legal theory, and regardless of when a claim arises. YOU UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT, BY AGREEING TO THESE PROGRAM TERMS, YOU AND DR. BERG NUTRITIONALS ARE EACH WAIVING THE RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY OR TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION AND THAT THESE PROGRAM TERMS SHALL BE SUBJECT TO AND GOVERNED BY THE FEDERAL ARBITRATION ACT. 2. Exceptions. Notwithstanding subsection (1) above (“General”), nothing in these Program Terms will be deemed to waive, preclude, or otherwise limit the right of you or Dr. Berg Nutritionals to: (a) bring an individual action in small claims court; (b) pursue an enforcement action through the applicable federal, state, or local agency if that action is available; (c) seek injunctive relief in aid of arbitration from a court of competent jurisdiction; or, (d) file suit in a court of law to address an intellectual property infringement claim. 3. Arbitrator. Any arbitration between you and Dr. Berg Nutritionals will be governed by the Federal Arbitration Act and the Commercial Dispute Resolution Procedures and Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes (collectively, "Rules") of the American Arbitration Association ("AAA"), as modified by these Program Terms, and will be administered by the AAA. The AAA Rules and filing forms are available online at www.adr.org, by calling the AAA at 1-800-778-7879, or by contacting Dr. Berg Nutritionals. The arbitrator has exclusive authority to resolve any dispute relating to the interpretation, applicability, or enforceability of this binding arbitration agreement. 4. Notice Process. If you or Dr. Berg Nutritionals intends to seek arbitration, then the party seeking arbitration must first send a written notice of the dispute to the other party by U.S. Mail (\\"Notice\\"). Dr. Berg Nutritionals address for Notice is: 4501 Ford Avenue, Alexandria, Virginia 22302, Attn: Chief Executive Officer. The Notice must: (a) describe the nature and basis of the claim or dispute; and, (b) set forth the specific relief sought ("Demand"). You and Dr. Berg Nutritionals will make good faith efforts to resolve the claim directly, but if you and Dr. Berg Nutritionals do not reach an agreement to do so within 30 days after the Notice is received, you or Dr. Berg Nutritionals may commence an arbitration proceeding. During the arbitration, the amount of any settlement offer made by you or Dr. Berg Nutritionals must not be disclosed to the arbitrator until after the arbitrator makes a final decision and award, if any. 5. Fees. If you commence arbitration in accordance with these Program Terms, Dr. Berg Nutritionals will reimburse you for your payment of the filing fee, unless your claim is for more than $15,000 or as set forth below, in which case the payment of any fees will be decided by the AAA Rules. If the claim is for $15,000 or less, you may choose whether the arbitration will be conducted: (a) solely on the basis of documents submitted to the arbitrator; (b) through a non-appearance based telephone hearing; or, (c) by an in-person hearing as established by the AAA Rules. If the arbitrator finds that either the substance of your claim or the relief sought in the Demand is frivolous or brought for an improper purpose (as measured by the standards set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b)), then the payment of all fees will be governed by the AAA Rules. In that case, you agree to reimburse Dr. Berg Nutritionals for all monies previously disbursed by it that are otherwise your obligation to pay under the AAA Rules. Regardless of the manner in which the arbitration is conducted, the arbitrator must issue a reasoned written decision sufficient to explain the essential findings and conclusions on which the decision and award, if any, are based. You and Dr. Berg Nutritionals agree that such written decision, and information exchanged during arbitration, will be kept confidential except to the extent necessary to enforce or permit limited judicial review of the award. The arbitrator may make rulings and resolve disputes as to the payment and reimbursement of fees or expenses at any time during the proceeding and upon request from you or Dr. Berg Nutritionals made within 14 days of the arbitrator's ruling on the merits. 6. No Class Actions. YOU AND DR. BERG NUTRITIONALS AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN AN INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. Further, unless both you and Dr. Berg Nutritionals agree otherwise in a signed writing, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person's claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding. 7. Modifications to this Arbitration Provision. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in these Program Terms, if Dr. Berg Nutritionals makes any future change to this arbitration provision, other than a change to Dr. Berg Nutritionals address for Notice, you may reject the change by sending us written notice within 30 days of the change to Dr. Berg Nutritionals address for Notice, in which case this arbitration provision, as in effect immediately prior to the changes you rejected, will continue to govern any disputes between you and Dr. Berg Nutritionals. 8. Enforceability. If an arbitrator decides that applicable law precludes enforcement of any of the limitations of subsection (6) above (“No Class Actions” - addressing class, representative and consolidated proceedings) as to a particular claim for relief, then that claim (and only that claim) must be severed from the arbitration and brought in court. If any other provision of these Program Terms is found to be unenforceable, the applicable provision shall be deemed stricken and the remainder of these Program Terms shall remain in full force and effect. ## Customer ratings, reviews, and Q\&A terms of use These Terms of Use govern your conduct associated with the Customer Ratings and Reviews and/or Questions and Answers service offered by Dr. Berg Nutritionals (the "CRR Service").
