## FAQ 11: Do calories matter when following a ketogenic diet plan?

[**Home**](https://support.drberg.com/) **/** [**All Frequently Asked Questions**](https://support.drberg.com/faqs) **/** **Keto** **/** Do calories matter when following a ketogenic diet plan? Where Do I Start? nstead of focusing solely on calorie counting, consider these factors: your metabolic rate, thyroid function, insulin resistance, exercise, stress, sleep quality, and overall health. Eating a Healthy Keto® diet and gradually reducing meal frequency from three to two, then to one meal a day (OMAD), can help regulate calorie intake. Listen to your body's hunger cues to determine the right amount of calories for you. As for feeling sleepy after eating salad, it could be due to overwhelming gut bacteria or hidden sugars in dressings. Gradually reduce salad intake to avoid fatigue and allow your body to adapt to increased vegetable consumption. This approach emphasizes overall health and satisfaction over strict calorie counting.

## FAQ 17: What do you do when nothing works for weight loss?

[**Home**](https://support.drberg.com/) **/** [**All Frequently Asked Questions**](https://support.drberg.com/faqs) **/** **Weight Loss and Fitness** **/** What do you do when nothing works for weight loss? The 3 dominating hormones that cancel out weight loss: **1\. Cortisol** Cortisol is a stress hormone activated by all forms of stress. In the presence of sustained cortisol, it will be hard to lose belly fat. It will also cause you to age more quickly, and it will even turn muscle into sugar. **What to do:** • Exercise • Get plenty of sleep • Consume B vitamins (nutritional yeast), calcium (not calcium carbonate), potassium (from vegetables) • Decrease stress from other people • Decrease physical stress • Increase pleasure **2\. Insulin** Insulin is a hormone that regulates the sugar in your blood. When you lose the ability to regulate sugar, the insulin goes up. Sugar triggers insulin. Even just a little bit of insulin can block fat burning. **3\. Estrogen** If you have problems with your menstrual cycle, you’re likely estrogen dominant. This will cause you to gain weight in your hips, butt, and below your belly button. It can also cause a fibroid, which then will make more estrogen. ![what-to-do-when-nothing-works-for-weight-loss-drbergs-tips](https://hls.drberg.com/migrated-assets%2Fwhat-to-do-when-nothing-works-for-weight-loss-drbergs-tips/thumbnail_main.jpg)

## FAQ 22: Is it okay to include juicing in a ketogenic diet?

[**Home**](https://support.drberg.com/) **/** [**All Frequently Asked Questions**](https://support.drberg.com/faqs) **/** **Keto** **/** Is it okay to include juicing in a ketogenic diet? Juicing vegetables isn't ideal for keto or fasting, unless you're using a juice powder. Vegetable juices often contain more carbs than expected, slowing ketosis and weight loss. Juicing removes fiber, increasing net carbs compared to whole vegetables. It also reduces phytonutrients, important for health. If you crave juice, try inositol to combat insulin resistance or bile salts to reduce cravings and increase satisfaction after meals.

## FAQ 23: What are the key benefits of autophagy?

[**Home**](https://support.drberg.com/) **/** [**All Frequently Asked Questions**](https://support.drberg.com/faqs) **/** **Natural Remedies** **/** What are the key benefits of autophagy? Autophagy means “self-eat.” This is the state in which your body begins to recycle damaged proteins and pathogens. When proteins become damaged, they can wreak havoc in your body. To prevent this harm, your body uses autophagy to break down damaged proteins with enzymes and to create new healthy proteins. **Benefits:** * Reduces inflammation * Increases your lifespan and health * Prevents cancer * Slows down the aging process * Decreases the risk of disease * Helps to recycle protein as a survival mechanism * Helps to reduce pathogens in the body * Protects neurons and heart cells * Gets rid of advanced glycation end products and amyloid plaquing * Helps you deal with • viruses • bacteria • fungus • candida • biofilms/nanobacteria ![what-is-autophagy-the-real-reason-why-it-exists-drberg](https://hls.drberg.com/migrated-assets%2Fwhat-is-autophagy-the-real-reason-why-it-exists-drberg/thumbnail_main.jpg)

## FAQ 24: What could be the reason I'm not feeling satisfied after meals?

[**Home**](https://support.drberg.com/) **/** [**All Frequently Asked Questions**](https://support.drberg.com/faqs) **/** **Nutrition Questions** **/** What could be the reason I'm not feeling satisfied after meals? **Cause #1: Insulin resistance** Consuming a lot of carbs will spike your blood sugar. In turn, your body will increase the amount of Insulin to lower these spikes. When your blood sugar goes down you will crave food again and can feel dissatisfied with the prior meal. Additionally, if you are constantly on a high- carb diet, your cells will eventually starve and you’ll crave all day long. **Cause #2: Low fats in the diet** Fats in your diet are necessary for you to be satisfied after a meal. Consuming fatty foods or adding fat to the meal can make you feel more full and less hungry afterward. Additionally, fats can greatly help if you are fasting, because if you consume more fat during your mealtime it will reduce the hungry feeling during a fast period. **Cause #3: Low micronutrients** If you are not consuming enough micronutrients in your diet, this can result in not feeling satisfied after meals. We need micronutrients to ensure healthy performance of our bodies and for prevention of illnesses. However, if you lack certain nutrients, like minerals or a specific vitamin, and consume a meal without getting what you need, this can keep causing dissatisfaction and a wish to eat more.

## FAQ 34: What nutrient deficiency is linked to asthma?

[**Home**](https://support.drberg.com/) **/** [**All Frequently Asked Questions**](https://support.drberg.com/faqs) **/** **Symptoms, Conditions and Causes** **/** What nutrient deficiency is linked to asthma? A common nutrient deficiency associated with asthma is vitamin D deficiency. Symptoms of asthma include wheezing, shortness of breath, chest tightness, and coughing. Vitamin D deficiency may contribute to structural changes in lung tissue, affecting gas exchange, lung volume, and smooth muscle composition. In asthma, inflammation disrupts immune protection in the lung lining, involving T helper and T regulatory cells. Dysfunctions in these cells lead to immune overreaction and inflammation triggers. Vitamin D supplementation, at doses like 20,000 IUs of vitamin D3, may help reduce inflammation, remodel lung tissues, and enhance cortisol function in the lungs, potentially alleviating asthma symptoms.

## FAQ 35: What strategies can be implemented to reduce the risk of developing cancer?

[**Home**](https://support.drberg.com/) **/** [**All Frequently Asked Questions**](https://support.drberg.com/faqs) **/** **Symptoms, Conditions and Causes** **/** What strategies can be implemented to reduce the risk of developing cancer? Cancer originates from normal cells. When something harmful happens in your environment, it can potentially create destruction to the mitochondria in your cells. Damaged mitochondria can no longer provide energy to a cell, and the cell is forced to use a different energy source. Now, we’re looking at a cancer cell. When mitochondria become damaged, and a cell turns into a cancer cell, the cancer cell becomes immortal. It also produces inflammation, and it seems to grow and spread into areas of inflammation. Mitochondria have many more functions than just producing energy. In my opinion, to reduce your risk of cancer, you need to reduce your risk of developing damage to the mitochondria. **Natural ways to decrease your cancer risk:** 1\. Do intermittent and periodic prolonged fasting 2\. Exercise 3\. Get quality sleep 4\. Socialize **\*The above information is not intended for diagnosis. If you have any health concerns you should consult your physician.** ![4-big-ways-to-drop-your-cancer-risk-1080p](https://hls.drberg.com/migrated-assets%2F4-big-ways-to-drop-your-cancer-risk-1080p/thumbnail_main.jpg)

## FAQ 36: Which supplement can assist with cataracts?

[**Home**](https://support.drberg.com/) **/** [**All Frequently Asked Questions**](https://support.drberg.com/faqs) **/** **Natural Remedies** **/** Which supplement can assist with cataracts? N-acetylcarnosine (NAC) is recognized for its potent antioxidant properties, which are beneficial in addressing glycation within the eye lens. The "C" component of NAC, carnosine, is particularly effective in this regard. The "N" component, acetyl, facilitates the delivery of carnosine into the eye, which can be challenging to achieve due to the lens's unique structure. When dealing with cataracts, targeting the affected tissue directly is crucial. NAC is an excellent choice for this purpose, as it can penetrate the lens effectively and address the opacity caused by advanced glycation end products (AGEs). However, it's important to note that there are different types of NAC available, and selecting the correct one is essential for optimal results. For detailed guidance on how to use NAC for cataracts, please refer to the comprehensive video I have created on this topic. While there are no guarantees, using NAC offers a promising approach to improving cataracts, especially when other methods have not yielded satisfactory results. Its ability to penetrate the lens and specifically target the glycation-related issues makes it a valuable option worth considering. ![the-1-ultimate-cure-for-cataracts-dr-berg-explains-1080p](https://hls.drberg.com/migrated-assets%2Fthe-1-ultimate-cure-for-cataracts-dr-berg-explains-1080p/thumbnail_main.jpg)

## FAQ 37: What are the best strategies for maintaining my weight?

[**Home**](https://support.drberg.com/) **/** [**All Frequently Asked Questions**](https://support.drberg.com/faqs) **/** **Weight Loss and Fitness** **/** What are the best strategies for maintaining my weight? To maintain your weight, it's important not to make drastic changes to your routine. However, if you find yourself losing too much weight, consider increasing your fat intake and slightly raising your carbs, while staying under 50 grams. As your health improves and insulin resistance decreases, you may have more flexibility in your diet. Occasionally testing how your body responds to going off-plan can offer insight into your tolerance, but always ensure you can easily return to your routine. The healthier you are, the more flexibility you have.

## FAQ 38: What nutrients or supplements are most beneficial for eye health and may help reduce floaters

[**Home**](https://support.drberg.com/) **/** [**All Frequently Asked Questions**](https://support.drberg.com/faqs) **/** **Natural Remedies** **/** What nutrients or supplements are most beneficial for eye health and may help reduce floaters **There is an MSM liquid.** And it tends to help as an antioxidant to the internal part of the eye that penetrates the eye. **There's also another remedy called NAC for the eye.** And if I'm not mistaken it comes in drops too. So that can penetrate the lens.That's more for cataracts but it can also be used for floaters. Think about floaters as something related to what's called glycation where you're combining this protein with the sugar. And that's why diabetics have a lot of floaters too. If you start to reduce your sugars, go on keto, they should improve. **How do you get rid of this residual glycation?** Cause that kind of gets stuck in the body. Well, you have to get your body in a state of what's called a autophagy and that's the recycling of these damaged proteins and cleaning them up. It's like a house cleaning. And there's a couple of different ways to get your body in autophagy: periodic prolonged fasting and exercise. Those are the two most powerful ones. And then of course, not adding more sugar that contributes to making it worse. ![eye-floaters-fixed-aug-29](https://hls.drberg.com/migrated-assets%2Feye-floaters-fixed-aug-29/thumbnail_main.jpg)

## FAQ 42: Is OMAD safe for individuals over 50?

[**Home**](https://support.drberg.com/) **/** [**All Frequently Asked Questions**](https://support.drberg.com/faqs) **/** **Intermittent Fasting** **/** Is OMAD safe for individuals over 50? **Benefits of One Meal A Day (OMAD) for Individuals Over 50** For individuals over 50, the One Meal A Day (OMAD) approach, which involves consuming all daily calories within a single 1-hour window, offers several advantages. As metabolism slows with age and the risk of age-related diseases such as type 2 diabetes and heart disease increases, OMAD can be particularly beneficial. It enhances insulin sensitivity, reduces inflammation, and promotes healthy aging. By limiting the eating window to one meal, the body has extended time to rest and repair, optimizing cellular function and disease prevention. Additionally, OMAD's simplicity may appeal to those seeking a streamlined eating approach. **Physiological Benefits of Extended Fasting** Extended fasting periods, such as the 18/6 and 20/4 methods, trigger significant physiological changes that improve health. Extended fasting boosts growth hormone levels, which is crucial for muscle growth, fat loss, and cellular regeneration. It can increase growth hormone production by up to 2000%, offering anti-aging benefits and improved body composition. Prolonged fasting also activates autophagy, a process where cells break down and recycle damaged proteins and organelles. This cellular cleaning enhances brain function, promotes longevity, and reduces the risk of chronic diseases. ![is-it-safe-for-an-older-person-to-fast](https://hls.drberg.com/migrated-assets%2Fis-it-safe-for-an-older-person-to-fast/thumbnail_main.jpg)

## FAQ 45: Is cow's milk safe to consume for most people?

[**Home**](https://support.drberg.com/) **/** [**All Frequently Asked Questions**](https://support.drberg.com/faqs) **/** **Nutrition Questions** **/** Is cow's milk safe to consume for most people? While raw milk is often blamed for carrying pathogens, it's important to distinguish between raw milk itself and contaminated milk. Pasteurization doesn't guarantee safety, as even pasteurized milk can contain harmful bacteria like certain strains of E. coli. The root cause often lies in unsanitary conditions on the farm, not the raw milk itself. Choosing dairy products from reputable sources that prioritize hygiene is crucial. When produced under clean conditions, raw milk can offer various health benefits. Raw milk and cheese contain beneficial enzymes, including lactase, which aids lactose digestion. They also harbor probiotic bacteria that support gut and immune health. Studies have even shown that children consuming raw milk have a lower occurrence of asthma, allergies, and infections compared to those consuming pasteurized milk. Raw dairy products from grass-fed cows are particularly advantageous, boasting higher levels of essential minerals and beneficial compounds like conjugated linoleic acid (CLA), which can aid weight loss and reduce inflammation. Remember, thorough research and choosing a trustworthy source for grass-fed raw dairy products are paramount.
