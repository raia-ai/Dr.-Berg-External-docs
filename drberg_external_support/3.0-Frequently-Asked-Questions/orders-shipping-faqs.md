## FAQ 20: How should I get started with a ketogenic diet?

[**Home**](https://support.drberg.com/) **/** [**All Frequently Asked Questions**](https://support.drberg.com/faqs) **/** **Keto** **/** How should I get started with a ketogenic diet? To start the keto diet correctly, focus on shifting your body into ketosis, where it uses ketones instead of sugar for fuel. Cut out carbs and sugars, including grains, sweets, and most fruits. Limit eating to 1-2 meals a day to reduce insulin spikes and promote fat burning. Load up on low-carb vegetables, aiming for 7-10 cups daily. Consume moderate amounts of protein (3-8 oz per meal) from sources like meat, eggs, and cheese. Prioritize healthy fats like avocado and olive oil while avoiding unhealthy options like soy and corn oil. Consider incorporating intermittent fasting.

## FAQ 21: What is keto flu, and how can I alleviate its symptoms while adapting to a ketogenic diet?

[**Home**](https://support.drberg.com/) **/** [**All Frequently Asked Questions**](https://support.drberg.com/faqs) **/** **Keto** **/** What is keto flu, and how can I alleviate its symptoms while adapting to a ketogenic diet? As you transition from sugar burning to fat burning you may experience headaches, body aches, cravings, brain fog, fatigue, nausea, chills, or loss of appetite. These symptoms are called “keto flu.” This is usually due to low sodium. Keto does cause more sodium loss so you don’t want to consume too much water and not enough salt. Additionally, when cells are converting over and changing to a different type of fuel, they need certain nutrients, minerals, vitamins and electrolytes. Specifically, B vitamins and electrolytes are vital to support your body during and after this transition. Consuming these will help you to avoid keto flu symptoms. You can use nutritional yeast (non-fortified) for replenishing the B vitamins, and electrolyte powder for the sodium and other key electrolytes. For sodium, you can even use 1 tsp of Himalayan sea salt per day to restore minerals that have been lost. ![how-to-get-rid-of-keto-flu-drberg-on-keto-flu-symptoms-remedies](https://hls.drberg.com/migrated-assets%2Fhow-to-get-rid-of-keto-flu-drberg-on-keto-flu-symptoms-remedies/thumbnail_main.jpg)

## FAQ 22: What should I do if I experience sticky, tarry black stools while following a ketogenic diet?

[**Home**](https://support.drberg.com/) **/** [**All Frequently Asked Questions**](https://support.drberg.com/faqs) **/** **Keto** **/** What should I do if I experience sticky, tarry black stools while following a ketogenic diet? It’s unabsorbed fat. While you’re transitioning from running on sugar for many years to burning fat for fuel, your body needs time to adapt. You need to make more enzymes and bile to properly digest the fat. During this temporary transition time, you could end up with fatty stools, a condition called steatorrhea. You’re overloading the colon with more fat than it can handle. Here is a video where Dr. Berg explains the cause and what you can do:

## FAQ 39: What are normal blood sugar levels during intermittent fasting?

[**Home**](https://support.drberg.com/) **/** [**All Frequently Asked Questions**](https://support.drberg.com/faqs) **/** **Intermittent Fasting** **/** What are normal blood sugar levels during intermittent fasting? Typically, fasting blood sugar levels should be between 75 and 85 mg/dL. Levels between 100 and 125 mg/dL indicate prediabetes, while 126 mg/dL or above suggests diabetes. On a keto diet with intermittent fasting, your fasting blood sugar might drop to 50–70 mg/dL. While this can seem low, it’s normal if your body has adapted to using ketones for energy. The key is how you feel: if you’re energetic and well, this lower range is likely fine. If you experience symptoms like shakiness or dizziness, it might be a concern. If your blood sugar rises on keto, it could be due to insulin resistance. Regular exercise can help, and a HOMA-IR test can check for insulin resistance by measuring both fasting glucose and insulin levels. Your doctor may need to special order this test. ![what-is-normal-fasting-blood-sugar-levels-on-intermittent-fasting-drberg](https://hls.drberg.com/migrated-assets%2Fwhat-is-normal-fasting-blood-sugar-levels-on-intermittent-fasting-drberg/thumbnail_main.jpg)

## FAQ 41: What are the ways to reduce cholesterol levels while following a ketogenic diet?

[**Home**](https://support.drberg.com/) **/** [**All Frequently Asked Questions**](https://support.drberg.com/faqs) **/** **Keto** **/** What are the ways to reduce cholesterol levels while following a ketogenic diet? Managing Cholesterol on the Keto Diet Fat cells consist of triglycerides (fuel) and cholesterol (not fuel). Breaking down body fat can temporarily raise cholesterol levels. If cholesterol remains high on keto, liver issues might be hindering cholesterol processing. To help normalize cholesterol on the Healthy Keto® diet with intermittent fasting: 1\. **Eat plenty of vegetables** (at least 7 cups per day) 2\. **Take purified bile salts** 3\. **Take choline** 4\. **Take niacin (vitamin B3)** Keto naturally decreases liver fat, improves liver function, and increases bile production. For those with familial hypercholesterolemia, reducing carbs on keto may help, but some might need to lower fat intake. Consult your doctor for personalized advice. For more guidance, check out Dr. Eric Berg's keto videos on YouTube. ![how-to-lower-your-cholesterol-on-keto-ketogenic-diet](https://hls.drberg.com/migrated-assets%2Fhow-to-lower-your-cholesterol-on-keto-ketogenic-diet/thumbnail_main.jpg)

Experiencing coldness while following a ketogenic diet is a normal adaptation process as your body adjusts to a lower carbohydrate intake. During this transition, your core body temperature may decrease, which is a typical response to reduced food intake. To help mitigate this sensation, consider supplementing with vitamin B1 (thiamine), which may support your body's adaptation. Over time, as you continue with the diet, the feeling of coldness is likely to lessen. ![feeling-cold-on-keto-intermittent-fasting-drberg](https://hls.drberg.com/migrated-assets%2Ffeeling-cold-on-keto-intermittent-fasting-drberg/thumbnail_main.jpg)

## FAQ 43: Can I control where I lose fat?

[**Home**](https://support.drberg.com/) **/** [**All Frequently Asked Questions**](https://support.drberg.com/faqs) **/** **Weight Loss and Fitness** **/** Can I control where I lose fat? Many women begin to lose the weight on their upper half first and then the lower half. So, is it possible to control where fat-burning occurs? Take a look. When you begin losing weight, your body starts to go after the intraabdominal fat first. This is the fat around your midsection. Next, you begin to burn the subcutaneous fat on the upper part of your body. Finally, you lose the fat on your lower body—your hips and thighs. As a side note, the cellulite found on hips and thighs is only about 50% due to fat and 50% due to muscle atrophy. As you start losing fat in those areas, you also have to build muscle for the cellulite to go away. HIIT (high-intensity interval training) is great for toning up your body and losing weight. You also want to work on specific muscle groups, which can help if you have a personal trainer. Getting healthy and in-shape is about 85% dieting and 15% exercise. The healthy keto diet and intermittent fasting plan is by far the best way to get healthy and lose weight. It can take 6-8 months to really see results while losing weight. Be patient, and your body will thank you. ![can-women-control-their-weight-loss-weight-loss-tips-for-women-by-drberg](https://hls.drberg.com/migrated-assets%2Fcan-women-control-their-weight-loss-weight-loss-tips-for-women-by-drberg/thumbnail_main.jpg)

## FAQ 46: Can intermittent fasting cause fatigue?

[**Home**](https://support.drberg.com/) **/** [**All Frequently Asked Questions**](https://support.drberg.com/faqs) **/** **Intermittent Fasting** **/** Can intermittent fasting cause fatigue? There are two reasons why you may be getting more tired instead of getting more energy while fasting. Fasting is supposed to take you from burning sugar to burning fat. When you’re fully adapted to ketosis, you’ll likely feel good and have tons of energy. But, if you don’t feel that way, it could be that you’re not at full fat-burning capacity. It typically takes about 3-7 days to fully get into fat-burning. **How to get into fat-burning fast:** • Keep your carbs low (below 40g per day, or below 20g if you have severe insulin resistance) • Do fasting (1-2 meals a day) • Take MCT oil or exogenous ketones (if you have severe insulin resistance) In order for the ketones to be burned in the energy factory (the mitochondria), it needs helper nutrients (cofactors). You need a combination of B vitamins, and you need minerals. If you’re deficient in these going into the keto program, you may experience keto fatigue. In this case, it may be helpful to take nutritional yeast and a good mineral blend. ![i-thought-fasting-was-supposed-to-give-you-energy-tiredness-and-fatigue-on-fasting-drberg](https://hls.drberg.com/migrated-assets%2Fi-thought-fasting-was-supposed-to-give-you-energy-tiredness-and-fatigue-on-fasting-drberg/thumbnail_main.jpg)

## FAQ 49: How canI feed my child if he is a very picky eater?

[**Home**](https://support.drberg.com/) **/** [**All Frequently Asked Questions**](https://support.drberg.com/faqs) **/** **Nutrition Questions** **/** How canI feed my child if he is a very picky eater? If your child only consumes savory snacks, sugary cereals, french fries, mac and cheese, cheese sticks, frozen waffles, and packaged foods, and avoids vegetables, fish, and meats, then this video is for you! Picky eating is most often due to nutritional deficiencies. The best situation is to start your kids out on healthy, nutritious foods from birth to ensure no nutritional deficiencies. However, at a certain age, it is often very difficult to get your child to consume the right foods. **A zinc deficiency** is common among children. Zinc affects your child’s ability to smell and taste. Consuming refined carbs and sugars will create a zinc deficiency. **MSG and modified food starch affect your child’s appetite.** If they are consuming any of the foods I mentioned earlier, then they are likely consuming a lot of MSG and modified food starch. In turn, this increases appetite and insulin. Always avoid MSG. **If your child is lacking DHA or vitamin B1**, they are likely to have problems with their mood and behavior—especially anger. **If a child has enough B1**, they are going to be calm—they won’t feel restless, and they’ll have more self-control. **Refined carbs and sugars can create vitamin B1 and DHA deficiency.** You should find healthy keto substitutes for high-carb and high-sugar foods. Make the transition from unhealthy junk foods to healthy keto foods. Instead of telling your child that they can’t have those foods, find a healthy substitute. You can also get your child to make the recipes with you. My wife has done this with my children for many years, and this works great—they enjoy cooking healthy foods. ![is-your-kid-a-picky-eater-do-this](https://hls.drberg.com/migrated-assets%2Fis-your-kid-a-picky-eater-do-this/thumbnail_main.jpg)

If you have adrenal fatigue, you may notice symptoms such as: • Insomnia • Fatigue • Aches • Brain fog • Low tolerance/irritability • Breathing issues • Sinus congestion • Decreased libido • Dizziness when standing up The adrenal gland, known as the survival gland, helps the body cope with stress. Quick movements like standing up fast or walking upstairs can cause adrenal exhaustion. Exposure to news, media, physical trauma, and losses can trigger an adrenal crisis. For adrenal fatigue recovery, give your body some rest and go for a walk for instant relief. You can also perform Ragland's Blood Pressure Test for Adrenals: Lie down for several minutes and take your blood pressure. Then stand up and take it again. Normally, the systolic (top number) will rise by 6-10 points.

## FAQ 56: What’s an effective way to calculate macronutrients on a ketogenic diet?

[**Home**](https://support.drberg.com/) **/** [**All Frequently Asked Questions**](https://support.drberg.com/faqs) **/** **Keto** **/** What’s an effective way to calculate macronutrients on a ketogenic diet? Keto macros are typically 5% carbs, 20% proteins, and 75% fats. Intermittent fasting adds layers to this plan by reducing meal frequency, which naturally decreases calorie intake and increases nutrient retention. For example, if you consume 1,800 calories with three meals per day, you might consume 1,500 calories with two meals and 1,200 calories with one meal. As meal frequency decreases, your body becomes more efficient at absorbing nutrients, so you need less food overall. Vegetable intake should adjust with meal frequency: \- Three meals per day: 10 cups total (about 3.3 cups per meal) \- Two meals per day: 8 cups total (4 cups per meal) \- One meal per day: 7 cups total Keep carbs under 20 grams per day, regardless of meal frequency, though up to 30 grams is acceptable. Protein intake should be: \- 3-4 ounces per meal with three meals per day \- 5 ounces per meal with two meals per day \- 8 ounces with one meal per day Fat intake should be based on hunger: \- 140 grams per day for three meals \- 113 grams per day for two meals \- 86 grams per day for one meal Initially, you will need more dietary fat, but as you progress, your body will use its own fat stores. Adjust fat intake to maintain satiety without feeling overly full. Dr. Berg's meal plans incorporate these keto macro amounts. ![top-5-keto-macros-micronutrients-tips-drberg](https://hls.drberg.com/migrated-assets%2Ftop-5-keto-macros-micronutrients-tips-drberg/thumbnail_main.jpg)

## FAQ 58: Is the ketogenic diet safe for people with high cholesterol levels?

[**Home**](https://support.drberg.com/) **/** [**All Frequently Asked Questions**](https://support.drberg.com/faqs) **/** **Keto** **/** Is the ketogenic diet safe for people with high cholesterol levels? Yes. By doing the healthy version of keto, you can get into ketosis and start burning fat. There will be certain times when your cholesterol goes up and down. But as long as you keep your carbs low, you’ll have your cholesterol regulated. The fat cell is made up of triglycerides (which is used as fuel) and cholesterol (which can’t be used as fuel). If you have excess cholesterol, your body breaks it down with bile and dissolves it with an enzyme called lipase. If your cholesterol increases, it could be that your body is having a difficult time processing excess cholesterol due to liver damage. Fatty liver, scar tissue, inflammation, endotoxins can all cause liver problems. Not having a gallbladder can also cause high levels of cholesterol. Here’s what you can do to help normalize your cholesterol levels: * Consume plenty of vegetables (at least 7 cups per day) * Take bile salts * Use choline * Take niacin (vitamin B3) As you adapt to a Healthy Keto® diet, your cholesterol will naturally normalize on its own. Keto helps decrease liver fat, increase liver function, and increase bile production. So if you’re not already on keto, check out some of Dr. Berg’s keto videos to get started.

## FAQ 59: What could be causing frequent urination while on a keto diet?

[**Home**](https://support.drberg.com/) **/** [**All Frequently Asked Questions**](https://support.drberg.com/faqs) **/** **Keto** **/** What could be causing frequent urination while on a keto diet? What could be causing my frequent urination? A constant urge to urinate may stem from several underlying issues, including urinary tract infections (UTIs), elevated blood sugar levels, or kidney stones. If you suspect an enlarged prostate, adopting a Healthy Keto® diet can be beneficial. It is advisable to avoid dairy products and incorporate pumpkin seeds into your diet. For urinary tract infections, consider remedies such as D-mannose, Kohki tea, and pumpkin seeds, which may help alleviate symptoms. Transitioning to a low-carbohydrate diet like Healthy Keto, combined with intermittent fasting, can be crucial for effectively addressing urinary issues and promoting overall urinary health.

## FAQ 62: What are the key benefits of branched-chain amino acids?

[**Home**](https://support.drberg.com/) **/** [**All Frequently Asked Questions**](https://support.drberg.com/faqs) **/** **Natural Remedies** **/** What are the key benefits of branched-chain amino acids? Branched Chain Amino Acids are one group of amino acids, the building blocks of protein. They are used to build muscle—but it is a myth. There are no human studies to show that taking BCAAs will increase muscle synthesis; they also won’t prevent muscle loss. BCAAs may give you a little bit of energy while you are working out. But the body needs all 9 essential amino acids for recovery, repair, and regrowth of proteins. In other words, BCAAs are not providing you with the complete version of protein that you need. **Benefits** BCAAs may provide you with a bit of energy during a workout. **How to consume them** Consuming BCAAs before or after exercise when you are on a ketogenic diet (keto) and when you are doing intermittent fasting will spike insulin, but it would be a very small spike. The real question is WHY are you taking them in the first place? If you are taking them for recovery, then realize that those amino acids take several hours before they are turned into protein and you would be much better off taking B vitamins (nutritional yeast) and minerals (electrolytes), since they are the cofactors or helpers in the repair of muscles and the creation of muscle. If you are taking BCAAs to protect the muscles, realize that intermittent fasting, in general, will already give you a protein-sparing effect and it will protect you from the loss of protein in the body. Growth hormone will be spiked too, which helps with keeping your muscle mass. Autophagy will also occur, which is the recycling of proteins from the cells, thus reducing the need for taking extra protein. **Where to get it** You can get it at a supplement store or order it online. ![branched-chain-amino-acids-bcaa-do-not-make-muscle-drberg](https://hls.drberg.com/migrated-assets%2Fbranched-chain-amino-acids-bcaa-do-not-make-muscle-drberg/thumbnail_main.jpg)

## FAQ 63: What are the health benefits of COQ10?

[**Home**](https://support.drberg.com/) **/** [**All Frequently Asked Questions**](https://support.drberg.com/faqs) **/** **Natural Remedies** **/** What are the health benefits of COQ10? CoQ10 is found in every single cell in the body. It’s a very powerful antioxidant, but its main job is to stabilize membranes, especially in areas of your body where you’re generating a lot of energy. The membrane around the mitochondria (the energy factory) needs CoQ10. Lipoprotein membranes, as in HDL and LDL, also need CoQ10. When you’re generating a lot of energy, you’re also generating a lot of free radical damage and oxidation. CoQ10 helps to counter that. **Benefits:** 1. It can support the heart 2. It may be good for athletes, who generate a lot of oxidation 3. It may be good for people who have migraines or headaches 4. It may be good for people who have inflammation 5. It may be good for people who take a lot of medication 6. It could potentially help protect against cancer **How to consume it** Follow the directions on the label for the proper dosage. You should know that statins block CoQ10. Blocking this enzyme can create a lot of side effects, especially muscle damage. If you’re taking a statin, you may also want to take CoQ10. If you have any nutritional deficiencies, you may also be deficient in CoQ10 because they set you up for not creating CoQ10. If you have inflammatory conditions, you may also want to take CoQ10. **Where to get it** You can get it at a health food store or order it online. ![what-is-coq10-drberg-shares-coenzyme-coq10-benefits](https://hls.drberg.com/migrated-assets%2Fwhat-is-coq10-drberg-shares-coenzyme-coq10-benefits/thumbnail_main.jpg)

## FAQ 72: What are the claimed health benefits of using Himalayan sea salt versus conventional table salt?

[**Home**](https://support.drberg.com/) **/** [**All Frequently Asked Questions**](https://support.drberg.com/faqs) **/** **Natural Remedies** **/** What are the claimed health benefits of using Himalayan sea salt versus conventional table salt? Himalayan pink salt is a pink-hued variety of salt that is sourced near the Himalaya mountains of South Asia. Himalayan salt is believed by many to be a healthier alternative to common table salt, or sodium chloride. Though mined like rock salt, Himalayan pink salt is technically a sea salt. Himalayan salt is actually different from standard sea salt. Here’s why: Although both Himalayan salt and sea salt both have trace minerals, regular sea salt also has microplastics. One study found that 90% of sea salt products had small amounts of plastics. However, Himalayan salt has zero microplastics. Why? Himalayan salt is sourced from an ancient sea that existed before humans and pollution. **Benefits** 1. One of the best sources of sodium 2. Doesn’t have microplastics (small particles of plastic) in it Unrefined 3. Has 84 minerals and trace minerals 4. Unpolluted 5. Antimicrobial 6. Can help support healthy blood sugars 7. Can help prevent cramping on keto Its ionic minerals go into the lungs, where they are anti-inflammatory and antibacterial. This process helps support the adrenals, loosen mucus, and suppress a sensitive immune system. **How to consume it** You need around 1 to 2 tsp of Himalayan salt per day. This depends on your activity level. If you sweat a lot, it can increase your need for sodium. If you’re on keto, you want a bare minimum of 1 tsp of salt a day. This is because, as you lose fat, you also lose water weight and electrolytes. Salt is a vital electrolyte. **Where to get it** You can get it at a health food store or grocery store, or order it online. ![himalayan-salt-vssea-salt](https://hls.drberg.com/migrated-assets%2Fhimalayan-salt-vssea-salt/thumbnail_main.jpg)

## FAQ 73: Which foods should be avoided during the menstrual cycle?

[**Home**](https://support.drberg.com/) **/** [**All Frequently Asked Questions**](https://support.drberg.com/faqs) **/** **Nutrition Questions** **/** Which foods should be avoided during the menstrual cycle? I explain the relationship between dairy and your menstrual cycle. It comes down to the hormone estrogen in dairy. Many people already have too much estrogen; we’re swimming in a sea of it! A lot of pesticides and insecticides mimic estrogen. They’re called endocrine disruptors or estrogen disruptors. So if you already have excess estrogen, and you’re consuming a product with additional hormones because it’s meant for a growing calf, it can create some issues. Not only with the menstrual cycle but also your breast tissue, uterus, and ovaries. And you men, it can cause prostate issues too. Many people are lactose intolerant; they don’t have the enzyme to break down milk sugar, so they get digestive issues. Or they may have a casein allergy that’s causing digestive issues, particularly to either the A1 or A2 protein in casein. You may want to try cheese from a goat or a sheep, which has less A1 protein. During the menstrual cycle, it's beneficial to avoid dairy products due to their estrogen content. Dairy often contains additional hormones intended for calf growth, which can exacerbate existing estrogen levels in the body. This surplus of estrogen may contribute to issues with the menstrual cycle, as well as affect breast tissue, uterus, and ovaries. For those sensitive to dairy, lactose intolerance or allergies to casein (specifically A1 or A2 proteins) can also lead to digestive discomfort. Opting for dairy from goats or sheep, which typically have less A1 protein, or ensuring dairy comes from grass-fed or organic sources can mitigate these concerns. Additionally, considering the diet and living conditions of dairy cows can impact the quality and hormone content of milk, with organic and naturally bred cows often being preferable choices. ![dairy-menstrual-cycle-female-hormone-high-estrogen-foods-to-avoid-during-menstruation-drberg](https://hls.drberg.com/migrated-assets%2Fdairy-menstrual-cycle-female-hormone-high-estrogen-foods-to-avoid-during-menstruation-drberg/thumbnail_main.jpg)

## FAQ 74: What should I do if I can’t stick to keto because of intense cravings?

[**Home**](https://support.drberg.com/) **/** [**All Frequently Asked Questions**](https://support.drberg.com/faqs) **/** **Keto** **/** What should I do if I can’t stick to keto because of intense cravings? Many people fear they won’t be able to do a keto diet due to their intense cravings. Fortunately, keto and intermittent fasting can actually get rid of your cravings for good. High insulin lowers your blood sugar, causing you to have food cravings. Lowering insulin can help normalize blood sugars and prevent cravings from happening in the first place. Eating carbs triggers insulin, so a low-carb diet is key to preventing insulin spikes. Protein can also trigger insulin if you consume too much, so make sure only to consume a moderate amount of protein. Fat has zero effect on insulin, so it’s important to consume more fat with your meals. Make sure to also consume a large quantity of vegetables. When you go from sugar-burning to fat-burning, there is a transition phase that occurs before you become fully keto-adapted. Oftentimes, it takes 3 days to stop cravings for good. Electrolyte powder, B vitamins from nutritional yeast, and apple cider vinegar with each meal can help speed up this process. ![i-cant-do-keto-due-to-my-intense-extreme-cravings-drberg](https://hls.drberg.com/migrated-assets%2Fi-cant-do-keto-due-to-my-intense-extreme-cravings-drberg/thumbnail_main.jpg)

## FAQ 75: Am I going to gain weight on fruits and vegetables?

[**Home**](https://support.drberg.com/) **/** [**All Frequently Asked Questions**](https://support.drberg.com/faqs) **/** **Nutrition Questions** **/** Am I going to gain weight on fruits and vegetables? Weight gain from vegetables depends on amount and frequency. Leafy greens, like 7 cups of salad, have minimal carbs (3.8 grams net carbs) and won't significantly impact insulin. Any weight gain is likely due to bloating or fluid retention, not fat. If you experience digestive issues, reduce vegetable intake or address possible SIBO. Fruits can cause weight gain if consumed frequently in large amounts. Snacking on fruits regularly can increase weight, as seen from personal experience. Historically, wild fruits and vegetables had lower sugar and higher fiber content, making them less likely to contribute to weight gain. ![is-it-possible-to-gain-weight-on-fruits-and-vegetables-drberg](https://hls.drberg.com/migrated-assets%2Fis-it-possible-to-gain-weight-on-fruits-and-vegetables-drberg/thumbnail_main.jpg)

This idea involves avoiding extremes and consuming a balanced diet with reasonable amounts of various foods. However, some of the foods you are allowed to consume, even in moderation, can destroy your health. **Why eating everything in moderation doesn’t work for weight loss or creating a healthy body:** 1\. The carbs aren’t low enough (moderation is subjective) 2\. Many people have insulin resistance 3\. It doesn’t consider genetics 4\. It includes addictive foods 5\. It includes refined foods 6\.

## FAQ 77: What are some hidden causes of digestive issues that may lead to gastrointestinal discomfort or dysfunction?

[**Home**](https://support.drberg.com/) **/** [**All Frequently Asked Questions**](https://support.drberg.com/faqs) **/** **Symptoms, Conditions and Causes** **/** What are some hidden causes of digestive issues that may lead to gastrointestinal discomfort or dysfunction? Stress profoundly impacts digestion by promoting biofilm formation, damaging the gut lining, speeding up transit time, causing leaky gut, and disrupting the microbiome. Key stressors include emotional stress, antibiotics, and medical treatments. To mitigate these effects: 1\. Manage stress effectively. 2\. Consider L-glutamine for gut support. 3\. Use probiotics and fermented foods cautiously, adjusting as needed to a carnivore diet if bloating persists.

## FAQ 81: What strategies or treatments can effectively stimulate hair regrowth?

[**Home**](https://support.drberg.com/) **/** [**All Frequently Asked Questions**](https://support.drberg.com/faqs) **/** **Natural Remedies** **/** What strategies or treatments can effectively stimulate hair regrowth? Whether you’re losing hair, your hair is thinning, or you have alopecia—these tips for hair loss may help. Hair is protein, and protein is made of amino acids. Lysine is a specific amino acid that greatly impacts hair growth. Lysine also helps make hair stronger and more elastic. The best foods for hair growth are foods high in lysine, like red meat and eggs. Consuming six to eight ounces of high-quality protein twice a day will give you the protein you need. Many people experiencing hair loss are low in iron. Red meat and eggs are high in iron, and lysine helps increase iron absorption. When you go through stress, your body’s demand for lysine goes up. If stress is causing you to lose hair, you may want to try increasing your protein consumption. To regrow hair, it’s also crucial to lower your cortisol by reducing your stress. Inflammation or a malabsorption issue in your gut could lead to a deficiency in lysine. Consuming grains or seed oils can lead to inflammation. If you have gut inflammation, you may want to try the carnivore diet. It’s also important to support your gut microbiome because your gut microbes make amino acids. A disruption of your gut flora can cause a disruption in the microbes on your scalp. This can lead to issues like dandruff and skin disorders. A probiotic supplement or probiotic foods may help promote healthy, thick hair. A powerful form of testosterone called DHT has been known to cause hair thinning or hair loss. Zinc is a fantastic natural DHT inhibitor, and it’s in red meat. Lysine also helps inhibit DHT. Lysine is important to support a healthy body and has many other health benefits that may indirectly help with hair loss and support hair growth. Great natural remedies for hair loss are: • Pumpkin seed oil • Green tea extract • Stinging nettle root • Nutritional yeast ![how-to-regrow-your-hair-updated-vital-info-1080p](https://hls.drberg.com/migrated-assets%2Fhow-to-regrow-your-hair-updated-vital-info-1080p/thumbnail_main.jpg)

## FAQ 89: What type of exercise burns the most fat?

[**Home**](https://support.drberg.com/) **/** [**All Frequently Asked Questions**](https://support.drberg.com/faqs) **/** **Weight Loss and Fitness** **/** What type of exercise burns the most fat? HIIT exercises are high-intensity, short-duration exercises that produce a high spike in growth hormone and many other benefits. It also takes less time to do HIIT than other types of workouts. Typically, when you do HIIT, you’re doing it for about 30-60 seconds and resting 1-5 minutes. You do this 3-7 times per workout, and you might only do HIIT 1-3 times per week. Intensity is the key factor in exercise that stimulates muscle growth and growth hormone. But, if you don’t recover from the intense exercise, your results won’t be as good. Before you do HIIT, try my test to check your ability to recover. This can help tell you if you should do HIIT exercises. The recovery period is very important to pay attention to. You may even need to give yourself extra rest, especially when you first start out, to get your pulse rate down close to where it is in a resting state before starting another HIIT interval. **HIIT cautions:** • Don’t overtrain • Don’t do HIIT if you have injuries • Don’t do HIIT if you have poor recovery • Don’t do HIIT if you have heart problems **Great HIIT exercises:** • Plyometrics • Jump rope • Burpees • Kickboxing • Spin bike • Kettlebell • Bulgarian bag • Crossfit • Cross-country skiing • Push-ups/sit-ups • Jumping jacks • Mountain climbers **The #1 best HIIT exercise: \*\*\*Sprinting** **How to sprint to burn fat:** • Sprint as fast as you can • Sprint for a very short duration (15-30 seconds) • Rest for 2-4 minutes • Do 4-6 sprints in a workout • Do this twice per week

[**Home**](https://support.drberg.com/) **/** [**All Frequently Asked Questions**](https://support.drberg.com/faqs) **/** **Weight Loss and Fitness** **/** What are the best ways to get rid of a lower belly pouch? Many people do countless sit-ups thinking they will help, but they're still left with lower belly flab and looseness. **The best belly pooch workout is actually reverse sit-ups. Reverse sit-ups are done by repeatedly extending the back while in a standing position. This can help flatten the lower belly and tighten the muscles and skin.** To prevent lower back pain when starting reverse sit-ups, slowly increase the number of reps and the number of days you do this exercise each week. Make sure to really focus on tightening the butt muscles to help avoid lower back pain. Diet is just as important as exercise for a lower belly pooch. Do Healthy Keto and intermittent fasting, but focus on lowering your carbs down to 10 grams each day. This can really help target stubborn lower belly fat. It may also be helpful to cut down your fat intake until you achieve your desired fat loss.

## FAQ 95: What nutrient deficiency is linked to asthma?

[**Home**](https://support.drberg.com/) **/** [**All Frequently Asked Questions**](https://support.drberg.com/faqs) **/** **Symptoms, Conditions and Causes** **/** What nutrient deficiency is linked to asthma? A common nutrient deficiency associated with asthma is vitamin D deficiency. Symptoms of asthma include wheezing, shortness of breath, chest tightness, and coughing. Vitamin D deficiency may contribute to structural changes in lung tissue, affecting gas exchange, lung volume, and smooth muscle composition. In asthma, inflammation disrupts immune protection in the lung lining, involving T helper and T regulatory cells. Dysfunctions in these cells lead to immune overreaction and inflammation triggers. Vitamin D supplementation, at doses like 20,000 IUs of vitamin D3, may help reduce inflammation, remodel lung tissues, and enhance cortisol function in the lungs, potentially alleviating asthma symptoms.

## FAQ 96: Which supplement can assist with cataracts?

[**Home**](https://support.drberg.com/) **/** [**All Frequently Asked Questions**](https://support.drberg.com/faqs) **/** **Natural Remedies** **/** Which supplement can assist with cataracts? N-acetylcarnosine (NAC) is recognized for its potent antioxidant properties, which are beneficial in addressing glycation within the eye lens. The "C" component of NAC, carnosine, is particularly effective in this regard. The "N" component, acetyl, facilitates the delivery of carnosine into the eye, which can be challenging to achieve due to the lens's unique structure. When dealing with cataracts, targeting the affected tissue directly is crucial. NAC is an excellent choice for this purpose, as it can penetrate the lens effectively and address the opacity caused by advanced glycation end products (AGEs). However, it's important to note that there are different types of NAC available, and selecting the correct one is essential for optimal results. For detailed guidance on how to use NAC for cataracts, please refer to the comprehensive video I have created on this topic. While there are no guarantees, using NAC offers a promising approach to improving cataracts, especially when other methods have not yielded satisfactory results. Its ability to penetrate the lens and specifically target the glycation-related issues makes it a valuable option worth considering. ![the-1-ultimate-cure-for-cataracts-dr-berg-explains-1080p](https://hls.drberg.com/migrated-assets%2Fthe-1-ultimate-cure-for-cataracts-dr-berg-explains-1080p/thumbnail_main.jpg)

However, results can be misleading: * Control groups may not be ideal (e.g., compared to white bread). * Benefits may be short-lived. * Some studies on people with diabetes show no blood sugar improvement. * **Gluten Concerns:** Oats contain avenin, a type of gluten that can trigger inflammation in some individuals. * **Contamination Risks:** Oat products are often contaminated with glyphosate, a potential carcinogen. **Alternatives to Consider** * **Intermittent Fasting:** Skipping breakfast altogether offers potential health benefits. * **Eggs:** If you choose to eat breakfast, eggs are a highly nutritious, protein-rich option compared to oatmeal.

## FAQ 99: Can intermittent fasting be effective while following a high-carb diet?

[**Home**](https://support.drberg.com/) **/** [**All Frequently Asked Questions**](https://support.drberg.com/faqs) **/** **Intermittent Fasting** **/** Can intermittent fasting be effective while following a high-carb diet? Intermittent fasting can be problematic if you have hypoglycemia (low blood sugar). Without regular meals, your blood sugar drops, straining your brain and nervous system. This leads to feeling grouchy, moody, irritable, and other symptoms of low blood sugar. A safer approach is to adapt to a ketogenic diet first. This helps your body use ketones for energy. Then, gradually transition into intermittent fasting: * **Start with 3 meals, no snacks.** * **Slowly delay breakfast each day.** * **Aim to sustain energy between meals without your blood sugar crashing.** ![never-do-intermittent-fasting-on-high-carb-diet-drberg](https://hls.drberg.com/migrated-assets%2Fnever-do-intermittent-fasting-on-high-carb-diet-drberg/thumbnail_main.jpg)

## FAQ 100: What nutrient deficiencies are often linked to hypertension?

[**Home**](https://support.drberg.com/) **/** [**All Frequently Asked Questions**](https://support.drberg.com/faqs) **/** **Symptoms, Conditions and Causes** **/** What nutrient deficiencies are often linked to hypertension? **Normal blood pressure is 120/80. Research suggests a strong relationship between potassium deficiency and high blood pressure. Many people are deficient in potassium because the requirements are so high—4700 mg daily.** Potassium directly controls the tone of the vascular system. This directly affects blood pressure. Potassium also supports the endothelial layer of the arteries and helps improve insulin resistance. Potassium supplements often only contain 99 mg of potassium, which is incredibly low considering how much potassium you actually need. You can get potassium from salad, but you must consume around 7 to 10 cups daily. This also provides magnesium. The combination of potassium and magnesium can help reduce high blood pressure. Diets high in carbs and sugar cause you to lose potassium. Adrenaline and cortisol deplete potassium as well. To support healthy blood pressure levels, try increasing your salad intake. You can also look for a high-quality electrolyte powder that's high in potassium.

## FAQ 101: Does intermittent fasting increase the risk of early death?

[**Home**](https://support.drberg.com/) **/** [**All Frequently Asked Questions**](https://support.drberg.com/faqs) **/** **Intermittent Fasting** **/** Does intermittent fasting increase the risk of early death? Recent news headlines claiming fasting harms cardiovascular health should be taken with a grain of salt. The study behind these headlines was observational, relied on limited dietary recall, and was authored by someone with a history of controversial food-related findings. Extensive, peer-reviewed research indicates intermittent fasting offers significant cardiovascular benefits, including reduced body fat, improved insulin sensitivity, and healthier lipid profiles. Don't be misled by fear-mongering headlines about fasting and heart health. The study prompting these stories had significant limitations: it was observational (not directly testing cause-and-effect), used unreliable dietary recall data, and was authored by a researcher with a track record of disputed findings on red meat, eggs, and cholesterol. In contrast, here's what credible research demonstrates about intermittent fasting: * **Randomized study:** Prolonged time-restricted eating with resistance training reduced body fat and inflammation, improved blood sugar markers, and improved lipid profiles. * **Controlled clinical trial:** 18 hours of fasting significantly decreased waist circumference and cardiovascular risk factors. * **Multiple study reviews have shown that fasting consistently lowers** body weight, fat mass, blood pressure, cholesterol, triglycerides, and insulin levels. * **Specific to breast cancer survivors:** 16-hour fasting patterns significantly reduced cardiovascular risk.

## FAQ 108: What cognitive benefits does coffee provide?

[**Home**](https://support.drberg.com/) **/** [**All Frequently Asked Questions**](https://support.drberg.com/faqs) **/** **Natural Remedies** **/** What cognitive benefits does coffee provide? If you're a coffee enthusiast, you might be pleased to know that your daily brew offers more than just a morning boost. Coffee consumption is linked to cognitive benefits that enhance mental acuity and focus. Coffee’s primary cognitive advantage comes from caffeine’s ability to block adenosine, a neurotransmitter that induces sleepiness. This inhibition increases alertness and improves learning capabilities, enhancing reaction time, vigilance, and logical reasoning. Furthermore, regular coffee intake has been associated with reduced risks of neurodegenerative diseases. Studies suggest that drinking 3-5 cups of coffee daily during midlife may lower the risk of dementia and Alzheimer's disease by up to 65%. Additionally, higher coffee and caffeine consumption is linked to a significantly lower incidence of Parkinson's disease. Beyond caffeine, coffee contains antioxidants and anti-inflammatory compounds that may help prevent brain plaque buildup associated with Alzheimer’s. Caffeine is also found in various plants, so while coffee is a prominent source, you can obtain similar benefits from tea, chocolate, and some soft drinks in moderation. ![what-is-caffeine-how-does-it-works-drberg](https://hls.drberg.com/migrated-assets%2Fwhat-is-caffeine-how-does-it-works-drberg/thumbnail_main.jpg)

## FAQ 122: Why can a vitamin D deficiency lead to hair loss?

[**Home**](https://support.drberg.com/) **/** [**All Frequently Asked Questions**](https://support.drberg.com/faqs) **/** **Symptoms, Conditions and Causes** **/** Why can a vitamin D deficiency lead to hair loss? Vitamin D regulates many aspects of the hair growth cycle, promotes hair follicle health, and modulates sebaceous gland functions. Lack of adequate vitamin D can lead to disrupted hair follicle regeneration, thinning of hair, and excessive shedding. In addition, vitamin D deficiency can increase the risk of autoimmune responses and lead to the development of alopecia areata, an autoimmune hair disorder characterized by partial or complete loss of body hair.

## FAQ 123: What is resistance training, and how effective is it?

[**Home**](https://support.drberg.com/) **/** [**All Frequently Asked Questions**](https://support.drberg.com/faqs) **/** **Weight Loss and Fitness** **/** What is resistance training, and how effective is it? Resistance training, which involves using weights, resistance bands, or your own body weight to challenge your muscles, is crucial for muscle hypertrophy, the process of muscle growth. This type of training creates microscopic tears in your muscle fibers, which your body then repairs and rebuilds stronger during rest and recovery. When engaging in resistance training, focus on compound movements that work for multiple muscle groups simultaneously. These exercises are not only efficient but also stimulate a greater hormonal response, leading to enhanced muscle growth. Some effective compound exercises include: * Squats * Deadlifts * Bench Press * Overhead Press * Pull-Ups * Rows Incorporate these exercises into your training program, aiming for 3-4 sets of 8-12 repetitions per exercise. As you get stronger, progressively overload your muscles by increasing the weight, reps, or sets to continue challenging your body and promoting muscle growth.

## FAQ 125: What are the clear signs that I’m in ketosis?

[**Home**](https://support.drberg.com/) **/** [**All Frequently Asked Questions**](https://support.drberg.com/faqs) **/** **Keto** **/** What are the clear signs that I’m in ketosis? You can jumpstart ketosis by consuming coconut oil rich in medium-chain triglycerides (MCTs), strictly limiting your net carb intake to 20 grams per day, and practicing intermittent fasting to deplete blood sugar and glycogen stores. While testing your ketones initially can be helpful, long-term accuracy decreases as your body becomes more efficient at burning ketones. Fortunately, there are nine clear signs that indicate you’re in ketosis: Top Signs of Ketosis: 1\. **No keto transitioning symptoms** (like keto flu, fatigue, or rashes). 2\. **Weight loss** (initially from water weight). 3\. **Loose clothes around the waist**. 4\. **Increased energy**. 5\. **Boost in cognitive function**. 6\. **Less inflammation and pain**. 7\. **Feeling satisfied after eating**. 8\. **Better mood**. 9\. **Decreased appetite**. Types of Ketones: There are three types of ketones produced in the body: 1\. **Acetate**. 2\. **Acetoacetate**. 3\. **Beta-hydroxybutyrate**. Keto urine tests primarily detect acetoacetate but do not measure the other two forms. As you adapt to the keto diet, your body converts acetoacetate into beta-hydroxybutyrate, which means urine tests may not provide an accurate assessment of your ketone levels over time. For a more accurate measurement of beta-hydroxybutyrate, blood tests are available, though they can be costly. Instead of relying solely on testing, focus on the signs of ketosis: if you’re losing weight, feeling good, and noticing a reduction in waist size while keeping your carb intake at 20 grams or less, you’re likely in fat-burning mode. ![9-signs-of-ketosis-fixed](https://hls.drberg.com/migrated-assets%2F9-signs-of-ketosis-fixed/thumbnail_main.jpg)

## FAQ 126: What steps should I take to prepare for starting a keto diet?

[**Home**](https://support.drberg.com/) **/** [**All Frequently Asked Questions**](https://support.drberg.com/faqs) **/** **Keto** **/** What steps should I take to prepare for starting a keto diet? When starting the ketogenic diet, your body goes through a short transition period of about two to five days as it shifts from burning carbs to fat. To ease this process, especially during stressful times, consider the following preparation tips: Preparing for Keto: \- **Take MCT oil** to boost ketone production. \- **Remove junk food** from your home. \- **Avoid restaurants** without healthy options. \- **Meal plan and prep** to stay on track. \- **Keep keto-friendly snacks** on hand. You may experience symptoms like hunger and dizziness during adaptation, but sticking to the plan will help your body burn fat efficiently. Remember, ketosis is achieved by **reducing carbs**, not just increasing fat. Eating more fat can ease the transition, but you can lower fat intake once adapted. Preventing Keto Flu: To minimize discomfort: \- **Drink bulletproof coffee**. \- **Add more fat** to meals. \- **Use sea salt and electrolytes**. \- **Take B vitamins** (like nutritional yeast). The keto diet is generally safe for many, particularly those with obesity or type 2 diabetes. However, breastfeeding mothers should focus on nutrition rather than fasting, as deficiencies can harm both mother and baby. Health Awareness: Many people misjudge their health until they face issues. Recognizing early signs of health risks can help you use diets like keto as a preventive measure rather than just a reaction to problems. ![preparing-for-keto](https://hls.drberg.com/migrated-assets%2Fpreparing-for-keto/thumbnail_main.jpg)

We have a rigorous quality control process. Every bottle is weighed, and if there's any discrepancy from the expected weight, the bottle is removed from the line. Each capsule in that bottle is then individually inspected and weighed. We don't use fillers in our capsules, so some empty space within the capsule itself is normal and expected. However, there should not be significant variations in the amount of product between capsules. In rare cases, a small amount of powder might escape a capsule during shipping.
