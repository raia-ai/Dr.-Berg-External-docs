## What Is The First Cause Of Arterial Stiffness

# What is the first cause of arterial stiffness?

Unfortunately, heart attacks, strokes, and high blood pressure are common problems. So, today we’re going to talk about what causes arterial stiffness or calcified arteries. 

**Common causes of stiff arteries:** 

• Age

• Inflammation 

• A high-carb, high-sugar diet 

• Omega-6 fatty acids 

There is one additional cause of hardened arteries that many people are unaware of, and it’s a vitamin K2 deficiency.  Vitamin K2 drives calcium into the bones to help make them stronger and keeps calcium out of the arteries and the walls of the arteries. Vitamin K2 may decrease the risk of heart attack by 50 percent. 

 [See Video/Image/Document](https://hls-player.drberg.com/asset?path=migrated-assets/heart-attack)

## What Is The Overlooked Cause Of Artery Calcification

# What is the overlooked cause of artery calcification?

Lactic acidosis occurs as a byproduct of glucose metabolism. Both lactic acidosis and lactate in the blood are associated with various health issues, including:

• Heart attacks

• Thrombosis

• Panic attacks

• Autonomic nervous system dysfunction

• Bipolar disorder

• Schizophrenia

• Sepsis

• Arrhythmia problems

• Liver disease

• Diabetes

• Cancer

• Restless leg syndrome

Calcification in the arteries is not just caused by old age, consuming too much calcium, or even a vitamin K2 deficiency. It turns out that one cause of vascular calcification is hypoxia in the arteries. Hypoxia is a lack of oxygen, and this lack of oxygen in the arteries can be caused by lactic acidosis.

**The top causes of lactic acidosis:**

• A high-carb diet

• An overactive sympathetic dominance situation (chronic stress)

• Metformin

• Warfarin

• Statins

• Alcohol

• Overtraining

## What Is The Most Effective Remedy For The Prevention And Treatment Of  4Bd5B3

# What is the most effective remedy for the prevention and treatment of dental plaque and tartar accumulation?

Today, I’m going to show you how to make natural toothpaste to help eliminate tartar and prevent it from coming back.

Tartar is a calcified, pale, yellow, hard substance that accumulates on your teeth. It can lead to gingivitis as well as bad breath. Tartar is made up of a colony of bacteria that survives in something called a biofilm.

Biofilms contain bacteria, fungi, yeast, and candida. Tartar biofilms ferment carbohydrates in your mouth and release lactic acid, which can leach away your calcium and cause cavities.

Many ancient cultures used natural toothpaste, but these recipes were very abrasive and wore down the teeth.

This homemade toothpaste recipe is far more gentle yet still effective at removing plaque.

To make this toothpaste, combine the following ingredients:

•3 drops of either clove oil, peppermint oil, or cinnamon oil, or a pinch of turmeric powder

•¼ teaspoon hydrogen peroxide

•¼ teaspoon baking soda

•¼ teaspoon raw honey or manuka honey

•½ cup water

Mix these ingredients and brush your teeth with the mixture using a soft bristle toothbrush twice per day.

Vitamin K2 has also shown promising results in removing and preventing tartar buildup.

## What Is The Significance Of Vitamin K2 During Pregnancy And How Does I 40Eafa

# What is the significance of vitamin K2 during pregnancy, and how does it contribute to essential processes such as fetal development, maternal bone health, and overall nutritional balance?

Vitamin K2 is a fat-soluble vitamin that plays an important role in blood clotting, which lowers the risk of neonatal bleeding, also known as hemorrhagic disease. 

In addition, vitamin K2 regulates the deposition of calcium into bone and teeth, supporting skeletal development and strong bones.

## What Is The Difference Between Alpha Tocopheryl Succinate And D Alpha  B7C031

# What is the difference between alpha-tocopheryl succinate and d-alpha-tocopheryl succinate?

Alpha-tocopheryl succinate and d-alpha-tocopheryl succinate are different names for the same molecule. They are also called vitamin E succinate or alpha-tocopherol succinate. These forms of vitamin E are derived from alpha-tocopherol (regular vitamin E) by esterification with succinic acid. The "d-" prefix refers to the natural d-isomer form. Once ingested, alpha-tocopheryl succinate is metabolized and cleaved, or split, to release alpha-tocopherol. Alpha-tocopherol is the form of vitamin E with antioxidant properties.

## What Are The Most Effective Remedies For Addressing Dry And Wrinkled Skin

# What are the most effective remedies for addressing dry and wrinkled skin?

Say goodbye to dry, dehydrated skin! While most moisturizers contain alcohol, which can worsen dryness, there are natural solutions that truly nourish your skin.

Vitamin E, coconut oil, and tallow offer relief, but the champion of hydration is hyaluronic acid. This powerful molecule, naturally found in your body, holds an incredible 1000 times its weight in water, making it essential for youthful, supple skin. It even aids in wound repair and sunburn recovery.

Unfortunately, hyaluronic acid levels decline with age or due to certain conditions. But don't worry! You can replenish it through injections, topical application, or oral supplements. Just 200mg daily can make a noticeable difference in combating dryness and wrinkles.

For quick relief, apply a few drops of alcohol-free hyaluronic acid to damp skin, rubbing it gently into your hands and face. Remember, healthy skin starts from within. A balanced diet like the Healthy Keto® approach can further enhance your skin's radiance.

Say hello to hydrated, glowing skin with hyaluronic acid!

## Is The D Alpha Tocopheryl Succinate In Dim Supplement Estrogen Balance Safe

# Is the d-alpha tocopheryl succinate in DIM Supplement Estrogen Balance safe?

Yes, d-alpha tocopheryl succinate (alpha-tocopheryl succinate or vitamin E succinate) is safe to consume at recommended dosages. The safe upper limit for alpha-tocopherol (regular vitamin E) is 1000 mg/day for adults. Excessive amounts of vitamin E have been shown to have adverse effects.

A study of d-alpha tocopheryl succinate has shown promise in reducing cancer growth. More studies need to be performed to create conclusive therapeutic benefits. [https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12672706/](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12672706/)

Always consult a medical professional before starting a vitamin E supplement to determine the proper dosage for your unique needs.

## What Is Menopause And What Are The Causes For It

# What is menopause and what are the causes for it?

**Understanding Menopause and Your Body**

Your hypothalamus, a region in your brain, plays a key role in regulating your menstrual cycle. Around age 52, menopause occurs naturally as ovarian function declines, leading to a change in hormone levels. Your adrenal glands partially compensate for this shift.

Menopause can cause various symptoms, including:

- Hot flashes

- Night sweats

- Anxiety and mood changes

- Stress

- Muscle loss

- Potential bone density changes

**Supporting Your Well-being**

Taking care of your adrenals is an important way to potentially manage menopausal symptoms. This includes:

- Prioritizing quality sleep

- Managing stress levels

- Considering ways to support healthy cortisol balance

Additionally, your pituitary gland stores vitamin E, and levels may naturally decrease during menopause. A high-quality vitamin E complex might be helpful in reducing symptoms. Iodine from sea kelp could also offer support by potentially balancing estrogen levels.

**Liver Health Matters**

While supporting your adrenals is important, your liver also plays a crucial role in managing menopause. Your liver helps detoxify your body, including processing excess hormones. Liver function can naturally change with age.

To support your liver health, consider:

- Eating cruciferous vegetables (or supplementing with DIM)

- Exploring calcium D-glucarate supplementation

- Consulting a healthcare professional about potential detox options

- Discussing ways to support healthy liver circulation

## What Are Effective Strategies Or Treatments For Managing And Alleviati 62A35A

# What are effective strategies or treatments for managing and alleviating hot flashes?

Tocotrinols, that's a type of vitamin E works pretty good. I would do that if I were you, that would help you. And of course, there are other natural remedies that you can take. But really what's happening is you're just you're not getting this backup from the adrenal. The adrenals are a little bit weak. So if you support the adrenals, that will help you as well. (16:19) Sometimes iodine works. Sometimes vitamin E works. I would start with the vitamin E as in the form of tocotrinols.

## What Constitutes The Complex Framework Of An Antioxidant Network And H 218Ff3

# What constitutes the complex framework of an antioxidant network, and how do its components interact to neutralize oxidative stress?

A free radical is an atom with an unpaired electron and could create a lot of damage inside the body. While an antioxidant is an atom that has a paired electron, it's stable and balanced and it also donates one of its electrons to make the free radical stable.

**Examples of Free Radicals and Oxidants:**

• Iron – In some of the enriched food

• Radiation

• Sugar – Large quantities of sugar destroy the body

• Chemicals / Pollution / Smoking

• Vegetable Oils – It can act as an oxidant and create free radicals

**Antioxidants:**

• Vitamin E

• Vitamin C

• Zinc – Oysters, Seafood, Lobster

• Selenium – Brazil nuts

• Vitamin B1 – Leafy Greens

• Lipoic acid – it’s a fat-soluble and has the ability to penetrate into the cell and protect the cells at different locations

• Uric acid – help clean out damage from various things

## What Are The Potential Therapeutic Benefits Of Vitamin E Supplementati 126893

# What are the potential therapeutic benefits of vitamin E supplementation in the context of hepatic health and liver disease management?

There is a condition called NASH (non-alcoholic steatohepatitis), which is basically a fatty liver that has some inflammation. There have been many studies on using vitamin E for NASH.

Vitamin E has demonstrated significant improvement in:

1\. Steatosis (the fatty liver portion)

2\. Inflammation

3\. Ballooning of the liver cells (degeneration)

Essentially, vitamin E may have the power to reduce the fat, inflammation, and the death of the liver cells in adult patients with NASH that don’t have diabetes or cirrhosis. In one study, they used a natural version of only one part of the vitamin E complex. However, it may be beneficial to have the whole complex. They also used 800 IUs of this one part. Other studies have used up to 1000 IUs, while others only used 400 IUs. Between 800 and 1000 IUs may be the best idea.

Vitamin E may help stop the transition of going from having a fatty liver to an inflamed liver. It’s a very powerful antioxidant that may help calm free radicle damage, prevent inflammation, and prevent fibrosis.

Taking vitamin E alone may not change anything very much. But, changing the diet as well may make a more significant difference. The healthy keto diet with intermittent fasting may be the best way to go. Adding vitamin C in a food complex with choline may also be beneficial.

## What Are Antioxidants And Free Radicals And How Do They Interact Withi 21534E

# What are antioxidants and free radicals, and how do they interact within biological systems?

Atoms are composed of electrons, protons, and neutrons. Most atoms have paired electrons, but a free radical has unpaired electrons. This means that there’s an electron on one side, but not on the other side of the atom.

Free radicals cause damage to your cells in the DNA and the mitochondria because they cause oxidation.

**Sources of free radical damage include:**

Radiation

Chemicals

Hydrogen Peroxide

Free iron

Free copper

High amounts of sugar

In the body, iron and copper are usually bound to protein, but they wreak havoc when they are free.

So, what is an antioxidant? Antioxidants donate an electron to neutralize the damaging effects of free radicals.

**Antioxidants include:**

Vitamin C

Vitamin E

Alpha lipoic acid

Selenium compounds

Beta carotene

Coenzyme Q10

Antioxidant-rich foods include superfoods like leafy greens and cruciferous vegetables. Try avoiding the sources of free radical damage that cause oxidation, and focus on consuming foods high in antioxidants.

## What Is The Recommended Protocol For Managing And Treating Calcified P Cb26D9

# What is the recommended protocol for managing and treating calcified plaque in the arteries?

**What you could do for calcification in the arteries:**

1\. Allicin  This is a phytonutrient in garlic. There is some interesting research on the association of allicin and decreased artery calcification in animals. 

2\. Butyrate  This is a compound that the microbes in the gut make when you feed them fiber (vegetable fiber). It’s a type of fat, a small-chain fatty acid. Butyrate has been associated with a decreased risk of artery disease. 

3\. Lycopene  This is a phytonutrient in certain vegetables. There is some interesting data showing how lycopene can decrease the thickness of the wall of the arteries and decrease the stiffness. 

4\. Omega-3 fatty acids  You can find this in cod liver oil or fish oils. Omega-3 fatty acids may help decrease inflammation.

5\. GLA (gamma-linolenic acid)  This is a type of omega-6 fatty acid that is actually friendly to your arteries. A few examples would be borage oil, black currant seed oil, and evening primrose oil. GLA may help decrease inflammation, decrease the thickness of the arteries, and decrease plaque formation in the arteries. 

6\. Vitamin K2 (MK-7 version) You may want to consider consuming 300mcg of vitamin K2 every day. Vitamin K2 can activate a certain protein that inhibits calcium from forming in the arteries. 

7\. Tocotrienols  This is one form of the vitamin E complex. Tocotrienols can greatly decrease inflammation in the arteries. 

8\. Decrease insulin resistance  Do whatever you can to decrease and reverse insulin resistance. There is a direct relationship between having insulin resistance and having calcification in the arteries. A lot of these other remedies may not work unless you also fix insulin resistance. You can help fix insulin resistance by doing the healthy keto diet and intermittent fasting. 

**The most important combination:**

• Address insulin resistance 

• Tocotrienols 

• Vitamin K2 

• Allicin 

• Omega-3 fatty acids 

**Secondary**:

• Butyrate 

• Lycopene 

• GLA

## What Is The Most Effective Remedy For Clearing Plaque Buildup In The Arteries

# What is the most effective remedy for clearing plaque buildup in the arteries?

A clogged artery is an artery that’s filled with plaque. In many cases, when a person has clogged arteries, they also have stiff arteries, inflammation, and high blood pressure.

**Many people seek natural alternatives for clogged arteries because the common treatments often have side effects. Potential side effects of these treatments can include:**

• Myopathy

• Erectile dysfunction

• Low testosterone

• Neuropathy

• Dementia

• Hemorrhagic stroke

• Increased risk of cancer

The best natural remedy to unclog your arteries is called nattokinase. Nattokinase is an enzyme in natto (fermented soybeans). Fermented soybeans are also loaded with vitamin K2.

**Potential benefits of nattokinase:**

1\. It may help break up clots

2\. It may help clear up nasal polyps

3\. It may help decrease oxidized LDL

4\. It has anti-inflammatory properties

5\. It may help lower blood pressure

6\. It inhibits the thickening of the artery walls

7\. It may help increase HDL and lower triglycerides

8\. It may help decrease the risk of strokes

9\. It was shown to shrink plaquing in the aorta when combined with ginseng in animal studies

## What Causes Arterial Calcification To Occur Leading To A Bone Like Tra 314411

# What causes arterial calcification to occur, leading to a bone-like transformation, and what are the associated health implications?

The body becomes more calcified with age. But, our goal is to keep the bones calcified and the other tissues from becoming calcified. A CAC test is a great way to determine if you have calcium in your arteries.

There are two types of cells in your bones. Osteoblasts are cells that build bone, and osteoclasts break down bones. If there are too many osteoblasts in your arteries, the arteries can start turning to bone. There are stem cells in the inner tissue of the arteries that have the potential to turn into a certain type of cell, depending on what the body needs.

If someone is developing bone tissue in their arteries, there is a problem with the differentiation of these stem cells—they’re turning into the wrong thing. Sufficient amounts of vitamin K2 may help inhibit calcification. Vitamin K2 helps keep calcium out of the arteries and in the bones, making the bones strong. Your good bacteria make vitamin K2.

## What Is The Best Keto Food After Menopause

# What is the best keto food after menopause?

Most postmenopausal women go straight for the calcium supplements, like calcium carbonate, to build bone. But this is a mistake. This could potentially increase the risk of heart attacks.

The vitamin they may really need more of is vitamin K2. It’s also important not to go on a low- fat diet.

## Can Type 1 Diabetics Do Prolonged Fasts

# Can type 1 diabetics do prolonged fasts?

Dr. Berg Nutritionals staff, including Dr. Berg Advisors, do *not* encourage prolonged fasting. We are not healthcare professionals equipped with the tests and facilities to perform the necessary monitoring during a prolonged fast, nor do we have an individual's medical health records. Dr. Berg Advisors provide this document based on Dr. Berg's education for informational purposes only to those already on a prolonged fast or independently choosing to do one.

**Always consult with your healthcare provider before starting a prolonged fast.  If you're considering prolonged fasting, discussing the benefits and risks with your healthcare provider is essential.**

[Dr. Berg's Guidelines for Prolonged Fasting.docx](https://realdrberg-my.sharepoint.com/:w:/g/personal/shawnh_drberg_com/EazcZ9dNJ6VDhEOO13hV0F8BnVvc-Ge6y2mYjpN-FnojYg?e=RHdisz&clickparams=eyJBcHBOYW1lIjoiVGVhbXMtRGVza3RvcCIsIkFwcFZlcnNpb24iOiI1MC8yNDAzMzEwMTgxNyIsIkhhc0ZlZGVyYXRlZFVzZXIiOmZhbHNlfQ%3D%3D).

**The focus of type-1 diabetics is to keep their glucose level under control. This is important. However, it’s also important to keep an eye on your level of insulin. The number of carbs you eat determines the amount of insulin you need. So if you consume lots of carbs, you have to use a lot of insulin. Insulin takes excess glucose and starts to store it throughout the body.**

Taking too much insulin is just as bad as having too much glucose. Fasting will help lower the amount of insulin that you need. Many type-1 diabetics have something called double diabetes.

This is a situation where your pancreas isn’t able to produce insulin (type-1), and your cells are also resistant to insulin (type-2). This means that taking insulin doesn’t always work—your insulin receptors don’t absorb the insulin you inject.

Doing fasting and healthy keto helps prevent insulin resistance.

**While you fast, it’s important to also take nutrients, including:**

• Electrolytes

• B-vitamins

• Trace minerals

• Vitamin C

• Vitamin E

## Is Liver And Gallbladder Cleanse Effective

# Is liver and gallbladder cleanse effective?

Bile, produced by the liver, is essential for extracting fatty acids and fat-soluble vitamins (A, D, E, K1, K2) and preventing constipation. Liver damage, such as cirrhosis, hepatitis, or fatty liver, significantly impairs bile production and detoxification, causing toxin buildup.

Most liver and gallbladder cleanses are short-term solutions and do not address the underlying issues. The liver requires up to three years to regenerate fully. Effective long-term solutions involve dietary improvements and sustained lifestyle changes.

# What are the benefits and differences between the forms of Vitamin B1 - Thiamine, Allithiamine, and Benfotiamine?

Here is a breakdown of the benefits and differences between thiamine, allithiamine, and benfotiamine:

### **Thiamine (Vitamin B1):**

- **General Role**: Thiamine is a water-soluble vitamin essential for energy production, nerve function, and muscle contraction.

- **Absorption**: It is less bioavailable than fat-soluble forms like allithiamine and benfotiamine.

- **Deficiency Symptoms**: Fatigue, muscle weakness, nerve damage, and other related issues.

### **Allithiamine:**

- **Form**: A natural fat-soluble form of Vitamin B1.

- **Benefits**:

    - **Enhanced Absorption**: Better absorbed by the body than synthetic thiamine forms.

    - **Improved Cellular Function**: Facilitates essential functions like converting nutrients into energy and supporting muscle contraction.

    - **Nervous System Support**: Plays a role in nerve signaling and may aid in conditions related to nerve health.

    - **Mood Enhancement**: Adequate thiamine levels, especially in this bioavailable form, may contribute to better mood.

    - **Synergy with Magnesium**: Works effectively when combined with magnesium, enhancing thiamine's benefits.

- **Usefulness**: Ideal for individuals seeking a natural and more absorbable Vitamin B1 supplement.

### **Benfotiamine:**

- **Form**: A fat-soluble form of Vitamin B1, more readily absorbed and utilized by the body than water-soluble thiamine.

- **Benefits**:

    - **Neuroprotective Effects**: Supports nerve health by promoting myelin production and protecting nerve tissues from inflammation and damage.

    - **Anti-Inflammatory Properties**: Reduces the formation of advanced glycation end products (AGEs), which can cause inflammation, oxidative stress, and tissue damage.

    - **Chronic Disease Support**: May reduce the risk of conditions like diabetes, Alzheimer's disease, arthritis, and certain cancers by inhibiting AGEs.

    - **Cardiovascular and Cognitive Health**: Enhances cardiovascular health, cognitive function, and energy levels.

    - **Thiamine Deficiency Management**: Effective for individuals with conditions that inhibit thiamine absorption, such as alcohol dependency, diabetes, and gastrointestinal diseases.

### **Key Differences:**

- **Absorption**: Allithiamine and benfotiamine are fat-soluble and more bioavailable than water-soluble thiamine.

- **Targeted Benefits**:

    - Allithiamine focuses on general thiamine benefits with enhanced absorption and nervous system support.

    - Benfotiamine offers additional anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective properties, making it particularly beneficial for managing chronic conditions and protecting against AGEs-related damage.

## Why Doesnt Dr. Berg D3  K2 With Zinc And Mct Oil Contain Magnesium And 3E2Bae

# Why doesn't Dr. Berg D3 & K2 with Zinc and MCT Oil contain magnesium and Vitamin B6?

Our liquid D3 & K2 with Zinc and MCT oil is designed differently than our D3 & K2 capsules. The liquid format, using MCT oil as a base, is ideal for optimal absorption of fat-soluble vitamins like D3 and K2. However, this makes it challenging to incorporate water-soluble ingredients like magnesium and vitamin B6, which don't dissolve effectively in oil.

## What Brand Of Nattokinase Does Dr. Berg Recommend

# What brand of nattokinase does Dr. Berg recommend?

**Nattokinase: A Natural Enzyme for Cardiovascular Health** 

While Dr. Berg doesn't provide a brand recommendation or suggested usage amount for **Nattokinase**, this powerful enzyme, extracted from the fermented soy product natto, offers significant health benefits. If you're considering taking it, always ensure it's **non-GMO**. 

Nattokinase is renowned for its potent **blood clot-dissolving properties**. It works by dissolving **fibrin**, a key protein found in blood clots and arterial plaque, thereby improving circulation and potentially decreasing the risk of heart disease. It can also help to **lower blood pressure**. 

Beyond its cardiovascular benefits, nattokinase is effective at **dissolving mucus**, making it beneficial for treating conditions like sinus infections or mucus accumulation in the lungs. 

When combined with **pycnogenol**, which shares similar properties, nattokinase can act as a natural alternative to aspirin due to its anti-inflammatory effects. Together, they form a comprehensive remedy with very minimal side effects. 

Although you may not have been aware of nattokinase, its value for your health, particularly in unclogging arteries, is considerable. As an enzyme from natto (fermented soybeans), it also comes from a food rich in **Vitamin K2**, which is excellent for helping to pull calcium buildup out of the arteries. 

**Potential Benefits of Nattokinase:** 

Here are some of the key health benefits associated with nattokinase: 

1. May help **break up clots**. 

2. May help **clear up nasal polyps**. 

3. May help **decrease oxidized LDL** (bad cholesterol). 

4. Possesses **anti-inflammatory properties**. 

5. May help **lower blood pressure**. 

6. **Inhibits the thickening of artery walls**. 

7. May help **increase HDL** (good cholesterol) and **lower triglycerides**. 

8. May help **decrease the risk of strokes**. 

9. In animal studies, it was shown to **shrink plaque in the aorta** when combined with ginseng. 

Nattokinase may also be helpful for those with **endometriosis, pulmonary embolism, or cirrhosis**. Many individuals take nattokinase as a natural alternative to aspirin to help reduce the chance of stroke, as it may help get rid of clots and act as a natural blood thinner. 

**More Potential Health Benefits for the Heart and Brain:** 

- **Antithrombotic:** Helps prevent the formation of harmful blood clots. 

- **Antihypertensive:** Contributes to lowering blood pressure. 

- **Anticoagulation:** Helps thin the blood. 

- **Anti-atherosclerosis:** May help prevent the hardening and narrowing of arteries. 

- **Neuroprotective:** May offer protection to brain cells.  

**Best Practices for Buying Nattokinase:** 

When selecting a nattokinase supplement, prioritizing quality is essential due to its potent effects. Here’s what to look for: 

1. **Non-GMO Source:** As nattokinase is derived from soybeans, it's crucial to choose a product made from **non-GMO fermented soybeans** to avoid genetically modified ingredients. 

2. **Purity and Fillers:** Choose products with minimal fillers, binders, or artificial ingredients. A high-quality supplement will primarily contain nattokinase with possibly just the capsule material. 

3. **Third-Party Testing:** Look for brands that provide **third-party testing** for purity, potency, and absence of contaminants (like heavy metals). This ensures the product truly contains what it claims and is free from harmful substances.

## What Brand Of Vitamin E Tocotrienols Does Dr. Berg Recommend

# What brand of Vitamin E Tocotrienols does Dr. berg recommend?

When considering Vitamin E supplementation, it's important to understand the different forms and their unique benefits. 

**Understanding Tocopherols vs. Tocotrienols** 

Most people get sufficient **tocopherols** (alpha, beta, gamma, delta) through their diet, so supplementing with this form of Vitamin E isn't usually necessary. However, **tocotrienols** (alpha, beta, gamma, delta) are much harder to obtain from food sources and often where supplementation can be most beneficial. 

A key difference lies in their antioxidant power: tocotrienols are significantly more potent at neutralizing free radicals—up to 50 times faster than tocopherols. Vitamin E, as a whole, is a powerful lipid antioxidant, crucial for protecting the **cell membranes** throughout your body. Without adequate Vitamin E, these membranes can suffer various types of damage. Think of tocotrienols as incredibly fast-spinning antioxidants, efficiently cleaning up and neutralizing free radical damage. 

**Potential Benefits of Tocotrienols** 

The benefits associated with Vitamin E, particularly the tocotrienol forms, are extensive: 

- **Antioxidant Power:** They are highly effective at combating oxidative stress. 

- **Anti-Cancer Properties:** Research suggests potential anti-cancer effects. 

- **Cardioprotective:** They may help protect heart health. 

- **Liver-Protective:** Tocotrienols can support liver function. 

- **Cell Membrane Support:** They play a vital role in maintaining the integrity of cell membranes in your skin, brain, nervous system, and arteries. 

**Natural Sources of Tocotrienols** 

While harder to get, some dietary sources include: 

- Rice (though not typically consumed on a keto diet) 

- Palm oil 

- Annatto (considered one of the best and most potent sources) 

**Buying Vitamin E Tocotrienols** 

If you decide to supplement with Vitamin E, here's what to look for: 

- **Focus on Tocotrienols:** Since tocopherols are generally abundant in diet, prioritize supplements that feature **tocotrienols**. 

- **Source Matters:** Look for tocotrienol supplements derived from **annatto**. Annatto is often favored because it primarily contains delta- and gamma-tocotrienols, which are considered particularly beneficial and potent. Other sources like palm or rice can also be good. 

- **Check the Label for Specific Tocotrienols:** Ensure the product specifies which tocopherols (alpha, beta, gamma, delta) and tocotrienols (alpha, beta, gamma, delta) are included. Ideally, you want a product rich in the **gamma and delta tocotrienol** forms. 

- **"Full Spectrum" or "Mixed Tocotrienols":** Some products are labeled as "full spectrum" or "mixed tocotrienols," meaning they contain all four tocotrienol isomers. This can be beneficial for comprehensive support. 

- **Avoid Isolated Alpha-Tocopherol:** Be cautious of supplements that primarily contain high doses of isolated alpha-tocopherol, as this can sometimes interfere with the absorption and benefits of other Vitamin E forms, including tocotrienols. 

- **Quality and Purity:** As with any supplement, choose reputable brands that provide **third-party testing** for purity and potency. Look for certifications like GMP (Good Manufacturing Practice). 

- **No Fillers:** Check the "Other Ingredients" list to ensure there are no unnecessary fillers, artificial colors, or preservatives. 

While it can be beneficial to get the whole Vitamin E complex in supplement form (both tocopherols and tocotrienols), a common strategy is to ensure adequate tocopherol intake through diet and then specifically supplement with tocotrienols, ideally from a source like annatto.

## Why Does Dr. Berg Use Synthetic Ingredients Such As Vitamin K2 Mk 7

# Why does Dr. Berg use synthetic ingredients such as Vitamin K2 (MK-7)?

**Why Are Synthetic Ingredients Used in Dr. Berg’s Products?**

In the world of supplements, natural isn’t always better, and synthetic doesn’t mean unsafe or inferior. Synthetic ingredients are often chosen because they’re the only way to deliver precise, powerful, and proven results. Here’s why certain synthetic ingredients are used in Dr. Berg’s formulas:

**Vitamin K2 (MK-7, Trans Form)**

Bioactive and Stable: Synthetic MK-7 gives you the trans form—the biologically active version your body needs. Natural sources can contain unwanted cis forms that aren’t as effective.

Longer Shelf Life: Unlike fermented food sources (like natto), synthetic MK-7 is more stable and lasts longer, maintaining potency until you need it.

Pure and Precise: Every batch is carefully crafted to deliver the same clean, pure form—without the variability found in natural extracts.

Bottom Line: For precision, purity, and power, synthetic MK-7 ensures your body gets the exact form it can use—every time.

## How To Soften Dry And Wrinkled Skin

# How to soften dry and wrinkled skin?

Most moisturizers contain alcohol, which dries and dehydrates your skin. Your moisturizer also gets absorbed into your skin, then into your bloodstream and liver. There are many natural dry skin remedies that can help, such as vitamin E, coconut oil, and tallow, but the best remedy for dry skin is hyaluronic acid.

Many of your cells make hyaluronic acid, which is also found in your skin and joints. Hyaluronic acid holds 1000 times its weight in water and can keep your skin looking youthful. It’s intimately involved in wound repair and can repair skin after a sunburn. As we age, our hyaluronic acid decreases. There are also health conditions like progeria that cause you to lose hyaluronic acid.

Hyaluronic acid can be injected, used topically, or taken orally. When taken orally, 2.5% of hyaluronic acid is absorbed, which can be enough to replace what you lose as you age. To get rid of dry, wrinkled hands and skin, take 200 mg of hyaluronic acid daily. You can also use it topically. Look for hyaluronic acid without alcohol, wet your hands, and apply a couple of drops. Rub your hands together to apply. You can also do this to your face. Also, focus on internal health to get rid of dry skin. Try Healthy Keto® to keep your skin looking healthy.

## Do Chia Seeds Have Any Benefits

# Do chia seeds have any benefits?

Chia seeds have also been compared to eggs. An egg contains around 7 grams of protein, while chia seeds contain 4 grams. The protein found in eggs is the most bioavailable form of protein. Chia seeds contain vitamin E, vitamin C, B vitamins, calcium, phosphorus, potassium, and magnesium. Research suggests that chia seeds are cardioprotective, help lower blood pressure, benefit your brain, and can even help thin your blood. Chia seeds contain soluble fiber, which is the most significant benefit of consuming them.

The gel that forms when you mix chia seeds with liquid is an excellent food for your microbiome. Chia seeds can help with gut inflammation and constipation. They’re also very low in lectins. Chia seed gel contains polyphenols—plant chemicals that benefit your microbes. A healthy microbiome supports your mood, energy levels, and overall health. Consume chia seeds, fermented vegetables, sauerkraut, pickles, and kimchi regularly for a healthy microbiome.

\- Red, swollen gums can indicate a vitamin C deficiency.

\- Sodium deficiency may cause weakness and confusion.

\- Easy bruising may be linked to a lack of vitamin K1.

## What Strategies Can Help Address The Hardening Of Heart Walls Includin 3C94Fc

# What strategies can help address the hardening of heart walls, including lifestyle changes, dietary adjustments, and medical treatments?

**If anything could actually extend the longevity of your heart it's the combination of keto and intermittent fasting and doing it healthily. The heart muscle and the inside of the arteries of your heart respond best to vitamin E.** So you should get something called tocotrienols which will immediately help any type of inflammation going on in those areas of your body. Your heart also will carry more oxygen, the heart muscle itself if it has enough vitamin E.

If we're talking about hardening of the arteries, we want to keep things elastic. And with aging, of course, you have more hardening. So there's a couple of things that I would focus on. **First is consuming the high potassium diet on this keto. The potassium and magnesium are going to make your arteries more flexible for sure. And being on a low carb is going to reduce any type of inflammatory condition because it's really all about inflammation that the body then responds as a band-aid and make things really stiff.**

There's some other things you can do to support the heart. Vitamin B3, like niacin with that flush. Also make sure you get enough sleep. And then the one last thing I would recommend is that I wouldn't be afraid of fatty foods. I'd be afraid of carbs because the fatty foods you'll have a lot of vitamin K2 which can help to decalcify the arteries if there is calcium in it.

It's important to consult a healthcare provider before altering medications or diet plans. Newer anticoagulants allow for more flexibility in vitamin K intake, offering additional options for managing blood viscosity alongside medical guidance.

## Whats The Optimum Vegetable Daily Intake

# What's the optimum vegetable daily intake?

Eating enough vegetables and salads daily is crucial for meeting your nutritional needs and maintaining optimal health. But how much is enough? And what role do veggies play in nourishing our bodies?

As a nutrition expert, I've seen firsthand the incredible benefits of incorporating various vegetables into your daily diet. These nutrient-dense foods, from [leafy greens](https://www.drberg.com/blog/blood-thinners-and-leafy-green-vegetables) to colorful bell peppers, are the unsung heroes of a healthy lifestyle.

### **The Role of Vegetables in Nourishment**

Vegetables are nature's multivitamins, packed with essential vitamins, minerals, and other nutrients that keep our bodies functioning at their best. They're rich in fiber, which aids in digestion and helps maintain a healthy gut microbiome.

Eating various vegetables ensures you get a broad spectrum of nutrients, each vital in maintaining overall health. For example, leafy greens like spinach and [kale](https://www.drberg.com/blog/why-i-love-kale) are excellent sources of vitamin K, which supports [bone health](https://www.drberg.com/blog/7-ways-to-improve-bone-health) and proper blood clotting.

### **How Much Is Enough?**

The recommended daily amount of salad or vegetables is about 7 to 10 cups, with one cup of salad equivalent to one ounce. This may seem like a lot, but it's achievable when you make veggies the star of your meals and snacks.

Aim to fill half your plate with vegetables at each meal and incorporate them into snacks like carrot sticks with hummus or celery with nut butter. By prioritizing vegetables, you'll quickly reach your daily quota and reap the numerous health benefits they provide.

## What Does Microflora Consist Of And How Can I Support It

# What does microflora consist of and how can I support it?

The large intestine is home to a vast and diverse community of microorganisms, collectively known as the gut microbiota. These microbes play a crucial role in our overall health, and one of their primary functions is to ferment the fiber that our bodies cannot digest on their own.

The fiber passes through the small intestine largely undigested when we consume fiber-rich foods like fruits, vegetables, and whole grains.

Once it reaches the large intestine, the resident microbes get to work, fermenting the fiber and producing beneficial compounds like short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs).

These SCFAs, particularly butyrate, serve as an energy source for the cells lining the colon and have been shown to have anti-inflammatory and potentially cancer-preventive properties.

In addition to fermenting fiber, the large intestine is responsible for absorbing water, electrolytes, and some of the vitamins produced by the gut bacteria, such as vitamin K and certain B vitamins.

This process helps to maintain proper hydration and electrolyte balance in the body, while also ensuring that we benefit from the nutrients synthesized by our microbial allies.

## **From Digestion to Absorption**

The journey of food through our digestive tract is a complex and fascinating process, involving multiple organs working together to break down, absorb, and eliminate waste.

Let's take a closer look at how this process unfolds, from the moment we take a bite to the point where nutrients are absorbed and waste is formed.

## What Foods Are Most Effective For Supporting The Bodys Healing And Rep C5595A

# What foods are most effective for supporting the body's healing and repair processes, and how do their nutrients aid recovery?

Other types of protein, like eggs and salmon, are beneficial—but red meat is the best to support healing. Of all the things needed for the repair or healing process, amino acids are among the most important.

**Red meat is more bioavailable and is a more concentrated source of amino acids than other types of protein. It also contains more iron, magnesium, zinc, B vitamins, vitamin K, and omega-3 fatty acids than eggs.**

This doesn’t include processed meat from factory farms. It’s crucial to get high-quality grass-fed, grass-finished red meat.

**Red meat also contains four important additional nutrients for healing, repair, and recovery:**

1\. Carnitine

2\. Creatine

3\. Carnosine

4\. Coenzyme Q10

**People who have difficulty digesting red meat typically have low stomach acid. Even if you don’t like the taste of red meat, it may be because you have low stomach acid. Betaine hydrochloride may be beneficial to help strengthen your stomach acid. You can try taking three to five betaine hydrochloride supplements before a meal for about one month. However, if you tend to have excess iron, red meat may not be for you. Instead, you could try consuming more poultry or eggs.**

## Are Heart Healthy Whole Grains Safe To Consume

# Are heart healthy whole grains safe to consume?

The American Association of Cereal Chemists defines whole grains as “any mixture of bran, endosperm, and germ in proportions one would expect to see in an intact grain”.

**There are 3 parts of an intact grain:**

• Bran- outer layer containing fiber, trace minerals, and B-vitamins

• Germ- B vitamins, vitamin E, trace minerals, phytonutrients, healthy fats

• Endosperm- All of the carbohydrates and a few B-vitamins

According to the FDA, all you need is 51% of these three elements to call a product whole grain. This means that the other 49% could be refined grains, sugars, sweeteners, or other additives.

Refined grains are made by removing the bran and the germ, leaving only the endosperm. There aren’t many vitamins in the endosperm, so the grains are typically enriched with synthetic vitamins and iron. Whether something is made from whole grains or refined grains, it’s still very high on the glycemic index and unfit for a ketogenic diet. The American Association of Cereal Chemists expanded their definition of whole grains to include grains that have been ground. When you grind whole grains, the grinding process exposes them to oxygen, which destroys vitamin E, part of the vitamin B complex, and many of the phytonutrients and healthy fats. Ground grains are more susceptible to going rancid when they’re exposed to air and other things like mold, so chemicals are added to the grains to preserve them.

## What Approaches Can Be Utilized To Enhance The Levels Of Glutathione I E80864

# What approaches can be utilized to enhance the levels of glutathione in the body?

Glutathione is the most abundant antioxidant in the liver, but all of the cells make it. It reduces oxidative stress. Glutathione can help neutralize toxins that your body actually makes for various things. Glutathione also helps maintain exogenous antioxidants like vitamin C, and vitamin E. It not only acts as an antioxidant, but it also helps in detoxification. Because glutathione is sulfur, when you eat certain foods high in sulfur, you will give your body the raw material it needs to make more glutathione.

**How to boost glutathione naturally:**

• Sulfur-based vegetables (cruciferous vegetables)

• Vitamin C

• Selenium

• Milk thistle

• Fasting

**What decreases glutathione?**

• Alcohol

• Stress

• Age

• Drugs

• Toxins

## What Are The Most Effective Methods For Diminishing Acne Scars

# What are the most effective methods for diminishing acne scars?

If you have scarring from acne, one of the best things you can do is to use vitamin E oil.

When using vitamin E oil for acne scars on your face, you may want to use an organic, hexane-free version of vitamin E oil. Vitamin E can have a significant effect on fibrosis. It may actually help break down scar tissue.

Benefits of vitamin E for the skin:

- It’s a powerful antioxidant

- It’s fat-soluble (it goes into the skin)

- It’s an anti-inflammatory

- It can help break down scar tissue

- It can help with certain wrinkles

To use vitamin E oil for your skin, rub it into the skin for about one or two minutes right before you go to bed every night. Do it for about two or three weeks.

To kick things up a notch, you may want to combine the use of vitamin E oil with the Healthy Keto® diet, intermittent fasting, and periodic prolonged fasting. This combination might give you even better results because consuming a lot of carbs and frequent eating can block the effect of vitamin E and can make the skin age faster.

When you do fasting, especially prolonged fasting, your body goes through autophagy, which is a fantastic anti-aging action. You may want to do prolonged fasting once every two weeks or once a month for at least 72 hours.

## What Are The Most Important Benefits Of Eggs

# What are the most important benefits of eggs?

Eggs are the content of the hard-shelled reproductive body produced by a bird, considered as food. Eggs and the nutrition in them are necessary in your diet, especially if you are choosing to change your health for the better and lose weight. Many people consider that they are the best source of protein.

**Benefits**

- Have the highest anabolic effect

- Are very high in nutrients

- Are loaded with healthy fats

- Contain lutein and zeaxanthin, very powerful phytonutrients (healthy substances found in plants), and antioxidants to repair any potential damage that occurs in the artery walls of the eyes

- Help prevent gallstones

**Nutrients in egg yolks**

- Choline

- Selenium

- Biotin

- Vitamins A, B12, D, E and K2

- Phosphorus

- Omega-3 fatty acids

- Calcium

- Immunoglobulins

**Nutrients in egg whites**

- Most of the egg protein

- Avidin

- Vitamins B2 & B3

- Magnesium

- Potassium

**Eggs and cholesterol**

Are eggs bad for your cholesterol? If you’re afraid of eggs increasing your cholesterol, keep in mind that there’s no evidence to support the idea that eggs raise your bad cholesterol. They can raise your good cholesterol, which isn’t bad for your heart.

Also keep in mind that when you consume cholesterol, your body simply makes less of it (it works the opposite way too). In fact, only around 25% of your cholesterol comes from your diet— your body makes the other 75%. And you need cholesterol for your brain, cells, membranes and hormone production.

**How to consume them**

It is best to consume both egg yolk and egg white.

The best way to preserve the vital nutrients in your eggs is to cook them in ways that leave a runny yolk. The less you heat the yolk, the more nutrients it contains. Try not to overcook hard- boiled eggs. If you scramble your eggs, try not to cook them too much. The problem with raw eggs is that the uncooked egg whites can deplete other nutrients like biotin. So always cook the whites, but leave the yolks runny.

**Where to get them**

Always go with farm-raised and organic eggs. When you crack open an egg and see that it has a dark orange egg yolk, it’s a sign that it’s an egg from a pasture-raised chicken. Organic, pasture-raised chickens eat natural grass and insects. This means you won’t be consuming GMOs. There are no bad effects when you consume organic pasture-raised eggs, so don’t be afraid to use them on a regular basis.

Factory-farmed eggs are a pale yellow color. These chickens consume GMO grains, which
are not recommended. Sometimes pasture-raised organic eggs can have a yellow egg yolk, but they won’t be pale. Pasture-raised organic eggs have more carotenoids, which are plant-based antioxidants that have a wide range of benefits. If you are developing vision problems as you age, you are especially going to want to consume pasture-raised eggs. Carotenoids can help you avoid macular degeneration.

Keep in mind that when you see the term “cage-free” this doesn’t mean these are necessarily better eggs. The chickens could be kept in a large barn with no sunlight. And these eggs are often not non-GMO.

## What Are The Common Causes Of Nosebleeds

# What are the common causes of nosebleeds?

Nosebleeds can give a lot of concern if you don’t know their cause and remedies. Consuming nutrients that support blood clotting can greatly help.

**Cause #1: Low vitamin K1**

Vitamin K1 is very important for your body. It has to do with blood clotting, and functions to stop you from bleeding. If you are deficient in K1, this can result in nosebleeds. Certain medications that have warfarin (chemical) can block vitamin K1.

**Cause #2: Sinus irritation**

Having an allergy, virus or infection can cause irritation of certain membranes (cell layers) in the sinus. This can cause bleeding from the nose.

**Cause #3: Low platelets**

Platelets are blood-clotters that flow through your blood. If you have a nutrient deficiency or some kind of liver disease, like cirrhosis or fatty liver, this condition can cause insufficient amounts of platelets to be produced by your body.

## What Are The Nutritional Benefits Of Cauliflower

# What are the nutritional benefits of cauliflower?

Cauliflower is a cruciferous vegetable that is naturally high in fiber and B vitamins. It is low in carbs and tastes something like potato. It feels like a starchy food but it doesn’t have starch.

**Benefits**

A great keto alternative to rice, pizza crust, mashed potatoes, tortilla, and mac and cheese

1. High in vitamin C

2. Contains choline (liver support)

3. Rich in nutrients

    - vitamin K1

    - vitamin B1

    - vitamin B2

    - vitamin B3

    - vitamin B5

    - folate

    - manganese

    - magnesium

    - potassium

    - trace minerals

4. Rich in phytonutrients (healthy substances found in plants):

5. sulforaphanes

6. glucosinolates

7. carotenoids

8. flavonoids

9. Contains DIM

    - balances estrogen ratios

    - supports natural detoxification

10. Low in carbs

**How to consume it**

You can eat it raw with dip or include it in your salad. Or cook it in a dozen ways.

There are many ways to prepare cauliflower. One favorite is to make it into pizza crust. Or you can find pre-made cauliflower crusts at the grocery store. Just be sure to check the label because sometimes the manufacturers slip in the ingredients like tapioca starch, dextrin and other things that aren’t keto-friendly.

Then there’s cauliflower rice. Nowadays you can find it at any grocery store because it’s become a mainstream product. It tastes almost identical to rice but without the starch.

Keep in mind that the longer you cook cauliflower, the more you destroy its nutrients. 3 minutes of boiling, for example, equals ten minutes of steaming. So steam it for just 5 minutes. Sauteing it is another recommended method. Ultimately, even if you cook it for a relatively long time, you still get the benefits of cauliflower’s low carbs and its fiber.

**Where to get it**

You can get it at any grocery store.

## What Are The Potential Causes Of Red Skin Spots

# What are the potential causes of red skin spots?

When you have poor blood clotting you may have red, pink or purple spots on your skin. Let’s look at the known remedies for this condition.

Vitamin K1 and C are very important for a healthy flow of blood through your body. Low levels of vitamin K1 can cause poor blood clotting. If you have low vitamin C, then you may have impaired capillary strength. As a result you can have red, pink or purple spots.

**Cause #2: Poor digestion of the above vitamins**

If you have gallbladder or liver issues, they can cause difficulties in digesting the above vitamins. If you consume enough vitamins from the above sources but the condition doesn’t resolve, it could be due to poor digestion and lack of bile.

## Can I Consume Olives On A Ketogenic Diet

Yes you can.

Features of olives:

## Can I Eat Cauliflower On Keto

# Can I eat cauliflower on Keto?

What’s cool about cauliflower is that its low carb, and it tastes like a potato! It seems like a starchy food but without the starch. One cup has 2.6 grams of carbs, but 1.4 grams of fiber makes it a net carb amount of 1.2 grams.

Besides being low carb, cauliflower has a lot of vitamins, especially B vitamins and vitamin C, vitamin E, and vitamin K1. It also has many minerals and trace minerals, especially manganese which is a great antioxidant. But that’s not all. Cauliflower has some serious amounts of phytonutrients (as do all cruciferous vegetables). Phytonutrients act as specialized antioxidants that help with turning certain genes on and off, as well as the maintenance of your DNA.

Keep in mind that the longer you cook cauliflower, the more you destroy its nutrients. 3 minutes of boiling, for example, equals ten minutes of steaming. So steam it for just 5 minutes; but, the way I recommend is to saute it. Ultimately, even if you cook it for a relatively long time, you still get the benefits of cauliflower being a low-carb food along with its fiber. Sometimes when I go to a restaurant I find they have the entire head of cauliflower roasted with cheese on it! And I pretty much eat the whole thing. Cauliflower truly is the ultimate keto food!
