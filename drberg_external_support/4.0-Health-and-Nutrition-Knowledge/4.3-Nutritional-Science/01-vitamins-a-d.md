## What Is The Nutritional Deficiency Behind Aging Spots

# What is the nutritional deficiency behind aging spots?

**Understanding Age Spots: Causes and Natural Remedies**

Though sometimes called "liver spots", these common marks of aging affect nearly 90% of people over 60 and are unrelated to liver function. Instead, they're caused by an accumulation of melanin, the pigment responsible for our skin, hair, and eye color.

Melanin plays a vital role in protecting us from UV radiation - the same radiation we need for vitamin D production. However, excessive UV exposure can lead to oxidative stress at the cellular level, triggering increased melanin production and hyperpigmentation (age spots). Hormonal fluctuations, diabetes, inflammation, certain medications, and stress can also contribute to this process.

Fortunately, nature offers solutions. Research and even patents for age spot treatments point to the power of natural ingredients like vitamin C, grape seed extract, zinc, licorice extract, and berries.

Zinc, in particular, stands out for its multifaceted benefits for skin health. As a key player in hundreds of enzyme reactions and biochemical pathways, zinc acts as a powerful antioxidant, helping to neutralize oxidative stress and naturally reduce excess melanin production.

When combined with selenium, a mineral essential for producing the potent antioxidant glutathione, zinc can be even more effective in combating age spots. Both zinc and selenium also offer crucial protection for our DNA.

Consider incorporating these minerals into your routine through topical creams containing zinc and selenium or by taking a supplement that combines them with other beneficial trace minerals. Remember, healthy, vibrant skin is achievable with the help of nature's remedies.

## What Is One Of The Causes For Peripheral Neuropathy

# What is one of the causes for peripheral neuropathy?

**Struggling with nerve problems like peripheral neuropathy? The culprit might be a vitamin B1 deficiency!**

Vitamin B1 plays a critical role in nerve health, and not getting enough can lead to a range of symptoms including:

- **Nerve pain** (like sciatica)

- **Tremors**

- **Anxiety, ADHD, ADD, OCD, and even psychosis**

- **Racing mind or insomnia**

- **Restless legs syndrome**

- **Air hunger**

- **Burning or numbness in the feet or hands**

- **Problems with the autonomic nervous system**

- **Vertigo**

- **Vision problems**

**What causes a Vitamin B1 deficiency?** Several factors can contribute, including:

- **Alcohol consumption**

- **A diet high in refined carbohydrates**

- **Diabetes**

- **Chronic stress**

- **Regular consumption of caffeinated tea**

- **Eating raw fish**

- **Sulfites**

- **Phytic acid**

- **Antibiotic use**

The good news is that vitamin B1 is one of the best vitamins for nerve repair. To ensure you're getting enough, focus on natural sources like nutritional yeast. You can sprinkle it on food or take it as a supplement.

**Remember:** If you suspect a vitamin deficiency, consult your doctor for proper diagnosis and treatment.

## What Is A Potential Danger With Vitamin D

# What is a potential danger with Vitamin D?

**Vitamin D: Unraveling the Misconceptions**

There's a lot of confusion surrounding vitamin D. It's crucial to remember that blood levels of vitamin D don't necessarily reflect the amount inside your cells. Additionally, relying solely on food for sufficient vitamin D is unrealistic.

**Two Distinct Vitamin D Systems**

Vitamin D plays a complex role in your body. While one system regulates calcium and bone health, another governs non-calcium functions, including immune response, prostate health, skin, gut, brain, and muscle health. Surprisingly, only a tiny fraction of vitamin D from your blood enters this second system.

**Research Focus: Calcium and Bone Health**

Most vitamin D research centers on calcium and bone health, often recommending only 600-800 IU per day. This amount might suffice for bone health but may fall short in supporting other critical bodily functions.

**Barriers to Vitamin D Absorption**

Several factors can impede vitamin D absorption, including:

- Air pollution

- Sunscreen use and sun avoidance

- Gut inflammation

- Magnesium deficiency

- Genetic predispositions

- Latitude, altitude, and seasonality

- Aging

- Insulin resistance

- Low cholesterol levels

- Absence of gallbladder

**Optimal Vitamin D Intake**

For a healthy individual, aiming for around 10,000 IU of vitamin D3 per day is generally recommended. If you have existing health conditions, you might need even higher amounts. Consulting with a healthcare professional is essential to determine your ideal vitamin D intake.

**Key Takeaways:**

- Blood levels of vitamin D aren't the only indicator of your true vitamin D status.

- Obtaining enough vitamin D through diet alone is challenging.

- Vitamin D's role extends beyond calcium and bone health.

- Numerous factors can hinder vitamin D absorption.

- A healthy person likely needs around 10,000 IU of vitamin D3 per day.

Remember, vitamin D is vital for overall health and well-being. Stay informed and work with a healthcare provider to optimize your vitamin D levels.

## Can Dr. Berg Recommend A Brand For Lutein And Zeaxanthin

# Can Dr. Berg recommend a brand for Lutein and Zeaxanthin?

**Dr.Berg does not provide a brand recommendation for Lutein and Zeaxanthin.**  

**Supporting Eye Health: Lutein, Zeaxanthin, and Beyond** 

**Contrast sensitivity loss**, an often-overlooked eye problem, can significantly impact vision, particularly in low light, by hindering the ability to differentiate shades of gray. Fortunately, proactive measures and targeted nutrients can help. 

**Carotenoids** like lutein and zeaxanthin are powerful antioxidants that serve as a natural defense system for your eyes. They protect against damage from blue light, environmental chemicals, and complications related to diabetes. As we age, our natural carotenoid levels decline, reducing this crucial protection. While full-spectrum light offers some benefits, it's not a complete solution. 

**Enhancing Retinal Efficiency and Boosting Carotenoids** 

To improve eyesight and enhance retinal efficiency, consider these strategies: 

- **Sunlight Exposure:** Sunlight is vital for overall eye and retinal health. It allows beneficial UV and infrared light into the eye and can help stimulate the eye's natural melatonin production. 

- **Dietary Carotenoids:** Increase your intake of foods rich in lutein and zeaxanthin, such as **egg yolks**. Other excellent sources include leafy green vegetables (spinach, kale), corn, and orange bell peppers. 

**Supplementing for Optimal Eye Health** 

If you opt for **lutein and zeaxanthin supplements**, look for products that provide at least **10 mg of lutein and 2 mg of zeaxanthin** per serving. Research indicates that consistent supplementation with these amounts for 12 weeks can lead to significant improvements in conditions like **macular degeneration** and **contrast sensitivity loss**. 

**Holistic Approaches to Eye Wellness** 

Beyond specific nutrients, a holistic approach to diet and lifestyle plays a crucial role in eye health: 

- **Ancestral Diet & Seed Oils:** As emphasized by Ophthalmologist Dr. Chris Knobbe, removing inflammatory **seed oils** from your diet and adopting an ancestral eating pattern can greatly benefit eyesight. 

- **Omega-3 Fatty Acids:** Incorporate **fatty fish** like salmon, rich in omega-3s, which support overall eye health and help reduce inflammation. **DHA**, a vital omega-3 for both brain and retinal health, is readily available in fish oil and cod liver oil. 

- **Vitamin D:** This vitamin is critical for every part of the eye and may help manage conditions such as **glaucoma, macular degeneration, and retinopathy**. Aim for at least **10,000 IU of vitamin D daily**. (Note: Dr. Berg's Vitamin D3 & K2 products contain MCT oil and ox bile and do not need to be taken with fats.) 

- **Vitamin A:** Essential for healthy vision, particularly **night vision**. 

- **Zinc:** This mineral also plays a supportive role in overall eye health. 

**#1 Deficiency Behind POOR EYESIGHT** 

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oXhOK2880i8&t=85s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oXhOK2880i8&t=85s) 

**Guidance for Purchasing Lutein and Zeaxanthin Supplements:** 

Since Dr. Berg does not provide a brand recommendation, here's what to look for to ensure you're getting a high-quality Lutein and Zeaxanthin supplement: 

1. **Specific Forms:** Look for **"Lutein"** and **"Zeaxanthin"** on the label.  

2. **Dosage:** Confirm the supplement provides at least **10 mg of Lutein and 2 mg of Zeaxanthin** per serving. Higher concentrations are also available and may be beneficial depending on individual needs. 

3. **Third-Party Testing:** This is crucial. Choose brands that perform and publicly share results from third-party testing for purity, potency, and absence of contaminants (e.g., heavy metals, pesticides). Look for certifications from organizations like NSF International, USP, or ConsumerLab.com. 

4. **"Other Ingredients" and Fillers:** Opt for supplements with minimal and clean "other ingredients." Avoid unnecessary artificial colors, flavors, sweeteners, or excessive fillers. 

5. **Reputation and Transparency:** Select well-established brands with a strong reputation for quality and transparent manufacturing practices. Check their website for information on sourcing and testing. 

6. **Absorption Aids:** Some formulations might include healthy fats (like olive oil or sunflower oil) to enhance the absorption of these fat-soluble carotenoids. 

7. **Organic** – Check to see if the company offers an organic product.  

Always consult with a healthcare professional or ophthalmologist before starting any new supplement regimen, especially if you have pre-existing eye conditions or are taking other medications.

## What Is Benign Paroxysmal Positional Vertigo Bppv

# What is benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV)?

This type of vertigo makes you feel like you’re spinning when you’re not, and it’s the #1 cause of dizziness. This condition is typically caused by a calcium crystal that has broken off and is in the canals of the inner ear that control equilibrium and balance. There is a simple test called the Dix-Hallpike test that you can do at home to help determine if you have this type of vertigo.

Check with your doctor before doing this test to ensure you don’t have an issue with your cervical spine that could prevent you from rotating your neck. After you perform the test and determine which side is causing a problem, you can try the Epley maneuver. The goal of this maneuver is to create different motions to slowly move the calcium crystal out of the ear. An interesting systematic review and meta-analysis done in 2020 showed an association between low vitamin D and BPPV. Vitamin D supports the absorption and transportation of calcium. It's important to note that some people have a genetic issue that causes normal vitamin D levels in the blood but not the tissues. I believe one of the best natural remedies for BPPV is a combination of vitamin D3 and vitamin K2. For every 10,000 IU of vitamin D3, you would want 100 mcg of vitamin K2. Talk to your doctor about taking 50,000 IU of vitamin D3 and 500 mcg of vitamin K2 once a week for BPPV.

## What Is The Best Way To Detoxify My Lungs Naturally

# What is the best way to detoxify my lungs naturally?

Air pollution, cigarette smoke, and cleaning chemicals are just a few of the things that can affect the lungs. But, certain natural remedies may help detox the lungs and potentially help decrease the risk of conditions like COPD and cancer. Cancer tends to spread into areas of inflammation. If the lungs have inflammation, they become a target for cancer. Inflammation can also lead to fibrosis. So, we want to focus on natural ways to reduce lung inflammation. When chemicals go into the lungs, they don’t stop in the lungs. Chronic exposure to toxins in the air can also lead to problems with the liver and heart.

The best remedies to detox the lungs:

1\. Milk thistle

2\. Tocotrienols

3\. Vitamin D

4\. Pneumotrophin PMG® (Standard Process)

## What Is Hormesis

# What is hormesis?

Hormesis describes two things that might oppose each other. In terms of health, hormesis refers to a controlled dose of stress that makes positive changes for your body. With hormesis, you can adapt to various types of stress, including exercise, radiation, cold, heat, hypoxia, plant chemicals, pesticides, insecticides, and fungicides.

Sulforaphane found in broccoli sprouts and radish sprouts triggers the heat shock protein that allows the body to strengthen its detoxification enzymes. In this instance, the body is exposed to a small amount of poison that strengthens its ability to get rid of other poisons.

The liver contains phase 1 and phase 2 detoxification enzymes that can take a poison and turn it into a harmless particle.

Sulforaphane triggers this system. Exercise is one of the best examples of hormesis.

Exercise induces microinflammation but then allows the body to get rid of inflammation. Fasting activates the body’s mechanisms that counter starvation. It encourages our brain cells to grow, increases mitochondria, and regenerates the immune system.

Health is often counterintuitive. For example, cutting fat won’t help you lose fat, and sterilizing your environment won’t protect you from getting sick. You can’t develop a strong immune system without getting sick.

Antibiotics destroy good bacteria in the body, which can lead to pathogen overgrowth.

Antacids can lead to more heartburn because you need more acid to get rid of heartburn. When you don't expose yourself to the sun, you put yourself more at risk for certain types of cancers. Many people have been told that the sun causes cancer, but the sun gives us vitamin D. Having a deficiency in vitamin D can increase your risk for cancer.

One last example is dieting. The more dieting you do in your lifetime, the more weight you will gain—especially if you’re doing it incorrectly.

## What Is The Best Hair Loss Test

# What is the best hair loss test?

You need to test your Vitamin D levels!

Vitamin D is not a vitamin; it’s a hormone intimately involved in 10% of our genes. If you don’t have enough vitamin D, it can interfere with the genes responsible for hair growth. There is also a very high concentration of vitamin D receptors in the hair follicle. Without enough vitamin D, your immune system is at risk of autoimmune conditions, including alopecia. Vitamin D supports the T cells that help combat autoimmune diseases. Psoriasis, dandruff, and dermatitis are also related to low vitamin D.

Magnesium is the most potent regulator of calcium and is involved with enzymes important for hair health. It’s also essential for the proper function of vitamin D. There are 2 systems of vitamin D: one that controls calcium and one that has several functions, including hair growth and hair restoration. This form of vitamin D has a 24-hour half-life, so you need daily sun or supplements to prevent a hair loss problem.

Your blood vitamin D levels should be at least 70 to 100 ng/mL. You need at least 20,000 IU of vitamin D daily and 50 mg of magnesium to support hair growth. Zinc, iron, vitamin B12, and omega-3 fatty acids are also essential for hair restoration.

## What Is The Correct Way To Take Vitamin D

# What is the correct way to take vitamin D?

Vitamin D is the most important vitamin! It’s a fat-soluble vitamin involved in 10% of our genetics. Vitamin D won’t work unless you have enough magnesium, the second most important nutrient. Magnesium is involved with 300 different enzymes and plays a vital role in regulating excess calcium. Magnesium glycinate supplements have the best absorption rate.

The more vitamin D you take, the more magnesium you’ll need. Some negative side effects associated with vitamin D, such as nausea, heart palpitations, muscle cramps, and headaches, are actually symptoms of a magnesium deficiency. Don’t take vitamin D without the important cofactor, vitamin K2. Vitamin D helps you absorb calcium, but you need vitamin K2 to drive it into the bones and teeth to keep it out of the soft tissues.

Vitamin K2 is best for calcium buildup. Take 100 mcg of vitamin K2 for every 10,000 IUs of vitamin D3.

Zinc is another important cofactor that helps you convert cholesterol into vitamin D. If you’re taking 10,000 IU of vitamin D, you should also take 20 mg of zinc.

One of the biggest vitamin D mistakes is not taking enough! You need at least 6,000 to 10,000 IU of vitamin D3 every day. Vitamin D2 does not work like vitamin D3.

The vitamin D detected in the blood is not the active form. This means you could have normal blood levels of vitamin D but still have vitamin D deficiency. Statins and steroids can inhibit your ability to make vitamin D and its ability to work in your body. The best time to get vitamin D from the sun is between 10 a.m. and 2 p.m.

## How Can I Get Rid Of Toenail Fungus

# How can I get rid of toenail fungus?

Treating a fungal infection with medication can cause several side effects, including liver damage! Toenail fungus is often blamed on sweat and can cause other skin infections such as jock itch, athlete’s foot, beard infections, and even scalp infections. When attempting to treat a fungal infection topically, the cream will not penetrate deep enough into the nail to kill the toenail fungus.

Toenail fungus can evade your immune system through several mechanisms, including growing slowly, suppressing T cells, and going dormant for long periods of time. The T. rubrum microbe that causes toenail fungus is resistant to UV radiation. When your T cells are healthy and active, it forces this microbe into remission. A cooler, dry environment can also put it into a dormant state. A change in environment, such as pH, temperature, or moisture, can bring it out of remission.

A suppressed immune system is the leading cause of a toenail fungal infection. Stress, diabetes, obesity, antibiotics, and a vitamin D deficiency can suppress your immune system and cause toenail fungus to come out of remission.

Vitamin D is the most important nutrient for your immune function. Your toenails contain vitamin D receptors, but toenail fungus can downgrade them. Toenail fungus prevention starts with a strong immune system and a hostile environment for toenail fungus. High amounts of vitamin D can help! Consider taking at least 25,000 IU of vitamin D daily to get rid of toenail fungus.

Vitamin D strengthens the immune system and addresses toenail fungus at the systemic level. Zinc pyrithione, breathable shoes, and proper foot hygiene can also aid in toenail fungus prevention.

## What Is The Most Effective Vitamin

# What is the most effective vitamin?

Leo Pharma and Almirall are two pharmaceutical companies that specialize in dermatology. Many of their products contain synthetic vitamin D for skin problems. Coincidentally, these companies also played a role in the sun-phobia movement. The sun is one of the best remedies for skin problems like eczema and psoriasis.

You need at least 10,000 IUs of vitamin d3 every day to maintain healthy vitamin D levels! Sunbathing was once popular worldwide and was used to prevent tuberculosis and various health conditions. However, after the development of antibiotics, its popularity drastically declined.

Dr. William Grant has done extensive research on vitamin D. He explains that 84,532 papers have been published on vitamin D, the most studied bioactive molecule. Despite the evidence, there is still controversy regarding the health benefits of vitamin D. Tens of thousands of research studies have been conducted on the benefits of vitamin D for cancer.

Big Pharma has influenced studies that discredit the benefits of vitamin D. Only small amounts of vitamin D were used in most studies that do not show favorable outcomes with vitamin D.

Dr. Cicero Coimbra, who developed the Coimbra protocol, has seen a 90% success rate in using vitamin D for autoimmune diseases. Some people have vitamin D resistance, which involves a genetic problem with vitamin D. Blood tests can not accurately determine vitamin D deficiency. It is vital to keep your vitamin D levels over 50 ng/mL to avoid vitamin D deficiency.

## What Is The Number One Deficiency Behind Poor Eyesight

# What is the number one deficiency behind poor eyesight?

Contrast sensitivity loss is an eye problem doctors don’t commonly check for. This condition affects the ability to differentiate between shades of grey, causing blurry vision, especially in low light. Carotenoids are antioxidants that protect the eyes against blue light, chemicals, damage from diabetes, and more. However, as we age, carotenoids decrease, so eye protection also decreases. Full-spectrum light can be helpful but will not solve the problem.

To improve eyesight, you need to increase the efficiency of the retina. Sunlight is vital for eye and retina health. It allows UV and infrared light into the eye and can also help build up the eye’s melatonin. You can increase carotenoids in the eye by consuming foods with lutein and zeaxanthin. Both carotenoids are found in egg yolks. If you choose supplements with lutein and zeaxanthin, look for one with at least 10 mg of lutein and 2 mg of zeaxanthin. Research has shown significant improvement in macular degeneration and contrast sensitivity loss in people who took lutein and zeaxanthin for 12 weeks.

## What Is One Of The First Warning Signs Of Dementia

# What is one of the first warning signs of dementia?

Surprisingly, one of the earliest signs of dementia involves the retina. There is a high correlation between problems in the retina and problems in the brain. Problems with night vision or central vision, floaters, and light sensitivity issues are the earliest signs of dementia.

Some people develop amyloid-beta plaquing on the retina and may experience problems differentiating shades of grey and other colors. Researchers have found high levels of microbes, typically found in the mouth, in the brains of Alzheimer’s patients. When people die from dementia, it’s usually caused by an infection such as a UTI or lung infection. For some people, surgery can be too much on the body and lead to death. Some people with dementia have a slow, progressive degeneration of the brain to the point they’re bedridden and stop eating and drinking, which ultimately leads to death.

Focus on cleaning your brain and reducing inflammation for dementia prevention. The glymphatic system cleans the brain, mainly at night, which is one of the primary purposes of sleep. This system removes malformed proteins and plaquing and rejuvenates the brain. Anything that inhibits sleeping may increase your risk for Alzheimer’s, heart attacks, strokes, cancer, blood sugar issues, and type 2 diabetes. Sleep apnea can also be problematic. You need 8 to 9 hours of sleep! Alcohol significantly interferes with REM sleep and is very damaging to brain health.

To prevent Alzheimer’s, you must flood the brain with oxygen. Exercise is one of the best ways to do this! Exercise stimulates the growth of brain cells and the hormone BDNF (brain-derived neurotrophic factor). Adequate sun exposure and high amounts of vitamin D can help support healthy sleep. A diet high in sugar and carbohydrates can starve your neurons. Brain cells love ketones! To get into ketosis, you must lower your carbohydrate intake. If you have any early signs of dementia, try taking ketones as a supplement or MCT oil. Niacin may also be helpful. Take 50 mg daily, slowly increasing to 500 mg per day.

## What Is The Worst Health Advice

# What is the worst health advice?

The worst health advice:

1\. People can get all their nutrition from food. Getting enough nutrients such as vitamin D, potassium, and magnesium from food is almost impossible. Many people consume refined carbs and sugar, which deplete them of vital nutrients. Supplements are often the only way to compensate.

2\. Take more calcium to prevent osteoporosis. Normal blood calcium levels do not prevent bone loss. Osteoporosis usually occurs when you age and hormones like estrogen and testosterone decrease.

3\. Always use sunblock. Sunblock became very popular when sun exposure was linked to cancer. But you need sun to get enough vitamin D, which is vital for your immune system.

4\. Snack frequently to avoid overeating. Snacking raises insulin, creating a high blood sugar situation. This keeps you hungry and will not prevent overeating.

5\. Sugar in moderation is fine. Sugar and carb consumption, even in moderation, stops you from tapping into your fat reserve.

6\. Avoid saturated fats. Saturated fat does not clog your arteries. High-carb diets create a much more significant risk for heart problems.

7\. Whole grains are heart-healthy. Whole grains trigger blood sugar. Most products that contain whole grains also contain refined grains and fillers like maltodextrin and modified food starch. Whole grains contain phytates, which block the absorption of key nutrients, and gluten, which irritates the gut.

8\. Avoid red meat Grass-fed, grass-finished red meat is the healthiest food you can eat!

9\. Our brains need sugar and carbs. Your brain can also run on ketones, which will prevent brain fog and increase cognitive function.

10\. Restrict salt for high blood pressure. Rather than avoiding salt, focus on eliminating junk food from the diet and increasing vitamin D and potassium.

11\. All calories are equal. The body does not treat all calories equally. Instead of creating a calorie deficit to lose weight, create a carbohydrate calorie deficit. This forces the body to burn fat as an alternative fuel source.

## This Ruins Your Health

# THIS Ruins Your Health!

Big Pharma and Big Food both contribute to this health crisis. Chronic disease primarily comes from a diet composed of ultra-processed foods. Doctors prescribe medications to treat symptoms that come from the junk food diet, rather than addressing the diet. Junk food is not food! It’s composed of refined sugars, seed oils, and starches along with colorings, flavorings, and preservatives. Junk food does not sustain life and it’s at the root of chronic disease.

Some people claim that the ketogenic diet is dangerous, but this is untrue. The keto diet involves the breakdown of fat into ketones as an alternative fuel. When you reduce your carb intake, it forces your body to use your fat reserve for fuel. Keto is great for weight loss and can help combat insulin resistance. When cigarettes lost popularity due to health concerns, tobacco companies bought up the junk food industry. These companies produced profitable food junk food made from dent corn and other cheap materials. A high-carb diet has become normalized for major profits.

RFK Jr. is a non-politician who may be able to sever the relationships between the food industry and the government. Food guidelines are of the utmost importance because the consequences trickle down to the schools, hospitals, assisted living homes, and other places that feed the most vulnerable. More doctors are beginning to consider food and the whole body when managing disease, moving away from the symptom management model.

It's important not to overlook the function and importance of vitamin D, turmeric, magnesium, and grass-fed red meat. Focusing on disease prevention by building health rather than treating disease is most effective. Eating real food is the most important thing you can do for your health.

## What Is The Most Valuable Vitamin In Handling Of High Blood Pressure

# What is the most valuable vitamin in handling of high blood pressure?

Vitamin D is the most important vitamin for the inside of the arteries, yet it’s often ignored in cases of hypertension. Ninety percent of hypertension is considered essential, which means the cause is unknown. However, I believe it's likely linked to vitamin D deficiency. Vitamin D is vital in supporting and protecting the endothelial layer of your arteries.

The benefits of vitamin D for your arteries include:

1\. Potent anti-inflammatory effects

2\. Potent antioxidant effects

3\. Increased nitric oxide

Nitric oxide keeps the arteries in a state of vasodilation and relaxation. Without enough nitric oxide, the arteries become tight, and blood pressure rises. When the endothelial layer of the artery becomes dysfunctional, you no longer produce nitric oxide. You won't absorb much calcium if you don't have enough vitamin D. This can cause your parathyroid hormone to increase to remove calcium from the bone and put it into the blood. If you are chronically low in vitamin D, the parathyroid hormone will continue to rob calcium from the bone, creating osteoporosis.

Many doctors do not recommend large doses of vitamin D in fear of vitamin D toxicity. Clinical data does not support vitamin D toxicity! Dr. Bruce Hollis, a pioneer in vitamin D research, has personally never seen a case. Vitamin K2 can help remove calcium from the arteries and put it into the teeth and bones. Magnesium regulates excess calcium and helps to prevent cardiovascular problems. Vitamin D protects your arteries by decreasing inflammation and supporting the vascular cells. Vitamin D, magnesium, and K2 can help prevent calcium from developing in the wrong places, helping to prevent high blood pressure. Aim for 30,000 IU of vitamin D daily if you have high blood pressure.

If someone dies from a heart attack or stroke, their death is typically the result of a clot. A clot can form in less than 5 seconds! Usually, your body should form a clot, fix the hole in the artery, then dissolve the clot, but this doesn’t always happen.

Clots can be caused by the following:

•Smoking

•Pollution/chemicals

•Alcohol

•Birth control pills

•Stress

•Surgery

•Endurance sports

•Refined starches

•Infection

•High blood sugar

•Inflammation

Excess calcium in the arteries can also trigger clotting, which can lead to a heart attack or stroke. Postmenopausal women who take large amounts of calcium are at a much greater risk for blood clots. Calcium is involved in over 15 different clotting factors. Vitamin K2 prevents calcium from building up in the soft tissues and arteries. It is found in dairy, butter, and other fatty foods. Always take vitamin D with vitamin K2. Magnesium is another important calcium regulator. It helps prevent calcium from entering the soft tissues, as well as arrhythmias and atrial fibrillation. Nitric oxide can reduce clotting. Vitamin D, L-arginine, and sunlight can increase nitric oxide to help prevent heart attack. Polyphenols, vitamin C, and omega-3 fatty acids all support heart health and may help reduce your risk of clotting. Keto and intermittent fasting can help reduce clotting by reducing inflammation in your arteries. Regular moderate exercise is vital in preventing clotting. Garlic and onion are also essential. Nattokinase, serrapeptase, and bromelain can be taken as supplements to prevent clotting.

## Vitamin K2 The Overlooked Nutrient For Artery And Bone Health

# Vitamin K2: The Overlooked Nutrient for Artery and Bone Health

**Vitamin K2: The Overlooked Nutrient for Artery and Bone Health**

It might surprise you to learn that Vitamin K2, found in many foods we've been told to limit, is actually crucial for maintaining healthy arteries and bones. A deficiency in this vital nutrient can contribute to a range of issues, from soft tissue calcification and bone loss to osteoporosis and even cavities.

**Where to Find Vitamin K2**

While our bodies can convert some vitamin K1 from leafy greens into K2, the most abundant sources are:

- **Natto:** This fermented soybean product reigns supreme in vitamin K2 content.

- **Organ Meats:** Eel, goose liver, chicken liver, and beef liver are also excellent sources.

- **Animal Products:** Butter and cheese from grass-fed animals, salami, and pork chops offer moderate amounts.

- **Fermented Foods:** Fermented vegetables like sauerkraut contain small amounts of K2.

**Why You Need Vitamin K2**

Vitamin K2 plays a vital role in directing calcium to where it belongs – in your bones and teeth – and keeping it out of your arteries and soft tissues. This process helps prevent calcium buildup, which can lead to hardened arteries and other health problems.

**Factors Affecting Vitamin K2 Production**

Several factors can hinder your body's ability to produce or utilize vitamin K2:

- **Gut Microbiome Imbalance:** A healthy gut is essential, as the microbe *B. subtilis* is primarily responsible for converting K1 to K2. Unfortunately, this microbe is sensitive to:

    - Antibiotics

    - Steroids

    - PPIs and antacids

    - Glyphosate (found in GMO foods)

    - Alcohol

    - Junk food

    - High-sugar diets

- **Liver Health:** A compromised liver can impair K2 absorption.

- **Low-Fat Diets:** Since K2 is fat-soluble, adequate fat intake is necessary for absorption.

- **Magnesium Deficiency:** Magnesium works synergistically with K2 for optimal calcium regulation.

**Supplementing with Vitamin K2**

If you're concerned about your vitamin K2 levels, consider supplementing with MK7, the natural form of K2. A general guideline is to take 100 mcg of MK7 for every 10,000 IU of vitamin D3 you consume.

**Key Takeaway:** Don't underestimate the importance of vitamin K2 for your overall health. Prioritize a balanced diet with K2-rich foods, support your gut health, and consider supplementation to ensure you're getting enough of this critical nutrient.

## What Is The Most Effective Vitamin For Promoting The Shrinking Of Fibroids

# What is the most effective vitamin for promoting the shrinking of fibroids?

Up to 80% of women will develop fibroids by age 40. In this video, we'll take a look at the causes of fibroids that could be related to vitamin deficiency. Find out how to help shrink fibroids naturally and alleviate fibroid symptoms with one vitamin. Fibroids decrease in size after menopause, yet pregnancy, exposure to HRT, and birth control pills can cause fibroids to enlarge. Obesity, type 2 diabetes, high blood pressure, and PCOS also increase the risk of fibroids. Black women have a 3 to 9 times higher risk of developing fibroids.

Estrogen is the primary driver of fibroids and endometriosis. A fibroid is a growth in the uterus, but it differs from uterine tissue in several ways. Fibroids are very sensitive to estrogen and have increased estrogen receptors, more of the enzyme aromatase, less oxygen than the uterus, and more inflammation.

Many health problems and risk factors associated with fibroids are related to low vitamin D. Vitamin D has incredible properties that may help inhibit the growth of fibroids.

There is also a vast amount of anecdotal evidence in support of using vitamin D to shrink fibroids.

Be sure to take vitamin D with the cofactors magnesium and vitamin K2.

It's important to consult with a healthcare professional before starting any new supplement regimen, including vitamin D, to ensure proper dosage and to discuss any potential interactions with other medications or health conditions.

## Which Vitamins Help Prevent Diabetic Complications And How Do They Sup C90432

# Which vitamins help prevent diabetic complications, and how do they support blood sugar, nerve health, and metabolism?

**Today I’m going to share five vitamins that can help with the complications of diabetes. High blood glucose affects four main tissues, including:**

1\. The eyes

2\. The arteries

3\. The nervous system (including the brain)

4\. The kidneys

However, the damage to these tissues can lead to a myriad of health problems. Glycation is a combination of sugar and protein in the body, and it can lead to this dysfunction of tissues. An A1C score is basically a number that represents glycated hemoglobin (a protein in red blood cells) to help tell how bad someone’s diabetes is. Glycation can also occur when someone consumes a combination of sugar or carbs and protein or fat. When glycation occurs, it can build up into advanced glycation end products (AGEs). With AGEs comes a lot of free radical damage, inflammation, and oxidative stress.

**The good news is that there are natural things that can inhibit glycation. Vitamins that inhibit glycation:**

1\. Benfotiamine

2\. Vitamin C

3\. Vitamin D

4\. Vitamin E (tocotrienols complex without tocopherols)

5\. Vitamin B6

## What Is The Connection Between Thyroid And Gallbladder

# What is the connection between thyroid and gallbladder?

Bile contains bile salts, lecithin, bilirubin, protein, and cholesterol. If a person has too much cholesterol and not enough bile salts, they could develop gallstones. However, cholesterol is necessary to help you make bile, hormones, and vitamin D. The body makes the majority of cholesterol in the body.

The liver makes bile. Bile helps eliminate excess cholesterol and certain toxins. It also helps break down fats and supports the absorption of fat-soluble vitamins and fatty acids. A person with hypothyroidism or a subclinical hyperthyroid issue has an increased risk of gallstones. Many different connections cause this increased risk, but overall, it takes a healthy thyroid to make enough bile and bile to create a healthy thyroid.

Ultimately, I believe a lack of fat and cholesterol in the diet can increase your risk of gallstones and hypothyroidism from multiple angles. The Healthy Keto® diet can help supply the fats and important vitamins and minerals your body needs. Learn more about Healthy Keto in my other videos.

## What Is The Epstein Barr Virus

# What is the Epstein-Barr virus?

Roughly 95 percent of the population has the Epstein-Barr virus. The more you know about EBV, the less you’ll be adversely affected by it.

The Epstein-Barr virus can use different strategies to go under the radar and survive in a person’s body. The virus can go dormant and become very difficult for the body to detect. You can never get rid of EBV—you have to focus on keeping it in remission. To keep it in remission, you need to understand the strategies of the virus and how to support the immune system to keep it under control.

**Important things to know about the Epstein-Barr virus:**

1\. You can’t get rid of it

2\. It’s associated with an increased risk of certain cancers, autoimmune diseases, rheumatoid arthritis, chronic fatigue syndrome, and fibromyalgia

3\. It blocks key immune nutrients that your cells depend on, like vitamin D, vitamin A, and zinc

4\. It modulates fever response

5\. Emotional stress may trigger EBV to come out of remission

**Three things to help inhibit EBV from coming out of remission:**

1\. Decrease your stress and exposure to triggers

2\. Take cod liver oil

3\. Choose one or two of these herbs:

• Elderberry

• Echinacea

• Olive leaf extract

• Andrographis

• Astragalus

## What Is The Vitamin Deficiency Behind The Bladder Issues

# What is the vitamin deficiency behind the bladder issues?

**A vitamin B1 deficiency could lead to problems, including:**

• Leaky bladder

• Incomplete urination

• Frequent urination

• Getting up in the middle of the night to urinate

The common thread behind these bladder issues is actually a problem with the nervous system. The main control with urine elimination stems from the brain, and this part of the brain is very sensitive to a vitamin B1 (thiamine) deficiency. A thiamine deficiency in the brain can even starve off certain neurons, causing a lack of function. The part of the brain that controls the bladder can shrink, leading to a loss of control of the bladder. This situation is common with age and in those with diabetes, prediabetes, or chronic insulin resistance.

**Natural tips to get rid of bladder issues:**

1\. Take vitamin B1 (benfotiamine and natural B1)

2\. Get on the Healthy Keto® diet and do intermittent fasting

3\. Drink 2.5 liters of fluid a day (not past 6 pm or 7 pm)

4\. Consume apple cider vinegar (1 to 2 TBSP in water)

5\. Reduce caffeine consumption

6\. Massage the bladder

## What Is The Underlying Mechanism By Which Hyaluronic Acid Exerts Its E Ae5301

# What is the underlying mechanism by which hyaluronic acid exerts its effects at the molecular and cellular levels within biological systems?

Having enough [vitamin A](https://www.drberg.com/blog/vitamin-a-functions-and-deficiencies) actually increases hyaluronic acid production. This might be why people who are deficient in this vital vitamin tend to have problems with dry eyes and skin. Even the fluid within your eye contains large amounts of hyaluronic acid.

What many don't realize is that after a certain age, this crucial compound begins to decline in our bodies. You primarily start to see a reduction in hyaluronic acid around your 40s and 50s.

By the time you are 80 years old, you will have lost nearly 80% of your natural hyaluronic acid production. This decline can lead to noticeable changes in the skin, such as wrinkles and sagging.

To give you a better idea of the powerful effects of hyaluronic acid, consider the rare genetic disease called progeria, which causes children to age rapidly.

Kids with progeria experience a 20-fold reduction in hyaluronic acid levels compared to individuals who do not have this rare condition.

When comparing images of young skin to those with older, more mature skin, the differences are easy to spot. Older skin wrinkles and sags, making it usually easy to spot someone who is deficient in hyaluronic acid and doesn’t reap its amazing skin benefits.

## What Indicators Or Symptoms Should I Be Aware Of That Might Suggest A  0Fe0Bf

# What indicators or symptoms should I be aware of that might suggest a deficiency in Vitamin D levels?

Professor Bruce Hollis' groundbreaking research has revolutionized our understanding of vitamin D's crucial role and multifaceted functions.

Historically, vitamin D was primarily associated with maintaining bone health and calcium levels. However, advancements in research have revealed its impact on a broader range of cells, including cancer and immune cells.

Vitamin D undergoes transformations within the body. It starts as an inactive form, obtained through supplements or sunlight exposure. This inactive form is then converted into 25-hydroxy vitamin D, an intermediate form circulating in the bloodstream for weeks. While this form is measurable in blood tests, it remains largely inaccessible to tissues that require it.

The final and most potent form of vitamin D is 125 di-hydroxy vitamin D, a powerful hormone. This conversion predominantly occurs in the kidneys but can also happen within individual cells.

Unfortunately, much of the existing research on vitamin D in the U.S. is flawed, leading to inaccurate conclusions. There's also a lack of consensus on "normal" vitamin D levels and what constitutes a deficiency.

Professor Hollis' research has yielded remarkable results, demonstrating vitamin D's effectiveness in preventing birth complications in Iranian women, benefiting patients with low-grade prostate cancer, and supporting lactation. He also emphasizes the importance of magnesium as a vital cofactor in vitamin D metabolism.

Professor Hollis aims to raise awareness about vitamin D's underappreciated benefits, highlighting that many physicians remain uninformed due to a lack of recognition and understanding from national organizations.

## What Is Better Pasture Raised Eggs Or Store Bought Eggs

# What is better pasture raised eggs or store bought eggs?

### **Why Free-Range Eggs Are Healthier Than Commercial Chicken Eggs**

**1\. Diet and Nutrient Content:**

- **Commercial Chicken Diet**: Commercial chickens are typically fed a grain-based diet supplemented with vitamins and minerals. While this diet helps produce large eggs, it lacks critical nutrients found in the natural diet of free-range chickens, such as insects and green vegetation.

- **Free-Range Chicken Diet**: Free-range chickens have some access to the outdoors, allowing them to consume a more varied diet that includes insects, worms, and vegetation. This natural diet contributes to the higher nutrient content in their eggs.

**2\. Nutritional Differences:**

- **Omega-3 vs. Omega-6 Fatty Acids**: Free-range eggs generally have a better balance of omega-3 to omega-6 fatty acids. Omega-3s are anti-inflammatory and important for heart and brain health, while too many omega-6s can contribute to inflammation.

- **Vitamins and Antioxidants**: Free-range eggs contain higher levels of vitamins and antioxidants. For example, they have double the amount of vitamin E and 38% more vitamin A compared to commercial eggs. These nutrients are essential for overall health, including eye, prostate, and heart health.

**3\. Living Conditions:**

- **Commercial Chickens**: These chickens are often kept in confined spaces with limited movement, which can impact their overall health and the quality of the eggs they produce.

- **Free-Range Chickens**: Although the term "free-range" can be somewhat misleading, as it only requires "access" to the outdoors, these chickens generally have more space to move around compared to commercial chickens. This can lead to healthier chickens and better-quality eggs.

Free-range eggs are considered healthier than commercial eggs due to the more varied and natural diet of free-range chickens, which leads to higher nutrient content in the eggs. Additionally, the living conditions of free-range chickens are generally better, contributing to the overall quality of the eggs.

## What Are Effective Methods To Dissolve Inner Ear Crystals And Relieve  15875C

# What are effective methods to dissolve inner ear crystals and relieve vertigo symptoms?

**Understanding Vertigo: Causes and Potential Solutions**

While surgery and exercises may be used in vertigo treatment, they often don't address the underlying cause. Vertigo frequently stems from misplaced calcium crystals within the inner ear, disrupting the delicate balance signals sent to the brain.

**How Calcium Crystals Cause Vertigo**

Your inner ear contains a gel-like membrane with calcium crystals positioned on top. This system helps your brain sense movement and maintain balance. Problems arise when these crystals become dislodged, migrating into deeper areas of the inner ear. This can occur due to head injuries, infections, medications, or simply aging.

**The Calcium Connection**

Individuals with vertigo often have higher calcium levels in their inner ear fluid, suggesting difficulties with proper calcium regulation. Additionally, there's a strong link between osteoporosis (a condition of excess calcium in soft tissues) and vertigo.

**Vitamin D for Vertigo: A Potential Aid**

Vitamin D might help with vertigo by assisting your body in managing calcium. It promotes calcium absorption and deposition in bones, potentially reducing excess calcium buildup in the inner ear.

**Recommendations**

Consider a vitamin D3 supplement dosage between 10,000 and 20,000 IU. Crucially, combine it with vitamin K2 and magnesium for optimal results. Magnesium helps balance calcium levels in the body.

**Important Note:** Before starting any new supplement regimen, please consult your doctor for personalized guidance.

## What Is Ocular Myasthenia Gravis

# What is ocular myasthenia gravis?

**Myasthenia Gravis and Vitamin D: A Promising Case Study**

Myasthenia gravis (MG) is an autoimmune disease that disrupts the communication between nerves and muscles, leading to muscle weakness. While steroids are a common treatment, they can have harsh side effects.

**A Brazilian Case Study**

Intriguingly, a Brazilian doctor treated an MG patient using high-dose vitamin D3 (80,000 - 120,000 IUs). Remarkably, the patient's symptoms went into remission.

**Potential Benefits**

- **Hormone-like Action:** Vitamin D may mimic some of the effects of steroids, potentially without the same side effects.

- **Immune Regulation:** Vitamin D supports T regulatory cells, which play a crucial role in preventing autoimmune reactions.

- **The Vitamin D Connection:** Many autoimmune diseases, including MG, are linked to vitamin D deficiency.

**Important Considerations**

- **Hypercalcemia Risk:** High-dose vitamin D can raise blood calcium levels (hypercalcemia), increasing the risk of kidney stones. Precautions like omitting dietary calcium and increasing fluids may be helpful.

**\*Please keep in mind that the above is not a medical advice. You should see your doctor about any possible medical conditions.**

## What Are The Signs That You May Benefit From Taking Purified Bile Salt Fa2Ae9

# What are the signs that you may benefit from taking purified bile salts, and how can they address specific health concerns?

Individuals without a gallbladder may experience deficiencies in fat-soluble nutrients, leading to various health issues.

**Identifying Nutrient Deficiencies from Impaired Fat Absorption**

\- Vitamin A Deficiency: Symptoms include difficulty seeing at night (night blindness), dry skin, and frequent infections.

\- Vitamin D Deficiency: Weak bones, muscle pain, and fatigue are common indicators of low vitamin D levels due to poor fat digestion.

\- Hormonal Imbalances: Since hormones like estrogen and testosterone are derived from fats, compromised fat absorption can cause mood swings, irregular periods (in women), and decreased libido.

\- Inflammation: Inadequate levels of vitamins D and E can lead to chronic inflammation, which is linked to heart disease, asthma, and autoimmune disorders.

**Benefits of Using Purified Bile Salts Without a Gallbladder**

Purified bile salts supplements can enhance the body's ability to digest dietary fats effectively. Benefits include:

\- Improved Fat Digestion: Bile salts aid in breaking down fats into smaller particles, facilitating easier processing by pancreatic enzymes.

\- Better Absorption of Fat-Soluble Vitamins: Enhanced fat breakdown promotes better absorption of essential vitamins A, D, E, and K.

\- Hormone Balance Support: Improved fat digestion can contribute to more balanced hormone levels, as many hormones are derived from fats.

If you suspect impaired fat absorption due to a missing or non-functioning gallbladder, consult a healthcare professional about your symptoms and the potential benefits of purified bile salt supplements. They can provide personalized guidance on whether supplementation is right for you.

***We recommend consulting with your doctor before making any dietary changes or before you start taking any new supplements, especially if you have any existing health conditions.***

## What Is The 1 Deficiency In All Autoimmune Conditions

# What is the #1 Deficiency in all autoimmune conditions?

**Understanding the Coimbra Protocol and Vitamin D Resistance**

The Coimbra Protocol is a treatment that uses high doses of vitamin D to address certain autoimmune diseases. Here's how it relates to your body's use of vitamin D and calcium:

- **Vitamin D and Calcium:** Vitamin D plays a crucial role in helping your body absorb calcium from food. In turn, calcium is essential for strong bones and overall health.

- **Parathyroid Hormone (PTH):** This hormone, produced by the parathyroid gland, regulates calcium levels in your blood. If you're low on calcium or have insufficient vitamin D, the parathyroid gland produces more PTH to extract calcium from bones for your body to use.

- **Vitamin D Resistance:** Sometimes, the body doesn't effectively use vitamin D, even if blood levels are normal. This is called vitamin D resistance, and high PTH levels (alongside low vitamin D) can be a sign of this condition.

**How the Coimbra Protocol Works**

The Coimbra Protocol addresses potential vitamin D resistance by:

1. **Monitoring PTH Levels:** Doctors track PTH to see how your body is responding to vitamin D.

2. **Increasing Vitamin D Intake:** Vitamin D doses are gradually increased until PTH levels decrease, indicating improved vitamin D utilization.

**Causes of Vitamin D Resistance**

- **Vitamin D Receptor Issues:** Problems with the body's vitamin D receptors can hinder absorption.

- **Genetics:** Certain genetic variations (polymorphisms) can increase the risk of resistance.

- **Other Factors:** Limited sun exposure, darker skin, old age, stress, location, and air pollution can all contribute.

- **Pathogens and Toxins:** Some pathogens from tick bites, cancer cells, and heavy metals can significantly reduce the effectiveness of vitamin D receptors.

**Important Note:** While magnesium and zinc can help manage calcium levels, vitamin K2 is considered essential for directing calcium to the right places (like bones) and preventing it from building up where it shouldn't.

## In Addition To Taking Minerals For Arthritis Are There Other Important 2Bb1B7

# In addition to taking minerals for arthritis, are there other important treatments or strategies that I should consider incorporating into my management plan?

**The Role of Boron in Arthritis Management**

Boron is a crucial trace mineral that supports the effectiveness of calcium and magnesium in arthritis treatment. It helps retain these minerals in the bone, activates vitamin D, and reduces joint inflammation by lowering C-reactive protein levels. Boron deficiency may lead to excess calcium and magnesium in the urine, calcification of soft tissues, and weakened bones.

Benefits of boron include:

\- Enhancing mineral retention in bones

\- Activating vitamin D

\- Preventing tooth decay

A lack of boron can also cause receding gums, kidney stones, and calcification in arteries and joints. Additionally, adequate boron levels support hormonal balance and may reduce the risk of prostate cancer.

For arthritis relief, starting with 3 mg of boron three times daily may be beneficial. Consult with a healthcare provider to tailor this approach to your needs.

## What Are The Symptoms Of Magnesium Deficiency And What Are The Effecti 4Fba20

# What are the symptoms of magnesium deficiency, and what are the effective solutions and interventions for addressing this condition?

**Magnesium Deficiency: What You Need to Know**

Magnesium plays a vital role in hundreds of bodily processes. But sadly, many of us are deficient in this essential mineral. Let's delve into what magnesium deficiency is, its symptoms, causes, and how to fix it.

**What is Magnesium Deficiency (Hypomagnesemia)?**

Magnesium deficiency occurs when your body doesn't have enough magnesium for optimal function. This mineral is crucial for muscle health, blood sugar control, nerve function, and much more. As Dr. Berg notes, "Almost 50 percent of adults don’t consume enough magnesium." This can lead to serious health problems.

**Signs of Magnesium Deficiency**

Since magnesium is used throughout your body, deficiency symptoms can be wide-ranging:

- Fatigue

- Muscle cramps and weakness

- High blood pressure

- Anxiety, depression, and sleep problems

- Migraine headaches

- Irregular heartbeat

- Numbness or tingling

**Important:** Magnesium deficiency can worsen side effects associated with low vitamin D. Consult a doctor if you suspect a deficiency.

**Causes of Magnesium Deficiency**

- **Poor diet:** Not eating enough magnesium-rich foods is a major culprit.

- **Health conditions:** Issues like Crohn's disease and low stomach acid can hinder magnesium absorption.

- **Medications:** Certain drugs like diuretics and antibiotics can deplete magnesium.

- **Alcohol:** Excessive alcohol intake interferes with your body's ability to absorb magnesium.

**How to Boost Your Magnesium Levels**

1. **Magnesium-Rich Foods:** Focus on these top sources:

    - Pumpkin seeds

    - Spinach

    - Avocados

    - Dark chocolate

    - Almonds

    - Leafy greens

2. **Supplementation:** Opt for highly absorbable forms like magnesium citrate, threonate, glycinate, or taurate. *Avoid* magnesium oxide, sulfate, carbonate, or chloride, as these have low bioavailability and can cause side effects.

**Benefits of Magnesium**

This mighty mineral can help with:

- Blood pressure regulation

- Diabetes management

- Migraine prevention

- Anxiety and mood improvement

- Better sleep

- And more!

## What Nutrient Deficiency Cause Migraines

# What nutrient deficiency cause migraines?

**Migraines, Mitochondria, and the Power of Vitamin B2**

Migraines can be a debilitating experience – intense pain, sensitivity to light and sound, nausea... it's no wonder they're linked to the #1 vitamin deficiency. While genetics can play a role, don't despair. Understanding the factors that trigger your migraines can help you manage them effectively.

The key may lie in your mitochondria, the powerhouses of your cells. Research suggests a link between mitochondrial dysfunction and migraines. This is where riboflavin (vitamin B2) comes in! It supports healthy mitochondrial function and the production of glutathione, a crucial antioxidant that protects your brain cells.

**Why B2 Matters**

B2 deficiency is a common factor in migraines. It plays a crucial role in oxygen utilization within your mitochondria – vital for energy production. If you have a genetic tendency towards mitochondrial issues, you might need even more B2.

**B2 for Migraine Relief**

- **Prevention:** Try 400mg of vitamin B2 daily.

- **Acute Attack:** If a migraine strikes, try 100mg of B2 every hour until symptoms subside (up to a maximum of 400mg daily).

**Beyond B2**

Sodium deficiency can also trigger migraines, so consider increasing your sea salt intake. If B2 alone doesn't provide full relief, natural remedies like ginger or turmeric may offer additional support.

**Important:** Always consult your doctor before starting any new supplements or making significant dietary changes, especially if you experience migraines.

## What Is The Primary Vitamin Deficiency Associated With Tonsillitis And Ce3F21

# What is the primary vitamin deficiency associated with tonsillitis and enlarged tonsils, and how might addressing this deficiency help in managing these conditions?

The primary vitamin deficiency associated with tonsillitis and enlarged tonsils is vitamin D. Low levels of vitamin D are linked to increased inflammation and enlargement of the tonsils. Vitamin D is challenging to obtain through diet alone, but cod liver oil is a notable source. Historically, cod liver oil was commonly given to children for its vitamin D content. Modern indoor lifestyles further contribute to vitamin D deficiency, which can impact tonsil health. The tonsils play a crucial role in the immune response by detecting pathogens and signaling the immune system to mount a defense.

## What Is The Most Common Deficiency In Skin Diseases

# What is the most common deficiency in skin diseases?

**Dermatitis, simply put, is inflammation of the skin. There are numerous types, but fundamentally, most skin issues stem from either allergies or immune responses. Think of many dermatitis cases as an overzealous immune system.**

Typical treatments like topical or oral steroids aim to suppress this immune response, while antibiotics are often used for infections, although these can sometimes lead to secondary infections.

The skin's surface, teeming with microbes, acts as a shield for underlying immune-rich tissues. When dermatitis flares up, vitamin D seems to be a helpful ally. It can soothe contact dermatitis by calming the histamine response, and as a key immune system regulator, vitamin D's benefits extend to a variety of skin issues.

We often see skin conditions worsen in winter due to less sunlight exposure and vitamin D production. Stress also plays a role, as elevated cortisol levels deplete vitamin D.

**Specifically, vitamin D can improve acne by regulating oil production, and vitamin D creams can alleviate dandruff. Eczema, psoriasis, vitiligo, and alopecia have all been linked to vitamin D deficiency. Interestingly, some microbes involved in skin problems can actually hinder vitamin D receptors, aiding their own survival.**

## What Strategies Can I Employ To Enhance My Sleep Quality While Simulta 65D2Cb

# What strategies can I employ to enhance my sleep quality while simultaneously ensuring optimal nourishment for my cells?

When someone has some type of defect in their genes, and everyone does have some defects and mutations to their genes, and there's some great DNA testing that you can do, you'll see more of this as time goes on. It doesn't mean that those genes will always be expressed, because they're not the controlling factor. You have epigenetics, which is above your genes. So it's lifestyle. It's when you eat. It's what you eat. It's the stress level, all these other things. But what you're trying to do, which is smart, is trying to do fasting. And it's been hard, so you have to snack.

First of all, you need to start including the apple cider vinegar with water with your meals, and maybe even before you go to bed, because that's one of the best things to regulate your blood sugars. Even if someone does a high-carb diet, if they consume that apple cider vinegar with water, their blood sugars will be better, even if you have something called the dawn phenomenon in the morning, where your blood sugars are high.

The other thing is to look back at my videos on your meal and compare it to what I recommend to what you're doing. You might need more fat with the meal. Because if you're truly in ketosis, to be able to get the benefits, you need to go. You should lose your appetite, so you should not be hungry at all, and you should feel good, and everything should be fine. So the fasting for your condition is so vitally important, because that way all these cool things will happen when you start fasting to your blood like normalization of all sorts of things.

You may also need to add a little bit of salt and water in the evening and drink that. That does help sleep, especially if you have what you have. And there's other remedies, too, like vitamin D3 before bed and zinc before bed. These are all just natural things that I would do versus snacking.

## Prolonged Fasting   Build Up Nutrients With Healthy Keto

# Prolonged Fasting - Build Up Nutrients with Healthy Keto®

An adequate nutrient reserve is essential to a safe prolonged fast.  Healthy Keto® is a low-carb, high-fat, moderate-protein diet focusing on high-quality, nutrient-dense foods.   

Healthy Keto® emphasizes organic vegetables, full-fat organic dairy, and wild-caught, grass-fed, pasture-raised meat, fish, fowl, and eggs to maximize vitamin and mineral nutrients.  Healthy Keto® replaces unhealthy oils like soy, corn, and canola oil with healthier butter, coconut, avocado, olive, and animal fats to help reduce inflammation and support improved nutrient absorption.  Dr. Berg’s Healthy Keto® also encourages the consumption of 7 to 10 cups of vegetables daily for adequate vitamins and mineral nutrients. 

**Always Start with Intermittent Fasting** 

Intermittent fasting serves as a foundational step before transitioning to prolonged fasting for several reasons: 

1. **Adaptation to Fasting State:** Intermittent fasting helps your body gradually adapt to periods without food. This adaptation can make the transition to prolonged fasting smoother and more manageable. 

2. **Metabolic Flexibility:** Intermittent fasting enhances your body's ability to switch between using glucose and fat as energy sources. This metabolic flexibility is crucial for prolonged fasting, where your body needs to utilize fat stores for energy over extended periods efficiently. 

3. **Building Fasting Tolerance:** Starting with intermittent fasting allows you to build knowledge of your hunger signs and learn how your body responds to fasting. This experience is valuable when you extend the fasting duration in prolonged fasting. 

4. **Safety and Efficacy:** Gradually increasing fasting duration through intermittent fasting is essential to a safer and more efficient fast than jumping directly into prolonged fasting, which can be more challenging and has a higher risk of adverse effects if not done correctly. 

Starting with intermittent fasting prepares your body and mind for the more intensive experience of prolonged fasting, potentially enhancing both the experience and the benefits. 

To start intermittent fasting, you can follow these steps: 

1. **Choose Your Fasting Plan**: Decide a fasting schedule that suits your lifestyle. Standard plans include the 16:8 method, where you fast for 16 hours and eat during an 8-hour window. 

2. **Gradually Increase Fasting Time**: Begin by slowly extending your overnight fast. For example, delay breakfast by an hour and gradually increase until you can comfortably skip it. 

3. **Stay Hydrated**: During fasting periods, drink plenty of water and electrolyte water. Black coffee or herbal teas should be consumed in limited amounts, as they can dehydrate you. 

4. **Listen to Your Body**: Pay attention to how your body responds. If you experience fatigue or feel unusually cold, these could be signs that you’re advancing too quickly. 

5. **Nutrient-Dense Foods**: During your feeding window, choose nutrient-dense foods, such as those on the [Healthy Keto® Approved Foods](https://www.drberg.com/ketosis-approved-foods) list. 

6. **Consult Healthcare Providers**: If you have any health conditions or concerns, consult a healthcare provider before starting an intermittent fasting regimen. 

This information is provided from [Dr. Berg's Guidelines for Prolonged Fasting.docx](https://realdrberg-my.sharepoint.com/:w:/g/personal/shawnh_drberg_com/EazcZ9dNJ6VDhEOO13hV0F8BnVvc-Ge6y2mYjpN-FnojYg?e=RHdisz&clickparams=eyJBcHBOYW1lIjoiVGVhbXMtRGVza3RvcCIsIkFwcFZlcnNpb24iOiI1MC8yNDAzMzEwMTgxNyIsIkhhc0ZlZGVyYXRlZFVzZXIiOmZhbHNlfQ%3D%3D).

Dr. Berg Nutritionals staff, including Dr. Berg Advisors, do *not* encourage prolonged fasting. We are not healthcare professionals equipped with the tests and facilities to perform the necessary monitoring during a prolonged fast, nor do we have an individual's medical health records. Dr. Berg Advisors provides this document based on Dr. Berg's education for informational purposes only to those already on a prolonged fast or independently choosing to do one.

**Always consult with your healthcare provider before starting a prolonged fast.  If you're considering prolonged fasting, discussing the benefits and risks with your healthcare provider is essential.**

## What Is The Role Of Dietary Cholesterol For Healthy Heart

# What is the role of dietary cholesterol for healthy heart?

### **The Role of Dietary Cholesterol in Heart Health**

First, let's talk about [cholesterol](https://www.drberg.com/blog/cholesterol-basics-101-by-dave-feldman-and-dr-berg)—specifically, dietary cholesterol—the kind found in foods like eggs, meat, and dairy.

For years, conventional wisdom held that dietary cholesterol was public enemy #1 for heart health. The thinking went: you eat cholesterol, your blood cholesterol levels rise, and your heart suffers.

However, fresh investigations have questioned this long-held belief, suggesting it might not be as straightforward as once thought. Emerging research indicates that ingesting cholesterol doesn't significantly alter blood cholesterol figures for most people.

Interestingly, a 2018 investigation unveiled that consuming as many as a dozen eggs weekly doesn't elevate heart disease risk in individuals with no pre-existing health issues.

So, what gives? It turns out that the relationship between dietary cholesterol and heart health is a lot more complex than we once thought.

Factors like genetics, overall diet quality, and lifestyle habits all play a role in determining how your body responds to cholesterol intake.

### **Observational Studies vs. Clinical Trials**

To really understand the egg-heart connection, we need to discuss the different types of nutrition research available.

On the one hand, you've got observational studies. These look at large groups of people and try to find links between specific foods or nutrients and health outcomes.

The problem with observational studies is that they can't prove cause and effect. Just because egg-eaters have a higher risk of heart disease doesn't necessarily mean that eggs are to blame.

On the other hand, you've got clinical trials. In these meticulously designed studies, participants are randomly sorted into varied dietary factions, and their well-being is monitored over time.

In nutrition research, clinical trials reign supreme due to their ability to definitively demonstrate causality. And when it comes to eggs and heart health, the clinical trial evidence is pretty reassuring.

![certified humane organic eggs](https://drberg-dam.imgix.net/others/basket-chicken-eggs-on-wooden-table.jpg?w=992&auto=compress,format)

## **Heart-Healthy Choices** 

When comparing brown [eggs to hot dogs](https://www.drberg.com/keto-recipes/eggs-grassfed-hot-dog-and-kaleshake), the health benefits are clear: brown eggs are a rich source of protein, vitamins, and minerals essential for overall health.

Hot dogs often contain high levels of sodium, saturated fats, and preservatives, which can increase the risk of heart disease and other health issues.

Brown eggs provide nutrients like vitamin D, B12, and selenium, supporting immune function, bone health, and metabolism. In contrast, hot dogs are processed meats linked to an increased risk of cancer and cardiovascular disease.

We must make informed choices about what we consume, opting for nutrient-dense foods like brown eggs over processed options like hot dogs to support optimal health.

## Is It Possible To Do Healthy Raw Vegan Keto

# Is it possible to do healthy raw vegan keto?

Achieving ketosis while adhering to a vegan diet is indeed feasible, albeit more challenging. The primary difficulty lies in balancing macronutrients, particularly in obtaining sufficient fat and complete protein sources. Adequate intake of nutrients like zinc, typically found in animal products, may require careful attention and supplementation from alternative plant-based sources. Similarly, obtaining the active form of vitamin A, such as retinol, and essential omega-3 fatty acids can pose challenges and necessitate strategic dietary planning.

## How To Break A Prolonged Fast  Refeeding

# How to Break a Prolonged Fast & Refeeding

**Understanding Refeeding Syndrome After Prolonged Fasting**

Prolonged fasting (4-7+ days) carries the risk of refeeding syndrome, a rare but potentially serious condition. This occurs when your body rapidly shifts nutrients from the bloodstream into cells, especially if you were already nutrient deficient before the fast.

**Why It Happens:** Pre-existing nutrient deficiencies worsen during a fast. When you suddenly reintroduce food, your body can experience dangerous imbalances. People with known vitamin deficiencies should avoid prolonged fasting.

**Prevention is Key:** During a prolonged fast, it's crucial to supplement with vitamins, electrolytes, and sea salt. This helps maintain balance and won't break your fast.

**Breaking Your Fast Safely:** Ease back into eating slowly with keto-friendly foods. Avoid carbohydrates, sugars, and non-keto foods, as they can worsen nutrient depletion. Start with small portions and gradually increase as your body adjusts.

**Important:** If you have any underlying health conditions, always consult your doctor before starting a prolonged fast.

## What Is The Initial Indicator Of A Vitamin A Deficiency

# What is the initial indicator of a vitamin A deficiency?

The primary indicator of a vitamin A deficiency often presents as night blindness, characterized by difficulty seeing in low-light conditions. This condition impairs the ability to discern objects clearly in dimly lit environments and may be erroneously attributed to a need for corrective lenses. Sufficient intake of retinol, the active form of vitamin A, is crucial for maintaining optimal vision across varying lighting conditions. It is advisable to seek medical consultation for accurate diagnosis and appropriate treatment if experiencing symptoms indicative of vitamin A deficiency.

## What Could Be Causing My Acne After Starting The Ketogenic Diet

# What could be causing my acne after starting the ketogenic diet?

Acne development after initiating a ketogenic diet may indicate that the version of keto you're following is not optimal or that you might be lacking certain essential nutrients. Generally, when adhering to a well-balanced and nutritious ketogenic diet, individuals often see an improvement in skin condition, including a reduction in acne.

One crucial nutrient for preventing acne is vitamin A. The synthetic version of vitamin A, such as Accutane, is used in severe cases, but it is advisable to focus on natural sources instead. Foods rich in retinol, such as egg yolks, liver, and butter, as well as certain dairy products like cheese, can significantly contribute to your vitamin A intake. It's important to note that the form of vitamin A found in animal products is more effective for skin health than the provitamin A found in plant sources. If acne persists, it may be beneficial to consult a healthcare professional for personalized recommendations.

## What Are The Potential Benefits Of Probiotics For Managing And Reducin Bf57C1

# What are the potential benefits of probiotics for managing and reducing dandruff, and how do they contribute to scalp health?

**The cause of dandruff is still unknown, but there are theories as to what causes it.** 

**What we know about dandruff:** 

• Dandruff occurs more in the winter

• People who have dandruff typically have more of a vitamin D deficiency 

• Dandruff is an imbalance between the fungus and the bacteria on the skin

• One type of fungus on the skin (malassezia) has more than doubled when you have dandruff

• There is an increase of staph bacteria on the skin when you have dandruff

• Antibiotics may help temporarily

• Steroids may help temporarily (but can suppress the immune system) 

• People with dandruff typically have a zinc deficiency 

Mycobiota is the friendly fungus and the yeast that grow inside and outside of the body. It’s an area that is rarely studied, but I believe it’s very important. 

**Friendly fungus and yeast are very beneficial—they do a lot for us. But they need to be in the right balance. There are a lot of conditions that can occur if a person doesn’t have the right balance of fungus and bacteria.** 

In my opinion, I think what’s really going on with dandruff is an imbalance of the friendly fungus and friendly bacteria. I don’t believe the solution is to start using chemicals and steroids to kill off the fungus or bacteria. Instead, I think a great remedy for dandruff is a natural antibiotic and a natural anti-fungal. 

**Potential remedies for dandruff:** 

1\. Garlic and oregano (take orally) 

2\. A probiotic that also has friendly yeast

## What Is Premenstrual Dysphoric Disorder Pmdd And How Does It Differ Fr 62E79E

# What is Premenstrual Dysphoric Disorder (PMDD), and how does it differ from typical premenstrual symptoms in terms of severity and impact on daily life?

Premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD) is a severe form of PMS or premenstrual syndrome.

**A few symptoms of premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD):**

• Bloating

• Headaches

• Breast tenderness

• Anxiety

• Depression

There seems to be a lot of information about PMDD but no information that’s going to help correct the problem. Most information is on how to live with the problem more comfortably. With PMDD, the person has a hormonal imbalance situation. Typically, estrogen is low, but progesterone is severely low. This can give the appearance of an estrogen dominance situation, but it’s not really an estrogen dominance situation.

**What you can do for PMDD:**

• Avoid all dairy

• Consume cruciferous vegetables or take DIM

• Consume sea kelp (iodine)

• Take vitamin D (10,000-20,000IU per day)

## What Is The Most Beneficial Nutrient For Managing Autoimmune Condition 092908

# What is the most beneficial nutrient for managing autoimmune conditions, and how does it support immune system regulation and overall health?

**Vitamin D and Autoimmune Disease: Dr. Coimbra's Insights**

According to Dr. Coimbra, patients with autoimmune diseases often have increased resistance to vitamin D, requiring higher doses than the average person. While general recommendations suggest 600 IU/day, some sources advocate for up to 10,000 IU/day safely.

**Key Points:**

\- Vitamin D acts as an immune regulator and reduces inflammation.

\- Resistance to vitamin D increases the risk of autoimmune diseases and other conditions.

**Causes of Vitamin D Resistance:**

\- Vitamin D polymorphism

\- Darker skin

\- Metabolic syndrome or insulin resistance

\- Obesity

\- Age

\- Lack of dietary vitamin D

\- Lack of sun exposure

**Coimbra Protocol:**

\- Dosage: 40,000 to 200,000 IU/day, guided by parathyroid hormone levels.

\- Avoid calcium and drink 2.5 liters of fluid daily to prevent hypercalcemia.

\- Consult a doctor experienced with the Coimbra protocol for proper guidance.

**Conclusion:**

Higher vitamin D doses may be necessary for autoimmune patients, but professional supervision is crucial.

## Which Foods Are Most Effective For Addressing Depression

# Which foods are most effective for addressing depression?

**The first thing that comes to mind would be vitamin D. Vitamin D.** There is another remedy that has been known to be very, very effective and it's called methylene blue. It's the first synthetic drug that ever was developed in medicine. But there's some interesting properties. It will make your urine turn blue, but apparently it's really good for depression. But vitamin D is really key. Also light therapy. And that would be the most potent.

**What foods are high in vitamin D?** Well, you have salmon, cod liver oil, things like that. There's not a lot of foods that have vitamin D in them. So enough anyway. So you might want to just take that as a supplement at least 20,000 IUs.

Now, if that is your problem, right? And you take 2000 IUs of vitamin D3 and you're like I tried vitamin D, it didn't work. Well, I've been doing a lot of valuations in people that have DNA problems. And I'm finding hands down the great majority of them nearly always have problems with vitamin D in the converting the inactive to the active in the absorption, which means that the average person that I've tested at (25:18) least needs to take a larger amounts of vitamin D than they were before to create the effects (25:23) that they're trying to create.

IMPORTANT: Do not take methylene blue with an SSRI or anti-anxiety medication. This combination can be lethal. Methylene blue has many known drug interactions. Always consult with your perscribing doctor and/or pharmacist before starting methylene blue use.

## What Is Copd

# What is COPD?

COPD, also known as emphysema, presents with symptoms like breathlessness, coughing, and mucus production. It can lead to pulmonary hypertension, stressing the heart's right ventricle and causing edema.

Strategies for managing COPD based on research include:

1\. Tocotrienols: 300 mg daily for potential lung support

2\. Vitamin D: 40,000 IUs to boost immunity and reduce inflammation.

3\. Fasting and keto diet: May help manage inflammation and improve overall health.

4\. Vitamin C: Supports immune function and reduces oxidative stress.

5\. Osha root and Mormon tea: Traditional remedies for respiratory health.

**6\. Vitamin B1: Important for energy and nerve function.**

**7\. Stop smoking: Essential to prevent further lung damage from smoke and nicotine.**

**These methods aim to alleviate symptoms, support lung function, and potentially slow COPD progression.**

## What Supplements Does Dr. Berg Recommend Taking While On The Healthy K B53E6E

# What supplements does Dr. Berg recommend taking while on the healthy Ketogenic Diet?

Dr. Berg recommends several supplements to take while on the ketogenic diet for optimal health and functionality. Here are some of them:

**1\. Magnesium:** Many people, even those who are not on the ketogenic diet, struggle with magnesium deficiency due to poor dietary choices and even certain medications that can deplete the body’s supply of magnesium. Ideally, keto dieters should make sure they are getting at least 200–400 mg of magnesium each day.

**2\. Omega-3 Fatty Acids:** Omega-3s can reduce inflammation, improve brain health, and decrease a person’s risk of heart disease, making them a very valuable item to have in your high-fat diet, either eaten as food or as a supplement.

**3\. Vitamin B5:** This vitamin is important for the conversion from sugar to fat burning; it helps in keto-adaptation and prevents ketogenic fatigue, flu, and rash.

**4\. Vitamin A:** This vitamin improves insulin resistance.

**5\. Vitamin D:** This vitamin also improves insulin resistance.

**6\. Choline:** This nutrient helps a fatty liver.

**7\. Minerals:** First up are the major minerals: potassium, magnesium, sodium, and calcium. These four are what are called electrolytes—electrically charged minerals that maintain fluid throughout your body. Trace minerals such as iron, manganese, and copper are also beneficial when you’re on a keto diet. Remember to consult with a healthcare professional before starting any new supplement regimen.

## What Are The Most Effective Natural Approaches For Managing And Treati 09Cb4D

# What are the most effective natural approaches for managing and treating autoimmune diseases?

An autoimmune disorder can occur when your immune system starts attacking healthy cells, and it can lead to a lot of damage and inflammation. Many autoimmune disorders start in the gut. Your body has protective mechanisms to keep pathogens from invading the gut. But, pathogens may be allowed to pass through the intestinal barrier if you have intestinal permeability, also known as leaky gut. This can lead to someone developing an autoimmune disease.

There is a certain protein called zonulin that regulates intestinal permeability, and it’s typically elevated in autoimmune diseases or inflammatory diseases. To find the best foods for autoimmune diseases, we need to look for foods that strengthen the intestinal barrier and keep zonulin in check. The number one thing that helps regulate zonulin is your own microbiome—it's crucial to support your microbiome.

**The best foods for autoimmune disorders:**

1\. Probiotic foods (sauerkraut, kimchi, kefir, or a probiotic supplement)

2\. Fermented vegetables

3\. Foods high in sulforaphane (broccoli sprouts or a sulforaphane supplement)

4\. Foods high in glutamine (red cabbage, grass-fed beef, eggs, fish)

5\. Foods high in omega-3 fats (cod liver oil, salmon, sardines)

**The most important nutrients for autoimmune conditions:**

1\. Zinc

2\. Vitamin D

3\. Vitamin A

**Things to avoid if you have an autoimmune disorder:**

• Antibiotics

• Glyphosate

• Gluten

• Glucose

• Fructose

• Vegetable oils

• Trans fats

## What Kind Of Diet Would You Recommend If I Have Psoriasis

# What kind of diet would you recommend if I have psoriasis?

For managing psoriasis, focus on:

1\. **L-Glutamine**: Strengthens the gut lining and supports gut health. Start with 1 gram daily, gradually increasing to 10 grams split into three doses on an empty stomach.

2\. **Tamanu oil**: Apply topically for its antibacterial and skin-healing properties.

3\. **Vitamin D3 and K2**: Take 10,000 IU of D3 and 100 mcg of K2 (MK7) daily to support immune function and skin health.

Avoid inflammatory vegetable oils and consider adopting a healthy keto diet with intermittent fasting to reduce inflammation and support your immune system. Periodic prolonged fasting may also help alleviate symptoms over time.

## Is It Ok To Take Testosterone

# Is it ok to take testosterone?

When considering testosterone supplementation, it's crucial to understand potential side effects, including worsened sleep apnea, mood swings, acne, and increased cardiovascular risk. Other effects may include reduced fertility, blood thickening, testicular atrophy, and erectile dysfunction.

Before starting testosterone supplements, identifying the underlying causes of low testosterone is essential. Factors such as aging, insulin resistance, low zinc or protein intake, a low-fat diet, statin use, high soy consumption, and deficiencies in vitamins A or D should be addressed.

Boosting testosterone naturally involves strategies like weight training, increasing zinc and vitamin D intake, prioritizing healthy fats over carbohydrates, using DHEA supplements, improving REM sleep, managing weight through a ketogenic diet and intermittent fasting, and ensuring adequate protein intake. These methods support natural hormone production and overall health without the potential risks associated with exogenous testosterone.

## What Is The Most Effective Meal For Promoting Arterial Health And Pote C7Ed5F

# What is the most effective meal for promoting arterial health and potentially reducing arterial plaque?

There is an interesting connection between your microbiome and your arteries. In mice studies, when the mice lack a healthy gut microbiome, they tend to develop a lot of inflammation. Inflammation in the arteries triggers a cascade of damaging effects. An overall imbalance of the microorganisms in the body can also lead to various problems in the arteries.

**One of the most important vitamins for the arteries is vitamin K2.** Vitamin K2 helps keep calcium buildup out of the arteries. The microbes in your gut have the ability to make vitamin K2, but fermented foods and fatty foods are also rich in vitamin K2. Keep in mind that vitamin K2 works better when taken with vitamin D3. For every 100 mcg of vitamin K2, consider taking 10,000 IU of vitamin D3.

Probiotics are crucial to support healthy arteries, and your friendly microbes are your natural probiotics. It’s important to support your microbiome and avoid sterile foods like pasteurized and over-processed foods.

**The best meal to clean out the arteries:**

• Brie cheese

• Fatty pork sausage

• Sauerkraut

Each of these foods is fermented and loaded with vitamin K2. Give them a try, and start adding other alive and fermented foods to your diet.

## What Is The Most Crucial Detoxifying Agent And Antioxidant For Liver Health

# What is the most crucial detoxifying agent and antioxidant for liver health?

To promote liver health and support recovery from damage caused by a high-carb diet, glutathione plays a crucial role:

\- Glutathione, a potent antioxidant, protects and repairs the liver, preventing conditions like fatty liver and reducing oxidative stress.

\- It detoxifies the liver, counters insulin resistance, and supports mitochondrial health.

\- Factors depleting glutathione include alcohol, stress, toxins, and poor diet.

\- Boost glutathione levels with foods like beef, fish, cruciferous vegetables, garlic, and onions, as well as supplements like NAC, curcumin, melatonin, vitamin D3, SAMe, and alpha-lipoic acid.

## What Are The Primary Causes Of Osteoporosis And How Do Factors Such As D973Ec

# What are the primary causes of osteoporosis, and how do factors such as age, hormonal changes, and lifestyle choices contribute to its development?

Osteoporosis means a severe loss of bone mass and density. Osteopenia is a lesser version of it. What is important to know is that consuming calcium (which is used as a general remedy) is not going to remedy it. Bone is made from protein, minerals and calcium--not just from calcium.

**Cause #1: Stress**

When you are undergoing stress, your adrenal glands produce cortisol (stress hormone). Cortisol in itself does damage your bones. When you are undergoing chronic stress, and your body is not recovering well from it, this can cause osteoporosis.

**Cause #2: Vitamin D and K2 deficiency**

VItamin D is a vital hormone for healthy functioning of your bones, immune system, mood etc. It increases the absorption of calcium by 20x. Additionally, vitamin K2 allocates free calcium units in the blood to needed tissues. Vitamin D and K2 work together. If you are deficient in them, this can cause osteoporosis.

## What Are The Key Symptoms Of Ulcerative Colitis And How Do These Manif E09972

# What are the key symptoms of ulcerative colitis, and how do these manifestations affect digestive health and overall well-being?

Ulcerative colitis is a condition where you have inflammation in your colon and/or rectum with ulcers and bleeding. It’s an autoimmune condition, which means your immune system is attacking your own healthy cells in the colon.

**How to treat it**

With this autoimmune condition, your own immune cells are creating constant inflammation and irritation of the colon. The solution would be to reduce the inflammation and heal your colon from this condition. The remedies below will help to achieve that.

**Remedies:**

- Avoid snacking

- Do intermittent fasting

- Consume vitamin D (at least 40,000 IU per day)

- Consume zinc

- Consume cabbage juice

- Consume VSL#3 (probiotic type)

    - 4 to 8 capsules per day for 2 months

    - start gradually to avoid causing an immune reaction

- Consume wheatgrass juice

- You may need to avoid vegetables for 1 to 2 months (except for the above).

## What Strategies Can I Employ To Help My Children Reduce Their Sugar Intake

# What strategies can I employ to help my children reduce their sugar intake?

Added sugars are everywhere, even in places you might not expect them. The average child consumes 66 pounds of added sugar every single year!

**Here are some sugary foods to avoid:**

• Sweetened milk

• Sweetened chocolate milk

• Sweetened tea

• Fruit juices

• Sodas

• Sports drinks

• Vitamin drinks

• Ketchup

• Sauces

• Breaded meats

• Chicken fingers

The best thing you can do for your kid’s health is to get them off of junk food! By removing sugar from the diet, you can get them to start burning fat instead of sugar.

**There are several benefits to burning fat instead of sugar:**

• Improved mood

• Improved cognitive function

• Improved ability to learn

• Stabilized blood sugars

The best way to get your kids to stop eating sugar is to substitute sugary foods with identical alternatives. Keto-friendly cookies, pies, and chocolates are all great alternative foods for kids, without the sugar. Keto bombs are also a great alternative to junk foods and other sugary foods. Keto bombs are similar to a cookie, but made completely of fat. You can use erythritol, xylitol, and stevia to sweeten treats instead of sugar. It may take a few days for your child to adjust, but removing sugar from your kid’s diet is a great choice for their health.

## Can Damage To Brain Cells Lead To The Phenomenon Of Brain Fog And What Eec50C

# Can damage to brain cells lead to the phenomenon of brain fog, and what specific mechanisms or conditions might facilitate this cognitive impairment?

Bruises—also known as contusions—happen when the capillaries under your skin have bled internally due to their weakness or due to impact. Bruising is very common, and not typically something to worry about. However, if you bruise very easily, this can be a sign of an underlying issue.

**Cause #1: Nutrient deficiencies**

Vitamins, minerals, and other nutrients are important for the healthy structure of blood vessels and the thickness of your blood. If you have a nutrient deficiency, this can weaken your capillaries or thin your blood, leading to excessive bleeding.

- **Calcium is vital for the healthy structure of your veins and capillaries. If you lack calcium, this can result in bruising easily.**

- **Vitamin D deficiency can cause an inability to absorb calcium, resulting in the above condition.**

- **Lack of vitamin K1. This vitamin helps your blood clot. If you have malabsorption or lack of bile (gallbladder not functioning properly or removed) this will create inability to absorb vitamins K1 and D).**

- **Lack of vitamin C. This has everything to do with keeping your capillaries strong. Without it, you lose collagen that surrounds your capillaries.**

- **Low vitamin B12 and low folate can cause insufficient amounts of thrombocytes (cells that help you with blood clotting.)**

## What Is Rheumatoid Arthritis And What Are The Common Symptoms Associat 8Ced0E

# What is rheumatoid arthritis, and what are the common symptoms associated with this autoimmune condition?

**Rheumatoid Arthritis**

Rheumatoid arthritis is an autoimmune disease causing joint pain on both sides of the body due to immune system attacks on healthy cells.

**Microbial Connection**

Studies link knee rheumatoid arthritis to bacteria like porphyromonas gingivalis found in knee and heart joints.

**Natural Antibiotics**

Test with natural antibiotics like goldenseal, tea tree oil, myrrh, garlic, thyme, oregano oil, and olive leaf extract to check if microbes are the cause.

**Supporting Immune System**

Boost immune health and reduce inflammation with vitamin D (20,000-60,000 IU/day), vitamin K2 (300 mcg/day), zinc (200 mg 3x/day for 1-2 weeks), Healthy Keto® diet, intermittent fasting, potassium (6,000 mg/day), ginger, turmeric, cinnamon, omega-3 fatty acids, ozone therapy, and thunder god vine (570 mg).

## Can Apple Cider Vinegar Either Irritate Or Soothe The Skin

# Can apple cider vinegar either irritate or soothe the skin?

The pH of the skin is 5.5 (acidic) – 7 is neutral, below 7 is acidic, and higher than 7 is alkaline. The sweat and the oil(sebum) in the skin are between 4 – 5.5 acidic.

The pH of apple cider vinegar is between 2 to 3 and is 100x more acid than skin so yes it could irritate and burn the skin. Always dilute it and don’t put it directly on your skin.

Dilute 1 tbsp. in an 8oz of water.

**Health Benefits of Apple Cider Vinegar for the Skin:**

1\. Reduce Bacteria

2\. Clean Pores

3\. Make the skin softer and more elastic \*it will not get rid of acne because it is a vitamin A or a situation where there are too many androgens coming from too much insulin.

## What Strategies Or Substances Can Effectively Enhance Insulin Sensitivity

# What strategies or substances can effectively enhance insulin sensitivity?

To understand insulin sensitivity, you need to understand insulin resistance. Insulin resistance is a situation where the receptor for insulin in your cells is blocking insulin. It’s not allowing insulin to go into the cells. You don’t have the function that insulin should have normally. Because of this, the body starts putting out more insulin. 

Insulin is very important to help regulate the blood sugars and to help with the absorption of nutrients. But, the more insulin resistance you have, the more insulin you’re going to have, and the more problems you’re going to have. For example, in the presence of insulin, you can’t lose weight. 

We want to improve insulin resistance by making insulin more sensitive.

**Help improve insulin sensitivity naturally by doing these things:**

1\. Resistance training 

2\. Fasting 

3\. Decrease inflammation 

4\. Reduce glucose (do healthy keto)

5\. Increase sleep

6\. Decrease stress (cortisol)

7\. Consume more vegetables (fiber)

**A few additional things to help increase insulin sensitivity:**

• Apple cider vinegar

• Cinnamon

• Omega 3 

• Vitamin D

## Are Grass Fed Meats Healthier Compared To Conventionally Raised Meats

# Are grass-fed meats healthier compared to conventionally raised meats?

Grass-fed means that animals were fed on grass. However, you should know that there is no legal definition for the word grass-fed. So you don’t know how long the animal was fed grass, in actuality. It could be several months, it could be a year, you don’t know. What is really important is that it says grass-finished. If it doesn’t say grass-finished, it means grain-finished, which has a difference in health benefits for the body. Ideally, you would want to have grass-fed, grass- finished, 100% certified organic food.

Grass-fed beef and other animal products are far better than grain-fed animal products. Comparing grass-fed to grain-fed animal products, grass-fed products have five times more omega-3 fatty acids. They also have much lower levels of omega-6 fatty acids, and that is ideal for the omega-3 to omega-6 ratio. Omega-6 fatty acids can be highly inflammatory in excess amounts.

Additionally, In grass-fed meat, there are three times more CLA, which is a powerful antioxidant. CLA is important for cardiovascular function.

**Benefits**

- Compared to regular meat, grass-fed meat contains far more

    • vitamins • minerals

    - antioxidants (carotenoids, which come from grass)

    - other vital nutrients

- Grass-fed meat is not heavy in omega-6 fatty acids, compared to grain-fed meat

- Grass-fed beef has CLA, and far more vitamin A and vitamin E

- Grass-fed meat doesn’t contain GMOs

**Where to get it**

You can get grass-fed meat at a grocery or health food store. Ideally, you want to consume grass-fed, grass-finished, 100% certified organic meats, eggs and dairy products. One company Dr. Berg personally uses is called U.S. Wellness Meats.

## What Are The Potential Causes Of Itchy And Red Eyes

# What are the potential causes of itchy and red eyes?

Having itchy, red eyes can create a number of difficulties in our daily lives. This condition can come from infections and allergies as well as nutritional deficiencies.

**Cause #1: Viral infection**

If you have an eye infection like pink eye, it can cause eye irritation, redness and inflammation. I suggest using colloidal silver as well as zinc and vitamin D to improve your immune system.

**Remedies:**

- Use 1 drop of colloidal silver in each eye 7 times per day

- Consume zinc

- Consume garlic

- Consume other natural antibiotics

Consume vitamin D

**Cause #2: Nutritional deficiencies**

There are several nutrients that your body needs for healthy functioning of the eyes. If you are deficient in them, this can create redness and irritation in the eyes.

\-If you are deficient in vitamin A, it can cause you to have dry eyes as well as a thickened mucus around the eyes that can result in itchiness and redness.

\-B vitamin deficiencies can cause redness or irritation in the eyes, especially B1 and B2 deficiencies.

\-Vitamin C helps keep veins and capillaries healthy and supports their work. If you have a small hemorrhage (bleeding) in the eye, vitamin C (along with vitamin K) can help repair it.

\-Vitamin D is one of the best nutritional anti-inflammatories; if you have red, irritated eyes, vitamin D can help resolve this condition.

**Remedies: Vitamin A:**

- Beef liver

- Egg yolks

- Cod liver oil

- Fatty fish

- Butter

- Cheese

    **B vitamins:**

- Nutritional yeast

- Eggs

- Meat

- Liver

- Fish

- Nuts

- Seeds

    **Vitamin C:**

- Sauerkraut

- Bell pepper

- Berries

- Raw lemons

    **Vitamin K:**

- Any type of dark leafy green

    **Vitamin D3:**

- Consume cod liver oil

- Get more exposure to the sun

- Take a vitamin D3 supplement

    **Improve the absorption of vitamins:**

- Consume apple cider vinegar (1 to 2 teaspoons stirred into about a cup of water)

- Consume betaine hydrochloride

• Take purified bile salts

**Cause #3: Allergies**

An allergy is an intolerance to certain foods or some substance in the environment (like pollen). If you have red, itchy eyes, there is a possibility that you have an allergy and your eyes are reacting to certain substances or food.

**Remedies:**

- Consume vitamin A

- Consume vitamin D

- Locate the source of the allergy by looking back and seeing what you were exposed to or what you ate before the eye irritation started, then avoid it.

    **Cause #4: High-carb diet**

    When you are on a high-carb diet your blood sugars elevate too high after eating. As a result your tear glands can stop producing tears. Insulin can also affect the blood flow to the nerve that goes to the cornea. Additionally, if you feel that there is something in the eye but nothing is in there, this is a sign of a blood sugar / insulin problem.

    **Remedies:**

- Avoid sugar and refined carbs

- Avoid snacking

- Do the Healthy Keto® diet

- Do an intermittent fasting plan

    **Other causes:**

- Blue lights causing irritation

- Lack of sleep

- Low blood sugar

- Anemia

- Lack of essential pancreatic enzymes

- Liver/gallbladder problem

- Alcohol

- IBS

## What Are The Potential Reasons For Memory Loss

# What are the potential reasons for memory loss?

Symptoms of memory loss have to do with the hippocampus. The hippocampus is an area of the brain that is responsible for short-term, long-term and spatial memory (remembering things that are located somewhere--for example where you parked your car).

**Cause #1: Nutritional deficiency**

There are several nutrients that are vital for the healthy functioning of the brain. If you are deficient in those nutrients, the hippocampus is the part of your brain that will be affected most. The good thing is that it can regenerate if you restore your normal levels of the nutrients.

\- Vitamin B1 is a very important vitamin for healthy brain function, as well as for your nervous system.

\- Vitamin D has many health-related functions, including healthy development and upkeep of the brain. Out of all brain areas that are affected by a D deficiency, the hippocampus feels the lack of vitamin D most.

\- If you are deficient in zinc (mineral) your hippocampus won’t work properly, resulting in short- term memory problems.

\- Additionally, If your brain doesn’t have enough oxygen this can result in damage to the hippocampus.

**Remedies:**

- Restore vitamin B1 in your body:

    - take nutritional yeast

    - avoid refined carbs and sugar

    - avoid things and people that stress you out

    - take long walks

- Restore vitamin D in your body:

    - take vitamin D3 (10,000 to 20,000 IU daily)

    - take virgin cod liver oil

- Restore zinc in your body:

    - consume beef liver

    - consume shellfish

    - take a zinc supplement

- Restore oxygen in your body:

    - exercise

    - take long walks outside daily (at least 45 minutes)

    - hyperbaric oxygen therapy

**Cause #2: High-carb diet**

If you are on a high-carb diet this can result in a brain starvation as blood sugar is not the best source of fuel for your brain, including the hippocampus. There is another type of fuel that your brain loves: ketones (a byproduct of your body burning its own fat). Additionally, intermittent fasting will trigger certain processes that will regenerate your hippocampus.

**Remedies:**

- Avoid refined carbs and sweets

- Avoid snacking

- Take MCT oil (source of ketones)

- Take exogenous ketones supplement

- Do the Healthy Keto® diet

- Do intermittent fasting

**Cause #3: High cortisol**

Cortisol is a stress hormone that is being produced by your adrenals (stress-regulating glands). High amounts of cortisol can damage your hippocampus. The solution to that would be to improve your mental and physical stress resistance and recovery.

**Remedies:**

- Consume vitamin B1:

• nutritional yeast • benfotiamine

- Improve sleep (take naps if needed)

- Take long walks outside daily (at least 45 minutes)

- Avoid things or people that stress you out

- You can also take my Adrenal & Cortisol Support

- You can also take my Adrenal Stress Advanced Formula

**Other causes:**

- Aging (Healthy Keto + intermittent fasting will help)

## What Are The Primary Causes Of Tetany

# What are the primary causes of tetany?

Muscle twitches or tetany are erratic little nerve impulses that can start anywhere in your body. They usually go away pretty quickly.

**Cause #1: Nutrient deficiency**

If you have a certain electrolyte deficiency--specifically calcium and magnesium--you can have muscle twitches at different places in your body. These electrolytes are responsible for normal functioning of the body, including relaxation of muscles.

Additionally, manganese is needed for a certain part of the brain that is involved in suppressing abnormal muscle movement. If you are deficient in it, you can also experience tetany.

**Cause #2: Alkalosis**

If you have a too-alkaline body pH it can result in tetany. The reason behind this is that when your body pH is higher than it should be, it can result in inability to correctly utilize calcium that is in your body. Calcium is an electrolyte that is needed for healthy muscle function in the body. The solution would be to acidify your body.

**Other causes:**

- Tourette’s syndrome

- High stress

- Tardive dyskinesia

- Dystonia

- Psych drugs

- Tranquilizers

- Brain damage

- Insulin resistance

- Diuretics

- Antibiotics

- Low vitamin D

- Fluoride

- Parathyroid problem

- Calcium carbonate

## What Are The Potential Causes Of Short Term Memory Loss

# What are the potential causes of short-term memory loss?

Short-term memory loss can create a lot of difficulties that make life harder. The area of the brain that is responsible for your short-term memory is called the hippocampus. Any type of damage to the hippocampus can cause problems with memory in general.

**Symptoms:**

- Asking the same questions repeatedly

- Forgetting where you just put something

- Forgetting recent events

- Forgetting something you saw or read recently

**Cause #1: Nutritional deficiency**

There are several nutrients that are vital for the healthy functioning of the brain. If you are deficient in these nutrients, the hippocampus will be affected most. The good thing is that it can regenerate if you restore your normal levels of those nutrients.

\-Vitamin B1 is a very important vitamin for healthy brain function as well as for your nervous system.

\-Vitamin D has many health-related functions, including healthy development and upkeep of the brain. Out of all the brain areas that are affected by vitamin D deficiency, the hippocampus feels the deficiency most.

\-If you are deficient in zinc (mineral) your hippocampus won’t work properly, resulting in a short-term memory problem.

\-If your brain doesn’t have enough oxygen this can result in damage of the hippocampus.

**Cause #2: High-carb diet**

If you are on a high-carb diet this can result in brain starvation because blood sugar is not the best source of fuel for the healthy functioning of the brain, including the hippocampus. There is another type of fuel that your brain loves: ketones (a byproduct of your body burning its own fat). Additionally, intermittent fasting will trigger certain processes that will regenerate your hippocampus.

## What Are The Key Benefits Of Uv Radiation And How Does It Aid Vitamin  975662

# What are the key benefits of UV radiation, and how does it aid vitamin D synthesis, skin health, and therapeutic uses?

Many people think they need to avoid ultraviolet radiation—their first thought may even be that it causes cancer. Today we're going to talk about the potent anti-inflammatory effects of UV radiation and its other benefits. UV radiation is a part of the spectrum of energy from the sun. Humans have adapted over time to survive the sun's radiation and use it to our advantage.

Ultraviolet radiation is the only part of the sun's energy that helps the body make vitamin D, which is essential. Vitamin D is one of the most important vitamins for your immune system and is an incredibly potent anti-inflammatory. While chronic exposure to UV radiation is unhealthy and can increase your risk of certain skin cancers, it may have significant health benefits in small doses.

Too much exposure to ultraviolet radiation can also cause wrinkles, loss of collagen, and aging spots. But having enough antioxidants in your skin may help protect you from these issues. If you build up the antioxidants in your skin—in small doses, the benefits of ultraviolet radiation may outweigh the negatives.

**Potential benefits of UV radiation:**

• It has an anti-inflammatory effect

• It may contribute to decreasing your risk of autoimmune diseases

• It may help reduce the risk of TB

• It may help suppress the symptoms of certain skin conditions

• It may help reduce pain

• It may help regulate cortisol

• It can help increase nitric oxide

• It has reparative actions

• It may help elevate your mood and balance serotonin

## What Are The Underlying Causes Of Scoliosis Kyphosis And Lordosis

# What are the underlying causes of scoliosis, kyphosis, and lordosis?

Scoliosis, kyphosis and lordosis are abnormal curves of your spine that can cause a lot of difficulties and pain, especially in your back.

**Symptoms:**

- Scoliosis: s-curve of the spine

- Kyphosis: hunched back

- Lordosis: lower back curved too far in

**Cause #1: Vitamin D deficiency**

Vitamin D has a lot to do with your skeletal structure as well as with bone health. If you are deficient in vitamin D this can cause scoliosis, kyphosis and lordosis--along with other problems.

Vitamin D increases the absorption of calcium by 20 times. Also consuming vitamin K2 will increase the movement of free calcium in the blood to the needed tissues and bones.

## What Are The Underlying Causes Of Melancholic Depression

# What are the underlying causes of melancholic depression?

Melancholy is sadness and depression and generally feeling down. Interestingly enough it comes from a Greek word that means “black bile.”

**Cause #1: Gallbladder issues**

Bile is a liquid that is being produced by your liver and is stored in your gallbladder. If you have a lack of bile production in your body, whether due to gallbladder or liver issues, this can cause severe melancholy.

The reason is that if you lack bile you will not be able to absorb vitamin D and DHA (a type of omega-3 fat that is needed for a good emotional state, among other things) from your diet. These 2 nutrients, if deficient, can have the side effect of severe depression.

## What Is The Remedy For The Liver Cirrhosis Caused By Hepatitis C

# What is the remedy for the liver cirrhosis caused by Hepatitis C?

When you have hepatitis C or some other virus attacking the liver, this may cause high amounts of iron in the body. The iron is inflammatory and creates oxidative damage. Normally your liver gets rid of excess iron in the body. However if your liver is infected, for example with hepatitis C, it will not be able to remove this iron, which will cause further damage. One thing to know is that viruses and bacteria grow by consuming iron. This situation can eventually turn into cirrhosis of the liver.

**Remedies:**

- Consume lactoferrin

- Do an intermittent fasting plan

- Do periodic prolonged fasting

- Consume vitamin D (at least 20,000 IU / day)

- Consume natural antibiotics

    - garlic

    - clove

    - thyme

    - oregano oil

    - grapefruit seed extract

**\*We recommend consulting with your doctor before making any dietary changes or before you start taking any new supplements, especially if you have any existing health conditions.**

The solution is to support your adrenals and address your stress directly. Those can normalize the level of cortisol (not too low and not too high). Additionally, improving your sleep is going to be very beneficial for your adrenals and fat burning.

**Remedies:**

- Consume vitamin B1

- benfotiamine

- nutritional yeast

- Improve your sleep (take naps if needed)

- Take long walks outside daily (at least 45 minutes)

- Regularly exercise (but don’t overtrain)

- Avoid things/people that stress you out

- Consume vitamin D

- Consume adaptogens

- Consume calcium

- Consume potassium

- Consume magnesium

- You can also use this Massage Tool

- General remedies to help with belly fat:

    - do reverse sit-ups exercise

    - consume purified bile salts

    - consume fermented vegetables

    - consume probiotics

    - consume apple cider vinegar (1 to 2 teaspoons stirred into about a cup of water)

    - consume potassium

    - consume chromium

    - consume MCT oil

    - do HIIT exercises with high amounts of rest between sets

## Is The Zinc With Magnesium Vitamin D3 And Selenium Vegan Or Vegetarian D02030

# Is the Zinc with Magnesium, Vitamin D3 and Selenium vegan or vegetarian-Friendly?

Our Zinc with Magnesium, Vitamin D3, and Selenium is not vegan because it contains vitamin D3 derived from lanolin, which comes from sheep’s wool. While no animals are harmed, lanolin is still animal-derived, making it unsuitable for a vegan diet.

It is, however, vegetarian-friendly, as it contains no meat, poultry, fish, or slaughter byproducts, and all other ingredients are plant- or mineral-based.

## What Foods Should Be Incorporated Into The Diet To Effectively Lower C 9B9Fb7

# What foods should be incorporated into the diet to effectively lower cholesterol levels, and how do their specific nutrients contribute to heart health and improved lipid profiles?

However, keep in mind that if you have a genetic problem called familial hypercholesterolemia or if you are a hyper responder, this information will not apply.

**Health benefits of cholesterol:**

• It helps make hormones

• It helps make vitamin D

• It supports cell membranes

• It supports the brain

• It supports the immune system

• It’s needed to make bile salts

Egg yolks are one of the highest sources of cholesterol-mobilizing nutrients: choline and lecithin. One egg gives you about 186 mg of cholesterol. But, the body makes about 3000 mg of cholesterol a day. Dietary cholesterol isn’t associated with increased cholesterol. There are also no studies that show that consuming eggs negatively affects the cardiovascular system. In one study, they found that certain phytonutrients in eggs improved the cholesterol profile in a group of people on a low-carb diet. Egg yolks are also loaded with vitamin K2, which supports a healthy heart.

Grass-fed butter also has an incredible influence over cholesterol, and if you can find cultured butter, then that’s even better. Cultured butter has the added benefit of friendly bacteria that help boost the benefits of butter.

Your friendly microbes make bile salts, which help mobilize and regulate cholesterol. Butter is also a good source of vitamin K2 and is great for anyone going through menopause because cholesterol is needed to support hormones. One study shows that butter has a neutral association with cardiovascular disease and diabetes. Beta-carotene, which is high in butter, may also help lower cholesterol. Butter is also rich in CLA, butyric acid, and omega-3 fatty acids, which may benefit healthy cholesterol.

## What Are The Potential Causes Of Vertigo

# What are the potential causes of vertigo?

One cause is having mucus in your sinuses. Another cause is having calcium deposits in the inner ear.

What is potentially behind these problems?

- Too much calcium – Flunarizine is a drug that acts as a calcium antagonist. This means that it blocks calcium. If your situation gets better on this drug, this is a sign that your vertigo is related to too much calcium.

- Not enough vitamin D – New studies show that low levels of vitamin D may contribute to vertigo. Vitamin D is involved in calcium metabolism and regulation. It is also important for promoting the normal function of the immune system, which can potentially reduce sinus congestion.

- Low vitamin K2 – Vitamin K2 helps remove calcium from the wrong places in your body. It then transports the calcium to the bones.

The best remedies for vertigo are:

- Vitamin D3 (10,000 IU/day)

- Vitamin K2 - MK7 version (100 mcg/day)

## What Are Some Intriguing Facts Regarding Vitamin D Including Its Physi 71Ad51

# What are some intriguing facts regarding vitamin D, including its physiological roles, sources, and the implications of deficiency on overall health?

Vitamin D is responsible for the 20x increase in calcium absorption in the small intestine. It also increases the absorption of iron, magnesium, zinc, and phosphate to mineralize the bone and support other tissues in the body. However, it has to be activated through an enzyme in the liver and kidney.

Vitamin D is very important in controlling immunity to viruses, especially in the lungs and in autoimmune diseases. Make sure to take vitamin K2 when you take vitamin D because it helps deliver calcium to the bone.

Possible Causes of Vitamin D Deficiency:

• Liver Damage

• Kidney Damage

• Fatty Liver

• Cirrhosis of the liver

• Kidney Dialysis

Importance of Vitamin D

• 20x increase in absorption of calcium

• Increases absorption of iron, magnesium, zinc, and phosphate

• Controls immunity to viruses

• Can turn off asthma symptoms

• Strong bones

• Prevents deformation of bones

• Prevents chronic muscle/skeletal pain

Vitamin D Deficiency

• Weak and Fragile Bones

• Bones Fracture Easily

• Bowed Legs

• Bending of Spine

Hypercalcemia Signs and Symptoms: (Too much calcium)

• Increased excessive urination

• Increased thirst

• Insomnia

• Nervousness

• Itching

## I Had A Cheat Day. Now How Do I Recover

# I had a cheat day. Now how do I recover?

Take these nutrients individually to recover faster from a cheat meal: 

- Magnesium

- Potassium

- Vitamin B1

- Vitamin D

They will help stabilize your blood sugar, improve insulin resistance, and buffer the effects of high sugar to a certain degree.

Incorporate exercise to burn up the excess sugar that you have consumed.

Get right on a fasting program. Fast longer to make up the damage from the cheat meal. This will bring your insulin back down to where you need it to be, and your body will burn up the excess sugar and tap into fat again.

When you go off the keto plan do not spread this out over a long period of time. Do it for a short period of time and get right back on. The longer you are off, the harder it will be to get back.

## What Health Issues Can Arise From Low Cortisol Levels

# What health issues can arise from low cortisol levels?

Cortisol has a lot of benefits for overall health. However, cortisol levels that are too high or low can be a problem. One of the causes of low cortisol is cortisol resistance. This means you had high levels of cortisol (stress) for a long time, and the receptors for cortisol started to downgrade. Now, you can’t absorb cortisol anymore. Your cells can’t get the benefits of cortisol despite having high levels of cortisol. You essentially have both high cortisol and low cortisol, as well as the bad side effects that accompany both of these issues.

Potential side effects of low cortisol include:

• Inflammation

• Arthritis

• Low immunity

• Allergies

• Asthma

• Low stress tolerance

• Low vitamin D

• Poor memory

## Can Adrenal Fatigue Cause Weight Gain

# Can adrenal fatigue cause weight gain?

It depends on how chronic the fatigue is. If you have an issue with chronic stress, as opposed to only having occasional stress events, then there may be some weight gain. It also depends on your diet. If you have a bad diet and chronic stress, the situation is going to be far worse. There's a condition called Cushing's syndrome, which is characterized by high cortisol or hypercortisolism. Cortisol is known as the stress hormone, and the adrenal glands are responsible for creating it. It begins gradually and gets worse as time passes. The starting point is adrenal fatigue. Symptoms to look out for include:

• Visceral fat

• High blood pressure

• Round face

• Red cheeks

• Fatigue

• Anxiety

• Buffalo hump

• Fat-collar bone

• Thin skin

• Decreased libido

• Hypokalemia

• Low vitamin D

• Insomnia

## Should I Take A Separate Magnesium Supplement In Addition To The Magne 9Ebd6D

# Should I take a separate magnesium supplement in addition to the magnesium included in the D3/K2 formula?

The magnesium included in the D3 & K2 formula is specifically there to support the activation of vitamin D3. It is largely utilized during the conversion and metabolic processes required for D3 to function effectively in the body. With that, the magnesium present in this product is not intended to contribute meaningfully to daily magnesium intake and should not be counted toward overall magnesium requirements.

## Can A Frail Senior Parent Do Intermittent Fasting

# Can a frail senior parent do Intermittent Fasting?

**CONS**

• If your parent is thin, you don’t want them to lose weight

**PROS**

• Neurogenesis

• Increase Stem Cells

• Extend Life

Do a version of intermittent fasting that doesn’t restrict the calories. Calculate the calories and push them into two meals or less frequently without reducing the calories. Make sure that the fat is high enough to prevent weight loss.

The key is to keep their calorie intake high which also means to keep the fat higher. Add fermented vegetables because it is very important for the elderly to start establishing the flora and getting the pH correct. Vitamin K2 is vital as well because it helps remove calcification as we age. It also improves and strengthens the output of the mitochondria.

**Recommended K2:** 100mg – 10,000IUs of vitamin D (MK7 version)

**Stomach Support:** Betaine Hydrochloride or Apple Cider Vinegar

## What Is The Transdermal Magnesium

# What is the transdermal magnesium?

**Many people take transdermal magnesium oil for:**

- Joint pain relief

- Muscle pain

- Leg cramps 

- Fibromyalgia

While transdermal magnesium is good for people who overtrain when working out, if these issues are ongoing, it would be beneficial to consider a deeper cause.

Fibromyalgia is almost always connected to the gallbladder. 

The purpose of magnesium is to provide a mineral for over 400 enzymes that generate ATP, repair DNA and RNA, promote muscle relaxation and nerve conductivity, and help with the production of muscle protein.

You also need magnesium to make vitamin D work. Vitamin D is one of the main anti-inflammatory vitamins.

- Cold or burning pain

- Feeling of ants crawling on your skin

- Body parts feel heavy

- Hypersensitivity to pain; or, conversely, low pain sensitivity

By far the most common cause of paraesthesia is a high carbohydrate diet. By this I mean a diet with too much sugar, or refined carbs such as bread, pasta, crackers, and the like. This is because a high carb diet primarily causes a B vitamin deficiency. And this explains why most diabetics, who are told to follow a high carb diet, have issues with peripheral neuropathy, nerve damage, and paraesthesia.

## What Is The Best Tactic If I Want To Wake Up Refreshed

# What is the best tactic if I want to wake up refreshed?

The most important factor in quality sleep and waking up feeling refreshed is the sleep hormone called melatonin. Melatonin is triggered when you aren’t exposed to light. When it’s dark at night, and less light is shining into your eye, it activates the pineal gland, which then turns serotonin into melatonin. This makes you tired.

Any light source can potentially turn off the pineal gland and melatonin production. Melatonin is also vitally important for your immune system. Melatonin has numerous other functions as well. It’s used as an antioxidant, which helps prevent free-radicle damage. The problem with taking melatonin supplements is that your body then makes less of it. It’s not a fix to your problems. As you age, your melatonin decreases. This can cause poor sleep and immune function as you get older. It can also cause inflammation in the body.

**This is how you can enhance melatonin production before bed:**

1\. Lights out before bed

2\. Water filter for removing fluoride

3\. Glycine

4\. Reduce blue light exposure

5\. Get sun and vitamin D during the day

6\. Lower stress, caffeine, and alcohol

7\. Keep your bedroom cool

8\. Avoid EMFs

## What Is The Most Effective Remedy To Reverse Wrinkles

# What is the most effective remedy to reverse wrinkles?

In this video, we’re going to talk about how to reverse wrinkles. GAG (glycosaminoglycan) helps hydrate and repair the skin and collagen, and helps make collagen. The hormone that controls GAG is IGF-1 (insulin-like growth factor 1). IGF-1 is triggered by growth hormone, which is the anti-aging hormone. There are a few things you can do to actually trigger this hormone naturally. 

How to reverse wrinkles:

1\. Lower insulin (do healthy keto and intermittent fasting) 

2\. Enhance your sleep and lower cortisol 

3\. Do HIIT (high-intensity interval training) 

4\. Consume a moderate amount of quality protein (3-6 oz. with each meal) 

5\. Enhance the liver (avoid alcohol, eat organic, consume a lot of vegetables, take supplements to support the liver) 

6\. Do Intermittent fasting (IGF-1 is stimulated when you’re not eating) 

7\. Take fat-soluble vitamins (vitamin A, vitamin D, and vitamin K2)

## What Are The Benefits Of Castor Oil For Skin If I Want To Get An Anti  36339B

# What are the benefits of castor oil for skin if I want to get an anti-aging effect?

Castor oil can naturally give your skin a soft, glowing, firm look. It’s the best remedy for wrinkles or dry skin. Castor oil contains ricinoleic acid, a penetrating moisturizer for your skin and hair. It also has powerful anti-inflammatory and antimicrobial effects. Many skin-related problems are caused by an overgrowth of bacteria, yeast, or fungus. Castor oil is the perfect antidote—you can even use it for acne. Castor oil contains vitamin E, which can protect your skin from UV radiation and pollution. It has potent wound-healing properties and can help fade dark spots for an even complexion.

Castor oil contains beta-carotene, the precursor to vitamin A, which supports the skin. It also contains magnesium and potassium. Evidence suggests castor oil can help stimulate collagen synthesis, which is vital for anti-aging. Apply castor oil routinely to scars, stretch marks, and acne scars to help them fade.

Many people dilute castor oil with other oils, such as coconut or olive oil, because of its thick and sticky texture. It can also be used as is.

Take a couple of drops and rub them into your skin, focusing on dry, wrinkled, reddened, or irritated areas.

Try using castor oil before bed, so it has plenty of time to penetrate the skin. Be careful using castor oil around the pelvic area or abdomen if you’re pregnant, as it can induce labor.

To use castor oil for hair growth, massage it into your scalp. This can help stimulate hair growth, especially if you have alopecia. You can also rub a few drops through your hair before bed. Look for organic, cold-pressed, hexane-free castor oil for the best quality and the most benefits.

Many people have seen positive effects from Jamaican black castor oil.

You can also use castor oil for eyelashes! Apply a small amount of castor oil to the root of your eyelashes daily to strengthen and lengthen your eyelashes. You don’t have to worry about the toxin in castor oil because it’s eliminated in the manufacturing process.

## Why Do We Use The Synthetic Form Of Vitamin K2 Mk 7 In Our Vitamin D3  28505E

# Why do we use the synthetic form of Vitamin K2 (MK-7) in our Vitamin D3 & K2 products?

While Dr. Berg recommends obtaining MK-7 vitamin K2 from natural food sources like natto and aged cheeses, sourcing it for supplement manufacturing can be challenging. Synthetic MK-7 vitamin K2 is commonly used in supplements because it is more accessible, scalable, stable, and consistent in potency than natural sources. It allows for precise usage and has a longer shelf life. Additionally, synthetic MK-7 is often allergen-free, vegan-friendly, and sometimes formulated for better absorption. All these factors make the synthetic form of MK-7 a more reliable option for supplements.

Studies have shown that synthetic MK-7 is bioequivalent to natural MK-7, indicating that the body processes it similarly. Dr. Berg Nutritionals uses the trans form of MK-7 vitamin K2, which is superior due to its higher bioavailability, longer active blood circulation time, and more effective activation of key proteins associated with bone and artery health than cis forms. It provides benefits at lower doses and is the biologically active form that the body can readily utilize.

## Why Was Magnesium Citrate Used In Vitamin D3K2 Instead Of Magnesium Glycinate

# Why was magnesium citrate used in Vitamin D3K2 instead of magnesium glycinate?

We opted for magnesium citrate in our D3 & K2 vitamin formula due to capsule size limitations. Achieving the desired 25mg of magnesium requires less volume with magnesium citrate than with magnesium glycinate. Using magnesium glycinate would have made it impossible to fit all the necessary ingredients into a single capsule.

## Nac And Glutathione A Powerful Partnership

# NAC and Glutathione: A Powerful Partnership

NAC's primary mechanism of action is increasing the body's levels of glutathione. Glutathione is a vital antioxidant that protects cells from oxidative stress and damage caused by free radicals and toxins. When the body is exposed to excessive toxins or experiences high levels of oxidative stress, glutathione can become depleted, leading to cellular damage, particularly in organs like the liver. 

Glutathione helps the body by: 

- Detoxifying xenobiotics (poisons) 

- Combating free radical damage 

- Counteracting the effects of hydrogen peroxide 

- Chelating heavy metals 

- Reducing pathogens 

- Decreasing oxidative stress 

Factors Affecting Glutathione Levels: 

Low glutathione levels can be associated with various conditions, including: 

- Cancer 

- HIV 

- Infections 

- Trauma and burns 

- Chronic diseases and inflammation 

- Overtraining 

- Poisoning 

- Diabetes 

Other Nutrients that Support Glutathione Production: 

Beyond NAC, other nutrients can also help boost glutathione levels, such as: 

- Alpha-lipoic acid (ALA) 

- Vitamin D 

- SAMe (S-Adenosylmethionine)

## What Brand Of Beef Liver Supplement Does Dr. Berg Recommend

# What brand of beef liver supplement does Dr. Berg recommend?

**Beef Liver Supplements: A Nutrient Powerhouse** 

While Dr. Berg doesn't have a specific brand recommendation for **beef liver supplements**, he emphasizes the importance of finding a product that is both **grass-fed and grass-finished**. This ensures you're getting the highest quality supplement with the most beneficial nutrient profile. 

Beef liver is truly a superfood, packed with an incredible array of vitamins, minerals, and other essential nutrients. It's an excellent natural source of: 

- **Vitamin A (Retinol):** Crucial for vision, immune function, and skin health. 

- **B Vitamins (especially B12, Folate, Riboflavin):** Vital for energy production, nerve function, and red blood cell formation. 

- **Iron (Heme Iron):** Highly bioavailable iron, important for oxygen transport and preventing anemia. 

- **Copper:** Essential for iron metabolism, energy production, and connective tissue. 

- **Choline:** Supports liver function, brain health, and metabolism. 

- **CoQ10:** An antioxidant important for cellular energy.  

**Best Practices for Buying Beef Liver Supplements:** 

When you're looking to purchase a beef liver supplement, here are the key recommendations to ensure you're getting a top-quality product: 

1. **Grass-Fed and Grass-Finished:** This is the most crucial factor. "Grass-fed" means the cattle ate grass for most of their lives, but "grass-finished" means they continued to eat grass right up until harvest. This ensures a superior nutrient profile and avoids grains that can impact the animal's health and the quality of the liver. 

2. **Desiccated (Freeze-Dried):** Look for supplements that are "desiccated" or "freeze-dried." This gentle drying process preserves the heat-sensitive vitamins, enzymes, and cofactors naturally found in raw liver, retaining its nutritional integrity. 

3. **No Fillers:** A high-quality beef liver supplement should contain only beef liver.  

4. **Non-GMO and Hormone-Free:** Ensure the product comes from animals not treated with hormones or antibiotics, and that their feed (if any, though grass-finished is ideal) is non-GMO. 

5. **Third-Party Tested:** Reputable brands will often have their products third-party tested for purity, potency, and to ensure they are free from heavy metals or other contaminants. Look for this information on the product label or the company's website. 

By focusing on these criteria, you can confidently choose a high-quality beef liver supplement to support your nutritional needs!

## What Brand Of Melatonin Does Dr. Berg Recommend

# What brand of melatonin does Dr. Berg recommend?

**Melatonin: Beyond Just Sleep** 

While Dr. Berg doesn't have a specific brand recommendation for **melatonin**, it's important to understand that its benefits extend far beyond just being a sleep aid. 

It's true that your body naturally produces melatonin, and you can support these levels through diet and lifestyle. We'll get into those tips shortly. However, I'm not recommending that you take melatonin supplements unless you're using it for a specific condition, as your body is designed to make its own. 

**Surprising Benefits of Melatonin** 

Here are 12 lesser-known but significant benefits of melatonin you should be aware of: 

1. Acts as a **potent antioxidant**. 

2. **Improves the immune system**. 

3. **Reduces inflammation**. 

4. **Decreases headaches**. 

5. Helps **fight against cancer**. 

6. Helps **protect your brain and memory**. 

7. **Decreases Luteinizing Hormone (LH)**, which is linked to Alzheimer's disease. 

8. **Improves GERD symptoms**. 

9. **Lowers anxiety**. 

10. Helps **fight depression**. 

11. **Stabilizes blood sugars**. 

For the therapeutic benefit of lowering Luteinizing Hormone, Dr. Berg suggests a higher dosage: **75 mg for women and 125 mg for men**. 

**How to Naturally Boost Your Melatonin Levels** 

You can significantly improve your body's natural melatonin production through these lifestyle adjustments: 

- **Avoid light at night:** This includes bright overhead lights. 

- **Get plenty of sun and vitamin D during the day:** Exposure to natural light during the day helps regulate your circadian rhythm. 

- **Decrease your exposure to blue light in the evening:** This means limiting screens (phones, tablets, computers, TVs) before bed or using blue light filters. 

- **Avoid eating before bed:** Give your digestive system a break before sleep. 

- **Get your glucose under control:** A low-carb keto diet can be very helpful here. 

- **Avoid TV before bed:** The light and stimulation can interfere with melatonin production.  

**Best Practices for Buying Melatonin Supplements** 

If you do decide to purchase a melatonin supplement for a specific condition, here are some best practices to ensure you're getting a quality product: 

1. **Look for "Pharmaceutical Grade" or "USP Verified":** These designations indicate that the product meets strict quality, purity, and potency standards. 

2. **Check the Dosage:** Melatonin dosages can range widely. Be sure the product offers the specific dosage you're looking for, especially if you're aiming for higher therapeutic amounts. 

3. **Read the "Other Ingredients":** Opt for products with minimal fillers, artificial colors, flavors, or preservatives. Simpler is often better. 

4. **Reputable Brand:** Choose well-known, transparent brands that are clear about their sourcing and manufacturing processes. 

5. **Third-Party Testing:** Some brands will have their products tested by independent third-party labs to verify purity and accuracy of ingredients. This information is often available on their website or the product label.

## Why Is Zinc An Important Trace Mineral

# Why is zinc an important trace mineral?

Zinc is an essential mineral vital for numerous bodily functions. It is particularly crucial for the senses of smell and taste; a deficiency can impair these senses, potentially affecting appetite and food choices. Zinc is also necessary for the body to utilize Vitamin A, and a deficiency in either can impact vision, especially night vision. Globally, zinc deficiency is a significant health issue, tragically contributing to child mortality from conditions like diarrhea in certain regions. A contributing factor to deficiency, even when zinc is consumed, is the presence of phytic acid in foods like cereals, which can block zinc absorption. Furthermore, zinc is important for maintaining gut health and the integrity of the intestinal barrier.

## How Can You Create A Meal With All Essential Vitamins And What Ingredi 2Af96F

# How can you create a meal with all essential vitamins, and what ingredients ensure a balanced nutritional profile?

**Let's explore the best food sources for essential vitamins and minerals.**

**Protein:** Grass-fed beef, lamb, and goat offer high-quality protein.

**Vitamin A:** While carrots are rich in beta-carotene, the active form is retinol. Liver, fish, cod liver oil, and egg yolks are excellent sources of retinol.

**Iron:** Heme iron from liver and red meat is more readily absorbed than non-heme iron from plants.

**B Vitamins:** Red meat, fish, eggs, cheese, and liver are packed with B vitamins. While grains contain B vitamins, phytic acid can hinder absorption. Nutritional yeast and sunflower seeds are also good sources.

**Collagen:** Consuming skin, bone broth, and organ meats can help increase collagen intake.

**Vitamin D:** Sunlight is the best source, but cod liver oil, sardines, and fatty fish provide vitamin D3. Supplements can be helpful if sun exposure is limited.

**Iodine:** Shellfish, cod, dairy, eggs, sea kelp, and sea salt are rich in iodine.

**Selenium:** Shellfish, organ meat, red meat, and Brazil nuts are excellent sources of selenium.

**Zinc:** Oysters, beef, organ meats, and pumpkin seeds are high in zinc.

**Omega-3 Fatty Acids:** Fatty fish is the best source. Algae is a plant-based source of ALA, a precursor to omega-3s.

**Magnesium and Potassium:** While fish and dairy contain some magnesium, pumpkin seeds, greens, and chocolate are better sources. For potassium, focus on greens and avocado."

**Here are some nutrient-dense meal ideas:**

- Steak, eggs, salad

- Burger, cheese, sauerkraut

- Liver, onions, cauliflower

- Egg, avocado

- Sardines, tomato

- Tuna salad with nutritional yeast

- Salmon, carrots, Brussels sprouts

- Shellfish, mashed cauliflower

- Short ribs, cheese, tomato

## What Are Effective Treatments For Lyme Disease And How Do They Help Al 6Fc7C4

# What are effective treatments for Lyme disease, and how do they help alleviate symptoms and support recovery?

Lyme disease is commonly treated with antibiotics, which can unfortunately also harm beneficial bacteria in the body, potentially weakening the immune system.

In some cases, individuals may develop antibiotic resistance, leading to complications like chronic fatigue syndrome, fibromyalgia, or autoimmune diseases after Lyme disease treatment.

There are over 900 tick species, and some carry Lyme bacteria, a spirochete known for its corkscrew shape. These bacteria can penetrate various tissues and evade the immune system by hiding in areas without immune cells.

A tick bite often results in redness, which might evolve into a bull's eye rash, a typical sign of Lyme disease.

The corkscrew bacteria can invade the heart, causing palpitations. They possess a defense mechanism allowing them to survive even after being engulfed by immune cells. Spirochetes also reduce receptors for vitamin D, a crucial vitamin for the immune system.

Vitamin D enhances the effectiveness of monocytes, a type of white blood cell. It also boosts antimicrobial peptides, which aid in killing spirochetes.

There are two main vitamin D systems. One regulates calcium, while the other supports immune cells, the heart, muscles, the central nervous system, and the intestines. This second system relies on vitamin D from sunlight, food, and supplements. This vitamin D remains in the body for only 24 hours.

If you suspect you have Lyme disease, consider taking at least 30,000 IU of vitamin D daily, even if you're on antibiotics. Whenever you take vitamin D3, ensure you also have sufficient magnesium, vitamin K2, and zinc.

Japanese knotweed and garlic may also offer benefits for managing Lyme disease.

## Is There A Basis For The Argument That Vitamin D Lacks Significant Val Fc80Fa

# Is there a basis for the argument that Vitamin D lacks significant value or efficacy in supporting overall health and wellness?

The VITAL study, involving 26,000 participants, concluded that vitamin D supplementation provided minimal benefits, failing to reduce the risk of cancer, major cardiovascular events, stroke, or cardiovascular death. However, this study has been met with criticism due to several methodological flaws.

The VITAL study utilized drug trial protocols, with one group receiving vitamin D and the other a placebo. However, it failed to establish baseline vitamin D levels in participants and allowed both groups to consume up to 800 IU of vitamin D daily, potentially masking the supplement's effects.

Furthermore, the study focused on measuring the inactive form of vitamin D in the blood, primarily involved in skeletal health and calcium regulation. This overlooked the active form of vitamin D found within cells, which plays a crucial role in immune function, cancer prevention, inflammation reduction, and prevention of diabetes and dementia.

The VITAL study's dosage of 2,000 IU, considered high in their context, is deemed inadequate by many experts. Dr. Hollis cites a Townsend letter referencing six papers highlighting vitamin D's promising benefits, including reducing autoimmune disease, advanced cancer risk, autism, asthma, and adverse pregnancy outcomes.

Despite the VITAL study's conclusions, extensive research supports vitamin D's role in reducing breast cancer, tooth decay, depression, skin disorders, prostate cancer, cardiovascular disease, high blood pressure, diabetes, and colon cancer.

Research also emphasizes the benefits of sunlight, the optimal source of vitamin D. Sun exposure can significantly reduce breast cancer risk, lower blood pressure, and boost serotonin levels by up to 80%.

## Is Excessive Vitamin D Intake Linked To Hair Loss And What Mechanisms  Bee398

# Is excessive vitamin D intake linked to hair loss, and what mechanisms might contribute to this adverse effect in individuals with high vitamin D levels?

Yes. Vitamin D increases the intestinal absorption of calcium, and elevated vitamin D levels can result in excessive calcium, also known as hypercalcemia. Hypercalcemia can cause soft tissue calcification and lead to calcified plaque formation on the scalp, which blocks hair follicles and results in hair loss.

## Why Should You Never Take Vitamin A Supplements

# Why should you never take Vitamin A supplements?

Vitamin A toxicity is rare, but taking a synthetic vitamin A supplement may increase your risk. Synthetic vitamin A may also increase the risk of lung cancer. Accutane, a form of synthetic vitamin A, has serious potential side effects. I suggest getting your vitamin A from food sources or natural food-based supplements.

Foods high in vitamin A (retinol):

• Cod liver oil

• Egg yolks

• Grass-fed butter

• Grass-fed cheese

• Liver

Beta carotene is the precursor to the active form of vitamin A (retinol). Beta carotene is in foods like carrots and spinach. But, If you’re relying on beta carotene alone to get your vitamin A or if you have a liver or gallbladder issue, you could be deficient in vitamin A.

## What Are Some Great Tips For When You Are Sick

# What are some great tips for when you are sick?

Viral infection symptoms will be more systemic. If you have a viral infection, you’ll notice more body aches and chills. Bacterial infection symptoms will be localized. Fevers are typically higher with a bacterial infection. A sore throat associated with a viral infection is often accompanied by a runny nose and a cough. If a sore throat is caused by a bacterial infection, you’ll feel more localized pain without a runny nose. A dry cough is associated with a viral infection, while bacterial infections are associated with a productive cough. Respiratory infection, the common cold, flu, bronchitis, and infections involving the sinuses and lungs are generally viral. Pneumonia can be both bacterial and viral. A viral infection typically lasts 1 to 2 weeks. A bacterial infection will probably last a bit longer, but this depends on your immune system. Mucus associated with a viral infection is usually clear or white and green or yellow with a bacterial infection.

The best viral infection remedies are elderberry and olive leaf extract. For bacterial infections, try garlic, oregano oil, and echinacea. The following remedies for infection work for both viral and bacterial infections:

•Take a hot bath or shower/dress warm

•Get more sleep

•Take zinc, vitamin D, and vitamin C

•Fasting

•Increase sea salt intake

•Improve emotional state

•Get more sunlight (UVB and infrared rays)

•Take cod liver oil

## How To Get Rid Of Sebaceous Filaments

# How to get rid of sebaceous filaments?

Many people mistake sebaceous filaments for blackheads and try to remove them by using tweezers or other methods. However, this can damage the skin. The presence of sebaceous filaments and blackheads is often linked to the overproduction of sebum. This production is regulated by a hormone called androgens, which can increase during puberty, pregnancy, or other hormonal imbalances. So, how do we address the root cause of sebaceous filaments? One way is to regulate and balance our androgen levels through dietary changes. Consuming foods high in vitamin A, D, and omega-3 fatty acids while reducing the intake of seed oils found in processed foods can help decrease sebum production. Another way to reduce and balance androgen levels is through intermittent fasting and the keto diet, which helps lower insulin levels. High levels of insulin can also contribute to the overproduction of sebum. Additionally, zinc deficiency has been linked to raised sebum production. Consuming zinc-rich foods such as shellfish and red meat can help address this deficiency. Managing stress levels is also essential, as chronic stress can deplete our zinc levels.

## What Fat Is Considered Dangerous

# What fat is considered dangerous?

Fat storage is a survival mechanism, but there is a limitation to how much fuel can be stored. Once your body is out of storage, fat is placed around the organs. This type of fat is called visceral fat. If visceral fat is stored for too long, it spills into your organs. This is called ectopic fat. The good news is that when you burn fat, this is the first to go.

It’s not the number of calories that causes this excess fat storage; it’s the type of calories. Alcohol and ultra-processed foods like high fructose corn syrup cause visceral fat and liver fat. Chronic stress can even cause your body to turn things into sugar. Poor sleep can increase cortisol and visceral fat. Certain medications, such as steroids, antibiotics, antidepressants, and anti-anxiety drugs, can also increase visceral fat.

Seed oils, refined sugars, and starches in the diet directly contribute to mitochondrial damage and visceral fat. To lose visceral fat, you need to eliminate ultra-processed calories. Instead, consume nutrient-dense foods like red meat, eggs, and fish.

HIIT exercise is the best exercise for burning fat. HIIT involves short bursts of high-intensity exercise with rest. Weight training can help reduce belly fat by increasing muscle mass. Long walks can help reduce belly fat by burning fat and reducing stress.

Vitamin B1 helps reduce stress and improve sleep.

Nutritional yeast is one of the best sources of B1.

Vitamin D can also help you lose weight. If you can’t go out in the sun, take at least 10,000 IU of vitamin D3. Make sure to take magnesium with vitamin D3 because it allows for vitamin D's proper function and helps improve sleep. Fasting also helps to burn fat fast by reducing insulin spikes.

## What Will Happen If You Take Omega 3 Fish Oil For A Month

# What will happen if you take Omega-3 fish oil for a month?

Both cod liver oil and fish oil contain omega-3 fatty acids, with the addition of vitamin A and vitamin D in cod liver oil. Around 25% of the fat in your brain is the omega-3 fatty acid, DHA. Most of this fat is in the frontal cortex, which supports memory, focus, concentration, and attention. DHA supports the integrity of the membranes around the neurons and supports the retina. It also protects against inflammation, UV radiation, and macular degeneration.

Omega-3 fatty acids keep skin smooth and protect against acne, psoriasis, eczema, dry skin, red skin, and ultraviolet light. They can also help remineralize bone, decrease the risk of osteoporosis, and improve arthritis and joint inflammation.

Taking cod liver oil or fish oil for 30 days has even more potential benefits, including the following:

•Supports liver health

•Helps regulate blood sugar

•Helps reverse insulin resistance

•Supports inside of the arteries

•Reduces symptoms of asthma and allergies

•Supports fertility

•Helps eliminate soreness and inflammation after exercise

Avoid choosing fish oil based on price alone. Some fish oils are poor quality and may be rancid or oxidized. Know the source of your fish oil to avoid getting a product contaminated with heavy metals such as lead, arsenic, or mercury. Fish oil and cod liver oil may taste like fish, but they shouldn’t have a rancid taste. To minimize the taste, try looking for supplements in pearl form. Omega-3 foods include fatty fish such as wild-caught salmon, herring, mackerel, and sardines. Shellfish and grass-fed dairy products also contain omega-3 fatty acids.

## How Can I Get All The Needed Nutrients In One Meal

# How can I get all the needed nutrients in one meal?

When it comes to protein, grass-fed beef, lamb, and goat are the best sources. People often think carrots are high in vitamin A, but they don't contain the active form. Retinol, the active form of vitamin A, is found in liver, fish, cod liver oil, and egg yolk. There are two types of iron: non-heme iron, found in plants, which is not very absorbable, and heme iron, found in liver and red meat.

Red meat, fish, eggs, cheese, and liver are all excellent sources of B vitamins. You can get B vitamins from grains, but grains contain phytic acid, which blocks the absorption of trace minerals.

Nutritional yeast and sunflower seeds are also good sources of B vitamins.

Collagen is a protein that makes up ⅓ of the body's protein. Consuming the skin from meat and fish, bone broth, and organ meats can help supply the body with collagen.

Cod liver oil, sardines, and fatty fish help provide vitamin D3, but the sun is the best source. Supplements can be helpful if you can't get enough sunshine. Shellfish, cod, dairy, eggs, sea kelp, and sea salt are the best sources of iodine.

Shellfish, organ meat, red meat, and Brazil nuts are the best sources of selenium. Oysters, beef, organ meats, and pumpkin seeds are the best sources of zinc.

Fatty fish is the best source of omega-3 fatty acids. You can get ALA from algae, the precursor to omega-3 fatty acids. Fish and dairy contain magnesium, but not very much.

Pumpkin seeds, greens, and chocolate are the best food sources.

Animal foods are also not the best source of potassium. Consume plenty of greens and avocado to help get potassium.

Check out these meal ideas that include foods high in nutrients:

•Steak, eggs, salad

•Burger, cheese, sauerkraut

•Liver, onions, cauliflower

•Egg, avocado

•Sardines, tomato

•Tuna salad with nutritional yeast

•Salmon, carrots, Brussels sprouts

•Shellfish, mashed cauliflower

•Short ribs, cheese, tomato

## What Are Some Bad Habits That Can Destroy My Heart

# What are some bad habits that can destroy my heart?

1\. Believing everything you read on labels

Food labels can be misleading. Even foods marketed as essential to a heart-healthy diet may have damaging health effects.

2\. Staying out of the sun

Avoiding the sun can lower your vitamin D levels. Vitamin D is one of the most important vitamins for supporting a healthy body, including cardiovascular health.

3\. Excessive sitting

A fascinating study shows a sedentary lifestyle may increase the risk of heart disease and stroke.

4\. Overusing medication

Consider working with a doctor who is open to natural alternatives for various conditions.

5\. Snacking

Snacking before bed ruins your ability to burn fat while you sleep. Fat burning occurs mainly at night!

6\. Drinking too much water

Drinking too much water while on a low-salt diet can dilute an important electrolyte: sodium.

7\. Ignoring dental care

Certain studies have found dental bacteria in arterial plaque. Tooth infections can also lead to health issues.

8\. Mouth breathing

Nose breathing may help you sleep better at night—good sleep is vital for heart health.

9\. Exposure to microplastics

Microplastics are everywhere and have become a big issue. It has been found that the average person has microplastics in their blood.

10\. Feeling out of breath when exercising

Feeling out of breath very quickly when exercising could be a sign of a heart issue you should not ignore.

11\. Jet lag

Jet lag dramatically affects sleep cycles and can lead to fluid retention. If you fly frequently, taking niacin may help, and vitamin D3 may also be beneficial for jet lag.

12\. Excessive cardio without rest

Sustained pulse rate exercise is hard on the heart and body.

13\. Secondhand smoke exposure

Secondhand smoke can increase the risk of heart attack by 25-30%.

14\. Consuming refined foods

Magnesium is one of the most important nutrients for the heart. But refined foods deplete magnesium.

## Whats The Best Fibroid Shrinking Vitamin

# What's the best fibroid shrinking vitamin?

Fibroids decrease in size after menopause, yet pregnancy, exposure to HRT, and birth control pills can cause fibroids to enlarge. Obesity, type 2 diabetes, high blood pressure, and PCOS also increase the risk of fibroids. Black women have a 3 to 9 times higher risk of developing fibroids. Estrogen is the primary driver of fibroids and endometriosis. A fibroid is a growth in the uterus, but it differs from uterine tissue in several ways. Fibroids are very sensitive to estrogen and have increased estrogen receptors, more of the enzyme aromatase, less oxygen than the uterus, and more inflammation.

Many health problems and risk factors associated with fibroids are related to low vitamin D. Vitamin D has incredible properties that may help inhibit the growth of fibroids. There is also a vast amount of anecdotal evidence in support of using vitamin D to shrink fibroids. Be sure to take vitamin D with the cofactors magnesium and vitamin K2.

## How To Get Rid Of Mucus Fast

# How to get rid of mucus fast?

NAC works similarly to salt by thinning mucus, but it also stops its production. It’s a potent anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, antibacterial, and antiviral agent that can even break up biofilms. NAC also strengthens the cilia in the respiratory system, which helps to move mucus.

NAC can be taken orally, injected, or inhaled through a nebulizer. It can be beneficial for respiratory congestion related to an infection or for diseases like COPD or cystic fibrosis. NAC is also used in hospitals as an antidote for Tylenol poisoning. NAC helps enhance brain function and may be beneficial for people with Alzheimer’s, Parkinson's, OCD, addictions, depression, and schizophrenia. NAC can improve insulin sensitivity, which helps regulate blood sugar and prevent a fatty liver. It promotes healthy blood pressure and cholesterol, and can even help with asthma.

You can reduce respiratory mucus with salt if you’re dealing with an acute infection, but NAC can eliminate mucus and the inflammation behind it. Vitamin C, curcumin, probiotics, magnesium, quercetin, and vitamin D can all improve the effectiveness of NAC.

## What Can I Do If Im Overthinking 247

# What can I do if I'm overthinking 24/7?

Overthinking can trigger cortisol, which equals more stress. Stress hormones will continue to stress you out, leaving you trapped in a vicious cycle of anxious thoughts that can be very difficult to break out of.

Most of the time, anxiety and overthinking can be fixed by addressing nutritional imbalances, but people are often prescribed SSRIs. These drugs block the reabsorption of serotonin and come with several side effects. They can downgrade the receptor for serotonin, which can cause a major deficiency in serotonin. Drugs, chronic stress, junk food, lack of sun, and vitamin D can deplete your serotonin and dopamine. Many people get the blues during the winter months because of a lack of vitamin D from the sun. Vitamin D deficiency can lead to anxiety and depression. Research has shown that vitamin D may produce the same results as a medication for depression without the side effects!

The health of your microbiome directly affects your mental health. The microbes that help increase serotonin are very sensitive to broad-spectrum antibiotics. To stop overthinking and improve your mental health, you’ll want to take at least 10,000 IU of vitamin D each day. You also need the microbes that make serotonin! L. reuteri affects serotonin more than any other microbe, yet over 96% of the population is deficient! The best way to fix this problem is to make your own probiotic yogurt using L. reuteri. This microbe can help decrease anxiety, increase oxytocin, and significantly reduce cortisol.

## Whats The Best Probiotic For An Autoimmune Condition

# What's the best probiotic for an autoimmune condition?

An autoimmune disease is a condition in which the immune system attacks its own tissues. It is typically characterized by low regulatory T-cells and high Th17 and Th2 cells. T-reg cells prevent autoimmune diseases by supporting an appropriate immune response. There are natural ways to support your immune system so that it operates at an optimal level. Poor gut health and gut inflammation can block the function of vitamin D3. Without enough vitamin D, T-reg cells do not work properly.

The majority of the population is vitamin D-resistant. To support the immune system, you need 8,000 to 10,000 IU of vitamin D daily, but even more to overcome resistance. Poor gut health, inflammation, and low vitamin D are a perfect storm for developing an autoimmune condition.

B. infantis and L. reuteri are vital for your immune system, but many people don’t have them because these probiotics are very sensitive to antibiotics. These two important microbes help prevent autoimmune diseases, greatly affect T-reg cells, and suppress inflammatory immune cells.

L. reuteri helps increase oxytocin, one of the most potent anti-stress hormones. High cortisol levels mean high stress, which suppresses the immune system. The best way to consume l. reuteri is to cultivate it in a dairy product.

If you’re low in selenium, you will have higher amounts of inflammatory immune cells. Selenium helps lower Th17, Th2 cells, and auto-antibodies involved in autoimmune disorders. Prolonged fasting can improve your immune system by increasing T-reg cells and creating new stem cells.

## How Can I Regenerate My Stem Cells

# How can I regenerate my stem cells?

Here's how to keep your stem cell population at the highest level.

1\. Fasting

Prolonged fasting can boost stem cells naturally. If you can fast for 72 hours, you can boost stem cell production primarily for the gastrointestinal tract, brain, and immune system.

2\. Exercise

Intense exercise is the best way to boost stem cells for your muscles and brain. Exercise also stimulates BDNF (brain-derived neurotrophic factor), which allows you to make new nerve and brain cells.

3\. Deep sleep

Sleep increases melatonin, which stimulates stem cell regeneration in your brain. Sleep also increases immune and cardiovascular stem cells.

4\. Green tea

Green tea contains the phytonutrient EGCG, which has potent anti-inflammatory properties and can increase stem cells for your brain and liver.

5\. Omega-3 fatty acids

Decreasing inflammation can boost stem cell production. Omega-3 fatty acids are anti-inflammatory and can increase stem cells for your bones, cartilage, brain, and skin.

6\. Vitamin D Vitamin

D and the sun help maintain blood stem cells that are involved with the immune system. Vitamin D increases new immune cells, prevents the exhaustion of stem cells, and can even increase longevity.

7\. Cold therapy

The cold stimulates brown fat stem cells, which support muscle repair and the mitochondria, decrease inflammation, and increase blood flow.

## What Are Some Unexpected Benefits Of Apple Cider Vinegar

# What are some unexpected benefits of Apple Cider Vinegar?

Both good bacteria and bad bacteria can go into a dormant state. Microbes in a dormant state are protected from many environmental stresses and chemicals, especially antibiotics. Dormant microbes can survive for decades or even thousands of years! A change in environment, like a change in pH, can wake good bacteria or cause them to go dormant. Most good bacteria thrive in an acidic environment. Apple cider vinegar acidifies the environment for good microbes. Things like kombucha, pickle juice, sauerkraut, and kimchi have similar effects.

Certain microbes create butyrate, which helps with insulin resistance. These microbes thrive in an acidic environment. We have a synergistic relationship with the microbes in our gut. We provide a home, and they provide immune protection, help with digestion, vitamin production, and more. By making their environment more acidic, you help activate them.

H. pylori releases ammonia, which alkalizes the stomach acid. This allows it to do its damage, causing ulcers in the stomach and small intestine. C. diff, E. coli, and salmonella go into a state of dormancy when the pH drops below 6. When your immune system is suppressed, bad bacteria can come out of dormancy. Antibiotics, stress, Prednisone, and vitamin D deficiency can all suppress the immune system and activate pathogenic microbes. Adequate vitamin D in amounts of at least 10,000 IU daily may help keep pathogenic microbes in remission. Try drinking 1 tablespoon of apple cider vinegar in a glass of water every evening with a straw to support your beneficial microbes. Fairchild’s Apple Cider Vinegar is an excellent option.

## What Are Some Things To Avoid If You Are Over 50

# What are some things to avoid if you are over 50?

1\. Don’t take health advice from inexperienced people.

2\. Don’t be too quick to accept a diagnosis.

3\. Avoid solutions that create more problems.

4\. Avoid excessive stress.

The most important nutrient for people over 50 is vitamin D. Vitamin D influences 10% of your genes. You need at least 10,000 IU of vitamin D or more to produce a therapeutic effect. Doctors worldwide are using vitamin D3 for many health concerns, including autoimmune diseases, eye problems, and fibroids.

Magnesium, zinc, and vitamin D work together in a synergistic relationship. Magnesium is vital for heart health and energy. Avoid calcium and iron supplements as you age. It’s very difficult to rid the body of excess iron.

You don’t need to avoid salt! Opt for sea salt and make sure you’re getting plenty of potassium. Sodium deficiency can cause increased cortisol levels, which can interfere with sleep.

Cholesterol is an essential building block of sex hormones, so you must get enough after menopause. Cholesterol is essential for our brain, bile salts, and other hormones. Butter, eggs, dairy, and shellfish are the best dietary sources of cholesterol.

Focus on removing carbs from the diet and prioritizing quality protein. Grass-fed beef or lamb is the best source of protein.

Frequent eating stimulates insulin, which is the root cause of many chronic illnesses, including high blood pressure, diabetes, and a fatty liver.

Autoimmune diseases are related to low vitamin D and the microbes, viruses, and other pathogens that downgrade the vitamin D receptor. After severe stress or shock, your immune system becomes suppressed, leaving you vulnerable to autoimmune disease.

## How To Thicken My Hair

# How to thicken my hair?

The good bacteria in your gut make biotin. This is why a common side effect of antibiotics is hair problems. When you stop taking biotin, you may notice that the problem comes right back, so it’s vital to address gut health when dealing with biotin deficiency. Liver and egg yolks are the best sources of biotin. Nutritional yeast and salmon also contain biotin. Alcohol, raw eggs, and magnesium deficiency can interfere with biotin absorption. Zinc and copper are essential for biotin absorption and function.

Retinol, the active form of vitamin A, is only found in animal foods. Liver and egg yolks are the best sources, but you can also find vitamin A in shellfish and cod liver oil. Vitamin A helps control sebum, so it’s very beneficial for thick, shiny hair! For healthy hair, reduce your omega-6 fat intake and increase your omega-3s. Omega-3 fatty acids are vital for healthy hair. Fish oil and cod liver oil are excellent sources of omega-3s.

L. reuteri is a microbe missing in 96% of the population. It increases sebum, which makes hair shiny, and it may also increase hair growth. Copper is used in many different enzymes, including the enzyme that helps prevent iron accumulation in your tissues. Iron is vital for hair growth, but we need the right balance. NPK fertilizer in our foods is a common cause of copper deficiency. If the grass is deficient in copper, the animals that eat the grass will also be deficient. Animals with copper deficiency have very dull hair. If this can happen to sheep and cows, it can definitely happen to us! Overconsumption of iron, often from fortified wheat products, can lock up your copper and contribute to copper deficiency. Other contributors to copper deficiency include high fructose corn syrup and high zinc intake.

**If you want healthy hair, add the following foods to your diet:**

•Fermented foods (i.e. kefir, sauerkraut, kimchi)

•Liver

•Egg yolks

•Cod liver oil/cod liver

•Organic foods

•Trace minerals

## What Are The Most Important Foods For Shinier And Healthier Hair

# What are the most important foods for shinier and healthier hair?

1\. Bamboo shoots are high in trace minerals, potassium, and silica—essential for building hair protein. Silica makes hair strong and elastic and also prevents breakage and brittleness. Silica supports skin, joint, and bone health as well!

2\. Wild-caught salmon is an excellent source of protein and is loaded with nutrition. It’s also one of the best sources of omega-3 fatty acids. Wild-caught salmon is a potent source of vitamin D3, which can improve nearly every problem with hair loss. Vitamin D controls the hair follicle and can activate dormant hair follicle stem cells.

3\. Egg yolks are loaded with biotin, vital for keratin production. They also contain all of the fat-soluble nutrients that are essential for hair growth and hair health. Egg yolks are a rich source of cholesterol, a precursor for the hormones necessary for hair growth. Cholesterol increases hair shine and luster and strengthens the hair shaft. Egg yolks contain vitamin D and sulfur, which supports a healthy scalp.

4\. Grass-fed liver contains concentrated amounts of almost every nutrient. It’s high in iron, vital for oxygen transport to the scalp. One of the most common causes of hair shedding is iron deficiency. An iron deficiency can be caused by low iron or a copper deficiency.

## How Can I Fix Bad Circulation In Legs And Feet

# How can I fix bad circulation in legs and feet?

According to Dr. Stephen Hussey, author of "Understanding the Heart," the heart spins the blood, acting as a mechanism to create structured water. Similar to the way a tree pushes water up from the roots, increasing structured water throughout the circulatory system can improve circulation. You can increase structured water in your blood with infrared.

Over 50% of the sun's energy is infrared! Increasing sun exposure can help improve the circulation in your legs and your heart function. Infrared increases nitric oxide, which supports the arteries and healthy blood pressure.

Vitamin D from the sun also increases nitric oxide. If you have edema in the feet, potassium is one of the best natural diuretics for getting rid of excess fluid. Eliminating sugar and starches from your diet can also stop fluid retention, especially in the lower extremities. High sugar consumption depletes vitamin B1.

If you’re experiencing tingling and pain in the bottom of your feet, consuming benfotiamine—a fat-soluble form of vitamin B1—may help. Cramping in your legs and feet can also be related to a magnesium deficiency. For the best results, take 800 mg per day in the evening for several weeks. It’s also important to avoid compression socks, which can further restrict blood circulation.

Diosmin is an excellent remedy for varicose veins. If you have varicose veins, edema, or any other problems with the lower part of your body, avoid intense exercise. Instead, aim for light exercise like walking and try these simple leg circulation exercises!

What about cold feet? Cold feet are generally caused by an iodine deficiency due to a low thyroid. Sea kelp is one of the best sources of iodine.

Ninety percent of hypertension is considered essential, which means the cause is unknown. However, I believe it's likely linked to vitamin D deficiency. Vitamin D is vital in supporting and protecting the endothelial layer of your arteries. The benefits of vitamin D for your arteries include:

1\. Potent anti-inflammatory effects

2\. Potent antioxidant effects

3\. Increased nitric oxide

Nitric oxide keeps the arteries in a state of vasodilation and relaxation. Without enough nitric oxide, the arteries become tight, and blood pressure rises. When the endothelial layer of the artery becomes dysfunctional, you no longer produce nitric oxide. You won't absorb much calcium if you don't have enough vitamin D. This can cause your parathyroid hormone to increase to remove calcium from the bone and put it into the blood. If you are chronically low in vitamin D, the parathyroid hormone will continue to rob calcium from the bone, creating osteoporosis. Many doctors do not recommend large doses of vitamin D in fear of vitamin D toxicity. Clinical data does not support vitamin D toxicity! Dr. Bruce Hollis, a pioneer in vitamin D research, has personally never seen a case.

Vitamin K2 can help remove calcium from the arteries and put it into the teeth and bones. Magnesium regulates excess calcium and helps to prevent cardiovascular problems. Vitamin D protects your arteries by decreasing inflammation and supporting the vascular cells. Vitamin D, magnesium, and K2 can help prevent calcium from developing in the wrong places, helping to prevent high blood pressure. Aim for 30,000 IU of vitamin D daily if you have high blood pressure.

## Whats The One Vitamin That Reverses Nerve Damage

# What's the one vitamin that reverses nerve damage?

Viruses can hide in the ganglia (a nerve cell cluster) and turn off autophagy, a state in which the body recycles damaged proteins. Here, the viruses can lie dormant until stress levels rise, which increases cortisol and weakens the immune system. Emotional stress can significantly weaken the immune system. This is why many dormant viruses come out of remission after a stressful event, such as losing a loved one.

The herpes and shingles viruses are often seen after a significant stressor. These viruses need the amino acid arginine to survive. Lysine can block arginine and stop the reproduction of these viruses. You need at least 1000 to 3000 mg of lysine to block arginine.

Sciatica typically stems from a disc problem. Copper deficiency is at the root of many disc problems, so it can be an excellent solution for sciatica. A copper supplement or copper cream can help reduce sciatica pain.

Carpal tunnel syndrome is usually caused by a vitamin B6 deficiency. Along with increasing vitamin B6, you also need more vitamin B12 to support the myelin sheaths of your nerves.

Adequate vitamin D3 is vital for conditions like multiple sclerosis and helps reduce inflammation within the nerve cells. To put conditions like MS into remission, you need to take large amounts of vitamin D3—at least 50,000 IU.

The Coimbra Protocol is a well-researched method of using high doses of vitamin D3 to effectively reduce the symptoms of autoimmune conditions. Many people with diabetes develop a condition called peripheral neuropathy that causes numbness in the toes and feet. Vitamin B1 in the form of benfotiamine can penetrate the myelin sheath and help reverse nerve damage caused by high blood sugar. For vitamin B1 to work, you need the cofactor magnesium.

## What Foods Can Help To Reverse Kidney Damage

# What foods can help to reverse kidney damage?

Potassium protects kidney health in several ways. It helps lower high blood pressure, which damages the kidneys and protects against kidney stones. Too much sodium can be hard on the kidneys, but the remedy is more potassium.

A proper diet with adequate vitamin D, potassium, and magnesium can significantly improve kidney health.

The following foods protect the kidneys from damage and support kidney health:

1\. Vegetables: asparagus, celery, bell peppers, cabbage, cauliflower, garlic

2\. Magnesium-rich foods: pumpkin seeds, leafy greens, avocadoes, magnesium glycinate

3\. Probiotic-foods: kefir, yogurt, sauerkraut, kimchi

4\. Moderate amounts of high-quality protein

5\. High-antioxidant foods: strawberries, blueberries, blackberries, beets

6\. Quercetin: onions

7\. Extra virgin olive oil

Consuming tea is a great way to stay hydrated and support kidney health. Polyphenols found in tea are very beneficial for the kidney. Green, nettle, dandelion, turmeric, and decaffeinated black tea are all great options. Frequent eating can overtax the kidneys' filtration system. A low-carb diet and intermittent fasting are very beneficial for kidney health. Intermittent fasting can decrease the stress on the kidneys and significantly reduce insulin. Too much insulin can be damaging to the kidneys.

## How Can I Grow My Muscles If Im Over 50 Years Of Age

# How can I grow my muscles if I'm over 50 years of age?

Losing weight should help you live longer, but it’s not always that simple. As you age, it’s vital to maintain a healthy amount of lean muscle mass. Ozempic is very popular for weight loss, but trials have shown that it can cause muscle loss, not just fat loss. One study compared the use of Ozempic to a decade or more of aging. Preserving muscle mass is one of the best things you can do for longevity. Your muscles help regulate your blood sugar and support your metabolism. Sarcopenia is the term for age-related muscle loss. When you develop sarcopenia, your risk for diabetes, immune problems, and your mortality rate increases.

Exercise is the best thing you can do for your muscles. Protein is the raw material for muscle-building, so it’s essential to ensure you’re getting enough and spreading your intake throughout the day. Grass-fed red meat is the best source of protein. Poor sleep drains muscle mass more than poor diet because muscle recovery occurs when you’re sleeping.

In summary, focus on the following as you age:

•Increase lean muscle mass

•Ensure adequate protein intake

•Consume collagen

•Increase magnesium glycinate, vitamin D, zinc, selenium, copper, B vitamins, and coenzyme Q10

•Consume iron from red meat L. reuteri is a microbe with many fascinating benefits and has been shown to increase muscle stem cells. It's helped me gain 5 pounds of muscle mass!

## How Lack Of Sleep Affects Your Health

# How lack of sleep affects your health?

If you’re consistently getting less than 6 hours of sleep, you increase your risk of premature death, cancer, diabetes, dementia, and more!

Sleep is the best way to clean the brain of damaged proteins, but this only occurs when you get real sleep. Sleep medication can sedate you but will not enhance your sleep quality. Alcohol significantly decreases sleep quality, causing snoring, sleep apnea, and tossing and turning. Sleep is essential for repairing and restoring the entire body, especially the immune system. Without sleep, the immune system shuts down, leaving you vulnerable to infection.

REM sleep supports parts of the brain involved in creativity, memory, and problem-solving. It improves social interaction, emotional stability, empathy, and your mood throughout the day. Most repair occurs during non-REM sleep, also known as deep or delta-wave sleep. As you age, non-REM delta wave sleep decreases significantly. Delta wave sleep is vital for fat burning, cell repair, and cell regeneration. It’s also when your body fights infections most effectively.

To improve your sleep quality, try the following restful sleep tips:

•Avoid alcohol

•Drink kombucha tea

•Exercise regularly

•Avoid eating too late

•Avoid eating too much protein

•Sleep in a cool, dark room

•Avoid too much caffeine

•Avoid excessive blue light

•Turn lights off a few hours before bed

•Get plenty of sun during the day

•Go to bed when you’re tired

•Avoid stimulating shows/movies before bed

Magnesium, vitamin D, and zinc are the most important nutrients for sleep. L. reuteri is a microbe that can help boost oxytocin and serotonin and improve sleep. Sodium is also vital for restful sleep

## How Can I Remove Skin Tags And Warts Overnight

# How can I remove skin tags and warts overnight?

High insulin can increase one's susceptibility to skin tags. People with diabetes, overweight people, and women with PCOS are at a higher risk of developing them. When you produce too much insulin over a period of time, you can develop insulin resistance. Too much insulin is caused by eating too many carbs or frequent eating. Insulin resistance makes it difficult to absorb glucose. Over time, this deprives your brain cells of fuel, leading to memory problems, concentration problems, and early dementia.

**The solution** is to give your body an alternative fuel source, such as ketones, fatty acids, and protein. To do this, lower your carbs and do intermittent fasting. This will lower insulin and prevent growths like skin tags and warts.

A virus that comes out of remission can create warts if your immune system is compromised. Sufficient vitamin D can support the immune system and put these viruses back in remission. Take 10,000 IU of vitamin D daily, especially in winter.

**Povidone iodine** is an excellent remedy for skin tags. It has potent antiviral and antimicrobial properties, so it’s also good for warts. Iodine dissolves the protein in the skin tag and acts as a dehydrator.

**Garlic** contains allicin, a powerful antiviral compound effective against warts. Because it’s often difficult to differentiate between warts and skin tags, add garlic to ensure your remedy is effective.

**Crush one clove of garlic** and combine one drop of garlic with one drop of iodine. Apply the mixture to your wart or skin tag and cover it with a band-aid. Repeat this every day until your skin tag or wart is gone.

## How To End Dry Cough Fast

# How to end dry cough fast?

Most dry cough remedies involve medication that suppresses the cough. However, suppressing the cough is not always best because coughing is one of the body’s vital defense mechanisms. A cough can result from a post-nasal drip caused by an allergy, cold, virus, or fungal infection. It can also be a side effect of certain medications or be related to GERD or asthma.

Many children have asthma because their mothers did not get enough vitamin D during pregnancy. Vitamin D is essential for lung formation. If a cough is caused by croup, vitamin D is also an excellent home remedy. Some coughs are caused by low humidity. In this case, try a humidifier.

Laryngospasms can also cause a dry cough. These spasms are often caused by low calcium in the blood. A deficiency in vitamin D3 can cause low blood calcium. Take 20,000 IU of vitamin D3 daily if you’re dealing with a cough related to laryngospasms. Always take magnesium and vitamin K2 with vitamin D3. Chronic dry cough can also be caused by perfumes, smoke, new furniture, or tic disorders.

NAC (n-acetyl-cysteine) is a potent antioxidant and anti-inflammatory that breaks up mucus in the lungs. To use NAC for a cough, dissolve ¼ teaspoon of NAC powder into 4 ounces of water. Once dissolved, add ⅛ teaspoon of magnesium in the form of Epsom salt. Add this liquid to a nebulizer and breathe in for 5 minutes, 1 to 2 times daily.

• Be sure to use food-grade Epsom salt.

• Make sure the NAC and Epsom salt are fully dissolved before nebulizing.

• Use sterile or distilled water to prevent contamination.

• Consult a healthcare professional before nebulizing any homemade solution.

Black seed oil and white horehound are also good home remedies for a cough if taken with vitamin D3, K2, magnesium, and zinc.

## How Can I Deal With Hyperpigmentation

# How can I deal with hyperpigmentation?

Dark spots are often blamed on the sun, and they can become more problematic as we age. Melanocytes are cells that make the pigment melanin in your skin. These cells are affected by oxidation. To fix hyperpigmentation, focus on antioxidation from antioxidants.

Adequate vitamin D will protect you against the overproduction of melanin, preventing dark spots from forming. If you’re avoiding the sun and using sunscreen, you will be low in vitamin D! Work on increasing vitamin D levels by consuming 10,000 to 20,000 IU of vitamin D3 daily. Build antioxidant networks in the body by consuming high-quality protein such as fish, meat, and eggs. Trace minerals, including zinc, copper, and iodine, are vital. B vitamins, vitamin C, and vitamin E are also essential.

If you want a quick fix to remove uneven skin tone, use grass-fed organic plain unsweetened yogurt. Rub it into the skin and leave it on for 5 minutes before rinsing off. Add this step to your skincare routine once per week to help get rid of dark spots. Yogurt contains lactic acid at a gentle concentration that dissolves the bonds between dead skin cells that have darkened in pigment. It also provides probiotics to support the skin’s microbiome. If hyperpigmentation is severe, add a pinch of turmeric to the yogurt before applying it to your skin.

## Whats The Best Meal To Clean Arteries And Keep Them Plaque Free

# What's the best meal to clean arteries and keep them plaque-free?

The endothelial layer is the innermost layer of your arteries. It controls blood pressure, acts as a filter, prevents clots, and supports immune function. The inside of your arteries is very susceptible to problems with insulin. Most people have insulin resistance, which is caused by chronic carbohydrate consumption and constant snacking.

Nitric oxide relaxes the blood vessels and is vital for the health of the endothelial layer of the arteries. Vitamin D triggers nitric oxide, which is why many people who are low in vitamin D also have high blood pressure. Arginine, testosterone, and magnesium also trigger nitric oxide.

Vitamin D and magnesium can help prevent calcium from building up in the arteries, and vitamin K2 also helps to prevent calcium buildup.

Foods like whole grains and seed oils are deemed “heart healthy,” but they spike insulin. We’re also told to avoid saturated fats because of the cholesterol content. There’s a lot of false information regarding a diet that’s truly healthy for your heart.

The best meal to clean your arteries would involve foods that don’t spike insulin. A low-carb ketogenic diet is best for your heart. The primary part of the best meal to clean out your arteries should be grass-fed red meat. If you’re having a burger, melt raw cheese on top because it’s high in vitamin K2. Red meat is loaded with zinc, which can directly improve your testosterone. Include a salad with your meal. Arugula is a great addition to any salad, as it can increase nitric oxide and is rich in vitamins C and E. Pumpkin seeds are also beneficial due to their high magnesium, zinc, and selenium content. Vitamin D3 is vital for a healthy heart. Sunlight is the best source, but you may need to take a supplement in the winter. Take at least 10,000 IU daily as a maintenance dose.

## How To Stop Frequent Night Time Urination

# How to stop frequent night time urination?

Frequent urination is often blamed on an enlarged prostate, UTIs, or kidney stones, but there’s a much more common root cause.

The most common cause of frequent urination at night is too much insulin in your blood. Insulin resistance is a condition where your insulin receptors no longer accept insulin. To compensate, the pancreas produces more insulin. This is why many diabetics have a problem with urinary frequency at night.

When blood sugar is high, the kidneys remove the sugar from the blood to eliminate it from the body. This increases urination frequency. Insulin resistance causes an overactive bladder, even if your blood sugar is normal. Increased urinary frequency at night is an early sign of insulin resistance, which is a precursor to diabetes. Insulin resistance increases stress on the kidneys, which is why diabetes is the leading cause of kidney disease. Insulin resistance can also cause electrolyte imbalances, blood pressure changes at night, and increased cortisol.

Snacking at night is the single most significant cause of frequent urination at night. Eliminate all snacks and beverages after dinner to decrease urination frequency at night. Snacking at night can also cause bloating and interrupted sleep.

A low-salt diet can also increase urination frequency at night. If you think your nocturia is due to low salt, add more sea salt to your meals throughout the day.

A low-carb diet can help reduce nocturia symptoms. Keep your carb consumption under 30 grams per day. Healthy Keto® can combat insulin resistance, improve your health, and reduce frequent urination at night.

Intermittent fasting is equally important in reversing insulin resistance. Aim for 3 meals with no snacks, eventually dropping down to 2 meals each day. Ending nocturia will significantly enhance your sleep, which is vital for your heart, blood sugar, stress levels, energy, cognitive function, and more. Don’t forget to get plenty of vitamin D with magnesium.

## What Are The Causes Of Low Vitamin D Levels  New Video

# What are the causes of low Vitamin D levels?  (new video)

(new video)

Low vitamin D levels are caused by people staying indoors, location, skin color, and other lifestyle and genetic factors. Low vitamin D symptoms include:

•Low back pain

•High blood pressure

•Depression

•Anxiety

•Inflammation

•Poor immune function

Sunblock blocks the absorption of vitamin D. In 1980, society became sun phobic in an attempt to prevent skin cancer, which has continued to increase despite less sun exposure. You need 10,000 IUs of vitamin D daily, especially for immune function. This amount of vitamin D is the same amount you’d get from 20 minutes of sun exposure in the summertime.

When you get a blood test for vitamin D, they’re not checking for the active form and are not accounting for vitamin D resistance. Many things block the vitamin D receptor and contribute to vitamin D resistance, including genetics, plastics, forever chemicals, age, weight, inflammation, pregnancy, and lactation. Vitamin D3 won’t work without magnesium. As you increase your vitamin D intake, the demand for magnesium increases. Vitamin K2 and zinc are also vital when increasing your vitamin D dosage. Vitamin D has potent anti-cancer and anti-tumor benefits at therapeutic doses. It can also combat inflammation and autoimmune conditions. Dr. Coimbra of Brazil has seen positive effects with high doses of vitamin D in people with autoimmune conditions.

## What Causes Cataracts New Video

# What causes cataracts? (New video)

All it takes is a small amount of oxidative stress to the eye's lens to develop a cataract. A healthy lens is composed of an organized protein called crystallin. When this tissue becomes damaged, it is not replaced. Glycation can damage the lens of the eye. It results from sugar connecting to a protein and then becoming stuck and unusable to the body. Steroids like Prednisone can also increase the risk of cataracts.

Not all surgeries can eliminate cataracts, and they can come with complications. According to “The Cataract Cure” by Dr. Marios Kyriazis, there is a safe, effective remedy for cataracts. Carnosine is a unique compound that can penetrate the lens of the eye and help with cataracts. Carnosine is a potent antioxidant that can dissolve damaged proteins. It can also activate your own antioxidants. NAC (n-acetyl carnosine) eye drops are one of the best remedies for cataracts.

The same group of scientists who performed the rabbit studies also tested NAC on humans. They selected 49 volunteers with an average age of 65 who had established age-related cataracts. After 6 months, researchers found that:

•41% of people presented a significant reduction of clouding in the lens

•90% showed a gradual improvement in vision

•89% showed up to a 100% improvement in sensitivity to glare

NAC for cataracts must be used for at least 3 to 5 months. Antioxidants such as those found in onions, egg yolks, leafy greens, and grass-fed red meat can protect you against cataracts. Vitamin A is vital for eye health and can be found in cod liver oil and grass-fed liver. B vitamins, especially B2, B6, and folate, are also essential.

## Can Iu International Units Be Converted To Mcg

# Can IU (International Units) be converted to mcg?

Yes. However, there is no universal IU-to-mcg conversion because IU measures biological activity or potency while mcg measures weight. However, conversion rates have been established for specific substances. For vitamin D3, the established conversion is:

• 1 IU of vitamin D3 = 0.025 mcg

• 1000 IU of vitamin D3 = 25 mcg

More information on the established conversion rate for vitamin D3 can be found in the FDA's "Converting Units of Measure for Folate, Niacin, and Vitamins A, D, and E on the Nutrition and Supplement Facts Labels: Guidance for Industry" - [**https://www.fda.gov/media/129863/download**](https://www.fda.gov/media/129863/download)

## Is There A Proper Ratio Of Magnesium To Vitamin D3 Intake

# Is there a proper ratio of magnesium to vitamin D3 intake?

While there isn’t a universally agreed-upon ratio of magnesium to vitamin D3, recent research has shed light on the crucial relationship between these two nutrients. Magnesium is vital for vitamin D synthesis, transport, and activation. It acts as a cofactor in the enzymatic reactions that convert vitamin D into its active form, 1,25(OH)2D. The daily intake recommendations for magnesium are 420 mg for men and 320 mg for women, independent of vitamin D supplementation. Research suggests that maintaining adequate levels of both nutrients is more important than a specific ratio. Magnesium deficiency can impair vitamin D metabolism, while vitamin D supplementation without sufficient magnesium may not be as effective.

## What Approaches Can Alleviate Lumbar Disc Pain And How Do They Target  B43Bb1

# What approaches can alleviate lumbar disc pain, and how do they target its causes?

Your intervertebral discs are made up of a gel-like center (nucleus pulposus) surrounded by tough rings (annulus fibrosus), all sandwiched between vertebral endplates. The center is mostly carbohydrate for holding fluid, while the outer rings are mostly protein for strength.

A herniated disc occurs when the gel-like center pushes through the outer rings, sometimes reaching the nerve root. This can cause pain due to inflammation and acidity within the disc.

Factors like type 2 diabetes, metabolic syndrome, and chronic high blood sugar increase the risk of disc herniation.

To potentially alleviate lumbar disc pain, consider these natural remedies:

1. Cut out inflammatory foods like sugar, refined carbs, and omega-6 fatty acids.

2. Practice intermittent fasting and occasional prolonged fasting.

3. Increase your intake of omega-3 fatty acids.

4. Supplement with vitamin D3 (20,000 IUs) and magnesium.

Remember, these are potential remedies and may not work for everyone. Always consult with a healthcare professional for personalized advice.

## Worse Than Sugar

# Worse than Sugar

**Hidden Sugars: The Dangers of Synthetic Starches in Ultra-Processed Foods**

Don't be fooled by "sugar-free" labels! Many ultra-processed foods are loaded with synthetic starches that can be even worse for your blood sugar than sugar itself. These hidden sugars can lead to:

- **Insulin Resistance and Diabetes:** Repeated blood sugar spikes from synthetic starches can lead to insulin resistance, where your body can't properly use insulin to control blood sugar. This can progress to diabetes, a serious health condition.

- **Nutrient Depletion and Inflammation:** These starches lack essential nutrients like protein, fiber, and vitamins. They can even deplete your body of vitamin D and B1, leading to inflammation, fatigue, and impaired energy production.

- **Gut Health Issues:** Synthetic starches can disrupt your gut microbiome, feeding harmful bacteria and potentially contributing to conditions like SIBO (small intestinal bacterial overgrowth).

**Common Culprits:**

- **Modified corn starch:** Used as a thickener and flavor carrier.

- **Maltodextrin:** Often used as a filler in processed foods and even protein powders, with potentially damaging effects on your cells.

**Protect your health by:**

- **Reading labels carefully:** Don't be fooled by "sugar-free" claims. Look for hidden starches like modified corn starch, maltodextrin, and others.

- **Minimizing consumption of ultra-processed foods:** Limit your intake of packaged snacks, processed meats, and ready meals.

**Key takeaway:** Synthetic starches are hidden sugars that can wreak havoc on your health. Be aware of their presence in ultra-processed foods and make informed choices to protect your well-being.

## Boosting Your Immune System Naturally Vitamin D Vs. Prednisone

# Boosting Your Immune System Naturally: Vitamin D vs. Prednisone

**Boosting Your Immune System Naturally: Vitamin D vs. Prednisone**

Your immune system is a complex network with two main components:

- **Innate Immunity:** Your body's first line of defense, present from birth.

- **Acquired Immunity:** Develops over time as you encounter various infections.

Autoimmune diseases arise from problems with the "peacekeepers" of your immune system, called T-regulatory cells or T-cells. These cells are crucial for turning off the immune response once a threat is neutralized.

While prednisone, a synthetic cortisol, is often used to treat autoimmune diseases, it suppresses both parts of your immune system. **Vitamin D offers a different approach:**

- **Empowers Immunity:** Unlike prednisone, vitamin D enhances your immune system, particularly increasing T-cell production.

- **Reduces Inflammation:** Vitamin D suppresses inflammatory cells (TH1 and TH17), which are often overactive in autoimmune conditions.

- **Blood Sugar Control:** Prednisone can raise blood sugar levels, while vitamin D actually helps regulate them and supports insulin production.

- **Bone Health:** Prednisone can weaken bones, but vitamin D promotes calcium absorption and bone health.

- **Thymus Support:** The thymus gland, responsible for T-cell production, declines with age. Vitamin D helps slow this decline, but requires therapeutic doses and essential cofactors like magnesium, vitamin K2, and zinc.

**The Coimbra Protocol:**

Dr. Coimbra in Brazil developed a protocol using high doses of vitamin D to overcome resistance and significantly increase its levels in the body. This, in turn, lowers parathyroid hormone and helps manage autoimmune conditions.

**Key Takeaway:**

Vitamin D offers a natural way to support and modulate your immune system, unlike prednisone which suppresses it. Consult with a healthcare professional to determine if vitamin D therapy is right for you.

## The 1 Blood Test Most Overlooked For Hair Loss

# The #1 Blood Test Most Overlooked for Hair Loss

**Vitamin D: Essential for Healthy Hair Growth**

While often called a vitamin, Vitamin D actually functions as a hormone, playing a crucial role in numerous bodily processes, including hair growth. In fact, it influences approximately 10% of our genes, some of which directly impact hair follicle health.

**The Vitamin D and Hair Loss Connection**

- **Gene Regulation:** Vitamin D interacts with genes responsible for hair growth. Insufficient levels can disrupt this process, potentially leading to hair loss.

- **Immune Function:** Adequate vitamin D levels are essential for a healthy immune system. Deficiencies can increase the risk of autoimmune conditions like alopecia, where the immune system mistakenly attacks hair follicles.

- **Skin Health:** Vitamin D also plays a role in maintaining healthy skin. Conditions like psoriasis, dandruff, and dermatitis, which can contribute to hair loss, are often linked to low vitamin D levels.

**Magnesium's Role in Hair Health**

Magnesium is another critical nutrient for hair health. It regulates calcium absorption and is involved in enzymatic processes crucial for hair growth. Importantly, magnesium is also necessary for vitamin D to function optimally.

**The Two Faces of Vitamin D**

Vitamin D operates through two distinct systems in the body:

1. **Calcium Regulation:** This well-known system controls calcium absorption and bone health.

2. **Cellular Functions:** This lesser-known system impacts various cellular processes, including hair growth and restoration. This form of vitamin D has a short half-life (around 24 hours), necessitating daily replenishment through sun exposure or supplementation.

**The Global Vitamin D Deficiency Epidemic**

A widespread vitamin D deficiency is prevalent globally, contributing to various health issues, including hair loss. Factors contributing to this deficiency include:

- **Genetics**

- **Skin color**

- **Insulin resistance and diabetes**

- **Obesity**

- **Air pollution**

**Optimal Vitamin D Levels and Supplementation**

For healthy hair growth, aim to maintain blood vitamin D levels between 70 and 100 ng/mL. This may require daily supplementation of at least 20,000 IU of vitamin D along with 50 mg of magnesium.

**Other Essential Nutrients for Hair Health**

In addition to vitamin D and magnesium, ensure adequate intake of:

- **Zinc**

- **Iron**

- **Vitamin B12**

- **Omega-3 fatty acids**

**Key Genes Involved in Hair Growth**

Several genes play critical roles in hair growth, including:

1. **Sonic Hedgehog (SHH)**

2. **WNT genes**

3. **BMP (Bone Morphogenetic Protein) genes**

4. **FGF (Fibroblast Growth Factor) genes**

5. **TGF-β (Transforming Growth Factor-Beta) genes**

6. **LEF1 (Lymphoid Enhancer-Binding Factor 1)**

7. **PDGF (Platelet-Derived Growth Factor)**

8. **Dkk (Dickkopf WNT Signaling Pathway Inhibitor) genes**

9. **CTNNB1 (Beta-Catenin)**

By understanding the vital role of vitamin D and other nutrients in hair health, and taking steps to address any deficiencies, you can support optimal hair growth and restoration.

## What Specific Nutrients Are Essential For Mitigating Plaque Buildup In Aaf93C

# What specific nutrients are essential for mitigating plaque buildup in the arteries, and how do they contribute to cardiovascular health?

**Understanding Plaque**

- **Composition:** Plaque consists of cholesterol, calcium, and protein. It forms within arteries in response to inflammation or injury.

- **Types:**

    - **Soft plaque:** Unstable and prone to rupture, leading to serious complications.

    - **Hard plaque:** Calcified, more stable, and less immediately dangerous.

**Testing for Plaque**

- **CAC Test:** The Coronary Artery Calcium (CAC) test primarily detects hardened plaque, often underestimating the risk of soft plaque.

- **The CAC Paradox:** After improving your diet, your CAC score may increase. This doesn't mean your condition worsens; it reflects the stabilization of soft plaque into hard plaque, which is less dangerous in the short term.

**LDL and Plaque Risk**

- **LDL Types:**

    - **Small, dense LDL:** Highly damaging, linked to increased oxidation and plaque formation.

    - **Large, buoyant LDL:** Less harmful.

- **Testing:** Measuring myeloperoxidase and Lp-PLA2 levels, or using ultrasound, can indicate the presence of soft plaque.

**Improving Your Lipid Profile**

- **HDL:** Higher levels of "good" HDL help remove harmful LDL.

- **Triglycerides:** High triglycerides often signal excess carbohydrates in the diet.

- **Lipoprotein Insulin Resistance (LP-IR):** This test can be a strong marker for cardiovascular risk.

- **LDL/ApoB Ratio:** Here’s how to determine whether you have small dense LDL or large buoyant LDL. Divide the LDL by ApoB—the part of the lipoprotein that indicates the number of particles. You want your result to be greater than 1.2. This indicates large buoyant LDL.

The following nutrients may help remove arterial plaque buildup naturally:

1. Pycnogenol–150 mg

2. Gotu Kola–450 mg

3. Vitamin K2–Life Extension Mega K2

4. Nattokinase

5. Niacin

Vitamin K2 is the most potent inhibitor of vascular calcification. Tocotrienols, berberine, aged garlic, magnesium, potassium, and vitamin D also help to clean out plaque naturally.

## I Will Get Attacked For This...

# I Will Get Attacked for This...

**The Medical Industry: Lies and Misconceptions**

Modern medicine is often heavily influenced by big pharma and big food, leading to a focus on medication and overlooking the crucial role of nutrition. Let's expose some common medical industry lies:

1. **"You don’t need a gallbladder"** - False. Your gallbladder stores bile, essential for fat digestion. Removing it can lead to digestive issues.

2. **"Statins have minimal side effects"** - False. Statins can cause serious side effects like type 2 diabetes and liver damage.

3. **"Hypertension is caused by too much salt"** - Misleading. While reducing sodium can help, focus on increasing potassium intake for healthy blood pressure.

4. **"Low amounts of vitamin D will fix a deficiency"** - False. If deficient, you'll need much more than 600-800 IU daily, likely around 10,000 IU.

5. **"Red meat causes cancer"** - False. Grass-fed red meat is a nutrient-dense, healthy food, rich in protein, B vitamins, and essential minerals.

6. **"Avoid saturated fats"** - Misleading. The real danger lies in unhealthy unsaturated fats found in seed oils and processed foods.

7. **"Your weight is causing your health issues"** - False. Weight is often a *symptom* of underlying issues like insulin resistance.

8. **"Plant-based diets are best"** - Misleading. Many plant-based products are ultra-processed and less healthy than whole foods.

9. **"Hypoglycemia is a complication of diabetes"** - False. Hypoglycemia indicates too much insulin, but doctors often advise treating it with more sugar.

**Remember:** It's important to be informed and question conventional medical advice. Focus on a balanced, whole-food diet and prioritize your overall health.

## What Are 7 Bad Habits That Can Ruin Your Liver

# What are 7 bad habits that can ruin your liver?

**7 Lifestyle Factors That Damage Your Liver (And How to Fix Them)**

1. **Overuse of Over-the-Counter Medications:**

    - Surprisingly, common painkillers like Tylenol can lead to serious liver damage if taken excessively. It's crucial to be aware of the potential risks of all medications, even those available without a prescription. Don't assume they're harmless just because they're easily accessible.

    - Natural remedies like milk thistle and NAC can offer liver support.

2. **Leading a Sedentary Lifestyle:**

    - When you consume more calories than you burn, it stresses your body at the cellular level. Regular exercise not only helps you manage your weight but also boosts your immune system, improves circulation, and reduces stress – all of which benefit your liver. Make physical activity a regular part of your routine.

3. **Poor Dietary Choices:**

    - The combination of seed oils (like vegetable or canola oil) with sugar or starch is a recipe for liver damage. These ingredients are found in most processed foods and contribute to insulin resistance, a major factor in fatty liver disease, obesity, and other health issues.

4. **Prioritizing Convenience Over Nutrition:**

    - Busy schedules often lead to grabbing fast food or unhealthy snacks. These choices typically lack essential nutrients and can harm your liver. Plan your meals ahead of time so you're not tempted to make poor choices on the go.

5. **Chronic Stress:**

    - Stress disrupts sleep, affects blood sugar, and can even weaken your immune system. Vitamin B1, vitamin D, exercise, and spending time in nature can all help manage stress levels.

6. **Excessive Alcohol Consumption:**

    - Alcohol is processed directly by your liver, putting a significant strain on it. Sugary mixed drinks are particularly harmful. Limit your alcohol intake and avoid making it a daily habit.

7. **Nutrient Deficiencies:**

    - Your liver needs specific nutrients to function optimally. Include plenty of cruciferous vegetables (broccoli, cauliflower, kale), garlic, onion, and quality protein sources like grass-fed beef and wild-caught fish in your diet to support liver health.

## Update On The Usage Of Microcrystalline In Dr. Bergs Products

# Update on the usage of microcrystalline in Dr. Berg's products

We're excited to share that we are actively transitioning to formulas without microcrystalline cellulose! We are replacing microcrystalline cellulose with the amino acid L-leucine in our products.

Only two products, Vitamin D3 & K2 and Trace Minerals Enhanced, will continue to contain a small amount of microcrystalline cellulose. This is due to challenges encountered during production where the ingredients adhered to the machinery without it. Rest assured, we are actively researching and developing solutions to eliminate it from these products as well.

Our new and improved formula, featuring L-leucine instead of microcrystalline cellulose, is already in our Natural Vitamin B1+! This positive change will extend across our entire product line as existing inventory is replenished so you can enjoy the enhanced formula in all your favorite Dr. Berg products very soon.

## Early Signs Of Liver Damage

# 7 Early Signs of Liver Damage

**7 Surprising Signs of Liver Damage**

While alcoholic fatty liver disease is a concern, most liver issues stem from non-alcoholic fatty liver disease. Here are some unexpected signs to watch for:

1. **Bulging or Tightness Under the Right Rib Cage:** This can sometimes lead to right shoulder pain due to pressure on the phrenic nerve.

2. **Loss of Energy:** This differs from typical fatigue. You might experience decreased endurance, especially during exercise, tiredness after eating, or a need for early bedtimes.

3. **Itchiness:** Often worse at night, this itchiness, especially on the feet, is caused by bile salts building up in tissues due to liver problems.

4. **Red Dots or Spider Veins:** High estrogen levels due to liver damage can cause these skin changes. Men might also develop breast tissue, while women might experience symptoms of estrogen dominance.

5. **Thyroid Problems:** Liver issues can impact thyroid function, leading to symptoms like fatigue, hair loss, high cholesterol, and dry skin.

6. **Low Vitamin D:** Liver damage can exacerbate existing vitamin D deficiency. Look out for inflammation, weakened immunity, and muscle problems.

7. **Dark Urine:** Dark, strong-smelling urine can be a sign of liver problems.

**The Root Cause**

Whether it's a fatty liver, inflammation, or cirrhosis, the root cause of many liver problems is often the consumption of sugar, starches, and seed oils.

**The Solution**

Eliminating these culprits from your diet can potentially reverse fatty liver and improve other chronic health issues.

## How Can I End The Hypertension

# How can I end the hypertension?

Blood pressure problems are very common. Today, we’re going to talk about blood pressure and the best natural hypertension remedies. The problems with high blood pressure can extend way beyond the heart. High blood pressure can affect the brain, eyes, and kidneys. High blood pressure can also increase the risk of heart attack and stroke. In my opinion, two common causes of high blood pressure are low magnesium and low vitamin D. But hypertension could also be the result of another health issue, like hypoxia.

The typical treatment for hypertension involves lowering sodium intake or taking a diuretic. But, diuretics deplete potassium and magnesium, which could both be potential causes of high blood pressure in the first place. Calcium channel blockers and ace inhibitors are also used to treat high blood pressure, but those come with serious potential side effects. A research study also found that taking aspirin every day may not have any benefits.

Nitric oxide, on the other hand, supports the inner layer of the arteries and may help lower blood pressure. A certain enzyme in the body helps make nitric oxide. But, this enzyme can be inhibited if you have a specific genetic variation.

**One of the best natural remedies for hypertension is L-arginine.** L-arginine supports the production of nitric oxide in the body. Other great natural remedies for high blood pressure are foods like garlic and celery, which you can easily include in your diet. You may also want to take tocotrienols to support the arteries and make sure you’re getting plenty of potassium, magnesium, and vitamin D3. Changing your diet is another crucial part of dealing with high blood pressure.

## What Are The 6 Health Conditions That Could Potentially Benefit From A D3962F

# What are the 6 health conditions that could potentially benefit from addressing nutrient needs?

## Could Nutritional Deficiencies Be Hiding Behind Your Health Concerns?

Modern medicine sometimes encounters health issues with unknown causes, categorized as "idiopathic." However, research suggests some of these might be linked to nutritional deficiencies.

Here are 6 health conditions that could potentially benefit from addressing nutrient needs:

**1\. Fatigue, Mood Problems (Neurasthenia):** This could be linked to Vitamin B3 deficiency. Consider consulting a healthcare professional about including Niacin in your regimen, but avoid self-dosing at high levels. Remember, a balanced diet is also crucial.

**2\. Tourette Syndrome:** Studies suggest a possible link between Tourette's and Vitamin B3 deficiency. Niacinamide, another form of B3, might offer some relief. However, discuss proper dosage with a healthcare professional.

**3\. Persecutory Delusions:** Feelings of persecution, apathy, and disorganized thoughts might be signs of Vitamin B12 deficiency. Consulting a doctor and addressing B12 levels could be helpful.

**4\. Restless Legs Syndrome:** This could be due to either Vitamin B1 deficiency or iron deficiency. Consult a healthcare professional to identify the cause and get the right treatment.

**5\. Anxiety and Worry:** These, especially before bed, might be linked to Vitamin B1 deficiency, potentially caused by excessive carb intake. Discussing this with a doctor can help determine if dietary changes or supplements are appropriate.

**6\. Sensation of Impending Doom:** This feeling could be related to Vitamin D3 deficiency. However, high doses like 20,000 IU daily are not advisable without professional guidance.

**Important Note:** This information is for general awareness only. It's crucial to consult a healthcare professional for proper diagnosis, treatment plans, and appropriate dosages for any supplements. Self-treating with high doses of vitamins can be dangerous.

## What Are The Differences Between Water Soluble And Fat Soluble Vitamin 60F4Ed

# What are the differences between water-soluble and fat-soluble vitamins, and how do these differences affect their absorption, storage, and utilization in the body?

**Optimizing Vitamin Absorption**

The way you take your vitamins can affect their absorption. Vitamins are either fat-soluble or water-soluble:

**Fat-Soluble Vitamins**

Vitamins A, D, E, K1, and K2 require dietary fat for optimal absorption. Consuming these vitamins with a fat-containing meal can enhance their absorption. For example, vitamin D absorption increased by up to 32% when taken with fat, as noted in the *Journal of the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics*.

**Water-Soluble Vitamins**

Vitamins C and the B-complex vitamins do not require fat for absorption and are effective even on an empty stomach. However, since these vitamins are not stored in the body, regular intake is necessary. The National Institutes of Health notes that up to 90% of vitamin C can be absorbed when taken in doses of 180 mg or less daily.

## What Are The Unusual Symptoms And Signs Of An Iodine Deficiency

# What are the unusual symptoms and signs of an iodine deficiency?

Many people have low iodine. You're likely iodine deficient unless you consume shellfish, seaweed, sea kelp, or vegetables grown on the coast. The level of iodine in your body really depends on the level of iodine in the food you eat and the soil it's grown in. If you're deficient in iodine, you could end up with a hypothyroid condition.

**Overlooked signs of an iodine deficiency:**

1\. Estrogen dominance. Iodine helps regulate estrogen and helps prevent estrogen dominance. It also supports detoxification.

2\. High cortisol levels. Iodine helps normalize cortisol levels.

3\. A hypothyroid condition. Hypothyroidism can cause the cholesterol in your body to be elevated but unusable for making vitamin D, cell membranes, and bile.

4\. Side effects when consuming soy products. Iodine helps buffer the estrogen effects of consuming soy products.

5\. Hashimoto's. You still need iodine if you have Hashimoto's, but not excess iodine. You may also need selenium, zinc, vitamin D, and myo-inositol.

## What Are The Best Top Foods For Kidney Disease

# What are the best top foods for kidney disease?

The top causes of kidney problems are diabetes, insulin resistance, and high-sugar, high-carb diets. Consuming a low-carb diet, like the Healthy Keto® diet, and doing intermittent fasting are two of the best things you can do to help prevent kidney disease. But, if you have stage 3A through stage 5 kidney disease, you may want to consider making some adjustments to your keto plan.

If you have a kidney problem, it’s important to work with your doctor to make sure certain nutrients aren’t out of range. These nutrients include potassium, sodium, and phosphorus. Protein levels can also become too high if someone has a kidney problem.

The best diet tips for kidney disease:

• Consume lower amounts of high-quality protein (pasture-raised organic eggs, wild-caught fish, seafood, and grass-fed, grass-finished beef)

• Consume lower amounts of sodium (2,300 mg of sodium per day)

• Avoid processed foods and junk foods

• Avoid high-potassium foods and consume low-potassium foods

• Avoid soda

## How To Lower Blood Pressure Simply By Cutting Out Sugar

# How to lower blood pressure simply by cutting out sugar?

High blood pressure can significantly affect your health, but understanding its causes and adopting natural solutions can help you manage it effectively.

One major contributor to high blood pressure is sugar. Unlike the common belief that salt is the primary culprit, sugar often plays a more significant role. When you consume sugary foods, your body releases more insulin to manage the spike in blood sugar. This, in turn, activates your sympathetic nervous system, the "fight or flight" response, leading to elevated blood pressure.

Recognizing the symptoms of sympathetic dominance, such as a lump in the throat, cold extremities, rapid heartbeat, anxiety, insomnia, and panic attacks, is crucial for early identification of high blood pressure. By paying attention to these signs, you can take proactive measures to manage your blood pressure naturally.

Cutting out sugar from your diet is a powerful step towards lowering blood pressure. It reduces insulin spikes, prevents unnecessary stress on your cardiovascular system, and improves overall health by aiding weight management, reducing inflammation, and enhancing mental clarity.

The ketogenic diet is another effective tool for blood pressure regulation. By lowering carb intake and increasing healthy fats, it reduces insulin levels and activates the parasympathetic nervous system, promoting relaxation and lowering inflammation. Fatty fish, eggs, nuts, seeds, oils like olive oil and coconut oil, and leafy green vegetables are all excellent choices for a keto diet.

In addition to dietary changes, incorporating natural remedies like vitamin D and potassium-rich foods can further support healthy blood pressure levels. Vitamin D, obtained through sunlight, supplements, or specific foods, is crucial for maintaining balanced blood pressure. Potassium-rich foods like bananas, avocados, and dairy products can also help regulate blood pressure.

Remember, a healthy lifestyle encompassing dietary changes, exercise, stress management, and sufficient sleep is key to naturally managing high blood pressure. Consult with your doctor before making any significant changes to your diet or lifestyle, especially if you have underlying health conditions.  

By understanding the impact of sugar and insulin on your body and adopting natural solutions like a keto diet, vitamin D, potassium-rich foods, and lifestyle modifications, you can take charge of your health and effectively manage your blood pressure.

## What Kind Of Fat Is Dangerous

# What kind of fat is dangerous?

In this video, I'll share strategies to lose belly fat by targeting visceral fat, the harmful type stored around your organs.

**Understanding Fat Storage:**

Your body stores fat as a survival mechanism, but there's a limit. Excess fat, especially from unhealthy calories like alcohol and processed foods, accumulates around organs as visceral fat. If not addressed, it spills into organs as ectopic fat. The good news? This is the first fat burned when you lose weight.

**Causes of Excess Visceral Fat:**

- **Unhealthy calories:** Alcohol, high fructose corn syrup, and processed foods are major culprits.

- **Chronic stress:** Stress can trigger your body to turn substances into sugar, leading to fat storage.

- **Poor sleep:** Lack of sleep raises cortisol levels, contributing to visceral fat.

- **Certain medications:** Steroids, antibiotics, antidepressants, and anti-anxiety drugs can increase visceral fat.

- **Unhealthy fats and sugars:** Seed oils, refined sugars, and starches harm your mitochondria and promote visceral fat storage.

**Effective Strategies to Reduce Visceral Fat:**

- **Eliminate ultra-processed foods:** Focus on nutrient-dense options like red meat, eggs, fish, and vegetables.

- **HIIT exercise:** Short bursts of intense exercise followed by rest are highly effective for fat burning.

- **Weight training:** Build muscle to boost metabolism and burn more calories at rest.

- **Long walks:** Reduce stress and burn calories simultaneously.

- **Optimize nutrition:**

    - **Vitamin B1:** Found in nutritional yeast, it helps reduce stress and improve sleep.

    - **Vitamin D3:** Take 10,000 IU daily (with magnesium) if you lack sun exposure.

- **Consider fasting:** Fasting can help reduce insulin spikes and promote fat burning.

By understanding the causes of visceral fat and implementing these strategies, you can effectively reduce belly fat, improve your health, and achieve your weight loss goals.

## How Should I Address Vertigo

# How should I address vertigo?

While Vitamin D and Magnesium play significant roles in calcium regulation, there are additional things you can do. Incorporating a proper diet, along with specific lifestyle changes, might help reduce your risk. Let’s explore these further:

### **1\. Hydration: Strike a Balance**

Dehydration can often mimic the sensations of vertigo, making proper hydration crucial for managing the condition. But there's a catch – simply increasing your water intake might not always be the solution.

As odd as it sounds, just like dehydration, excessive water consumption can also disrupt your body's electrolyte balance, potentially making vertigo worse.

Instead, aim for a healthy balance and consider incorporating electrolyte-rich drinks. These drinks can be especially helpful if you're experiencing BPPV symptoms. They are especially useful during a fast.

### **2\. Reduce Caffeine and Alcohol Intake**

Both caffeine and alcohol are known diuretics. This means they can actually exacerbate dehydration by increasing fluid loss, potentially worsening vertigo. So, it’s best to enjoy these beverages in moderation.

Consider limiting their consumption, especially if you're prone to frequent vertigo episodes. Too much caffeine or alcohol can make you go to the bathroom more, which can lead to dehydration.

### **3\. Manage Stress Effectively**

We know that stress negatively affects overall health, but you may be surprised to learn that stress can also worsen vertigo symptoms. The symptoms of BPPV can be triggered by certain head positions, and stress can make these symptoms worse.

Engage in stress-reducing activities such as deep breathing exercises. Experiment with what works best for you to keep your stress in check.  Managing stress can help you find relief from your vertigo.

### **4\. Address Food Sensitivities**

Sometimes, underlying food sensitivities might trigger inflammation and worsen your vertigo. Common culprits include dairy, gluten, and processed foods. If you find you have these issues, trying an elimination diet can help identify any potential triggers.

Once you pinpoint them, eliminating or reducing their consumption might bring you some relief. If you have BPPV, your healthcare provider may recommend certain dietary changes, which could include avoiding certain trigger foods.

## Does Eating Eggs Increase Your Risk Of Dying From Heart Disease

# Does Eating Eggs Increase Your Risk of Dying from Heart Disease?

Out of ten recent studies on eggs and heart disease, all of the studies were observational, and all but two of the studies were self-reported.

Studies that require people to recall everything that they’ve eaten over a period of time are generally inaccurate. People often forget what they’ve eaten and focus on the positive things they can remember eating rather than reporting the negative.

People often forget what they’ve eaten and focus on the positive things they can remember eating rather than reporting the negative. Questionnaires do not prove causation. There was also a conflict of interest in many of these studies.

Eggs are one of the most nutrient-dense foods you can consume. The egg yolk contains almost every nutrient except vitamin C.

Egg yolks from pasture-raised eggs are an excellent source of the following: •Vitamins B1, B2, B3, B5, B6, B9, B12 •The active form of vitamin A (retinol) •Vitamin E •Vitamin K2 •Vitamin D •Omega-3 fatty acids •Potassium, magnesium, and selenium.

Eggs are the best source of protein next to human breast milk and are one of the best sources of choline.

Egg yolks promote healthy levels of cholesterol. They can increase HDL cholesterol and can increase the size of your LDL cholesterol.

Egg yolks are the perfect combination of protein and fat and can help reduce insulin resistance. Egg yolks contain lutein and zeaxanthin—carotenoids that are most commonly found in vegetables. These carotenoids are more bioavailable in eggs and help protect the eye from macular degeneration and cataracts. They also protect the endothelial tissue inside of your arteries.

Eggs don't cause heart problems—they help with heart problems!

# I Might Get Banned for This...

The current recommended daily allowance (RDA) for vitamin D is a mere 600 IU (international units), a surprisingly small amount considering its vast potential health benefits. This has sparked controversy, likely due to the numerous conditions vitamin D may positively impact.

In the early 1900s, before modern medicine, heliotherapy (sunbathing) was used to treat a wide range of ailments, including tuberculosis, asthma, osteoporosis, tooth decay, psoriasis, mood disorders, diabetes, heart disease, and even cancer.

A nine-year study conducted by the University of Illinois Chicago, commissioned by the government, involving hundreds of doctors, patients, and even dogs, found no toxicity even at extremely high doses of vitamin D (200,000-1,000,000 IU).

Despite this, Dr. Bruce Hollis, a leading vitamin D researcher, notes that many in the field are hesitant to embrace the extensive data supporting its benefits.

Interestingly, data shows that populations living closer to the equator, with higher sun exposure and thus greater vitamin D levels, have lower rates of multiple sclerosis, breast cancer, colorectal cancer, and diabetes.

Factors like vitamin D resistance, age, darker skin, and higher body weight can increase your vitamin D needs. It's crucial to consult with a healthcare professional to determine the optimal dosage for your individual circumstances.

## The Most Powerful Group Behind What You Eat

# The Most Powerful Group Behind What You Eat

In the food industry, immense power resides with a mere quartet of companies: Archer Daniels Midland, Bunge, Cargill, and Louis Dreyfus. These four giants dominate the global grain trade, controlling a staggering 90%. Their influence extends to products derived from corn, soy, wheat, sugar, and rice, which collectively constitute roughly 68% of the average American's caloric intake.

These companies act as intermediaries between farmers and food corporations, wielding significant control over the supply chain. However, the food industry is not without its problems. Rampant corruption exists, with many "junk food brands" also owning organic and natural brands, pet food, and even vitamin and supplement companies.

A common thread among ultra-processed foods is their reliance on starches, sugars, and seed oils. Sugar is employed to create addictive cravings, seed oils are essentially repurposed waste, and starches, composed of sugar chains, serve as fillers.

Worryingly, starches trigger a more dramatic insulin spike than sugar itself. Maltodextrin, a common starch, has a glycemic index of 185, dwarfing sugar's index of 65. The overconsumption of fillers and starches can lead to serious health issues.

Remember, consumer choices hold immense power. By opting for healthier alternatives, we can reduce the demand for these harmful products, thereby influencing the market and promoting positive change.

## Whats An Aneurysm

# What's an aneurysm?

## The Silent Threat: Aneurysms and How to Protect Your Arteries

Aneurysms can be like ticking time bombs in our bodies. These weak spots in our arteries often bulge outwards without any warning signs until they rupture.

**What are Aneurysms?**

Imagine a weak spot in your artery wall that balloons outward. That's an aneurysm. They can occur anywhere in the body, but the brain (causing stroke) and aorta (the main artery leaving the heart) are common locations.

**Silent Danger:**

The scary part? Early detection is difficult because aneurysms frequently show no symptoms until they rupture.

**What Raises Your Risk?**

Several factors can weaken your arteries and increase your risk:

- **Smoking:** Smokers are four times more likely to develop an aneurysm.

- **Unhealthy Habits:** Chronic alcohol use, diabetes, high sugar intake, and seed oil consumption all contribute.

- **Inflammation:** Anything causing chronic inflammation, like dental bacteria, can be a risk factor.

**Protect Your Arteries:**

The good news: You can take steps to safeguard your blood vessels:

- **Manage Blood Pressure:** High blood pressure puts extra strain on your arteries. Increase potassium, magnesium, and vitamin D intake, and consider a low-carb diet for better control.

- **Fight Inflammation:** Avoid inflammatory foods like processed meats and refined carbohydrates.

- **Embrace Antioxidants:** These fighters combat free radical damage that weakens arteries. Berries, vegetables, and green tea are rich in antioxidants.

- **Omega-3 Power:** Fatty fish like salmon are packed with omega-3s, which promote healthy blood flow.

- **Vitamin D Boost:** Studies suggest vitamin D deficiency may be linked to aneurysms. Increase sun exposure or consider supplements.

- **Move Your Body:** Regular exercise strengthens your heart and improves blood circulation.

**Remember, a healthy lifestyle is your best defense against aneurysms. If you have a family history or suspect you might be at risk, consult your doctor for further evaluation.**

## What Are The Most Effective Medical And Lifestyle Interventions For Ad 200250

# What are the most effective medical and lifestyle interventions for addressing mitral valve prolapse, particularly in cases where symptoms or complications require treatment?

If you have mitral valve prolapse, your heart valves are not opening and closing correctly.

**Mitral valve prolapse causes floppy, leaky valves that are large and bulging.** This bulging, displaced tissue is called prolapse, which leads to inefficient heart pumping. Mitral valve prolapse symptoms include weakness, fatigue, palpitations, anxiety, and shortness of breath. It’s often described as idiopathic, which means it has no known cause. Mitral valve prolapse is generally treated with beta-blockers or a calcium channel blocker.

In a double-blind study, 141 subjects with mitral valve prolapse were compared to 40 healthy subjects. Sixty percent of the mitral valve prolapse group had magnesium deficiency compared to only 5% of the healthy subjects.

**Low magnesium leads to high adrenaline.** It also accelerates the aging of the fibroblast cell, which helps you make collagen, elastin, and hyaluronic acid. As we age, the fibroblast cell is very important for our skin, ligaments, tendons, and valves.

**One of the first signs of magnesium deficiency is tetany.** Surprisingly, 85% of people with mitral valve prolapse have tetany! Don’t just rely on the RDA if you’re deficient in magnesium. Try taking 400 mg 2 to 3 times a day, working up to this amount slowly. Also, ensure you’re getting enough vitamin D. Magnesium won’t work without vitamin D!

**WHAT TO DO**

Avoid sugar and refined carbs because they significantly decrease magnesium. It takes years for a magnesium deficiency to show up and it can take up to a year to correct. Try magnesium glycinate to increase your magnesium levels over time.

## Is It Possible To Reduce The Size Of A Cancer Tumor And What Treatment 4Fbaf1

# Is it possible to reduce the size of a cancer tumor, and what treatments or strategies are most effective in achieving tumor shrinkage?

Dr. Berg Nutritionals cannot diagnose, treat, or cure any disease, including cancer. Any information provided is for informational purposes and does not replace medical treatment plans. Based on this understanding, here are steps that can be inferred to potentially help in reducing the size of a cancer tumor or support overall cancer treatment:

1. **Dietary Adjustments**:

    - Limit glucose (sugar) consumption: The link between food intake, especially glucose consumption, and cancer risk is significant. Reducing glucose intake can potentially slow down the growth of cancer cells, as they often rely on sugar for energy. The Healthy Keto diet is a great way to reduce glucose.

2. **Fasting**:

    - Implement fasting protocols: Fasting is a strategic approach that can weaken cancer cells. When you fast, your healthy cells become more resilient, while cancer cells may lose their competitive edge. This can potentially make the body less hospitable to cancer growth.

3. **Exercise**:

    - Regular physical activity: Integrating exercise into your routine can promote cellular repair and improve overall health. Exercise has been shown to support the body's ability to fight off cancer by strengthening the immune system and potentially inhibiting tumor growth.

4. **Reducing Inflammation**:

    - Adopt anti-inflammatory practices: Since cancer can spread into areas of inflammation, reducing inflammation in the body may help slow down or prevent the spreading of cancer cells. This can be achieved through dietary choices, lifestyle changes, and possibly supplements that have anti-inflammatory properties, such as vitamin D and turmeric.

5. **Stress Management and Social Connections**:

    - Manage stress and foster social connections: Chronic stress and loneliness can weaken the immune system and make the body more susceptible to cancer. By managing stress through techniques such as meditation, yoga, or therapy and by seeking out social connections and community support, you can strengthen your body's defenses against cancer.

**It's important to note that these steps should be considered supportive or complementary strategies in a comprehensive cancer treatment plan developed by healthcare professionals. Always consult with your doctor or a medical professional before making significant changes to your lifestyle, diet, or exercise routine, especially when dealing with cancer.**

## Whats The Biggest Lie About Food

# What's the biggest lie about food?

## Understanding Cholesterol: Friend or Foe?

Cholesterol gets a bad rap, but it actually plays a vital role in our bodies. Made by the liver, it's used to build healthy cell walls, hormones, and even vitamin D.

**Fats 101:**

Fats come in two main categories: saturated and unsaturated. Saturated fats, like those in coconut oil (87%) and lard (47%), are solid at room temperature. Unsaturated fats, on the other hand, are liquid (think olive oil).

**The Cholesterol Myth:**

Dietary cholesterol from foods like steak doesn't have a huge impact on your overall cholesterol levels. Here's the surprising truth: your body actually makes about 80% of the cholesterol you need. It's a smart system – if you eat more cholesterol, your body naturally produces less. The opposite is true too – if you consume less, your body ramps up production.

**The Real Culprits:**

So, what should you really be mindful of? Here's where the plot twist comes in. While cholesterol itself isn't inherently bad, it's the company it keeps that matters. Sugar, smoking, trans fats, and seed oils can create an unhealthy environment for cholesterol, potentially increasing your risk of heart problems.

## When Should Magnesium Not Be Taken For Sleep And Anxiety And What Are  29Bb1C

# When should magnesium not be taken for sleep and anxiety, and what are the potential risks or contraindications to consider?

Sometimes, low magnesium is not the cause of your anxiety or sleep problems, and taking it can even worsen your symptoms. The second part of sleep is called REM sleep. People with higher levels of adrenaline and cortisol tend to wake up around 2:00 am during REM sleep. Magnesium will not fix this problem because the high cortisol levels are not caused by low magnesium.

Stress and lack of exercise can cause poor sleep. Exercise, long walks, and physical labor can reduce stress and improve sleep. If you find that you have difficulty getting to sleep because of racing thoughts and overthinking, you may be low in vitamin B1. Carbs, sugar, and caffeine can deplete vitamin B1. Taking B1 before bed can provide an immediate sense of calmness. Always choose a natural B1 supplement, not synthetic.

Instead of taking a melatonin supplement, it can be more beneficial to address why you do not have enough melatonin in the first place. Melatonin is inhibited by blue light. Darkness and infrared light recharge melatonin, so try getting sunlight or sitting by a fire. Vitamin D before bed can help you sleep. Magnesium will not work if you're very low in vitamin D and vice versa.

If you're new to fasting and you go to bed hungry, it can interfere with your sleep. If fasting triggered your sleep problem, scale back, and begin fasting more gradually over time. Try incorporating more carbs at your last meal and increasing your carb intake to 50 grams per day. Having plenty of sea salt on keto and intermittent fasting is vital. Salt causes your body to retain fluid, so not only will it help you sleep, but it can also help prevent waking to use the bathroom. If you do need magnesium, try taking magnesium glycinate to help support sleep and reduce anxiety.

## Why Am I Short

# Why am I short?

Stunted growth often stems from malnutrition. Zinc deficiency, for instance, can hinder growth by affecting hormone production. Issues with the pituitary gland, which regulates growth hormone, also impact height.

In children, growth hormone supports bone and muscle development, while in adults, it aids protein preservation, weight management, and anti-aging. Amino acids stimulate growth hormone production, but insufficient protein intake, high blood glucose, sugary diets, insulin resistance, and poor sleep can suppress it.

The liver produces insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1), crucial for growth. Deficiencies in IGF-1, triggered by inadequate amino acids and zinc found in red meat, fish, and shellfish, can affect height. Diets high in phytic acid, common in regions like the Republic of the Congo (primarily rice, grains, corn, cereals), block zinc absorption, leading to deficiency and impacting immunity. Stress, sugar, and insulin resistance also contribute to zinc deficiency.

Vitamin D is vital for growth, but many are deficient due to reduced outdoor activity and excessive junk food consumption among children, compounded by gut inflammation hindering absorption.

## Can Healthy Keto Help With Psoriasis

# Can Healthy Keto help with psoriasis?

Yes, the Healthy Keto® diet can help with psoriasis. Here are some key points from Dr. Berg's recommendations:

\- **Anti-Inflammatory Foods**: Incorporating anti-inflammatory foods such as berries, vegetables, fatty fish, and nuts into your diet can help reduce inflammation, which may alleviate symptoms of psoriasis.

\- **Healthy Fats**: Consuming healthy fats like avocados, nuts, and fatty fish provides essential fatty acids for maintaining healthy skin. These fatty acids help moisturize your skin, reduce inflammation, and protect against sun damage.

\- **Vitamin D and Omega-3 Fatty Acids**: Supplementing with vitamin D and omega-3 fatty acids, found in cod liver oil, can help manage psoriasis symptoms. Vitamin D helps regulate T-cells, and omega-3s are potent anti-inflammatories that can reduce dry, scaly, and red skin.

\- **Bile Salts**: Bile salts stimulate vitamin D receptors, allowing vitamin D to work more effectively in the body, which can benefit psoriasis.

\- **Intermittent Fasting**: Combining intermittent fasting with a ketogenic diet can significantly lower insulin levels and improve skin conditions. Limiting your eating window each day gives your body a chance to rest and repair, which can benefit skin health.

By taking charge of your diet and incorporating these elements, you can actively manage symptoms of psoriasis and improve overall skin health. Remember, always consult with your healthcare provider to determine the best treatment plan for your individual needs.

## What Vitamin Deficiency Mimics Dementia

# What vitamin deficiency mimics dementia?

**Vitamin B12: Vital for Brain Health and Beyond**

Vitamin B12 is crucial for brain function. Deficiency can cause symptoms resembling dementia. Here's what you need to know:

- **Why B12 Matters:** Supports healthy brain cells and nerve function.

- **Where to Find It:** It is primarily found in animal products (meat, fish, dairy), though some microbes also produce it. Vegan and vegetarian diets may increase the risk of deficiency.

- **Low Stomach Acid: A Common Culprit:** Stomach acid (HCL) is needed to absorb B12. Age, antacids, and certain medications (like Metformin) can reduce HCL levels.

- **Boosting Stomach Acid:** Betaine hydrochloride may help normalize acidity.

- **Medication Side Effects:** Dementia-like symptoms can be caused by common medications like antacids, sleep aids, blood pressure drugs, and more.

- **Other Potential Nutrient Deficiencies:** Low levels of vitamin B1 (linked to high sugar/carb intake), zinc, and vitamin D can also mimic dementia symptoms.

**Preventing and Addressing B12 Deficiency**

- **Brain-Boosting Diet:** Emphasize fatty fish, seafood, and red meat while following a healthy keto and intermittent fasting plan. This provides B12 and ketones, which are an alternative fuel for the brain.

- **Supplementation:** Betaine hydrochloride may help if low stomach acid is the cause.

**\*Please keep in mind that the above is not a medical advice. You should see your doctor about any possible medical conditions.**

People with darker skin tones have more melanin, making it more difficult to absorb vitamin D. It also becomes more difficult to absorb vitamin D as you age.

**Chronic vitamin D deficiency can lead to obesity.**

The more overweight a person is, the more vitamin D they need. The characteristics of metabolic syndrome align perfectly with the symptoms of vitamin D deficiency. Vitamin D deficiency can create inflammation, high blood glucose, high blood pressure, and insulin resistance. Insulin resistance is the driving factor behind obesity. If you have insulin resistance, you have too much insulin. Insulin is a fat-storing hormone that causes you to gain weight. Vitamin D helps keep insulin sensitive, but vitamin D doesn’t work well if you have insulin resistance.

**Colorado is a high-altitude state situated several thousand feet above sea level.**

This means it’s closer to the sun. The closer you are to the sun, the more vitamin D you’re exposed to. Vitamin D exposure in Colorado could be the most critical variable influencing people's weight.

## What Are Some Counterintuitive Health Tips That Despite Seeming Unusua 864Be0

# What are some counterintuitive health tips that, despite seeming unusual, have proven to be highly effective for improving health?

**Hormesis describes two things that might oppose each other. In terms of health, hormesis refers to a controlled dose of stress that makes positive changes for your body.**

With hormesis, you can adapt to various types of stress, including exercise, radiation, cold, heat, hypoxia, plant chemicals, pesticides, insecticides, and fungicides. Sulforaphane found in broccoli sprouts and radish sprouts triggers the heat shock protein that allows the body to strengthen its detoxification enzymes. In this instance, the body is exposed to a small amount of poison that strengthens its ability to get rid of other poisons.

**The liver** contains phase 1 and phase 2 detoxification enzymes that can take a poison and turn it into a harmless particle. Sulforaphane triggers this system.

**Exercise** is one of the best examples of hormesis. Exercise induces microinflammation but then allows the body to get rid of inflammation.

**Fasting** activates the body’s mechanisms that counter starvation. It encourages our brain cells to grow, increases mitochondria, and regenerates the immune system.

**Health is often counterintuitive.** For example, cutting fat won’t help you lose fat, and sterilizing your environment won’t protect you from getting sick.

You can’t develop a strong immune system without getting sick. Antibiotics destroy good bacteria in the body, which can lead to pathogen overgrowth. Antacids can lead to more heartburn because you need more acid to get rid of heartburn.

When you don't expose yourself to the sun, you put yourself more at risk for certain types of cancers. Many people have been told that the sun causes cancer, but the sun gives us vitamin D. Having a deficiency in vitamin D can increase your risk for cancer.

**One last example is dieting.** The more dieting you do in your lifetime, the more weight you will gain—especially if you’re doing it incorrectly.

## Can Increasing My Intake Of Calcium Citrate Support Bone Growth And Wh Ca84C7

# Can increasing my intake of calcium citrate support bone growth, and what should I consider when adjusting my calcium supplementation?

Well peripheral neuropathy is, if you're on supplements for that, then you want to take more calcium for bones, two different problems. To build bone, you really want, it's not just about calcium.

I would recommend having the full array of trace minerals to build bone. **Make sure you have enough of the amino acids, high quality amino acids from animal meats, specifically red meat. And then also, you definitely need calcium for sure, but also the vitamins that help the calcium go into the bones, like vitamin K2.**

And so where do you get that? **That's from sauerkraut, cheese, which then you can also get the calcium as well, fatty liver, things like that, that'll give you the K2. And of course, don't forget vitamin D, so you can get that from the sun, a cow liver oil, or a supplement. Those are the things that I would focus on if you want to strengthen the bone.**

**Of course the peripheral neuropathy, that would be a combination of benfotiamine and alpha lipoic acid.**

## What Are The Reasons For Avoiding Synthetic Vitamins Particularly In C 0C8Dcd

# What are the reasons for avoiding synthetic vitamins, particularly in comparison to their natural counterparts, when considering health and nutrient absorption?

**Synthetic vs. Natural Vitamins: What's the Difference?**

Synthetic and natural vitamins are fundamentally different. Natural vitamins exist within complex structures in food. While isolated natural vitamins are better than synthetic versions, there are specific instances where synthetic vitamins may be temporarily useful.

**When Synthetic Vitamins May Be Used:**

- **Short-term detox programs:** May sometimes include synthetic vitamins.

- **Benfotiamine:** A fat-soluble form of vitamin B1 (thiamine) with minimal side effects.

**Why Natural Vitamins Are Usually Superior:**

- **Safety:** Synthetic vitamins have a higher potential for toxicity and can even cause deficiencies.

- **Structure:** Synthetic vitamins are isolated fractions, lacking the natural components of whole-food vitamins.

- **Absorption:** Natural vitamins are more readily absorbed and utilized by your body.

- **Cofactors:** Natural vitamins come with essential cofactors, enzymes, and trace minerals that enhance their function.

**Spotting Truly Natural Vitamins:**

The best way is to examine the ingredients list:

- **Natural/Whole-food:** Look for terms like "herb-based" or "concentrated food."

- **Synthetic:** Ingredients will list individual vitamins with identical dosages (e.g., B1 - 100mg, B2 - 100mg, etc.).

**A Note on Liver:**

Liver pills are an exception, but excessive consumption (whether food or pills) can lead to iron or vitamin A overload.

## Is There Such Thing As Vitamin D Toxicity

# Is there such thing as Vitamin D toxicity?

**Understanding Vitamin D, Magnesium, and K2**

Taking high doses of vitamin D3 can sometimes lead to symptoms that may initially be mistaken for vitamin D toxicity. However, it's often a case of magnesium or vitamin K2 deficiency.

**Magnesium's Importance**

Magnesium is essential for many bodily functions, and deficiency is common. If you are taking vitamin D without enough magnesium, you may experience symptoms like:

- Irritability

- Insomnia

- Constipation

- Fatigue

- Muscle spasms/cramps

- Calcium buildup

- Arrhythmia

**The K2 Connection**

Vitamin K2 is crucial for preventing excess calcium buildup in soft tissues. Since Vitamin D significantly increases calcium absorption, having sufficient vitamin K2 is important. Some symptoms of vitamin D toxicity may actually be signs of vitamin K depletion.

**Cautions and Considerations**

While case studies of vitamin D toxicity exist, consider that these often involve subjects lacking sufficient magnesium or K2, or using vitamin D2 instead of D3.

It's best to avoid additional calcium supplements when concerned about vitamin D toxicity, as excess calcium in the blood (hypercalcemia) is a key symptom.

**Therapeutic Benefits**

Vitamin D offers therapeutic potential for many health conditions. While the Mayo Clinic recommends 600 IU, brief sun exposure provides significantly more. For conditions like autoimmunity, therapeutic doses can be beneficial – as in Dr. Coimbra's protocol involving up to 200,000 IU.

**Supplementation Strategy**

If taking vitamin D supplements, always ensure you're also getting sufficient magnesium and vitamin K2. Adequate intake of boron, zinc, and vitamin A is also important.

**Disclaimer: Please consult your doctor before making significant changes to your vitamin and mineral intake.**

## What Lifestyle Changes Do I Need To Make To Combat Chronic Inflammation

# What lifestyle changes do I need to make to combat chronic inflammation?

## **Lifestyle Changes to Combat Chronic Inflammation**

While chronic inflammation can have serious consequences for your health, the good news is that many lifestyle changes can help reduce inflammation in your body.

These include dietary modifications, regular physical activity, stress reduction, and improved sleep habits.

### **Diet Modifications for Reducing Inflammation**

One of the most effective ways to combat chronic inflammation is through your diet. Certain foods have been shown to have anti-inflammatory properties, while others can promote inflammation in the body.

Some of the best anti-inflammatory foods to include in your diet are:

- Fatty fish like salmon, sardines, and mackerel, which are rich in omega-3 fatty acids

- Leafy green vegetables like spinach and kale

- Berries, especially blueberries, raspberries, and strawberries

- Nuts and seeds, particularly walnuts and flaxseeds

- Olive oil

- Turmeric, ginger, and other spices with anti-inflammatory properties

On the other hand, there are certain foods that can promote inflammation in the body and should be limited or avoided. These include:

- Refined carbohydrates like white bread, pastries, and sugary snacks

- Fried foods and foods high in trans fats

- Red meat and processed meats like hot dogs and bacon

- Sugar-sweetened beverages like soda and sports drinks

Adopting a low-carb, high-fat diet like the ketogenic diet has also been shown to help reduce inflammation in some people. Additionally, practicing intermittent fasting may have anti-inflammatory benefits by giving your body a break from constant food intake.

### **The Importance of Physical Activity**

Regular physical activity is another key lifestyle factor for reducing chronic inflammation. Exercise has been shown to have anti-inflammatory effects in the body, partly by reducing levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines like TNF-alpha.

Aim for at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity aerobic exercise or 75 minutes of vigorous-intensity exercise per week, along with strength training exercises at least twice a week.

Even small amounts of physical activity can help reduce inflammation over time.

![Image](https://drberg-dam.imgix.net/video-thumbnails/9bf2d902-4282-456c-8ce8-9260f6d5b5c5.jpg?w=992&auto=compress,format)

### **Reducing Stress and Improving Sleep**

[Chronic stress](https://www.drberg.com/blog/chronic-stress-literally-destroys-immunity) and poor sleep habits can also contribute to inflammation in the body. When you're stressed, your body releases cortisol and other stress hormones that can promote inflammation if they remain elevated for too long.

Similarly, lack of sleep or poor sleep quality can disrupt your body's natural inflammatory response and contribute to chronic inflammation over time.

To help reduce stress and improve sleep, try incorporating some of the following strategies into your daily routine:

- Engage in regular physical activity, which can help reduce stress and improve sleep quality

- Establish a consistent sleep schedule and create a relaxing bedtime routine

- Limit exposure to screens and electronic devices before bed

- Create a cool, dark, and quiet sleep environment

In addition to these lifestyle changes, increasing your intake of vitamin D3 through sunlight exposure or supplementation may also help reduce inflammation in the body.

Vitamin D3 has been shown to have anti-inflammatory properties and may help regulate the immune system.

Finally, avoiding excessive intake of omega-6 fatty acids, which are found in many processed foods and vegetable oils, may also be beneficial for reducing inflammation.

While some omega-6 fatty acids are essential for health, consuming too many of them in relation to omega-3 fatty acids can promote inflammation in the body.

## Effective Nutritional Treatments For Common Eye Conditions

# Effective Nutritional Treatments for Common Eye Conditions

## **Effective Nutritional Treatments for Common Eye Conditions**

While a balanced diet is essential for overall eye health, certain nutrients can also be used to target specific eye conditions.

From pesky allergies to more serious autoimmune disorders, the right combination of vitamins and minerals can work wonders in alleviating symptoms and promoting healing. Let's take a closer look at some effective nutritional treatments for common eye issues.

### **Treating Conjunctivitis with Zinc and Colloidal Silver**

[Conjunctivitis, also known as pink eye](https://www.drberg.com/blog/colloidal-silver-pink-eye), is a highly contagious inflammation of the conjunctiva, the thin membrane that covers the white part of the eye.

While viral conjunctivitis often clears up, supplementing with zinc and colloidal silver can speed up the healing process.

Zinc has potent antiviral properties that can help fight off the infection, while colloidal silver acts as a natural antibiotic to reduce inflammation and prevent secondary bacterial infections.

To avoid any potential side effects, be sure to use a high-quality, sterile solution and follow the recommended dosage.

### **Alleviating Allergy Symptoms with Vitamin A**

If you suffer from seasonal allergies, you know how miserable they can make your eyes feel - red, itchy, watery, and just plain uncomfortable. But did you know that vitamin A can be a powerful ally in the fight against allergy symptoms?

Vitamin A helps to support the health of the mucous membranes in your eyes, which act as a natural barrier against allergens and irritants.

[Cod liver oil](https://www.drberg.com/blog/the-real-reason-why-you-should-take-cod-liver-oil-dr-berg) is an excellent vitamin A source, and a daily supplement can help reduce inflammation and soothe allergy-induced redness and irritation.

### **The Anti-inflammatory Benefits of Vitamin D for Autoimmune Disorders**

[Autoimmune disorders](https://www.drberg.com/blog/whats-at-the-root-of-an-autoimmune-condition) like uveitis and Sjogren's syndrome can cause severe inflammation in the eyes, leading to pain, vision changes, and even permanent damage if left untreated.

But research shows that vitamin D can be a powerful anti-inflammatory agent for managing these conditions.

[Vitamin D](https://www.drberg.com/blog/7-facts-about-vitamin-d-you-never-knew) helps to regulate the immune system and prevent it from attacking healthy tissues in the body, including the eyes.

Supplementing with vitamin D3, the most bioavailable form of the nutrient, can help reduce inflammation and alleviate symptoms of autoimmune-related eye disorders. Just be sure to work with your doctor to determine the right dosage for your specific needs.

In addition to these targeted treatments, maintaining adequate vitamin A levels is crucial for preventing dry eyes, a common symptom of many eye conditions.

If you struggle with vitamin A absorption due to digestive issues, adding purified bile salts to your supplement regimen can help enhance absorption and ensure your eyes are getting the nourishment they need.

## The Role Of Vitamin C And K In Preventing Eye Hemorrhaging

# The Role of Vitamin C and K in Preventing Eye Hemorrhaging

### **The Role of Vitamin C and K in Preventing Eye Hemorrhaging**

Vitamins C and K play a critical role in maintaining the structural integrity of the blood vessels in your eyes. When you don't get enough of these essential nutrients, the tiny capillaries in your eyes can become weak and prone to leaking or even hemorrhaging.

This can lead to some scary symptoms like sudden vision changes, floaters, or even blind spots. So if you notice any unexplained bleeding in your eyes, it could be a sign of a vitamin C or K deficiency that needs to be addressed ASAP.

### **Addressing Light Sensitivity Through Nutrition**

Do you find yourself squinting or shielding your eyes from bright lights? [Vitamin B1, also known as thiamine](https://www.drberg.com/blog/vitamin-b1-thiamine-deficiency-signs-symptoms-and-treatment-benefits), could be the missing link. This essential nutrient plays a crucial role in managing light sensitivity issues.

When you're deficient in vitamin B1, your eyes may struggle to adapt to changes in lighting, leading to discomfort and even pain in bright environments.

### **Nutritional Causes of Night Blindness**

If you have trouble seeing clearly in low-light conditions, a deficiency in vitamin A could be to blame. This vital nutrient is essential for producing rhodopsin, a pigment in the retina that helps you see in the dark.

Without enough vitamin A, your eyes may struggle to adjust to dim lighting, leading to night blindness and difficulty navigating in the dark. In rare cases, night blindness can also result from arsenic poisoning, which can interfere with vitamin A metabolism.

So if you're dealing with night vision issues, boosting your intake of vitamin A-rich foods like sweet potatoes, carrots, and leafy greens could make a big difference.

The bottom line? A proper diet rich in essential vitamins and minerals is crucial for maintaining healthy eyes and vision.

By being mindful of these common nutritional deficiencies and addressing them through diet and supplementation, you can give your eyes the support they need to function at their best for years to come.

## Impact Of Lifestyle Choices On Arterial Stiffness

# Impact of Lifestyle Choices on Arterial Stiffness

While Vitamin K2 is a key player in arterial health, it's not the only factor to consider. Our lifestyle choices, from the foods we eat to the medications we take, can have a big impact on the flexibility and function of our arteries.

![Food for healthy bones, vitamin D source. sardines, beans, dried figs, almonds, cottage cheese, milk](https://drberg-dam.imgix.net/others/food-healthy-bones-calcium-sorce.jpg?w=992&auto=compress,format)

### **The Double-Edged Sword of Calcium Supplements**

[Calcium supplements](https://www.drberg.com/blog/is-your-calcium-supplement-killing-you) are often touted as a way to support bone health, especially for older adults. However, taking high doses of calcium without adequate Vitamin K2 can actually do more harm than good.

Excess calcium that isn't properly directed into the bones can end up in the arteries, contributing to calcification and stiffness. In fact, [studies](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3690285) have shown that taking calcium supplements without Vitamin K2 can increase the risk of heart attacks and strokes.

If you do take calcium supplements, make sure you're balancing them with adequate K2.

### **Medication-Induced Risks for Arterial Health**

Certain medications can also have unintended consequences for arterial health. Warfarin, a common blood thinner, works by blocking the activity of Vitamin K1 in the liver.

However, it also inhibits Vitamin K2, which can lead to increased arterial calcification over time. If you're on Warfarin or a similar medication, talk to your doctor about monitoring your Vitamin K2 levels and considering supplementation if necessary.

### **Diet's Role in Arterial Flexibility**

Finally, the foods we eat every day can have a big impact on the health and flexibility of our arteries. A low-carb, anti-inflammatory diet can be particularly beneficial.

By reducing inflammation in the body, a low-carb diet can help prevent arterial damage and stiffening that can lead to heart disease.

It's also important to limit omega-6 fatty acids, found in vegetable oils and processed foods, as these can promote inflammation in the arteries.

In contrast, omega-3 fatty acids from fish and fish oil supplements have anti-inflammatory properties that can help keep arteries supple and healthy.

By making smart dietary choices and being mindful of the medications we take, we can create a lifestyle that supports healthy, flexible arteries well into old age.

## What Factors Might Contribute To The Frequent Recurrence Of The Flu In 26E252

# What factors might contribute to the frequent recurrence of the flu in certain individuals?

**If you're taking this supplement, especially D and even B12, and you still test deficient, there's a condition. It's a DNA problem. And the term you can look it up. It's called polymorphism, where some of your genes are altered in a way that makes it very difficult to absorb vitamin D. In fact, I recently looked at the 23 people, I think it was roughly 23, could be 24. But people that I tested with the DNA, and 100% of them had at least one gene that was not allowing them to either absorb vitamin D or convert from the inactive to the active.**

**Now, that was a small sample, but still, so you may have some genetic problem that prevents you from absorbing those two nutrients, which are very common issue. So the solution is to take more of it. Take more, take 20 or even 30,000 IUs.And then also, you can take more B12. But just make sure that that form of B12 is not in the synthetic form, which is called cyanocobalamin. You want the methylcobalamin, which actually you'd want to take it with like folate and B6 as well.**

And you can find that. But yeah, there's a lot of genetic issues that prevent people from absorbing nutrients. That's on top of all the other issues like malabsorption in your gut, or maybe low stomach acid. We want to increase absorption, and I think the solution is just to take more of it. That would simply override any type of resistance, especially to your receptors for vitamin D. Even if you have a chronic infection going on in your body, those microbes are very sneaky, and they tend to downgrade your receptors, especially for vitamin D, as their strategy, because they know that's part of your immune system. So the way to solve it is to take more.

## Importance Of Specific Supplements For Autism

# Importance of Specific Supplements for Autism

### **Importance of Specific Supplements for Autism**

[N-acetylcysteine (NAC)](https://www.drberg.com/blog/how-does-nac-n-acetylcysteine-work), selenium, cod liver oil, vitamin D3, methylcobalamin (a form of Vitamin B12), and methylfolate are essential to ensure proper brain functioning as they help reduce oxidative stress and inflammation—both being significant contributors to autism.

They aid in reducing oxidative stress and inflammation—two factors heavily implicated in autism.

Methylene blue is another exciting piece of this puzzle—it's been found to help fix mitochondrial dysfunction often seen with autism. [Studies have shown](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6078194) its potential benefits when used alongside traditional treatments.

Incorporating these supplements into an individual's diet plan can provide much-needed support toward improved well-being.

Coenzyme Q10 has also demonstrated promise, enhancing energy production at a cellular level—an important aspect considering the connection between mitochondrial dysfunction and autism.

## **Amino Acid Abnormalities in Autism**

Abnormal amino acid profiles are common among individuals with autism. This can contribute to their neurological and behavioral symptoms.

### **The Role of Amino Acids in Neurological Function**

Amino acids are essential for our brain's normal functioning, neurotransmitters or precursors. Imbalances may lead to neurodevelopmental disorders like autism.

An exciting example is [glutamate](https://www.drberg.com/blog/msg-vs-glutamate-whats-the-difference), an excitatory neurotransmitter whose excessive levels might cause neuronal damage and inflammation linked to autism spectrum disorder (ASD).

### **Tackling Amino Acid Imbalance**

Correcting these imbalances through diet and supplements could potentially help manage autistic symptoms.

[Studies suggest](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23515006) that foods rich in essential amino acids, such as eggs, seafood, shellfish, and organ meats, along with certain supplements, can assist the body in balancing its production of neurotransmitters.

## What Are The Most Effective Methods For Eliminating Candida Overgrowth C03Ed3

# What are the most effective methods for eliminating candida overgrowth, and what steps should be taken to address and prevent it?

**Candida is a fungal infection that typically affects the mouth, private areas, or toenails. Candida often develops after antibiotics destroys the bacteria that keep yeast and fungus at bay.**

The majority of your gut microbiome is bacteria. However, you have a small percentage of yeast, fungus, and friendly candida. When antibiotics wipe out your friendly bacteria, this leaves room for candida overgrowth.

**Some of the symptoms of candida overgrowth include itchiness, burning, fatigue, cracks at the corners of the mouth, and ammonia odor.**

Candida changes your pH, making it more alkaline. Sugar is the primary fuel source of candida.

**Other conditions can lower your immune system and cause candida overgrowth. HIV/AIDS, organ transplants, medications like Prednisone, pregnancy, and excessive sugar consumption can all cause candida.**

**Oftentimes, candida overgrowth is paired with a vitamin D deficiency.** Vitamin D has antifungal properties and is also a broad-spectrum antimicrobial.

**If you have candida, there are three things that you need to do!**

1\. Take 20,000 to 30,000 IU of vitamin D

2\. Remove sugar from the diet

3\. Consume probiotic foods (sauerkraut, kimchi, kefir, fermented vegetables)

## What Factors Contribute To High Cholesterol Levels And How Do Lifestyl Aa634A

# What factors contribute to high cholesterol levels, and how do lifestyle choices and genetics play a role?

**Well, probably because you're burning fat and guess what's in your fat cell.You have a portion of it's cholesterol has to come out. What gets rid of the excess cholesterol is the bile salts. So that would be the liver.**

There's all sorts of things that you can improve your cholesterol levels with niacin and bile salts and, you know having a bit more leafy greens, but typically I wouldn't worry about it because, this is the confusing area for most people with cholesterol. They have this idea that this keto will increase my bad cholesterol. So I'm going to avoid it.Well, please, before you avoid it, get all the details. We have tons of videos on this topic. Try to make it simple. There's a couple of different types of LDL. It's not just one LDL.

There's one that's more pathogenic, the one that can be, that can go into the cells. And unless you do like an advanced lipid profile test, you won't be able to pick up the difference. You're just going to look at total LDL. It doesn't tell you what's going on. I mean, even just think about the purpose of LDL, this so-called bad cholesterol. It delivers cholesterol into the tissues. Now don't we need cholesterol for cell membranes to make hormones, to make vitamin D, to make bile.

So unless we have that delivery system, how are we going to do that? So we need LDL. And especially if someone's going through an infection stress or a menopause, their demand for the cholesterol and those hormones are going to be higher. So it's going to go up. Is that a bad thing? No, we just have to look at the whole picture. And so to base cardiovascular risk on this one little biomarker is really, it's kind of like saying, okay, Steve, you're at the number of ashtrays you have in your house puts you at risk for lung cancer because we have this correlation is people that die of lung cancer have a lot of ashtrays in the house. So therefore ashtrays cause lung cancer.

## How Does Cholesterol Influence Muscle Development And Testosterone Lev 8398B6

# How does cholesterol influence muscle development and testosterone levels, and why is it important for these processes?

Your brain, nervous system, and muscles all need cholesterol to function. This is why cholesterol is important! Your body makes most of the cholesterol you need, about 3000 mg of cholesterol per day. Dietary cholesterol only accounts for 20-25 percent of your total cholesterol. Despite what you may have heard, consuming foods high in cholesterol does not increase your blood cholesterol levels.

Cholesterol is needed to make vitamin D and is also necessary in the production of bile, which helps to digest fats. Cholesterol and muscle building go hand in hand. Muscles require cholesterol to make them stronger and bigger. Cholesterol is a precursor for certain sex hormones and is anabolic in nature meaning that it builds things up. Without cholesterol, your body can not make testosterone.

When someone has high cholesterol, they are often prescribed statin drugs. Statins block the pathway to make cholesterol in the liver, shutting down the total production of cholesterol.

**Side effects of statin drugs include:**

•Myopathy—destruction of your muscle cells

•Myositis—an inflammatory condition of the muscles

•Muscle pain

•Back pain

•Weakness of the muscles

•Low coenzyme Q10 which is important for your heart

There’s also a black box warning because statins can cause diabetes and increase your risk for heart attacks, the exact problem they are supposed to prevent.

## What Supplements Are Recommended For Supporting Skin Health In Individ A1209E

# What supplements are recommended for supporting skin health in individuals with vitiligo, and how do they contribute to the management of this condition?

Vitiligo is a depigmentation problem. You lose your skin pigment in certain areas of your body. The cells in control of the skin pigment—known as melanocytes—have stopped functioning properly.

This condition is often associated with autoimmunity. Those with vitiligo may have other autoimmune conditions. Vitiligo is associated with a large amount of free radical damage. ROS and hydrogen peroxide cause a lot of oxidation.

Zinc and copper are involved in a very powerful antioxidant called SOD (superoxide dismutase).

Light therapy may be used to combat vitiligo. A pilot study showed that when vitiligo patients take 35,000 IUs of vitamin D, 14 out of 16 see significant repigmentation.

**There are three supplements you can take for vitiligo:**

1\. Zinc - 100 mg

2\. Vitamin D - 35,000 IUs

3\. Copper - 1500 mcg

**Fasting may also benefit those with vitiligo since it’s related to autoimmunity.**

## What Are Some Nutrient Dense Superfoods That Support Optimal Kidney He Df0887

# What are some nutrient-dense superfoods that support optimal kidney health, and how do their specific properties contribute to protecting and enhancing renal function?

The kidneys are composed of complex filters known as nephrons. A proper diet is crucial to support these nephrons. If your nephrons are damaged, you may end up with a build-up of phosphorus, potassium, and sodium. It is essential to avoid junk food and minimize eating out.

One of the leading causes of kidney damage is diabetes, which comes from high blood sugar. Avoid sugar and compounds that act like sugar in the body, like refined starches. Drugs, alcohol, certain medications, smoking, and ultra-processed foods all destroy the kidneys. Seed oils like corn oil, soy oil, cottonseed oil, and canola oil contribute to inflammation and damage to the kidneys as well.

**Here are eight superfoods to include in your diet if you’re dealing with kidney damage:**

1\. Low phosphorus protein (sardines, salmon, cod, and sea bass)

2\. Spirulina

3\. Fermented foods (sauerkraut, kimchi, pickles)

4\. Avocado

5\. Extra virgin olive oil

6\. Cottage cheese or goat cheese

7\. Vitamin D

8\. Baja Gold sea salt

If you have kidney damage, you’ll want to avoid foods that are high in oxalates, lectins, and tannins. Avoid things like nuts, spinach, meats high in phosphorus, eggplant, potatoes, beans, and grains. Cat scans to examine damage to the kidney can also be very damaging. Opt for an ultrasound or MRI to assess kidney damage if possible.

**If you have kidney disease or kidney problems, you can still consume vegetables. The following vegetables are safe options for people with kidney issues:**

•Asparagus

•Celery

•Avocado

•Cucumber

•Garlic

•Cabbage

•Cauliflower

•Mushrooms

•Lettuce

## Can I Take Bile Salts Without A Gallbladder

# Can I take bile salts without a gallbladder?

**Taking Bile Salts Without a Gallbladder**

Yes, you can take bile salts without a gallbladder. They help compensate for the less concentrated bile your liver releases directly into the digestive tract.

**Why You Might Need Bile Salts**

1\. **Vitamin A Absorption**: Poor night vision may indicate a vitamin A deficiency due to insufficient bile.

2\. **Stool Characteristics**: Light-colored, floating stools suggest a lack of bile, while diarrhea can indicate too much bile.

Monitoring these signs can help you determine the right amount of bile salts to support digestion and nutrient absorption.

## What Are The Benefits Of Taking Cod Liver Oil And Why Might It Be A Va Fb5Fd9

# What are the benefits of taking cod liver oil, and why might it be a valuable addition to your health regimen?

**Cod liver oil is an excellent source of omega-3 fatty acids, EPA and DHA. EPA has potent anti-inflammatory properties, while DHA supports cognitive function. Cod liver oil is also rich in vitamin A and vitamin D.**

**Don’t confuse cod liver oil with fish oil!** You would need 12,000 mg of fish oil to equal just one tablespoon of cod liver oil. You can not get vitamin A from fruits and vegetables. Beta-carotene is only a precursor to vitamin A, not the active form. Cod liver oil contains retinol, the active form of vitamin A.

The most common autoimmune disease is Hashimoto’s hypothyroidism. There’s a significant link between vitamin A deficiency and hypothyroidism.

**There are vitamin A receptors inside of your white blood cells, so it’s crucial for immunity! Vitamin A also helps to regulate iodine.**

**Vitamin A supports the mucus membranes of your mouth, sinuses, throat, and lungs, so it’s critical in preventing infections.** It also supports the roots of the microvilli on the inside of your intestinal tract. Vitamin A supports the health of your retina. If you’re deficient in retinol (the active form of vitamin A), you can go blind.

**Cod liver oil is also a good source of vitamin D.** Without vitamin D, you can't pull calcium and magnesium into the body. Beans, legumes, grains, and cereals are very high in phytic acid, which increases the need for vitamin D. If your diet is high in these foods, it’s easy to become deficient in vitamin D.

## What Are Essential Remedies And Treatments To Consider When Youre Feel 365De6

# What are essential remedies and treatments to consider when you're feeling unwell or sick?

**To combat an infection, try to determine if you’re dealing with a viral infection or a bacterial infection.**

**Viral infection symptoms will be more systemic.** If you have a viral infection, you’ll notice more body aches and chills. Bacterial infection symptoms will be localized. Fevers are typically higher with a bacterial infection. A sore throat associated with a viral infection is often accompanied by a runny nose and a cough. If a sore throat is caused by a bacterial infection, you’ll feel more localized pain without a runny nose.

**A dry cough** is associated with a viral infection, while bacterial infections are associated with a productive cough. Respiratory infection, the common cold, flu, bronchitis, and infections involving the sinuses and lungs are generally viral. Pneumonia can be both bacterial and viral.

A viral infection typically lasts 1 to 2 weeks. A bacterial infection will probably last a bit longer, but this depends on your immune system. Mucus associated with a viral infection is usually clear or white and green or yellow with a bacterial infection.

**The best viral infection remedies are elderberry and olive leaf extract. For bacterial infections, try garlic, oregano oil, and echinacea.**

**The following remedies for infection work for both viral and bacterial infections:**

•Take a hot bath or shower/dress warm

•Get more sleep

•Take zinc, vitamin D, and vitamin C

•Fasting

•Increase sea salt intake

•Improve emotional state

•Get more sunlight (UVB and infrared rays)

•Take cod liver oil

**Stress, age, and poor gut health can increase your susceptibility to infection. Refined sugar and other refined foods deplete zinc and vitamin C, also increasing your susceptibility to infection.**

## Is The Powdered Form Of Vitamin D3 Less Effective Than The Liquid Form Of D3

# Is the powdered form of Vitamin D3 less effective than the liquid form of D3?

Both our dry and liquid D3 supplements are highly effective. D3 is a fat-soluble vitamin, meaning it needs some fat for optimal absorption. Here's how we ensure you get the most out of our products:

- **Dry Formula:** Our capsules include MCT powder for fat-soluble support, plus ox bile for further absorption enhancement.

- **Liquid Formula:** We use MCT and fractionated coconut oil as carriers, avoiding inflammatory vegetable oils commonly found in other brands.

Both forms use the same true form of D3 (cholecalciferol).

**The Best Choice for You:** Individual needs may vary, so it's difficult to say whether dry or liquid is universally better. Our commitment to quality ingredients and thoughtful formulation sets us apart, regardless of the form you choose.

## Why Was Calcium Added To The Vitamin D3  K2 With Zinc  Mct Oil When Dr E242Bd

# Why was calcium added to the Vitamin D3 & K2 with Zinc & MCT Oil when Dr. Berg says does not recommend calcium supplementation?

The calcium found in the Vitamin D3 & K2 with Zinc & MCT Oil is naturally derived from the ingredients in the product, primarily the MCT Oil. No amount of calcium has been added to the formulation.

While Dr. Berg does not recommend specific calcium supplementation, calcium is crucial for overall health and wellness. Typically calcium supplementation is not required as adequate amounts can be obtained through a healthy diet, especially vegetables which pull calcium from the soil. Dairy can also be a good source of calcium.

However, one form of calcium supplementation should be avoided; calcium carbonate supplementation. Dr. Berg has created videos about the adverse effects of calcium carbonate - [https://youtu.be/VCpbvwM-5U4](https://youtu.be/VCpbvwM-5U4) and [https://youtu.be/hLP3SnbQvEc](https://youtu.be/hLP3SnbQvEc).

There is no calcium carbonate in the Vitamin D3 & K2 with Zinc & MCT Oil.

Additionally, all calcium, whether supplemented or acquired from your diet, needs vitamin K2 to help move the calcium out of the bloodstream, where it can create coronary calcification and subsequently heart disease, and into the bones. Vitamin D3 & K2 with Zinc & MCT Oil contains 50.3 mcg, 40% of the Recommended Daily Value.

## Whats The Number One Deficiency In All Autoimmune Conditions

# What's the number one deficiency in all autoimmune conditions?

The most common deficiency in autoimmune conditions is vitamin D. Many people with autoimmune diseases benefit from the Coimbra protocol, which involves high doses of vitamin D and monitoring parathyroid hormone (PTH) levels to regulate calcium absorption.

Vitamin D resistance, where the body doesn't absorb vitamin D effectively, can lead to deficiencies despite normal blood levels. High PTH and low vitamin D levels suggest resistance. The solution is to increase vitamin D intake until PTH normalizes.

Factors contributing to vitamin D resistance include low sun exposure, darker skin, age, stress, location, and air pollution. Pathogens, heavy metals, and cancer can also downgrade vitamin D receptors. Adequate magnesium, zinc, and vitamin K2 are essential for proper calcium management and overall health.

## What Nutrient Deficiencies Are Commonly Linked To Inflammatory Bowel D 69605E

# What nutrient deficiencies are commonly linked to inflammatory bowel disease (IBD)?

The most common nutrient deficiencies in individuals with IBD are:

1\. **Iron Deficiency**: Due to blood loss and decreased absorption from inflammation, 80% of those with IBD are iron deficient, which can lead to anemia. The best sources of iron are animal products (especially beef and organ meats) and spirulina. It's advisable to get iron from food rather than supplements to avoid excess buildup.

2\. **Vitamin D Deficiency**: Affecting 70% of those with IBD, inflammation hinders dietary vitamin D absorption. Factors like age, weight, skin tone, and location also impact levels. Vitamin D is crucial for calcium absorption, repairing the small intestine lining, and reducing inflammation. A daily intake of 10,000 IUs of vitamin D3 is recommended.

3\. **Vitamin B12 and B9 (Folate) Deficiency**: These vitamins come from diet and gut microbes. Gut inflammation can reduce beneficial bacteria, limiting B vitamin production and absorption. Deficiencies can cause fatigue, anemia, and other health issues.

4\. **Vitamin K1 and K2 Deficiency**: An unhealthy gut can decrease levels of these vitamins, which are produced by gut microbes. Vitamin K1 aids blood clotting, while K2 supports bone strength and prevents calcium buildup in arteries and joints. Replenishing these nutrients is essential for those with IBD.

## What Are The Key Benefits Of Vitamin B5 Pantothenic Acid For Energy Me 486934

# What are the key benefits of Vitamin B5 (pantothenic acid) for energy metabolism, skin health, and hormone production?

The name of the B5 vitamin is pantothenic acid and it is a cofactor of energy metabolism, specifically for the enzymes that help you break down fat. When you are converting from sugar- burning to ketosis by burning fat, you need vitamin B5 big-time.

The Greek word for this vitamin is “Pantothen” which means “from all quarters” indicating that it is very easy to get from all your foods. When you read about this vitamin you are going to find that it is almost impossible to be deficient in it, because it is everywhere, but actually a lot of people are deficient in it.

B5 allows macronutrients (fats, carbs, protein) to be converted to energy.

**Benefits**

- Vitamin B5 is needed to support enzymes for energy metabolism from carbs, protein and especially fat

- Supports during keto adaptation

- Supports the production of melatonin (sleep hormone)

- Supports the production of acetylcholine (to help you feel awake during the day)

- Is a key nutrient for adrenal function

- Is needed to make cortisol

**Symptoms of deficiency**

- Stress

- Neuro pain

- Inflammation

- Insomnia

- Keto fatigue

**Where to get it**

Typically, B5 is in our foods, but if your gut flora, the friendly bacteria, are incomplete, there will be fewer B vitamins made. Your gut flora also need vitamin D3 to function and low D3 will lessen the number you have of these microorganisms, which are needed to make B5—leading to a deficiency.

**Best foods for vitamin B5:**

• Mushrooms

• Liver

• Avocados

• Cauliflower

• Eggs

## Can Adopting A Plant Based Diet Contribute To The Reduction Of Fibroids

# Can adopting a plant-based diet contribute to the reduction of fibroids?

Following a keto diet can be more challenging on a plant-based regimen due to the need for adequate protein and essential nutrients like B12, bioavailable forms of zinc and iron, and retinol (the active form of vitamin A). While it is possible to achieve a vegan keto diet, careful planning is essential to ensure you're obtaining these vital nutrients. I recommend watching my videos on how to effectively implement a vegan-style keto approach, as you may need to incorporate additional nutritional sources to meet your dietary needs.

## Which Foods Should Be Avoided If You Have Hypothyroidism

# Which foods should be avoided if you have hypothyroidism?

**Understanding Goitrogens and Hypothyroidism**

Goitrogens are substances that can interfere with thyroid function and potentially lead to a goiter (enlarged thyroid). This is especially important to note if you have hypothyroidism (an underactive thyroid).

**Foods to Limit or Avoid:**

- **Cruciferous vegetables:** Broccoli, cauliflower, kale, Brussels sprouts, cabbage, etc. (Small amounts cooked/steamed may be okay.)

- **Soy products:** Tofu, tempeh, edamame

- **Cassava, lima beans, sorghum, sweet potatoes, flax seeds, millet**

- **Onions**

- **Gluten** (especially if you have a sensitivity or intolerance)

**Important Notes:**

- Cooking cruciferous vegetables can reduce their goitrogenic effects.

- Sea kelp may lessen the impact of goitrogens.

- Avoid foods that deplete selenium, iodine, iron, and vitamin A, as these nutrients are important for thyroid health.

**Foods for Thyroid Health:**

- **Selenium and Iodine:** Seafood, sea kelp, sea salt

- **Iron:** Red meat, animal products

- **Vitamin A:** Egg yolks, butter, cod liver oil, beef liver

## Which Is More Advantageous For Health Sardines Or Cod Liver Oil And Wh 1F3B74

# Which is more advantageous for health: sardines or cod liver oil, and what are the key benefits of each?

Sardines are excellent for your health and a great source of omega-3s, but so is cod liver! You should consume both foods because they each have their own strengths.

**Cod liver and sardines contain omega-3 fatty acids, EPA and DHA. EPA helps reduce inflammation, while DHA supports the brain, nerves, and heart.**

**Sardines contain .9 to 2 grams of omega-3 fatty acids per serving while cod liver contains 9 to 11 grams per serving. Cod liver also contains significantly more vitamin D.**

**Sardines and cod liver contain vitamin A in its active form, retinol.** Vitamin A supports vision, vision at night, and the inner mucosal membranes of your mouth, throat, sinuses, and lungs. It’s also important for your thyroid. Sardines contain 32 mcg of vitamin A, and cod liver contains 5100 mcg!

**Cod liver does not surpass sardines in all aspects. Sardines are a better source of protein.** Cod liver is a rich source of folate at 300 mcg, while sardines only contain 10 mcg. Sardines contain 392 mg of calcium and 545 mg of phosphorus and cod liver contains 10 mg and 100 mg respectively.

**Cod liver and sardines contain about the same amount of B12 at 10.6 mcg and 11 mcg respectively.**

When comparing sardines to salmon, both fish contain B vitamins, but sardines are a better source of calcium, phosphorus, selenium, iron, magnesium, and zinc.

## Is It Possible That High Doses Of Vitamin D3 Deplete Magnesium

# Is it possible that high doses of vitamin D3 deplete magnesium?

**The Importance of Balancing Vitamin D and Magnesium**

While vitamin D offers numerous benefits for the immune system, bone health, and reducing inflammation, it's important to be aware that high doses can deplete magnesium levels in your body. This is because vitamin D and magnesium work together, and an imbalance can lead to health concerns.

**Why Magnesium Matters**

Magnesium plays a crucial role in preventing calcium buildup in soft tissues, kidneys, arteries, and joints. Without enough magnesium, high vitamin D intake could potentially lead to:

- Kidney stones

- Improper calcium deposits

**How to Maintain Balance**

- **Diet:** Consuming plenty of vegetables (at least 7 cups daily), especially leafy greens and certain nuts, provides a good source of magnesium.

- **Supplementation:** If your diet is lacking, consider a magnesium supplement. Vitamin B6 also supports the function of both magnesium and vitamin D.

**Important Note:** If you are prone to kidney stones, increase your vitamin D intake, as insufficient magnesium could increase your risk.

## What Are Some Ways To Manage Sjgrens Syndrome

# What are some ways to manage Sjögren’s syndrome?

While I don't have personal experience with it, autoimmune diseases can have a significant impact on the body, affecting connective tissues, skin, joints, and digestion. One potential approach to managing symptoms is to maintain high levels of vitamin D, which may help reduce inflammation and support remission of certain symptoms.

Additionally, adopting a healthy lifestyle through a ketogenic diet combined with intermittent fasting may promote overall health. Intermittent fasting, in particular, has been shown to support immune system healing.

**Please consult with a healthcare professional before making any changes to your health regimen or addressing medical conditions.**

**Hypercalcemia Symptoms**

• Constipation

• Kidney Stones

• Frequent Urination

• Dementia

• Depression

• Ulcers

• Abdominal Pain

**Recommendation:**

1\. Vitamin K2 (MK7 version) – it triggers the protein that could signal the calcium to go into the bone. Ratio: For every 10,000IUs of D3 – 100mcg of K2

2\. Avoid Dairy

3\. Magnesium

4\. Drink more water

## Is It Advisable To Avoid Sun Exposure Entirely

# Is it advisable to avoid sun exposure entirely?

There has been an association between vitamin D insufficiency and autoimmune diseases, cardiovascular diseases, and at least 17 different cancers.

Vitamin D is intimately involved in over 2,000 of our genes and vital for proper immune function. It’s virtually impossible to get enough vitamin D from your diet. Only 5% to 10% of vitamin D comes from diet, and that’s only if you eat plenty of fatty fish, organ meats, and egg yolks. Around 90% to 95% percent of your vitamin D comes from the sun. Every year, there are 5,125 deaths from sun exposure and 1,684,677 deaths from lack of sun. For every death from sun exposure, there are 329 deaths from lack of sun.

The current American Dermatology Association recommendation is to stay out of the sun and use sunblock. Yet, in the early 1900s, the sun was used to treat illnesses like tuberculosis and asthma. In 1935, 1 out of 1500 people developed melanoma. By 2014, 1 in 50 people had developed melanoma, despite the fact that people are spending significantly less time outside. This shows that the sun protects you from melanoma. In fact, 75% of all melanomas are located in areas not typically exposed to the sun.

Fifty-four percent of the sun's rays are infrared light. Infrared light protects against cancer, stimulates melatonin, and also generates ATP. Vitamin D and melatonin protect the mitochondria. Both are stimulated by exposure to the sun. Aim to get a moderate amount of sun exposure to avoid burning and support your health.

## What Strategies Can Effectively Remove Kidney Stones And Excess Oxalat 9F581F

# What strategies can effectively remove kidney stones and excess oxalates to improve kidney function and health?

**Signs your oxalate levels are high:**

• Kidney stones

• Gout

• Headaches

• Eye pain

• Urinary pain

• Genital pain

• Muscle pain

• Intestinal pain

**Foods high in oxalates:**

• Almonds

• Peanuts

• Spinach

• Chocolate

• Kiwi

• Strawberries

• Beets

• Tea

• Bran

Dietary oxalates aren’t correlated with oxalates in your urine. Just because you consume foods high in oxalates doesn’t mean you will develop any problems. But, preexisting damage to your kidneys, liver, or metabolism can cause you to be unable to process oxalates like you should. Diabetes, prediabetes, insulin resistance, and carb consumption can lead to kidney problems. A lack of certain microbes can also prevent you from breaking down oxalates, causing them to end up in the kidneys. Many people who go on the ketogenic diet no longer have a problem dealing with oxalates. But if you’re still experiencing issues, you can try these tips.

**What to do if you have high oxalate levels or are prone to kidney stones:**

1\. Limit foods high in oxalates or consume them with cheese

2\. Take a probiotic with a mixture of lactobacillus

3\. Maintain higher levels of magnesium and citrates (by consuming magnesium and lemon)

4\. Get plenty of vitamin D

5\. Drink at least two and a half liters of fluid a day

## What Are The Common Causes Of Itching

# What are the common causes of itching?

Itching can be caused by:

1\. Body lice

2\. Scabies

3\. Hookworms

4\. Herpes

5\. Insect bites

6\. Yeast infection

7\. Poison ivy

8\. Tick bites

9\. Diabetes

10\. Polycythemia

## What Are The Potential Health Benefits Associated With Strontium Suppl 87Bc7B

# What are the potential health benefits associated with strontium supplementation?

Strontium is a powerful trace mineral whose chemistry is similar to calcium. It’s particularly helpful in building a strong outer shell on your bones, along with preventing hip fractures. The missing mineral that many people need to strengthen their bones is strontium, however, since it’s a trace mineral, you only need it in small amounts compared to calcium.

**Benefits**

- Good for bones and bone problems

- Can decrease the risk of bone fractures by up to 41%

- Good for osteoporosis or osteopenia

**How to consume it**

You need strontium and calcium in a 1:1000 ratio, where 1 is strontium and 1000 is calcium.

Consume strontium along with calcium aspartate anhydrous, vitamin D3, vitamin K2 and magnesium to support your bones and tackle any bone problem.

In addition to those nutrients, you need to have a sufficient amount of stomach acid to readily absorb minerals. Consume apple cider vinegar with each meal. You know that your stomach isn’t acidic enough if you have heartburn, acid reflux, or GERD.

If you have osteoporosis or osteopenia, it can take one to six years to regain your bone health. But it’s possible when you eat healthy foods and give your body the raw materials it needs.

**Where to get it**

Strontium doesn’t come in a form that’s easily absorbed by your body. Strontium is what’s called an elemental, inorganic mineral. Instead, you need the organic, plant-based form of it. Don’t take the elemental form.

One of the good sources of strontium is sea salt (can be found at the grocery store). You can also get it in a supplement form from a health food store or online.

## What Are The Primary Causes Of Low Testosterone And How Do Factors Suc A375F1

# What are the primary causes of low testosterone, and how do factors such as age, hormonal imbalances, and medical conditions contribute to this issue?

Low testosterone in men mainly is caused by the excess amount of other hormones in your body that counter testosterone. These hormones are cortisol, insulin and especially estrogen. The main remedy is to decrease the amounts of these hormones, which should greatly improve this condition.

**Symptoms:**

- Decreased libido

- Decreased erections

- Decreased vitality

- Weight gain (midsection)

- Can’t build muscle mass

- Skin thinner and softer

- Voice higher

- Prostate enlargement

- Breast tissue (man boobs)

- Loss of body hair

- Loss of collagen

- Reduction of sperm

**Cause #1: High estrogen**

High amounts of estrogen (the female hormone that is also produced in small amounts in a male body) can greatly lower the amounts of testosterone in your body. Consuming foods that are high in estrogen (like soy or GMO foods) can do that. If you have high amounts of body fat, it can do that too, as human body fat contains certain proteins that convert testosterone to estrogen.

**Remedies:**

- Consume foods that will lower estrogen levels:

    - cruciferous vegetables (natural estrogen blockers)

    - DIM (concentrated cruciferous)

    - white button mushrooms

    - mushrooms in general

    - celery

    - parsley

    - olive oil

- Avoid foods that will increase estrogen:

    - soy

    - vegetable oils

    - GMO foods

    - alcohol

    - soy-fed chicken

    - soy-fed beef

**Cause #2: High insulin**

One of the effects of insulin (the fat-storing hormone) is to lower testosterone in your body. If you are on a high-carb diet, this will increase the amount of insulin produced by your body to lower the blood sugar spikes after meals. Consuming snacks too often will raise insulin level after each of those snacks, too.

**Remedies:**

- Avoid refined sugar and carbs

- Avoid snacking

- Do the Healthy Keto® diet

- Do an intermittent fasting plan

**Cause #3: High cortisol**

Your body is producing the stress hormone called cortisol to help you adapt to stressors from your environment. Cortisol in itself will lower testosterone levels in the body. If the stress is constant, or chronic, this can overwork your adrenals--making them produce excess cortisol too often.

**Remedies:**

- Take vitamin B1:

• nutritional yeast • benfotiamine

- Improve your sleep

    - avoid blue lights (computer/phone) before going to bed

    - disconnect electronic devices from the outlets before going to bed

    - take naps if needed

    - try to go to bed before 10:30 p.m.

- Avoid watching news (bad news can keep you in a bad mood)

- Take magnesium

- Take vitamin D

- Do the Healthy Keto® diet

- Take long walks outside (at least 45 minutes)

- Regularly exercise (don’t overtrain)

- You can also take my Adrenal & Cortisol Support

- You can also take my Adrenal Stress Advanced Formula

**Cause #2: High amounts of stress**

General remedies to raise the level of testosterone in your body

Once you’ve eliminated and remedied the main causes of low testosterone, the remedies below might not be needed. Your body should be producing enough testosterone by then, since there is nothing lowering it or converting it to something else. But you can apply the remedies below as additional ways to elevate your testosterone levels.

**Remedies:**

- Consume more cholesterol (helps to make testosterone)

- Consume moderate amounts of protein (6 to 8 oz of protein in meal)

- Full-body exercise

- HIIT exercise

- Improve sleep

- Consume zinc (100 mg / day)

- Consume korean red ginseng

- Take L-arginine

- Take D-aspartic acid

**Other causes:**

- Aging

- Fatty liver

- Too much iron

- Medications:

    • statins

    - high blood pressure meds

    - medications for diabetes

## What Strategies Can Be Employed To Facilitate The Restoration And Rege 66143A

# What strategies can be employed to facilitate the restoration and regeneration of bone tissue?

Osteoporosis is a loss of bone density and bone mass. This increases your risk of fractures. Osteopenia is the stage that occurs just before osteoporosis. It’s been found that people with osteoporosis have a much higher degree of calcification in the arteries and joints. This means a person has excess calcium, but it’s not going to the right places in the body. When dealing with osteoporosis and osteopenia, we can’t just look at a loss of calcium. We also need to consider vitamin K2 deficiency and vitamin D3 deficiency.

Vitamin D3 supports calcium absorption, and vitamin K2 helps drive calcium into the bones. If you take vitamin K2 as a supplement, it may be best to take the natural form called MK7. Vitamin A (retinol) is another important vitamin to support healthy bones. These essential vitamins for osteoporosis are all fat-soluble, which means supporting your gallbladder and liver is crucial. Bile salts can help support the absorption of fat-soluble nutrients if you have a gallbladder or liver problem. It’s also essential to have strong acid in the stomach to absorb minerals and trace minerals.

I would still take some form of calcium if I had osteoporosis. But I would also take these other nutrients. I would also avoid calcium carbonate, which is less bioavailable than other forms. Try to get your calcium and other nutrients from food.

**Other important minerals and trace minerals for strong bones:**

• Magnesium

• Potassium

• Zinc

• Copper

• Boron

Be sure you’re also consuming high-quality sources of protein and are exercising consistently to help with osteoporosis and osteopenia.

## What Are The Underlying Factors That Contribute To The Development Of  Af39D2

# What are the underlying factors that contribute to the development of depression?

There is no evidence that depression is a chemical imbalance in the brain involving serotonin. It has been found that SSRIs can temporarily help increase serotonin in the brain. However, drug trials have shown that these anti-depressants were almost indistinguishable from the placebo in treating depression. SSRIs come with a lot of side effects, including some serious ones involving the sex organs. Does depression cause body problems, or do body problems cause depression? While it may be a mixture, we’re going to focus on the body problems and deficiencies that could cause depression.

Potential causes of depression include:

1\. Insomnia

2\. Chronic fatigue

3\. Stress

4\. Nutritional deficiencies (vitamin D, vitamin B12, vitamin B1, magnesium, DHA)

5\. Lack of exercise

**\*We recommend consulting with your doctor before making any dietary or medication changes, especially if you have any existing health conditions.**

## Can A Deficiency In Vitamin B Contribute To The Development Or Exacerb E3A238

# Can a deficiency in vitamin B contribute to the development or exacerbation of anxiety, and what specific B vitamins are most closely linked to mental health?

**Low B vitamins**

B vitamins are crucial for calmness, relaxation, and healthy sleep. Low B vitamins can reduce your ability to handle physical and mental stress, which can result in anxiety symptoms. B vitamin deficiency mainly stems from not consuming them in your diet or consuming things that deplete you of them.

## Can Vitamin Deficiencies Contribute To Low Back Pain

# Can vitamin deficiencies contribute to low back pain

Lower back pain, especially chronic pain, is often treated with medications, but understanding the root causes can lead to long-term relief. Nutritional deficiencies play a significant role in back pain:

1\. **Vitamin D**: Deficiency can cause bone pain, inflammation, soft bones, and skeletal problems in children. Magnesium and boron deficiencies can also affect vitamin D levels, leading to back issues.

2\. **Vitamin K2**: Deficiency can result in stenosis, arthritis, bone spurs, and calcium deposits. Vitamin K2 works synergistically with vitamin D.

3\. **Vitamin E**: Deficiency can cause back weakness and atrophy. Prefer tocotrienol complexes or wheat germ oil over tocopherols.

4\. **Manganese**: Deficiency can lead to disc problems, collagen issues, and an increased risk of scoliosis.

Other contributors to back pain include an imbalance of omega-6 to omega-3 fatty acids, a high sugar and carbohydrate diet, kidney stones, and gallstones. Addressing these nutritional deficiencies and dietary factors can help alleviate chronic back pain.

## Why Is Cholesterol Important

# Why is cholesterol important?

People are afraid of cholesterol. But, your body actually makes 3000mg of cholesterol per day. If cholesterol is dangerous, why would the body make so much of it?

**Why cholesterol is important:**

• You need cholesterol to make bile 

• You need cholesterol to make vitamin D

• You need cholesterol to make hormones (estrogen, testosterone, cortisol)

• Your brain is made up of 50% fat and 50% cholesterol 

• Your brain synapses are lined with cholesterol 

• The myelin sheath that surrounds the nerves needs cholesterol 

• 40% of the cholesterol that’s made in your body is needed for the cellular membrane 

**Your cell membranes are dynamic and are there to protect you. The cell membranes have to do with:**

• Receptors

• Ion channels

• Transporters

• Pumps—ions

• Fat-soluble vitamins

• Hormones

• Signaling

## Will The Lack Of Copper With The Zinc In D3  K2 Vitamin Create A Coppe 449A5C

# Will the lack of copper with the zinc in D3 & K2 Vitamin create a copper deficiency?

The vitamins and minerals in the D3 & K2 Vitamin product are specifically chosen cofactors required to increase the absorption of vitamin D and allow its activation in both bone health and immunity building. Zinc is one of these required cofactors while copper is not.

Zinc and copper do have a recommended ideal ratio of 8:1, with acceptable ranges of 4:1 to 12:1. Zinc deficiency is far more prevalent than copper deficiency as copper can be obtained through many dietary sources. On the other hand, many foods deplete zinc stores due to their phytates, including legumes, seeds, soy products, and whole grains, and their oxalates, including such foods as spinach, okra, nuts, and tea. The D3 & K2 Vitamin is specifically formulated to address zinc deficiency.

Additionally, Vitamin D supplementation can help with copper retention in the body, further reducing the possibility of copper deficiency. However, zinc in high quantities, 60mg or more a day, over a long period of time can cause some copper deficiencies.

Here are some signs of a copper deficiency:

1\. Nausea

2\. Flu-like symptoms (this is due to neutropenia, which is lowered white blood cells)

3\. Anemia (fatigue and weakness)

4\. Stomach pain

5\. Tingling and numbness in the hands or feet

6\. Diarrhea

7\. Loss of skin tone

8\. Vomiting

## What Are The Primary Causes Of Inflammation And How Do Various Interna 2F98C1

# What are the primary causes of inflammation, and how do various internal and external factors contribute to its development in the body?

Inflammation is a normal healing and repair process. But, if you experience chronic inflammation, all sorts of destruction can occur. If you can get rid of inflammation, you can get rid of the complications and symptoms of autoimmune diseases, old injuries, and more.

Inflammatory oncotaxis is a phenomenon where cancer tends to spread to areas where you experienced old injuries where there was inflammation. An old injury could mean many different things, such as food irritation to the colon, damage to the lungs from smoking, damage to the arteries from a high carb diet, or injuries.

**The top causes of inflammation:**

1\. Lack of cortisol

2\. Allergies

3\. Acute and chronic infections

4\. Gut inflammation (gut issues or inflammatory foods)

5\. Glucose/sugar

6\. Fat cells

7\. Old injuries

8\. Problems in the bile ducts

9\. Low vitamin D

10\. High omega-6 and low omega-3

11\. Environmental toxins

12\. Frequent eating

13\. Too much iron

## What Are The Effects Of Long Term Chronic Stress On Physical And Menta 34E9A2

# What are the effects of long-term chronic stress on physical and mental health?

Cortisol, released during stress, facilitates coping mechanisms but prolonged elevation can lead to high blood sugars, muscle catabolism, heightened awareness, reduced inflammation, suppressed reproduction, decreased white blood cells, and increased infection risk. Chronic stress weakens cortisol, contributing to conditions like allergies, memory issues, autoimmune disorders, asthma, viral reactivation, insomnia, and abdominal fat accumulation.

To address underlying causes, support adrenal health with outdoor walking, vitamin D exposure, adrenal gland acupressure, and adequate intake of potassium, magnesium, and B-vitamins. Prioritizing quality sleep is essential for cortisol regulation and overall well-being.

## What Are Effective Methods For Eliminating Blackheads And Sebaceous Filaments

# What are effective methods for eliminating blackheads and sebaceous filaments?

We will also explore the root causes and how to address these issues to achieve long-term results.

**Many people mistake sebaceous filaments for blackheads and try to remove them by using tweezers or other methods. However, this can damage the skin.**

**The presence of sebaceous filaments and blackheads is often linked to the overproduction of sebum. This production is regulated by a hormone called androgens, which can increase during puberty, pregnancy, or other hormonal imbalances.**

So, how do we address the root cause of sebaceous filaments? **One way is to regulate and balance our androgen levels through dietary changes. Consuming foods high in vitamin A, D, and omega-3 fatty acids while reducing the intake of seed oils found in processed foods can help decrease sebum production.**

**Another way to reduce and balance androgen levels is through intermittent fasting and the keto diet, which helps lower insulin levels. High levels of insulin can also contribute to the overproduction of sebum.**

Additionally, zinc deficiency has been linked to raised sebum production. Consuming zinc-rich foods such as shellfish and red meat can help address this deficiency. Managing stress levels is also essential, as chronic stress can deplete our zinc levels.

## What Are Steroid Drugs And What Are Side Effects Of Them

# What are steroid drugs and what are side effects of them?

Corticosteroids are primarily used to manage inflammation, but they suppress the immune system, increasing susceptibility to infections like pneumonia and potentially activating latent tuberculosis. Long-term use can lead to adrenal suppression and withdrawal symptoms such as osteoporosis, ulcers, and diabetes. Alternatives include curcumin, boswellia, green tea, vitamin D, and fasting. Corticosteroids should be used cautiously and for short durations.

# What are the health benefits of supplementing with Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium strains?

Many times people will see a doctor because of depression, and the doctor will want to load them up on prescription medications. The problem is that in some situations, the person can never come off of the medication, and the medication can cause serious side-effects.

If you have depression, it may be beneficial to look at your diet and see what could be improved. You may want to consider the heathy keto diet and intermittent fasting. Vitamin D may also be beneficial. Something else that could be very important to do is to fix your gut. There is a huge connection between what’s going on in your large intestine and your overall mood.

It has been found that with major depressive disorder, there are high levels of certain microbes and low levels of other microbes in the gut. These microbes could have a huge influence on your overall mood. There is one microbe in particular that could have many different benefits for someone who is depressed. This microbe is called lactobacillus bifidobacterium.

Lactobacillus bifidobacterium can be found in foods like:

1\. Bulgarian yogurt (high-quality and high-fat yogurt)

2\. Kimchi

3\. Sauerkraut

4\. Cheese

5\. Kefir

6\. Pickles

This microbe could be beneficial because it helps make certain neurotransmitters like GABA and serotonin. Microbes like this one also make vitamins, including B1 and other B vitamins. If you can’t consume these foods on a regular basis, you could try taking a probiotic with lactobacillus in it.

## How Does Stress Impact The Function And Composition Of White Blood Cells

# How does stress impact the function and composition of white blood cells?

**Stress, primarily regulated by cortisol, plays a critical role in immune function:**

**1\. Cortisol's Role:** Cortisol suppresses white blood cells, key components of the immune system, under stress conditions.

**2\. Types of Stress:** Acute stress is short-term, while chronic stress, which elevates cortisol levels persistently, can lead to cortisol resistance akin to insulin resistance.

**3\. Implications of Chronic Stress:** Elevated cortisol levels can impair immune response, potentially increasing susceptibility to illness and health complications.

**4\. Factors Influencing Immunity:** Chronic stress, combined with nutrient deficiencies or other factors, can compromise immune function, making individuals more vulnerable to infections and health issues.

**5\. Viral Impact:** Viral infections can further impact immune function by inducing nutrient deficiencies or hindering vitamin D absorption, which may exacerbate health challenges.

## What Strategies Can Be Employed To Address Adrenal Fatigue Through Imp Ab38Df

# What strategies can be employed to address adrenal fatigue through improved sleep management?

The medical profession doesn’t recognize adrenal fatigue as an actual condition. But, this doesn’t make sense. If a person has too much adrenal function, this is called Cushing’s disease, and if you don’t have enough adrenal hormones, this is called Addison’s disease. So, why couldn’t someone develop wear and tear, breakdown, or fatigue of the adrenal glands? 

**The two big symptoms of adrenal fatigue are:**

1\. Chronic fatigue 

2\. Chronic inflammation 

The most important thing you can do for adrenal fatigue is to get more sleep. Sleep helps improve stress. It’s not always just about the diet. In this situation, it’s about recovering and restoring sleep. 

**A few main causes of poor sleep:**

• Pain and inflammation (take vitamin D) 

• Nightmares (take nutritional yeast) 

• EMF 

• A high pulse rate or high blood pressure (take potassium, magnesium, and vitamin D)

• Heart arrhythmias (Take potassium, magnesium, berberine, quinine, and forskolin) 

**A few more things that may help:**

• Long walks

• Lower your carbohydrates 

• Go to sleep when you’re tired 

• Take naps 

• Isolate what’s causing your stress and do what you can to improve your stress

## What Signs Or Changes In The Eyes Can Indicate Fluctuations In Blood S 237Ed7

# What signs or changes in the eyes can indicate fluctuations in blood sugar levels, and how do these ocular symptoms relate to overall metabolic health?

Here are seven things your eyes reveal about your blood sugar levels:

1\. Puffy eyelids and edema indicate high sugar, as excess glucose causes fluid retention.

2\. Glaucoma, caused by high sugar levels leading to increased intraocular pressure, results from glycation and abnormal blood vessel formation.

3\. Cataracts occur when high sugar levels misfold lens proteins and deplete vitamin B1; supplements like B1 and carnosine can help.

4\. Retinopathy, damaging the retina and nerves, can lead to blindness; benfotiamine, a B1 supplement, may aid repair alongside dietary changes.

5\. Macular degeneration affects focus and is influenced by diet; lutein helps but diet improvements are crucial.

6\. Red, irritated eyes result from inflammation and damaged blood vessels due to high sugar; blood sugar normalization is necessary.

7\. Dry eyes, often from vitamin A deficiency and low zinc, are exacerbated by high sugar, which depletes zinc levels.

## What Does The Acronym Rae Mean

# What does the acronym "RAE" mean?

The term "RAE" refers to the amount of vitamin A. The acronym "RAE" stands for Retinol Activity Equivalents, which is a unit of measurement for vitamin A activity in food and dietary supplements. This unit takes into account the different bioactivities of retinol and provitamin A carotenoids, all of which are converted by the body into the active form of vitamin A. Dr. Berg's Cod Liver Oil Capsules, each serving provides 1062 mcg RAE of Vitamin A. This amount is equivalent to 118% of the recommended daily intake of vitamin A.

## Why Is Microcrystalline Cellulose In The Products

# Why is microcrystalline cellulose in the products?

We're excited to share that we are actively transitioning to formulas without microcrystalline cellulose! We are replacing microcrystalline cellulose with the amino acid L-leucine in our products.

Only two products, Vitamin D3 & K2 and Trace Minerals Enhanced, will continue to contain a small amount of microcrystalline cellulose. This is due to challenges encountered during production where the ingredients adhered to the machinery without it. Rest assured, we are actively researching and developing solutions to eliminate it from these products as well.

Our new and improved formula, featuring L-leucine instead of microcrystalline cellulose, is already in our Natural Vitamin B1+! This positive change will extend across our entire product line as existing inventory is replenished so you can enjoy the enhanced formula in all your favorite Dr. Berg products very soon.

## Can I Consume Cheese Every Day

# Can I consume cheese every day?

**Cheese is a great protein source, has probiotic properties, and is low in lactose.**

**The best cheeses are goat cheese and sheep cheese. These cheeses contain A2 casein, which is easier on your digestive system than lactose. Surprisingly, the oldest people in the world consume sheep cheese and goat cheese!**

Cow's milk is around 4% lactose, while cottage cheese and mozzarella cheese vary from 1% to 4% lactose. Goat cheese and sheep cheese are only about .5% lactose. Goat and sheep cheese are higher in protein, vitamin A, vitamin E, folic acid, B vitamins, calcium, and CLA than cow's milk cheese. CLA helps with exercise performance and weight loss.

Around 20% to 30% of the fat in sheep and goat cheese is MCT fat, which is converted directly into ketones. Sheep cheese and goat cheese generate quick energy with little stress on your digestion.

**Cheese from animals who graze at higher altitudes is higher in polyphenols. When you introduce these polyphenols to your mitochondria, it triggers an uncoupling effect. This means it generates extra energy, which is effective if you’re trying to lose weight. Polyphenols also stimulate mitochondrial biogenesis.**

**Research has shown that people who live longest have more mitochondria uncoupling. Other ways to stimulate mitochondrial uncoupling include exercise, cold therapy, fasting, and consuming other polyphenols like sulforaphane, turmeric, and green tea.**

## What Are The Most Effective Treatments For Acne

# What are the most effective treatments for acne?

Acne is often influenced by overactive sebaceous glands, exacerbated by hormonal spikes during puberty, particularly androgens. Managing acne involves ensuring adequate vitamin A, omega-3 fatty acids, and vitamin D intake—benefits found in cod liver oil. Zinc supplementation also aids in regulating gland function. Avoiding seed oils and reducing sugar intake help mitigate insulin levels, which can indirectly elevate androgens associated with acne, notably in conditions like polycystic ovarian syndrome. A low-carb diet may significantly improve symptoms.

## What Are The Various Underlying Causes And Contributing Factors Associ A4508E

# What are the various underlying causes and contributing factors associated with costochondritis?

**Cause #1: Vitamin D deficiency**

Vitamin D is a very important vitamin for your bones and for reducing inflammation across the body. Vitamin D deficiency can definitely cause bone pain and aching as well as costochondritis.

**Cause #2: Digestive problems**

Just behind the rib cage you have your digestive organs. If your gallbladder or liver are inflamed or enlarged, this can create pressure on your ribs resulting in chest pain and costochondritis. In such a case you could also have bloating and indigestion.

## Is It Ok For Kids To Drink Fruit Juice

# Is it ok for kids to drink fruit juice?

Even a pediatric group says, “Fruit juice has no essential role in healthy balanced diets of children”. That’s an understatement. Fruit juice has the same amount of sugar as soda. It's a pasteurized product; that is, it’s nutritionally dead. When you consume that much concentrated sugar without fiber or phytonutrients, you'll create vitamin deficiencies.

**Children between the ages of 2 and 18 consume 50 percent of their fruit as juice. So when a group of doctors who specialize in caring for children make a statement about fruit juice not playing an essential role in a healthy diet for children, it highlights how little they actually know about the role of sugar causing kids’ insulin to get too high and damage their health down the road.**

The worst thing you can do is give your baby fruit juice. They’re still developing. Giving them pure sugar is going to set them up for diabetes. In fact, you don’t want to give liquid fruit to any children.

## Natural Antibiotic Drink Recipe

# Natural Antibiotic Drink Recipe

The overuse of antibiotics is a major issue in the United States. Overuse of antibiotics leads to antibiotic resistance. This means that the microbes that are not killed by the antibiotics become stronger and resistant. When you take antibiotics again, they don’t work as well anymore.

Antibiotics do not kill yeast or viruses, but they do kill good microbes that keep the yeast at bay. This is why a common side effect of antibiotics is an overgrowth of candida or yeast.

Weaker antibiotics like penicillin and tetracycline work by slowing the growth of microbial reproduction. Stronger antibiotics like Cipro and Levaquin come with strong side effects and a black box warning.

If you have to take stronger antibiotics, always take magnesium, vitamin E, and probiotics along with them. After taking antibiotics, it could take weeks or even years to get your original microbes back. Because 80% of your immune system is your microbiome, this can have detrimental effects on your natural immunity.

Antibiotics naturally come from molds and other microorganisms found in the soil. These natural compounds have anti-inflammatory effects, antimicrobial effects, anti-diabetic effects, and anticancer effects.

**Here is the recipe for a natural antibiotic drink that should be taken at the first sign of a cough or illness:**

•3 cloves garlic

•90 drops Echinacea extract

•1 whole organic lemon (peel included)

•1 tablespoon apple cider vinegar

•1 tablespoon raw honey

•16 ounces water

Blend all ingredients for about 45 seconds. Drink ⅓ of the mixture 3 times per day. If you’re in the middle of an infection, do this for the duration of the infection. You should notice a diminishing of symptoms, and you should sleep better. Also, take 50,000 IUs of vitamin D3 and 100 to 150 mg of zinc to boost your immune system.

## What Are Some Different Ways To Burn Fat

# What are some different ways to burn fat?

Insulin is one of the most important hormones related to fat burning. It’s produced in the pancreas and tells your body to store fat. You can not burn fat if insulin is too high. Aim for less than 50 grams of carbs per day to avoid spiking insulin. Intermittent fasting can also help prevent insulin spikes.

Seed oils and modified food starches like MSG trigger insulin and inflammation and should be avoided.

**To help lower insulin, do the following:**

1\. Lower your carbohydrate intake

2\. Do intermittent fasting

3\. Drink apple cider vinegar with water

4\. Consume berberine and cinnamon

**Estrogen and cortisol** can also cause your body to store fat. To lower estrogen, avoid synthetic hormones and chemicals in your environment. Choose organic foods to avoid pesticides and herbicides that mimic estrogen in the body.

**To minimize cortisol**, focus on stress reduction. Physical activity like housework, long walks, or exercise can get your mind off of stress. Vitamin B1 and vitamin D are also very important for keeping cortisol levels low.

**Growth hormone and IGF-1** (Insulin-like growth factor 1) are the main hormones involved in fat burning. Intense exercise, good sleep habits, moderate protein intake, and intermittent fasting trigger growth hormone and IGF-1. Sprinting is one of the best workouts to trigger these hormones to burn fat.

**Testosterone, glucagon, thyroid hormone (T3), and adrenaline are also important for fat-burning.** To boost testosterone naturally, ensure that you’re consuming foods high in zinc and make sure you’re getting enough cholesterol.

**Exercise** is important, but only contributes to about 15% of your overall weight loss. Exercise can lower stress, improve sleep, and also trigger glucagon and adrenaline.

## What Steps Can I Take If Im So Exhausted That I Struggle To Fall Asleep

# What steps can I take if I’m so exhausted that I struggle to fall asleep?

While some people have too much energy to fall asleep, others are actually too tired to fall asleep. It takes a healthy amount of energy in your energy factories, your mitochondria, to sleep well. The organs that have the most mitochondria are your heart and brain. This means that both of these organs need a lot of oxygen to function properly. Thankfully, there are several things you can do to increase oxygen into the mitochondria in the brain to help you fall asleep fast and have a good night’s sleep. There is also, essentially, a clock in your brain that tells you when to sleep and when to wake up—we need to get this clock to work better.

**How to sleep better at night:**

• Exercise

• Consume vitamin B1 before bed

• Sleep with the window open

• Put plants in your room

• Consume CoQ10

• Take methylene blue

• Use dim lights after sunset

• Replace certain lights in your house with incandescent lights

• Avoid blue light before bed

• Use red lights

• Use the light from a fireplace if possible

• Use blue blockers

• Don’t consume any food 5 hours before bed

• Take vitamin D3 while traveling

• Go to bed before midnight (around 10 pm works for many people)

## What Are Some Effective Methods For Detoxifying And Cleansing The Lungs

# What are some effective methods for detoxifying and cleansing the lungs?

Let’s talk about the best ways to detox your lungs naturally. Air pollution, cigarette smoke, and cleaning chemicals are just a few of the things that can affect the lungs. But, certain natural remedies may help detox the lungs and potentially help decrease the risk of conditions like COPD and cancer. Cancer tends to spread into areas of inflammation. If the lungs have inflammation, they become a target for cancer. Inflammation can also lead to fibrosis. So, we want to focus on natural ways to reduce lung inflammation. When chemicals go into the lungs, they don’t stop in the lungs. Chronic exposure to toxins in the air can also lead to problems with the liver and heart.

**The best remedies to detox the lungs:**

1\. Milk thistle

2\. Tocotrienols

3\. Vitamin D

4\. Pneumotrophin PMG® (Standard Process)

## What Factors Can Disrupt A Good Nights Sleep

# What factors can disrupt a good night's sleep?

Sleep significantly impacts health, particularly heart function and longevity. Poor sleep correlates with disrupted blood sugar, increased cravings, higher cortisol levels, and mood disturbances.

Factors hindering good sleep include high cortisol, low levels of vitamin D, calcium, magnesium, potassium, B12, B1, and zinc. Additionally, poor sleep environments, melatonin supplementation, exposure to blue light and EMF, and stimulant consumption affect sleep quality.

Improving sleep involves cutting out sugar, adopting a low-carb diet, avoiding late or excessive eating, and focusing on relaxed breathing techniques to facilitate faster sleep onset.

## Why Cant I Lose Belly Fat After Menopause

# Why can't I lose belly fat after menopause?

When a woman goes through menopause, their ovaries no longer produce or release eggs. This big change leads to a cascade of other changes. The ovaries also make hormones, which means a woman in menopause will have lower hormone levels. However, when this happens, the adrenal glands are supposed to act as the backup system for the ovaries. The adrenal glands make all of the hormones that the ovaries make.

If the adrenal glands are strong and stable when a woman is going into menopause, they may experience fewer symptoms. It’s not normal to experience symptoms of menopause unless there’s a problem with the adrenal glands. Another part of the body we need to focus on is the parasympathetic nervous system. The parasympathetic nervous system is the recovery system of the body. It influences your sleep and ability to recover. Fat burning occurs in the recovery phase.

Exercising your parasympathetic nervous system will help reduce cortisol, support sleep, and get rid of belly fat. In order to strengthen your parasympathetic nervous system, it’s crucial to increase the time you rest in between your reps and sets of exercise, as well as the days of exercise. You have to make sure you don’t overtrain and give your body a chance to completely recover and reset.

**How to lose belly fat after menopause:**

1\. Do high-intensity exercises with longer rest periods

2\. Don’t overtrain

3\. Don’t train over soreness

4\. Focus on getting more sleep

5\. Take advantage of chiropractic care, massage therapy, or physical therapy

6\. Consume omega-3 fatty acids

7\. Take DHEA

8\. Go on a low-carb diet with intermittent fasting

9\. Get plenty of magnesium, choline, vitamin B1, and vitamin D

10\. Try lemon balm, passionflower, or ashwagandha

## Is Reducing Sugar Intake An Effective Strategy For Lowering Blood Suga 122Cc9

# Is reducing sugar intake an effective strategy for lowering blood sugar levels?

Sugar intake increases blood pressure because it increases insulin. Insulin triggers a spike in the sympathetic nervous system, which increases stress and worsens blood pressure.

Some of the best ways to lower blood sugar include increasing your intake of vitamin D and potassium, as well as cutting sugar out of your diet.

## What Are The Most Effective Remedies For Managing And Reducing Teeth Grinding

# What are the most effective remedies for managing and reducing teeth grinding?

**Grinding your teeth can lead to issues like:**

• Excessive wearing of the teeth

• Teeth pain

• Headaches

• Jaw spasms

People who smoke, drink alcohol, or take SSRIs have a higher risk of teeth grinding (bruxism). There are a few things involved in teeth grinding at night, but it seems to be largely related to the autonomic nervous system.

Bruxism is also associated with a certain variation in genetics. The gene involved is the receptor gene for serotonin. If you have this variation, you’ll have to work harder to increase the precursors of serotonin to help build it up.

**Bruxism can also be triggered by various things, including:**

• Stress events

• Trauma

• Excess caffeine consumption

**The best natural remedies for teeth grinding:**

1\. Vitamin B1 (nutritional yeast)

2\. Vitamin D3

## What Strategies And Nutrients Can Help Support Bone Health And Strengt 500086

# What strategies and nutrients can help support bone health and strengthen weak bones?

If you have osteopenia or osteoporosis and you want to strengthen your bones, this video is for you.

The missing mineral that many people need to strengthen their bones is strontium. Strontium is a powerful trace mineral. Trace minerals are minerals you need in very small amounts. This is unlike calcium, which you need a lot of for strong bones.

You need strontium and calcium in a 1:1000 ratio.

**If you have a bone problem, strontium could be a powerful addition to your protocol along with:**

• Calcium

• Vitamin D3

• Vitamin K2

• Magnesium

Your liver makes bile, which acts as a detergent to break down fats. Your gallbladder stores and concentrates bile, so it’s ready for use when you consume dietary fat. You need your bile to be concentrated to fully break down fat. When it isn’t concentrated, you can have incomplete fat digestion. In turn, your risk of developing a deficiency of fat-soluble vitamins and essential fatty acids is increased.

Without a gallbladder, you may experience symptoms such as:

• Floating stool

• Bloating

• Right shoulder pain

• Incomplete toxin removal

• Constipation

• Incomplete conversation of thyroid hormone T4 to T3

• Vitamin deficiencies

## Can Adrenal Fatigue Lead To Weight Gain

# Can adrenal fatigue lead to weight gain?

Adrenal fatigue, particularly chronic stress, can lead to weight gain, exacerbated by poor dietary habits. Cortisol, released during stress, increases energy (sugar) storage as fat when unused, and can degrade muscle mass by converting it into sugar. Additionally, cortisol inhibits fat burning, making ketosis difficult.

Addressing stress sources is crucial. Implementing Healthy Keto and intermittent fasting can help, along with ensuring adequate intake of vitamin D, vitamin C, and potassium.

## What Are The Common Reasons For Vitamin D Deficiency

# What are the common reasons for vitamin D deficiency?

Our bodies need about 1200 IUs of vitamin D per day. It might go up or down, depending on different factors. For example, are you stressed out? This could actually be one of the reasons for the deficiency of vitamin D. 

**Foods high in vitamin D:**

• Cod liver oil 

• Fatty fish

• Butter

• Cheese

• Cream

• Raw-milk 

Most people get vitamin D from the sun. 

**A few vitamin D benefits:**

• Supports bone health

• Supports the immune system

## What Causes Postmenopausal Osteoporosis

# What causes postmenopausal osteoporosis?

A lot of women who go through menopause end up having bone loss. What causes this condition, and what can you do about it? There are two types of cells in the bone:

• Osteoclasts – breaks down bone 

• Osteoblasts – builds bone 

A decrease in estrogen after menopause causes stimulation in osteoclasts and a decrease in osteoblasts.  Cortisol is a very destructive hormone to your bones. An increase in cortisol will stimulate osteoclasts and inhibit osteoblasts.

The female hormones, estrogen, and progesterone are produced by the ovary and the adrenals. When you go through menopause, and the adrenals are not strong enough to back up these hormones, you will end up with even less estrogen and more cortisol. 

**What you can do to support your bone health after menopause:**

1\. Support your adrenals (decrease stress, exercise, and increase vitamin D)

2\. Build bone (calcium citrate, magnesium, boron, trace minerals, vitamins D3 and K2) 

3\. Dairy (grass-fed)

## What Are The Most Effective Strategies For Stress Management

# What are the most effective strategies for stress management?

1\. Increase your sleep - If you aren’t getting enough sleep at night, you’re not going to be able to be patient and stress-free throughout the day. Avoid blue light before bed and get 7-8 hours of quality sleep.

2\. Get plenty of vitamin B1 - Vitamin B1 directly affects your tolerance to stress. Get vitamin B1 from a natural source, like nutritional yeast.

3\. Lower your carbohydrates - A high-carb diet will cause significant blood sugar and insulin fluctuations, which can cause significant irritability and boost your stress.

4\. Avoid the news - The news can be overwhelmingly negative, and it can add unnecessary fear and stress to your life.

5\. Exercise - Exercise increases the oxygen in your blood and lowers your stress naturally. Long walks are especially good for lowering your stress levels.

6\. Magnesium - This mineral is great for lowering your stress levels. 7 cups of vegetables and a bottle of mineral water a day will give you plenty of magnesium.

7\. Vitamin D - Get plenty of sunlight or supplement vitamin D. Vitamin D helps reduce stress and anxiety as well as support healthy sleep.

8\. Ketones - Ketones elevate your mood and promote healthy stress levels. Get on keto and intermittent fasting.

9\. Change your environment - Get outside and enjoy nature. This can really help slow down your pace and get rid of stress.

## Can Excessive Calcium Intake Lead To Kidney Stones

# Can excessive calcium intake lead to kidney stones?

Studies show that taking around 500mg of calcium carbonate will increase your risk of developing kidney stones. Massive doses of vitamin D over many months can also cause hypercalcemia, which can contribute to kidney stones. However, neither of these are the primary causes of kidney stones.

**The most common reasons for kidney stones are:**

1\. Kidney damage - years of bad dieting can cause poor kidney function. Try a healthy keto diet.

2\. Excess oxalates - avoid oxalate-rich foods, including almonds, spinach, swiss chard, and chocolate.

3\. Low citrates - take citrates or lemon juice.

4\. Low fluid - stay hydrated! At least 2.5 liters each day.

5\. Poor microbiome - improve your microbiome with probiotics and prebiotics (fiber).

6\. Low bile - take purified bile salts if you have low bile or a missing gallbladder.

## What Are The Common Causes Of Crusty Eyes

# What are the common causes of crusty eyes?

Crusty eyes can indicate a vitamin A deficiency, particularly when there's dryness and thickened mucus. Vitamin A, found in animal products like eggs, beef liver, and cod liver oil, is crucial for eye health. Factors such as low iron, insufficient pancreatic enzymes, gallbladder issues, alcohol consumption, IBS, inflammation, and antibiotic use can hinder vitamin A absorption. Increasing intake from animal sources, like cod liver oil, can help alleviate crusty eyes, while addressing absorption issues is key for effective treatment.

## Why Is It Difficult To Sleep Without Carbohydrates

# Why is it difficult to sleep without carbohydrates?

It can take a long time to fix insulin resistance, even once you make the switch to a ketogenic diet. With insulin resistance, you have higher amounts of insulin. With keto, you consume lower amounts of carbohydrates. But, you're still going to have high insulin despite cutting out the carbs because of the resistance problem.

Higher amounts of insulin can push the blood sugars down too low in the middle of the night. With low blood sugars, you have counter hormones that keep your blood sugars from going down too low. The two main ones are cortisol and adrenaline. These two hormones are behind many sleeping problems.

**What to do if you can't fall asleep without carbs:**

1\. Time (as you fix insulin resistance, this problem will get better)

2\. Take electrolytes (potassium, magnesium, and calcium)

3\. Take apple cider vinegar before bed

4\. Adjust the amount of protein you consume as your last meal

5\. Consume more vegetables

6\. Take vitamin B1

7\. Limit caffeine consumption

8\. Take exogenous ketones before bed

9\. Get more vitamin D by being in the sun or by taking vitamin D

## What Are The Nutrients That Get Rid Of Love Handles

# What are the nutrients that get rid of love handles?

First, I want to emphasize one important point. Love handles are a result of high levels of insulin. When your insulin is high, you cannot burn fat, and your body increases fat storage. The following nutrients help support healthy insulin levels, which promotes fat-burning. In turn, this will significantly reduce your love handles and belly fat.

**Take a look at these 7 nutrients that will help you lower your insulin and get rid of love handles.**

1\. Potassium - You can get potassium from beet tops, greens, and avocado.

2\. Vitamin D - You can get vitamin D from the sun, cod liver oil, egg yolks, and mushrooms.

3\. Fiber - You can get fiber from healthy low-carb vegetables.

4\. MCTs (medium-chain triglycerides) - You can get MCTs from coconut oil and other MCT oils.

5\. Magnesium - You can get magnesium from pumpkin seeds, spinach, chard, and almonds.

6\. Vitamin B1 - You can get vitamin B1 from sunflower seeds and nutritional yeast.

7\. Chromium - You can get chromium from broccoli and nutritional yeast.

Give these foods a try and let me know how they work for you.

## What Are The Health Benefits Associated With Exposure To Sunlight

# What are the health benefits associated with exposure to sunlight?

The sun is an excellent source of vitamin D, which has the capacity to lower cortisol by up to 40%.

Cortisol is a stress hormone and can cause weight gain, especially belly fat. High cortisol levels throughout your day can cause your stomach to be larger at the end of the day after dealing with different stressors.

The best source of vitamin D is sunlight, but you can also find vitamin D in fatty fish, mushrooms, cod liver oil, grass-fed dairy, and egg yolks.

**Some of the benefits of vitamin D include:**

•Helps the body absorb calcium

•Supports bone health

•Supports immune function

•Lowers cortisol

•Lowers insulin

## What Are The Common Symptoms Of Iron Deficiency

# What are the common symptoms of iron deficiency?

Iron deficiency is prevalent globally, crucial for:

\- Oxygen transport, energy production, DNA synthesis, hemoglobin, myoglobin, neuroglobin, and T-lymphocyte function.

Symptoms include fatigue, rapid heart rate, restless legs, and poor concentration.

Daily iron needs: 8mg for most, 18mg for post-menopausal women, 27mg for pregnant women. Animal sources (meat, chicken, fish) are more absorbable than plant sources.

Absorption helpers: Vitamin A, copper, zinc. Avoid ferrous oxide supplements; opt for natural food sources. Don’t take calcium with iron to prevent absorption interference.

Common causes: Celiac disease, IBS, low stomach acidity, gastric bypass, inflammation, phytic acid, soy, and vegan diets.

Consult a healthcare provider for personalized iron supplementation advice.

## When Is The Best Time To Take Vitamin D

# When is the best time to take vitamin D?

If you have a sleep problem, you may want to try taking your vitamin D before bed. Vitamin D may help increase your non-REM sleep. This is the deep delta wave sleep that occurs in the first half of sleep. Vitamin D may also help reduce your cortisol (stress) levels.

Most people will sleep fine, if not better, when they take vitamin D before bed. However, a small percentage of people may find that taking vitamin D before bed wakes them up. These people may need to take vitamin D earlier in the day.

Other great vitamins for sleep problems:

- Vitamin B5

- Folate

- Vitamin B1 (especially if you can’t turn your brain off at night)

---

## Can Insulin Resistance Be Reversed Or Improved

# Can insulin resistance be reversed or improved?

Yes, here is what you should do:

- Go on a low-carb diet

- Do intermittent fasting (at least 18 hours a day)

- Take apple cider vinegar before bed (2 tbsp. in water)

- Regular exercise

- Take vitamin D (at least 10,000 IU per day)

- Get potassium (from a supplement or from food)

- Get vitamin B1

---

## What Are The Health Benefits Of Magnesium

# What are the health benefits of magnesium?

Magnesium is a mineral that is very important for your nervous system and bones as well as your mood. People get magnesium from their diets, but sometimes magnesium supplements are needed if its levels are low. Of all the minerals, magnesium is the second most important, after potassium. You need both of these in pretty large quantities.

If you have low magnesium, you may have problems with bones and muscles like muscle cramps, muscle weakness, or muscle stiffness. Another key function of magnesium is maintaining electrical charge in the cells.

**Benefits**

- Improves blood pressure

- Improves muscle tone

- Improves vitamin D absorption

## Is Mineral Oil Advantageous For Health

# Is mineral oil advantageous for health?

Mineral oil is a petroleum derivative and is often found in cosmetic products and laxatives. There are over 70 hidden names for mineral oil!

Mineral oil should be avoided because it depletes fat-soluble vitamins such as vitamins A, D, E, and K. Even when applied to the skin, mineral oil still has the potential to deplete fat-soluble vitamins.

Vitamin A is important for the health of the skin as well as your body’s internal membranes. Applying a product to the skin that depletes vitamin A can cause acne and other skin ailments.

Vitamin D is important for your bones, vitamin K1 is important for blood clotting, and vitamin K2 is important for calcium transportation. Vitamin E is important for sex hormones, heart health, and many other important bodily functions.

## What Are The Potential Reasons For Easy Bruising

# What are the potential reasons for easy bruising?

Bruising, or contusions, occurs when capillaries under the skin bleed internally due to impact or weakness. While common, frequent bruising can indicate underlying issues:

1\. **Nutrient Deficiencies:**

\- **Calcium:** Essential for vein and capillary structure.

\- **Vitamin D:** Aids calcium absorption; sunlight and supplements are sources.

\- **Vitamin K1:** Crucial for blood clotting; found in leafy greens and supplements.

\- **Vitamin C:** Strengthens capillaries; obtained from cruciferous vegetables and complex supplements.

\- **Vitamin B12 and B9:** Support blood clotting; sources include fish, poultry, eggs, and leafy greens.

2\. **Medications:**

\- Blood-thinning medications and calcium channel blockers can increase bruising risk by inhibiting clot formation.

\- Consult a doctor to reassess medication dosages if you suspect this as a cause.

3\. **Other Factors:**

\- Gastric bypass surgery can impact nutrient absorption, potentially leading to deficiencies that contribute to bruising.

Maintaining a balanced diet rich in vegetables and consulting healthcare providers for proper evaluation and treatment are crucial for managing frequent bruising effectively.

## What Are The Primary Causes Of Hepatitis C

# What are the primary causes of Hepatitis C?

Hepatitis C is a viral infection that targets liver cells, leading to inflammation and potentially severe complications like diabetes, cirrhosis, and liver cancer. Symptoms include fatigue, flu-like symptoms, dark urine, abdominal pain, and jaundice.

Causes and remedies:

\- **Infection:** Hepatitis C is transmitted through blood contact. Strengthening the immune system is crucial. Adopting the Healthy Keto® diet and intermittent fasting can reduce liver inflammation and aid recovery. Limiting iron intake starves the virus.

\- **Supporting Liver Health:** Consume antioxidants like parsley, cruciferous vegetables, milk thistle, and vitamins (C, E, B complex). Enhance immune function with oregano oil, garlic, and vitamin D. Avoid liver-damaging substances such as alcohol, vegetable oils, and omega-6 fatty acids.

\- **Medications:** Reduce medication intake under medical supervision as some medications can strain the liver.

Managing these factors supports liver recovery and overall health when dealing with hepatitis C.

## What Are The Most Important Benefits Of Calcium

# What are the most important benefits of calcium?

Most people associate calcium with bone health. However, it has numerous other functions that are essential for a healthy body. The number one function of calcium is intercellular communication. What this means is that it helps with the communication between cells. When you don't have enough calcium outside your cells and too much calcium inside your cells, this is a problem called intercellular hypercalcinosis. This is caused by not enough calcium.

**When this happens, you can develop problems, including:**

• Hypertension

• Hardening arteries

• Diabetes

• Cancer

• Inflammation

• Soft tissue calcium

Calcium also controls natural cell death - called apoptosis. A problem with this can trigger tumors. The main reasons for low calcium could be a deficiency in Vitamin D3, Vitamin K2, Omega3, and Magnesium. These help transport, absorb, or regulate calcium.

Avoid calcium carbonate. This form of calcium is not beneficial for increasing calcium levels.

## Which Eggs Are Healthier White Or Brown

# Which eggs are healthier: white or brown?

Dr. Berg discussed if brown eggs are healthier than white eggs. The answer is NO. The reason why an egg has a certain color is because of the type of chicken. And the reason why the brown egg is more expensive than the white one is that the chicken is bigger and they have to feed the chicken more. It is important that the egg you consume is pasture-raised and organic.

**Types of Eggs**

• 100% natural

• Cage free / free range

• Pasture-raised

• Pasteurized

• Vegetarian-fed

• Organic Yolk Nutrients

• Choline

• Selenium

• Biotin

• Vitamin A, D, E, and K2

• B12

• Phosphorus

• Omega 3

## What Are The Potential Causes Of Joint Pain

# What are the potential causes of joint pain?

Joint pain is a problem that can be resolved by nutrition and proper diet. Certain foods and nutrients can reduce the inflammation and speed the recovery process of your joints and bones.

**Cause #1: Nutritional deficiencies**

When you are lacking certain vitamins in your body it can cause a lot of joint pain. This is because these certain vitamins are required for the healthy functioning of your joints and body tissues.

**Vitamin D3** is one of the most powerful natural anti-inflammatory vitamins. It will help with joint pain and reduce inflammation.

**Vitamin K2** is a vital nutrient that helps to move excess calcium deposits from your joints into your bones.

**Vitamin C** helps to develop and repair bones and joints in your body by making collagen (proteins for bones and joints). If you have fatigue in addition to joint pain that’s a good indicator of vitamin C deficiency.

Colostrum is a great anti-inflammatory and a good supplement for joint pain.

**Vitamin D3 (get 20,000 to 40,000 IU daily):**

- Consume cod liver oil

- Get more exposure to the sun

- Take a vitamin D3 supplement

**Vitamin K2** (get 300 to 400 mcg daily):

- Consume vitamin K2-rich foods:

    - grass-fed milk

    - cheese

    - butter

    - goose liver

    - grass-fed organic egg yolks

- Get vitamin K2 supplement (MK-7 version)

**Vitamin C:**

- Consume vitamin C-rich foods:

    - sauerkraut

    - bell pepper

    - berries

    - raw lemons

- Take natural vitamin C complex (not ascorbic acid)

- Avoid refined carbs and sugar

- Avoid snacking

- Consume colostrum for joint pain

**Cause #2: Mycotoxins**

Mycotoxins are various poisons which are released from mold and fungus that can affect your joints and your immune system in a bad way. One thing to know is that consuming refined carbs and sugar will worsen the problem as mold and fungus live on sugar and carbs.

**Remedies:**

- If you have mold in your house, locate and get rid of it

- Avoid antibiotics

- Avoid GMO foods

- Avoid sweets and carbs

- Consume grapefruit seed oil

- Consume bentonite clay

- Consume garlic

- Do the Healthy Keto® diet

- Do an intermittent fasting plan

**Cause #3: Omega-6 fatty acids**

When you consume certain oils that contain omega-6 fatty acids, they can greatly spike the inflammation in your body and this alone can cause you to have joint pain. The solution would be to avoid foods with omega-6 fatty acids and to consume more foods with omega-3 fatty acids (these are anti-inflammatory).

**Remedies:**

- Avoid foods containing omega-6 fats:

- corn oil

- soy oil

- canola oil

- cottonseed oil

- sunflower oil

- vegetable oils in general

- too many nuts

- Substitute with these oils containing omega-3:

- butter

- olive oil

- coconut oil

- cod liver oil

- high-quality fish oil

- Consume fatty fish

- Consume sardines

**Other causes:**

- Muscle compensation

- Rheumatoid arthritis

- DJD (degenerative joint disease)

- Gallbladder problem (indicated by right shoulder pain)

- Injuries

- Sacroiliac (S-I)

## What Are The Potential Causes Of A Lump In The Throat Sensation

# What are the potential causes of a lump-in-the-throat sensation?

You may have a sensation that something is in your throat when there is nothing in there. This means there is something wrong in your inner throat muscles or the valves in it.

**Symptoms:**

- Spasms in the throat

- Can’t breathe

- Sensation of a lump in the throat

**Cause #1: Hypocalcemia (calcium deficiency)**

Calcium is very important in preventing throat spasms as well as general spasms in the body. If you lack calcium, as well as VItamin D and K2 (which support absorption and utilization of free calcium in your body) this can result in throat “lumps.”

**Remedies:**

- Take calcium lactate

- Take calcium orotate

- Avoid calcium carbonate

- Take vitamins D and K2

**Cause #2: Low stomach acidity**

If you have low stomach acidity, this can result in acid reflux, which means the valve that keeps the acid in your stomach isn’t strong enough and the stomach will push the acid to your throat. This can cause throat spasms and the feeling of a lump in your throat. Additionally if your stomach acidity is not enough, you will not be able to absorb the calcium that is in your diet.

**Remedies:**

- Take apple cider vinegar (1 to 2 teaspoons stirred into about a cup of water)

- Take betaine hydrochloride

**Cause #3: Stress**

Stress over a long period of time can result in the depletion of calcium in the body. The nerves in your throat can get irritated as a result.

## What Are The Potential Causes Of Abnormal Urine Color

# What are the potential causes of abnormal urine color?

Typically, your urine should be a straw yellow color. If it is different, various causes can underlie those unusual colors.

**Dark urine:**

Dark urine could mean that the urine is too concentrated. This could indicate that you need to drink more water.

**Clear urine:**

This probably means it’s too diluted, which could mean you’re consuming too much water. You could actually be diluting your electrolytes, weakening the heart.

**Bright yellow urine:**

This could happen after consuming too many synthetic B vitamins. Reduce the amounts or substitute with natural B vitamins in this case.

**Red/Rust urine:**

Dark red could indicate blood in the urine, kidney stones, UTI or prostate problems. Also intense running can cause it by moving your kidney up and down for a long time, causing it to have hard time to properly filter the blood.

**Dark orange or brown urine:**

This could point to liver/gallbladder issues. Potentially it could come from flagyl (an antibiotic), muscle injury, excessive exercise, kidney damage, excessive fava beans or eating rhubarb. Consuming more vegetables may help.

**Pink urine:**

This could happen after eating beets or come from a small amount of blood in the urine. Potassium citrate may help.

**Green urine:**

This could come from eating asparagus.

**Foamy urine:**

This could mean there is too much protein in the urine. It can happen from consuming too much protein, or you may need to support your kidneys.

**Blue urine:**

This could mean there is too much calcium in your body. It can come from consuming a lot of vitamin D. Too much intake of B vitamins can also cause it. Consuming vitamin K2 and reducing amounts of calcium should help.

**Black urine:**

If your urine is black, the cause could be an antibiotic called flagyl or it could be the herb cascara laxative or the sweetener sorbitol.

## What Are The Potential Causes Of Poor Night Vision

# What are the potential causes of poor night vision?

Poor night vision means it’s hard to see during the night or when it is dark. Let’s look at the root cause behind it.

**Symptoms:**

- Can’t see at night

- Disoriented when it’s dark outside

**Cause #1: Vitamin A deficiency**

One of the functions of vitamin A is to sensitize the cells in the eye to respond to light. Without vitamin A you will not be able to see at night. The active form of vitamin A is called retinol. Retinol is found mainly in animal products. If consuming vitamin A-rich foods doesn’t remedy the situation I suggest improving the absorption of it by assisting the liver with the production of bile (absorbs vitamin A).

## What Are The Common Causes Of Nasal Congestion

# What are the common causes of nasal congestion?

Nasal congestion can create a lot of discomfort and difficulties breathing in your daily life. There are simple remedies that can be applied to this condition.

**Symptoms:**

- Stuffy nose

- Runny nose (mucus)

- Headache

- Allergy like symptoms

- Can’t breath

**Cause #1: Fungus**

The most common fungus that causes nasal congestion is called aspergillus fumigatus. If you have not enough friendly bacteria in the body--for example after having a history of taking antibiotics--the result can be an overgrowth of this fungus. One thing to know is that fungus uses carbs, sugar and Iron as food. I suggest using natural antibiotics while building up friendly bacteria in your body.

**Remedies:**

- Take oregano oil

- Take garlic

- You can also do a nasal rinse (Watch this video.)

- Avoid iron in the foods

- Avoid dairy and carbs

- Do intermittent fasting

- Do prolonged fasting (once or twice a month).

- As a general remedy for sinus relief:

    • take serrapeptase (200,000 IU)

- As a general remedy for sinus congestion:

• take serrapeptase (200,000 IU)
• do an acupressure technique (Watch this video.)
• mix 1 teaspoon of apple cider vinegar in water and drink it

**Cause #2: Rhinovirus**

Rhinovirus is a type of viral infection that can affect your nose and can keep them inflamed and congested. Most of the time it is seasonal, however it can be chronic.

**Remedies:**

- Take zinc (150mg)

- Take vitamin D (20,000 IU)

- As a general remedy for sinus congestion:

    - take serrapeptase (200,000 IU)

    - do an acupressure technique (Watch this video.)

- mix 1 teaspoon of apple cider vinegar in water and drink it

**Cause #3: Allergies**

Allergy means intolerance to certain types of foods or elements from outside, like pollen. Your body overreacts to the thing causing allergy, creating a lot of symptoms like inflammation, irritation, nose congestion etc. The best way to see if you have an allergy is to look back and see what you ate or were exposed to just before getting a sinus congestion. Chances are this is the unusual type of food or thing you were exposed to.

**Remedies:**

Take more vitamin A

- eat more meats

- virgin cod liver oil

- grass-fed butter

- kale

Improve the digestion of vitamin A by taking purified bile salts. As a general remedy for sinus congestion:

- take serrapeptase (200,000 IU)

- do acupressure technique (Watch this video.)

- mix 1 teaspoon of apple cider vinegar in water and drink it

## What Are The Potential Causes Of Charley Horses

# What are the potential causes of charley horses?

A muscle cramp or charley horse is an uncontrolled muscle contraction that is sudden and painful. It often occurs during exercise or at night. Muscle cramps commonly occur in the calf muscle, but they can also occur in the foot and, occasionally, in the thigh.

**Cause #1: Magnesium and potassium deficiency (electrolytes)**

Magnesium and potassium are the electrolytes (electrically charged minerals) that are very important for correct muscle work and relaxation.

Magnesium is the relaxation mineral. Having enough of it will prevent cramps from occurring as your muscles will be naturally relaxed.

Potassium is responsible for high cellular energy as well as relaxation of the body in general-- along with many other functions. Your body needs 4,700 mg of potassium daily, which is about 7 to 10 cups of vegetables a day.

**Remedies:**

- Consume magnesium-rich foods

- Consume vegetables (7 to 10 cups daily)

- Consume magnesium and potassium supplements

- Take apple cider vinegar (1 to 2 teaspoons stirred into about a cup of water) to improve the absorption of calcium and magnesium

**Cause #2: Too much calcium**

Too much calcium in the diet can cause a lot of calcium residue in your muscle tissues as well as in your joints. Calcium does cause contraction of the muscles, and if you have an excess of it, it can cause cramps. Additionally, sometimes you may consume moderate amounts of calcium and still get cramps; this could be because calcium is not absorbed properly and not mobilised to the bones once it is absorbed. In this case you can take vitamin D and K2.

**Remedies:**

- Avoid calcium carbonate

- Consume vitamin D3 and K2

- Consume natural sources of calcium (like european cheese, kefir, etc.)

**Cause #3: Alkalosis**

If you have too alkaline a body pH it can result in muscle cramps. The reason behind it is that when your body pH is higher than normal it can result in inability to utilize the free calcium that is in your body. Calcium, in the right amounts and correctly utilized by your body, is needed for healthy muscle contractions. The solution would be to acidify your body.

**Remedies:**

- Take apple cider vinegar (1 to 2 teaspoons stirred into about a cup of water, with your meals)

- Take betaine hydrochloride

- You can also drink these acidifiers:

    - kombucha tea

    - pickle juice

- Take potassium

- Avoid antacids

- Do the Healthy Keto® diet

- Do an intermittent fasting plan

- Avoid tap water (use a filter if needed)

**Other causes:**

- Medication for high blood pressure

- Medication for high cholesterol

- Prednisone

## How Do I Take Vitamin D To Reduce Inflammation

# How do I take vitamin D to reduce inflammation?

Vitamin D is a very powerful vitamin that supports and regulates your immune system as well as lowering inflammation. If you have chronic inflammation, this can be caused by vitamin D deficiency. The majority of the earth’s population is deficient in vitamin D.

Additionally, if your chronic inflammation is caused by an autoimmune condition (your own immune cells are attacking your body itself) vitamin D can greatly help to restore normal functioning of the immune system as well as reduce the inflammation.

**Remedies:**

- Consume vitamin D

    - cod liver oil

    - expose your body more to sunlight

    - vitamin D supplement (at least 20,000 IU/day)

- You can take vitamin K2 along with D (helps to utilize free calcium in the body, helps with bone/joint inflammation) --100 mcg for every 10,000 IU of vitamin D

## Does Consuming Coffee Have Any Adverse Effects On Liver Health

# Does consuming coffee have any adverse effects on liver health?

In fact, coffee has the capacity to protect your liver; it’s hepatoprotective.

The liver’s main job is to detoxify, although overall it has over 500 functions. Coffee has the capacity to protect liver cells and decrease liver enzymes.

**So what’s in coffee that provides this protection?** It’s the phytonutrients (plant-based chemical antioxidants). They help regulate bile. They have anti-inflammatory properties, they can help increase vitamin D, and they stabilize blood sugars.

These phytonutrients can also help lower insulin. Lowered insulin helps your liver because high insulin can damage your liver. Coffee has more antioxidants than tea, even green tea, and red wine. Roasting coffee beans increases the antioxidants. But if you grind the beans and expose the grounds to oxygen, you lose a lot of the antioxidants. So it’s best if there’s a short time between grinding it and drinking it.

**There are many positive things about coffee, but there are also a few negatives.**

First, caffeine can stimulate the sympathetic nervous system, responsible for “fight or flight.” It’s like activating your adrenals, causing sleep problems which in turn cause a cascade of health effects. A good idea is to drink just one cup in the morning. If you’re drinking coffee all day and evening, and have fatigue, you’re covering up an underlying problem that needs to be fixed.

**Coffee beans are the most heavily sprayed crop in the world. Choose organic coffee.**

The more caffeine you consume, the more you deplete vitamin B1 (thiamine), calcium and potassium. You may need supplements to replace those.

## Can I Give Butter To My Kids

# Can I give butter to my kids?

It would be a great idea to raise a child on cod liver oil and high-quality grass-fed butter to help support the child’s teeth, heart and bones. Grass-fed butter is a great source of vitamin K2. You can also get vitamin K2 from grass-fed meat and cheese, egg yolks, and fermented vegetables.

Why vitamin K2 is important for infants and children:

- It plays a crucial role in the development of facial bones

- It can help prevent cavities and premature calcification of cartilage end plates

- It protects the heart

- It helps support the structure of the teeth

A mother who breastfeeds gives her child a lot of vitamin K2, while children who are not breastfed are more likely to have a vitamin K2 deficiency. Lactic acid bacteria in the gut can also convert vitamin K1 to K2.

Vitamin K2 activates the function of other fat-soluble vitamins (like vitamin A and vitamin D), which are important for the development of a healthy immune system in a child. Cod liver oil has a great balance of vitamin D and vitamin A.

## Can I Take Melatonin For Sleep On Keto

# Can I take melatonin for sleep on keto?

I’m not recommending taking melatonin–unless you are using it for a specific condition. Your body can make its own melatonin naturally.

It’s true that your melatonin levels will drop with age, but you can support them through your diet and other lifestyle choices.

Here’s how you can improve your melatonin levels:

- Avoid light at night

- Get plenty of sun and vitamin D during the day

- Decrease your exposure to blue light in the evening

- Avoid eating before bed

- Get your glucose under control (low-carb keto diet!)

- Avoid TV before bed

The best foods for improving melatonin are mushrooms, eggs, fish and nuts.

## Is Depression A Disease

# Is depression a disease?

Depression is a mental state. When someone is depressed you can’t take an x-ray to see depression or a blood test to see depression. Depression is subjective. Diseases are objective and they are diagnosed based on some medical test. Depression as an emotion is real and can be caused by many things – like vitamin D deficiency, for example. Also, a lack of sleep can cause chronic fatigue, which can mimic depression.

**\*The above information is not intended for diagnosis. If you have any health concerns you should consult your physician.**

## Could A Racing Mind Indicate A Vitamin Deficiency

# Could a racing mind indicate a vitamin deficiency?

If your adrenal glands are being overworked, that can cause excessive thinking, which means your mind is working to solve problems 24/7. This can be very draining and usually affects your sleep. Social media, cell phones, and texting can all keep your adrenals working, leading to overthinking. Try techniques to reduce stress and overstimulation from electronics, as well as taking vitamins that support your adrenals.

## What Mechanisms Explain How Elevated Cortisol Levels Can Lead To Weight Gain

# What mechanisms explain how elevated cortisol levels can lead to weight gain?

Cortisol increases your energy in stressful situations by converting energy into sugar. However, when this energy isn't used—such as in a sedentary job—it gets stored as fat. Worse, cortisol can convert muscle into sugar, reducing muscle mass. Additionally, cortisol prevents fat burning, making it difficult to achieve ketosis. To manage cortisol effectively, identify and reduce sources of stress. Follow a Healthy Keto® diet and practice intermittent fasting. Ensure you get plenty of vitamin D, vitamin C, and potassium to support overall health.

## What Factors Related To The Menstrual Cycle May Contribute To Hair Loss

# What factors related to the menstrual cycle may contribute to hair loss?

On day 15, when you’re ovulating, you get a huge spike in estrogen. In the next two weeks, you’re going to get a huge spike in progesterone and androgens.

The time of the month you’re losing your hair can give us clues as to which hormone is involved. Most women tend to lose hair during the second half of the menstrual cycle when there is a spike in androgens. But, even a female in menopause may continue to lose their hair to some degree.

**If you’re pre-menopause** and you’re experiencing hair loss in the second half of your cycle, you may need to lower your androgens. The best way to lower your androgens is to lower your insulin. You can lower your insulin by lowering your carbohydrates. You would want to go on the Healthy keto diet and do intermittent fasting.

**If you’re post-menopausal** and your hair is falling out, you may be low in progesterone, androgens, and estrogen. In this situation, taking DHEA may be beneficial. But be sure to only take a small amount (10-30mg a day), or it may have an opposite effect causing hair loss.

What if you’re postpartum and you’re experiencing hair loss because of a severe drop in estrogen? In this case, 10mg of DHEA may help. For PCOS, your androgens are too high. In this situation, you could try doing keto and intermittent fasting, as well as taking inositol.

For a heavy period, you would not want to take DHEA. Instead, you can try taking DIM and get plenty of iron. It’s possible to have a slow thyroid because of an increase in estrogen. In this situation, DIM may be beneficial as well as bile salts and selenium.

If you’re losing your hair after you stopped taking birth control pills, this could be from a decrease in estrogen. Taking inositol may be a great remedy in this case.

**Two additional causes of hair loss to keep in mind are:**

1\. A trace mineral deficiency

2\. A B vitamin deficiency

## What Are The Primary Causes Of A Receding Hairline

# What are the primary causes of a receding hairline?

**There are a couple of reasons:**

One is that you have high levels of something called 5 alpha reductase which is an enzyme that converts testosterone into a more powerful form of testosterone called DHT. DHT can burn out your hair follicles.

Second, you have higher androgens, not necessarily caused by having high levels of 5 alpha reductase, they’re simply higher.
**You can reduce or inhibit 5 alpha reductase by taking zinc, omega 3, and B2. Zinc is the most important element to ensure you get enough of it. And if you think about it, zinc is also important for your immune system. So if you have alopecia, for example, which is an autoimmune condition then zinc is even more important. You’ll also want to add vitamin D.**

## Im Not Hungry On Keto But Still Feeling Weak   Why Is That

# I'm not hungry on keto but still feeling weak - why is that?

One of the best indicators to know if you’re in ketosis is the hunger goes away. But at the same time, you should not have low energy or fatigue on keto. If you’re feeling weak while on keto, it’s likely related to nutrient deficiencies. 

How to fix low energy or feeling weak on the ketogenic diet:

**Muscle weakness** \- Deficiency of vitamin E or sodium

Consume: Seeds, nuts, leafy greens, or a vitamin E complex supplement for a vitamin E deficiency. For low sodium, consume at least 1 tsp. of sea salt per day. 

**Brain Fog** - Insulin resistance 

Consume: MCT oil, and vitamin D

**Fatigue** \- A vitamin B1, vitamin B5, or potassium deficiency 

Consume: Nutritional yeast, potassium, and magnesium (electrolytes, and vegetables).

## What Are Some Unexpected Benefits Of Magnesium

# What are some unexpected benefits of magnesium?

**Magnesium is a very important mineral. Magnesium is in hard water, mineral water, and leafy greens.** Magnesium is not just essential for humans, but for plants too. Chlorophyll is like the blood of a plant, and a magnesium deficiency can inhibit a plant’s ability to make chlorophyll.

Chlorophyll is similar in chemistry to our blood. The magnesium in the chlorophyll causes the leaves of a plant to look green, and the iron in our blood makes it look red. There is a condition called chlorosis in plants caused by a magnesium deficiency. Chlorosis in humans is anemia and is caused by an iron deficiency. But, a person with anemia may even look a little green.

**The unexpected benefits of magnesium:**

1\. It relieves muscle tightness

2\. It boosts energy

3\. It supports vitamin D bioavailability

4\. It helps prevent calcium from depositing in the soft tissues

5\. It can help relieve migraines

6\. It supports your friendly bacteria

7\. It can potentially help reduce paresthesia

8\. It helps counter cortisol

9\. It helps balance the parathyroid hormone

## What Are The Common Reasons For Waking Up At Night

# What are the common reasons for waking up at night?

**Here are 7 reasons why you get up during your sleep:**

1\. High blood sugar: if you’re diabetic or prediabetic and you have high blood sugar you’ll end up peeing more (especially at night) because water attaches itself to the sugar in your body. If you’re new to my channel I put a link below to show you how to fix your blood sugar.

2\. High insulin, which relates to high blood sugar. Insulin stimulates the sympathetic nervous system, better known as fight or flight. Too much stimulation of this system means you can’t hold your bladder, resulting in more frequent urination. So you want to decrease insulin using the same system that fixes blood sugar.

3\. High cortisol. This is the adrenal hormone; the stress hormone. This disrupts the normal sleep cycle ranging from REM sleep to the deep delta wave sleep. You wake up at 2am when you should be in your deepest sleep. Check out the link below to my stress webinar. For now, take vitamin D3.

4\. Consuming coffee or tea; caffeine is a stimulant. Reduce your consumption and drink caffeine only in the morning.

5\. Too much artificial light, especially if you spend a lot of time in front of an LED screen. Put a full spectrum light on your desk. Also, go for a walk to offset all the sitting you do plus get sunlight on your face. Take off your dark glasses and let the light hit your eyes.

6\. Sleep apnea. First, take vitamin B1 in the form of nutritional yeast. And eat a low carb diet. There’s also a condition called lactic acidosis that’s a byproduct of eating too many carbs. It can throw off your pH (see point 7 below). B1 will help.

7\. pH imbalance can affect your sleep, whether your body is too alkaline or too acidic. You won’t be able to absorb minerals like calcium, magnesium, and potassium if your pH is off. You can take apple cider if it's too alkaline, or minerals if too acidic.

## What Foods Should I Consume To Support Healthy Teeth And Gums

# What foods should I consume to support healthy teeth and gums?

Ensuring optimal dental health involves consuming essential vitamins and foods that support teeth and gum health.

Vitamin A helps prevent conditions like gingivitis and periodontitis, while vitamin C supports gum health and prevents issues like loose teeth and bleeding gums.

Vitamin B1 can alleviate nerve pain and toothaches.

Vitamins D, K2, and F work together: D aids in calcium absorption, K2 directs calcium to the teeth, and vitamin F facilitates calcium incorporation into tissues.

Grass-fed butter or ghee and cod liver oil are excellent dietary choices for dental health, providing crucial nutrients like vitamins A, D, and K2.

Fermented vegetables contribute vitamins C and K2 and promote a healthy microbiome that produces B vitamins, complemented by nutritional yeast for additional B vitamin support. These components collectively promote strong teeth and gums while supporting overall oral health.

## How Can I Grow Taller

# How can I grow taller?

To support height increase and promote growth, consider incorporating the following strategies: Ensure adequate intake of trace minerals, particularly zinc found in foods like red meat and shellfish, or through a quality trace mineral supplement. Pituitrophin PMG (SP) can also aid in supporting growth processes.

Prioritize sufficient sleep, as it plays a crucial role in growth hormone production. Avoid phytates, which can inhibit mineral absorption necessary for bone health and growth. Ensure adequate vitamin D3 through regular sunlight exposure, essential for bone development. Adopting a Healthy Keto diet and intermittent fasting regimen can also support overall health and potentially optimize growth processes.
