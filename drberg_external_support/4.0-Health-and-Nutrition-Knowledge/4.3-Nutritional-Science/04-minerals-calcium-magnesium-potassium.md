## Does Magnesium Deficiency Cause Migraines

# Does magnesium deficiency cause migraines?

The link between magnesium levels and migraines in the morning is supported by research suggesting that:

**Magnesium Deficiency and Migraines:** Studies have shown a correlation between low magnesium levels and an increased frequency and severity of migraines.

- Magnesium plays a crucial role in neurotransmitter regulation, blood vessel tone, and nerve function, all of which are implicated in migraine development.  

- **Circadian Rhythm of Magnesium:** Magnesium levels naturally fluctuate throughout the day, being lowest in the morning. This dip in magnesium can trigger migraines in susceptible individuals, explaining why migraines are often more frequent in the morning hours.  

- **Magnesium's Mechanisms in Migraine Prevention:** Magnesium is believed to work in several ways to prevent migraines, including:

    - Regulating neurotransmitter release, such as glutamate, which can trigger migraines.

    - Preventing blood vessel constriction in the brain, which can contribute to migraine pain.  

    - Reducing inflammation, which plays a role in migraine development.  

However, it's important to consult with a healthcare professional if you are experiencing migraines before starting any new supplements, especially if you have underlying health conditions or are taking medications.

## What Is The Reason For Morning Asthma Attacks

# What is the reason for morning asthma attacks?

The correlation between magnesium deficiency and increased asthma attacks in the morning:

1. **Magnesium's Role in Airway Function:** Magnesium acts as a natural bronchodilator, helping to relax the muscles in the airways and improve airflow. When magnesium levels are low, the airways become more constricted, increasing the likelihood of asthma attacks.  

2. **Circadian Rhythm of Magnesium:** Magnesium levels naturally dip in the morning. This coincides with the time when asthma symptoms often worsen, potentially due to factors like increased airway resistance and inflammation overnight. Low magnesium levels in the morning can further exacerbate these issues, triggering or intensifying asthma attacks.

3. **Inflammation:** Magnesium also has anti-inflammatory effects. Deficiency can lead to increased inflammation in the airways, making them more sensitive and reactive, further contributing to asthma attacks.  

Please consult your medical professional on the deficiency of magnesium and asthma.

## What Is The Dawn Phenomenon

# What is the dawn phenomenon?

Magnesium deficiency has been linked to the dawn phenomenon, where blood sugar levels rise abnormally in the early morning hours. This connection highlights the important role magnesium plays in regulating glucose metabolism.

Magnesium influences gluconeogenesis, the process by which the liver produces glucose from non-carbohydrate sources.

In magnesium deficiency, this process can become dysregulated, leading to excessive glucose production, particularly in the morning when insulin sensitivity is naturally lower.  

Magnesium also plays a critical role in insulin sensitivity and action. Insulin receptors on cells require magnesium to function properly. When magnesium is deficient, insulin's ability to signal glucose uptake into cells is impaired, leading to insulin resistance and elevated blood sugar levels.

## What Are The Best And Worst Forms Of Magnesium

# What are the best and worst forms of magnesium?

Magnesium supplements aren't all created equal. Let's break down the different forms, ranking them from least to most effective, so you can make an informed choice.

### The Not-So-Great

1. **Magnesium Oxide:** While common and often pricey, it has a dismal 4% absorption rate, making it the least effective option.

2. **Magnesium Sulfate:** At 10% absorption, it's slightly better but known for its laxative effect. It might offer some superficial muscle relaxation.

### The Middling

3. **Magnesium Orotate:** With 15% absorption, it can penetrate cells for energy boosts, act as an antioxidant, and support DNA health.

4. **Magnesium Taurate:** At 20% absorption, it's good for your heart, blood pressure, and nervous system.

5. **Magnesium Lactate:** A gentler option at 25% absorption, it benefits your cardiovascular system, energy levels, and may be useful for muscle health when applied topically.

6. **Magnesium Citrate:** A solid 30% absorption makes it helpful for preventing kidney stones, improving cardiovascular health, managing blood pressure, and aiding detoxification.

### The Top Performers

7. **Magnesium Malate:** Boasting a 40% absorption rate, it's particularly beneficial for those with chronic fatigue syndrome or fibromyalgia.

8. **Magnesium Threonate:** An impressive 75% absorption makes it a brain booster, enhancing cognitive function and promoting better sleep.

### The Gold Standard

9. **Magnesium Glycinate:** The champion with the highest absorption rate. It's gentle on your stomach, helps prevent muscle spasms, promotes relaxation and sleep, and may even ease migraines without interfering with other minerals.

### Dosage Recommendations

- **Maintenance:** 400 mg of magnesium glycinate at night

- **Therapeutic:** Double the dose (800 mg) and spread it throughout the day

Remember, always consult your healthcare professional before starting any new supplements to ensure they're right for you.

## What Is The Connection Between High Blood Pressure Medication And Diabetes

# What is the connection between high blood pressure medication and diabetes?

Diuretics are commonly used to treat high blood pressure. But, they come with side effects, including an increased risk of developing diabetes.    On the flip side, ace inhibitors, also used to treat high blood pressure, protect against diabetes and lower the risk of diabetes.  I believe the big difference between these two drugs, when it comes to diabetes risk, is what they do to potassium.

Diuretics deplete potassium, and without enough potassium, insulin can't be released very well. A deficiency of insulin can then lead to diabetes. Ace inhibitors increase potassium by helping to prevent the loss of potassium.  So why do we even need a drug—why aren't we just consuming more potassium? Many people support healthy blood pressure and healthy blood sugar levels by taking potassium.

## What Is The Difference Between Potassium Chloride And Potassium Citrate

# What is the difference between Potassium Chloride and Potassium Citrate?

**Elemental Potassium Content:** Potassium chloride generally provides a higher percentage of elemental potassium by weight compared to potassium citrate. This means that for a given weight of the supplement, you get more actual potassium from potassium chloride.

Imagine two glasses of orange juice. One is a small glass of concentrated orange juice, and the other is a large glass of diluted orange juice. While the concentrated juice has more orange flavor per sip, the larger glass might contain the same total amount of orange juice overall.

Similarly, a potassium chloride capsule might have a higher concentration of potassium per pill, but a potassium citrate powder mixed into a larger volume of liquid could provide the same or even more total potassium depending on the amount of powder used.

## This 1 Thing Can Replace Our Entire Medical System

# This 1 Thing Can Replace Our Entire Medical System

Fasting has gained significant attention for its potential to address the root cause of many chronic illnesses: insulin resistance. By abstaining from food for a period, you can effectively "reset" your body's metabolism and improve its sensitivity to insulin.

**How Fasting Works:**

- **Activates Survival Genes:** Fasting triggers survival mechanisms within your body, prompting it to utilize stored fat and ketones for energy instead of relying solely on glucose.

- **Ketosis:** It typically takes around 3 days of fasting to enter ketosis, a metabolic state where your body efficiently burns fat for fuel.

- **Insulin Sensitivity:** Fasting enhances your cells' responsiveness to insulin, allowing for better blood sugar regulation.

- **Cortisol Levels:** Contrary to popular belief, fasting does not elevate cortisol (stress hormone) levels.

**Types of Fasting:**

- **Water Fasting:** Consuming only water during the fasting period.

- **Dry Fasting:** Abstaining from both food and water. Dry fasting may offer additional benefits like accelerated weight loss and enhanced detoxification, but it should be approached with caution and under appropriate guidance.

**Important Considerations:**

- **Listen to Your Body:** Don't force yourself to fast longer than feels comfortable. Pay attention to your body's hunger cues.

- **Nutrient Intake:** If you experience hair loss or menstrual irregularities while fasting, it could indicate a lack of protein. Prioritize high-quality protein sources like grass-fed red meat, which provides essential amino acids, trace minerals, and B vitamins.

- **Essential Minerals:** Ensure adequate intake of sea salt, magnesium (around 400mg), and zinc (around 50mg) to support overall health during fasting.

- **Hydration and Sleep:** Stay well-hydrated (especially during water fasting) and prioritize getting enough sleep.

**Disclaimer:** While fasting can offer significant health benefits, it's crucial to consult with your healthcare provider before starting any fasting regimen, especially if you have any underlying health conditions or are taking medications.

## What Are The Benefits Of Insulin Beyond Glucose Regulation And How Doe 951C18

# What are the benefits of insulin beyond glucose regulation, and how does it support metabolic health and manage certain conditions?

The main reason why the keto diet and intermittent fasting work so well to support a healthy body is that they both help lower insulin. However, insulin has certain benefits. This is where the confusion starts. How can insulin be harmful and also have health benefits?

**Potential health benefits of insulin:**

• It helps lower blood sugar levels

• It supports muscle growth

• It protects against muscle atrophy

• It supports the arteries

• It helps lower LDL cholesterol

• It helps lower blood pressure

• It lowers the production of glucose in the liver

• It supports the absorption of potassium and magnesium

• It suppresses lipolysis

• It is a potent anti-inflammatory

• It has antioxidant properties

• Insulin nasal spray is used to help people who have dementia

• It helps increases testosterone

• It helps lower uric acid

The real problem is with the insulin receptors. When the receptors become resistant, as in insulin resistance, we lose the function of insulin. When someone has insulin resistance, they actually have an insulin deficiency. You may have excess insulin in your blood, but it’s not affecting the receptors. A high level of insulin is what creates insulin resistance. The more you increase insulin, the less the receptors will work.

## What Are The Early Stages Of Potassium Deficiency

# What are the early stages of potassium deficiency?

In its early stages, a potassium deficiency, also known as mild hypokalemia, often manifests as subtle but noticeable changes in how you feel:

- [Muscle Cramps](https://www.drberg.com/blog/taking-electrolytes-yet-still-cramping): One of the initial and noticeable potassium deficiency symptoms is muscle cramping. Muscles rely on the proper balance of electrolytes, particularly potassium, to function smoothly. When blood potassium levels drop, your muscles may start to spasm or feel tight. If you've ever experienced a sudden, painful charley horse in your calf, you've felt a mild form of muscle cramping. These cramps can occur in various muscle groups, including your legs, arms, or even your abdomen.

- [Fatigue](https://www.drberg.com/blog/fatigued-on-keto-and-when-fasting): Potassium is crucial in energy production. It helps convert the food you eat into usable energy your cells can utilize. Low potassium disrupts this energy conversion process, often leaving you feeling drained and lethargic. This lack of energy might manifest as difficulty concentrating or simply feeling less motivated throughout the day.

- [Constipation](https://www.drberg.com/blog/constipation-is-not-just-a-lack-of-fiber): Ever notice how dehydration can back you up? Well, low potassium can have a similar effect on your digestive system. Potassium is involved in muscle contractions that help move food through your digestive tract. Low potassium levels can slow things down, leading to discomfort, bloating, and those dreaded irregular bowel movements we know as constipation.

## What Else Can Decrease My Calcium Levels

# What else can decrease my calcium levels?

While we've covered the essentials of calcium and nutrition, there are other crucial aspects to consider for maintaining optimal bone health.

### **1\. The Importance of Weight-Bearing Exercise**

Just like muscles, bones become stronger with regular exercise. Weight-bearing exercises, in particular, are crucial for building and maintaining bone density. These exercises force your body to work against gravity, stimulating bone-building cells. Aim for at least 30 minutes of weight-bearing exercise most days of the week. Here are some examples:

- Walking: A simple yet effective way to improve bone density, especially for beginners. Brisk walking is ideal.

- Running/Jogging: Provides a higher impact than walking, leading to greater bone strengthening.

- Dancing: A fun and engaging way to incorporate weight-bearing movements.

- Stair Climbing: Excellent for building bone density in the legs and hips.

- Strength Training: Lifting weights or using resistance bands helps build muscle mass, which in turn, supports bone health.

### **2\. The Detrimental Effects of Smoking**

Smoking is harmful to nearly every organ in the body, including your bones. It interferes with calcium absorption and reduces bone density, making bones weaker and more prone to fractures.

If you smoke, quitting is one of the best things you can do for your bone health, as well as your overall well-being.

### **3\. Understanding the Role of Genetics**

While lifestyle choices play a significant role in bone health, genetics also factor in. A family history of osteoporosis or low bone density can increase your risk. If you have such a history, talk to your doctor.

They may recommend bone density screenings earlier than usual to monitor your bone health and discuss preventive measures.

## What Are The Most Important Signs Of Calcium Deficiency

# What are the most important signs of calcium deficiency?

While getting your blood calcium levels checked is a good starting point, this method doesn't tell the complete story.

That’s because standard tests measure total serum calcium, which includes both the free, usable calcium and calcium bound to protein, which your body cannot use efficiently.

To gain a more accurate understanding of your calcium status, ask your healthcare provider for an "ionized calcium" test.

This specific test looks at the amount of readily available, active calcium, painting a clearer picture of potential deficiencies. It can help tailor interventions, whether through diet or in some cases, supplementation to effectively address your needs.

### **Common Signs That You Might Be Low in Calcium**

[Calcium](https://www.drberg.com/blog/calcium-goes-way-beyond-the-bones) is still vital for several bodily functions. Recognizing signs of deficiency can prompt timely intervention:

- Muscle Spasms or Twitches: Calcium plays a critical role in muscle function, so experiencing spasms, cramps, or twitches could signify a deficiency.

- Tetany: Characterized by involuntary muscle contractions, tetany, particularly in the eyelids or arms, can result from low calcium, although other mineral imbalances can also contribute. It highlights the delicate interplay of minerals in your body.

- Numbness or Tingling: Experiencing these sensations around your mouth or in your extremities could point toward a calcium dip. Calcium is crucial for nerve transmission, and these odd sensations could signal impaired nerve function.

- Heart Rate Fluctuations: Calcium contributes to regulating your heartbeat, so experiencing an erratic heart rate might stem from inadequate levels.

- Larynx Spasm: Affecting the vocal cords, low calcium can manifest as hoarseness, a change in your voice, or even a feeling of having a lump in your throat.

## What Are The Most Effective Treatments And Remedies For Alleviating Mi 835A40

# What are the most effective treatments and remedies for alleviating migraine symptoms?

**Understanding Hyponatremia and Migraines**

Hyponatremia is a condition in which the blood has too little sodium. This is important because sodium and potassium work together to create electrical charges that power muscles and nerves. People with migraines often have a mutation that leaves potassium channels in their brain cells stuck open, causing nerve excitation and potential electrical imbalances.

**The Salt Connection**

Some studies suggest that increasing your sodium intake may lessen migraine headaches. This could be because the extra sodium helps restore the balance between sodium and potassium in the brain. If you're prone to migraines, try consuming more salt right before a headache starts (around 4600mg, but start with the standard 2300mg and monitor your reaction).

**Causes of Sodium Deficiency**

Low sodium levels aren't always caused by a lack of salt in your diet. Other potential causes include:

- Addison's disease

- High-carb diets

- Diarrhea or vomiting

- Diuretic medications

- Excessive water consumption

- Blood loss (heavy periods)

- Excessive sweating

- Major burns

**Important Note:** It's always best to consult a doctor for personal advice, especially if you suspect a sodium deficiency or have any underlying health conditions.

## What Is A Good Option For A High Dose Potassium Supplement And What Sh 657Ee2

# What is a good option for a high-dose potassium supplement, and what should be considered when choosing one for effectiveness and safety?

Of course, I'm not biased of my own electrolyte powder, but I think it's pretty high quality. You should try that one.

But it's high potassium, it was a thousand milligrams. You know, you try to buy a potassium supplement, it only comes in 99 milligrams. I mean, why is that per dose? Is it like you'd have to have the whole bottle.

Our bodies need 4,700 per day and that's, it could be more than that, especially if you're adding more salt to your diet. So I think it's an interesting experiment on your body to just see what you would feel like if you actually got 4,700 milligrams of potassium, because potassium is necessary for the sodium-potassium pump that pumps all the nerves in your muscles and your body. So without that, you're gonna be tired.

And this is probably why when people do the electrolyte powders with the potassium, they can go along with exercise as well, because they have more energy.

# Crafting Your Intermittent Fasting Schedule

Intermittent fasting (IF) offers versatile options that can align with your lifestyle. Choosing the right fasting window and incorporating supportive supplements can optimize your IF plan for sustainable results.

**Selecting Your Fasting Window**

Consider your daily routine and preferences when choosing a fasting window:

\- **16/8**: Fast for 16 hours and eat within an 8-hour window, typically skipping breakfast and starting your first meal at lunchtime.

\- **18/6**: Fast for 18 hours with a 6-hour eating window.

\- **20/4**: A more advanced method with a 20-hour fast and a 4-hour eating window, known as the Warrior Diet.

\- **OMAD (One Meal A Day)**: Consume all daily calories in a single meal within a 1-hour window.

Starting with a 16/8 schedule is often advisable for beginners, gradually progressing as your body adapts. The key is to find a plan that is both sustainable and enjoyable.

**Supporting Supplements**

To enhance your fasting experience, consider these supplements:

\- **Electrolytes**: Sodium, potassium, and magnesium help prevent dehydration and maintain electrolyte balance.

\- **Omega-3 Fatty Acids**: Found in fish oil, these support brain health and reduce inflammation.

\- **Probiotics**: Improve gut health and nutrient absorption.

Before adding new supplements, consult with a healthcare professional, especially if you have existing health conditions or are on medication.

By customizing your fasting schedule and supporting it with appropriate supplements, you can maximize the benefits of intermittent fasting and improve overall well-being.

## What Is The Primary Side Effect Of Electrolytes On The Heart

# What is the primary side effect of electrolytes on the heart?

The primary side effect of electrolyte imbalance on the heart is heart arrhythmia. This condition can occur when there is a deficiency of electrolytes such as potassium and magnesium, or an imbalance in calcium levels. Interestingly, conventional treatments often involve medications like diuretics, which can further deplete electrolytes and exacerbate arrhythmias. Similarly, calcium channel blockers, while used to manage heart conditions, can also impact electrolyte balance. This highlights a cycle where the treatment intended to correct the issue can sometimes contribute to its persistence or worsening.

## What Is The Initial And Most Subtle Indicator Of Magnesium Deficiency

# What is the initial and most subtle indicator of magnesium deficiency?

Magnesium deficiency is the most overlooked deficiency because it cannot be detected by a blood test. Sixty percent of magnesium is in the bone, 20% is in the muscle, 19% is in the soft tissue, and 1% is in the blood.

**Neuromuscular excitability, or tetany, is the number 1 earliest sign of a magnesium deficiency. Tetany is a twitching of the muscles, often affecting the left eye.**

Diabetes, high blood pressure, arthritis, osteoporosis, and cardiovascular disease are all associated with low magnesium.

**Here are 22 surprising signs of magnesium deficiency:**

• Anxiety

• Insomnia

• Depression

• Migraines

• Restless legs syndrome

• Muscle cramps

• Fatigue

• Tourette's syndrome

• Oxidative cholesterol

• High homocysteine levels

• High blood pressure

• Calcification of the arteries

• Arrhythmias

• Stroke

• Metabolic syndrome

• Polycystic ovarian syndrome

• Kidney stones

• Higher levels of calcium in the blood

• Inflammation

• Nystagmus

• Asthma

## What Are The Most Effective Methods For Detoxifying The Kidneys From E Ad65Ea

# What are the most effective methods for detoxifying the kidneys from elevated levels of uric acid and oxalates, while also preventing their accumulation?

The kidneys can take a beating and can even regenerate. They are composed of roughly one million tiny filters, which filter your blood. But as you age, you start losing these filters—so it becomes even more important to start eating better and decrease exposure to toxins. The two worst things for your kidneys are sugar and oxalates. It’s crucial to stop consuming sugar and high-carb foods and to start limiting your exposure to high-oxalate foods.

However, consuming cheese or dairy with foods that are high in oxalates, but are otherwise healthy, can help counter kidney damage from oxalates.

The best ways to protect your kidneys:

1\. Consume lemon water every morning

2\. Consume apple cider vinegar mixed in water

3\. Consume 2.5 liters of water a day

4\. Avoid high-oxalate foods or add dairy to high-oxalate foods

5\. Get on the Healthy Keto® diet and do intermittent fasting

6\. Avoid fructose

7\. Avoid consuming high levels of vitamin C

8\. Consume potassium (not for end-stage kidney disease)

9\. Consume plant foods and microgreens

## Is Electrolyte Powder A Sodium Replacement

# Is electrolyte powder a sodium replacement?

**What is an electrolyte?**

\- Electrolyte is an electrically charged mineral that helps several things; pacemaker of the heart, muscles, and the nerve.

\- It is also involved in hydration and fluid volume inside and outside the cells.

When you sweat during exercise, you primarily lose salt or sodium chloride and not potassium, magnesium, or calcium – the electrolyte powder is not a sodium replacement.

**Things that Could Cause a Gap in the Nutrition:**

1\. High Carb Diet

2\. Doesn’t Consume Enough Vegetables

3\. Processed Foods

## Can I Eat What I Crave

# Can I eat what I crave?

If you’re on keto, you’re probably doing it for health reasons or weight loss. But if you’re not on keto, what motivates you to eat?  **It’s dangerous to ask your body what it’s in the mood for because you’re really asking what’s going on with your blood sugars. If your blood sugars are low, your answer will likely be refined carbohydrates.** 

Some people eat to try to raise their mood. Others eat just because there’s food there. It’s best not to have junk food available in your house because if it’s there, you might be more likely to start eating it without even thinking about it. 

Our bodies have a mechanism to crave sodium foods. We do not have a mechanism to crave potassium foods. Our bodies retain salt, but they cannot really retain potassium. This gets people in trouble because they will ask their body what they’re in the mood for, and they will think they want something salty. They will start consuming a lot of sodium and not potassium, which will alter the correct ratio and can cause fluid retention and even more cravings. 

**What to do:**

• When you eat, start with your vegetables first, and then have your salty protein. 

• Find keto-friendly healthy foods that give you a lot of pleasure.

## Why Do I Have A Sudden And Rapid Weight Gain

# Why do I have a sudden and rapid weight gain?

**Sudden changes in weight have nothing to do with losing or gaining fat. Let's say you start keto, and the next day you are four pounds lighter—this is due to fluid loss, not fat loss.**

As your body stores fat in the form of glycogen, you also store water. For every one gram of fat, your body stores three grams of water. High-carb diets cause you to retain even more water because your levels of stored sodium increase. Those with a lot of fluid retention often see the fluid build up around their feet and ankles.

**The best indicator of success on keto is if your cravings are going away—are you less hungry between meals? If you can't go without food for a few hours, then you know there's a lot of room to improve your diet.**

**The best natural diuretics for getting rid of excess fluids are:**

• Ketones

• Dandelion

• Uva Ursi

• Horsetail

• Celery

• Potassium

## What Strategies Can Effectively Reduce Elevated Ammonia Levels In Indi 88Ef86

# What strategies can effectively reduce elevated ammonia levels in individuals with liver cirrhosis?

Ammonia is a byproduct of protein metabolism. Normally, in the digestive tract you break down protein from the stomach that turns into amino acids that are supposed to go through the liver and there are certain byproducts that occur with those amino acids; ammonia and urea. Urea is the less toxic form of ammonia.

**Symptoms of Ammonia**

• Confusion

• Mood Changes

• Personality Changes

• Nerve Damage / Brain Dysfunction

• Comma (Possible)

**Possible Reasons Why Ammonia Buildup in the Body**

1\. Cirrhosis (Scar tissue of the liver)

2\. Hepatitis

3\. Alcohol

4\. Carnitine Deficiency – Carnitine is a protein that is carrier-like that delivers to the mitochondria for energy. So if you have a carnitine deficiency, you can build up too much ammonia.

5\. Dehydration

6\. SIBO – Too much bacteria growing in the small intestine and not in the large.

**What Things You Can Do?**

1\. Start cutting down protein.

2\. Take glutamine (L-glutamine)

3\. High potassium foods (Vegetables)

4\. Chlorophyll (Wheatgrass juice powder)

5\. Probiotics 6. Garlic

7\. Cruciferous

8\. Apple Cider Vinegar

9\. Celery / Celery Juice

## Why Do I Still Have Sweet Cravings On Keto

# Why do I still have sweet cravings on Keto?

**Dr. Berg talks about ketosis and some people still crave sweets even when they start a ketogenic diet.**

1\. You may be in the transition phase and it's going to take more time.

2\. You may need more potassium (this stabilizes blood sugars)

3\. If you enjoy chocolate, consume sugar-free always.

4\. If you crave bread - it means you need more B vitamins (nutritional yeast)

5\. Liver - your liver may be damaged due to many things and this alone can block ketosis.

## What Is Osteoarthritis And What Are The Characteristic Symptoms And Ma 85D392

# What is osteoarthritis, and what are the characteristic symptoms and manifestations of this degenerative joint disease that can impact mobility and quality of life?

Osteoarthritis is a condition where you have degeneration of joints and of the underlying bone. It causes pain and stiffness especially in the hip, knee and thumb joints.

There are a few conditions that can cause osteoarthritis. One of them is similar to rheumatoid arthritis as it was found that there are certain bacteria (that normally live in the mouth) that can go into your joints and damage them.

Additionally if your body is too alkaline, it can also cause osteoarthritis. If your stomach is too alkaline, you will not be able to absorb the calcium that is needed to resolve osteoarthritis.

It has also been found that 75% of people who have insulin resistance (a result of a high- carb diet) also have osteoarthritis. This is because consuming too many carbs and having high amounts of insulin cause inflammation across the body.

## What Is Atrial Fibrillation And How Does It Affect Heart Rhythm And Ov 1613Aa

# What is atrial fibrillation, and how does it affect heart rhythm and overall cardiovascular health?

Atrial fibrillation is when the beats of the heart’s upper chambers—known as the atria—are out of sync with the lower chambers. This causes an erratic and abnormally fast heartbeat. This condition is usually triggered by a magnesium deficiency. It can also be a potassium deficiency. However, it is difficult to determine these mineral differences because of where most of the minerals are located - inside the cell. It is recommended to take a type of magnesium called angstrom, which is 1 million times smaller than other forms.

## What Is The Relationship Between Glycogen Stores And Electrolytes When 9C1781

# What is the relationship between glycogen stores and electrolytes when doing Keto and Intermittent fasting?

**Glycogen is series of glucose molecules linked together as a group. When you have more glycogen, you are going to hold more water. Doing ketogenic diet and intermittent fasting will shrink down glycogen that could cause the symptoms in transitioning from sugar burning to fat burning.**

**Problems of Deplete Minerals:**

• Sodium – Weaker muscles, keto flu, dizziness, low blood pressure

• Potassium – Fatigue, Sleep problems, higher pulse rate. Potassium is needed for energy and also calmness when sleeping.

• Calcium – Cramps

• Magnesium – Sleep problem, cramps, heart rhythm

## What Is Usually The Initial Sign Of Magnesium Deficiency And How Can I 47A793

# What is usually the initial sign of magnesium deficiency, and how can it manifest in individuals?

The first sign of a magnesium deficiency is getting tired more easily when exercising.

**Aside from this symptom, you may also experience:**

• Poor memory

• High blood pressure

• Higher risk of soft tissue calcification

• Poor sleep

• Irritability

• Arrhythmias

• Cramps and tetany

• Tremors

There are over 300 enzymes that depend on magnesium to function. 65% of patients in intensive care are magnesium deficient. It is estimated that over half of the world’s population is low on their RDAs of magnesium. If you’re doing intermittent fasting and you’re low on magnesium, the negative effects can be magnified. Also, keep in mind that 80% of alcoholics are magnesium deficient.

Chelators combine or bind with toxic metals. Additionally, people take EDTA to get rid of calcium plaquing in the arteries and to get rid of kidney stones.

**Benefits:**

- Great detox for toxic metals

• mercury
• aluminium • lead
• iron
• calcium
• others

- Gets rid of calcium plaquing in the arteries and kidney stones

- Powerful antioxidant

- Great for detox

- Supports cardiovascular system

## Can Elevated Insulin Levels Contribute To The Development Of Clogged Arteries

# Can elevated insulin levels contribute to the development of clogged arteries?

Clogged arteries are created due to certain plaques in the blood routes. This can create a lot of difficulty and stress on your body because it lowers the ability of blood to freely move through its channels.

**Myth about cholesterol**

When it comes to clogged arteries, most people focus on cholesterol. They want to lower their cholesterol by eliminating things like fat, butter, eggs and animal meat. I want to go over some additional data that has to do with the chain reaction that occurs before cholesterol enters your arteries.

Not all cholesterol is bad. In fact, your body makes a ton of it--more than 3,000 mg a day. Keep in mind that an egg only contains 300 mg of cholesterol. If your body makes so much, why is it considered bad? It’s not. Every cell wall is made from cholesterol. Hormones, specifically sex hormones, are made from cholesterol.

When your artery gets damaged, cholesterol comes as a band-aid for the damage, creating a plaque along with calcium and fibrin (connective tissue). However, we need to fix the underlying issue, which is this: what is creating the damage to your arteries in the first place? Knowing the cause of the damage, you can resolve the plaques and avoid the clogged-artery condition.

**Cause #1: High amounts of insulin**

Frequent eating and a high-carb diet will cause your insulin to be very high. Insulin is a hormone that has the capacity to cause clogged arteries. This is because insulin creates inflammation in the body, which eventually will result in damaged tissue. If this damage occurs in the arteries, your body will try to heal it using a combination of cholesterol, calcium and fibrin (connective tissue) that creates a plaque.

## Is It Possible To Remedy The Liver Cirrhosis Caused By High Insulin

# Is it possible to remedy the liver cirrhosis caused by high insulin?

If you have high insulin in your body this can cause inflammation and a fatty liver. Inflammation can cause damage to your liver and your body will attempt to heal it, creating scar tissue in your liver. This will result in cirrhosis. Insulin goes too high mainly due to consuming a lot of refined carbs and sugar and due to frequent eating over a long period of time.

**Remedies:**

- Avoid refined carbs and sugar

- Avoid snacking

- Do the Healthy Keto® diet

- Do an intermittent fasting plan

- Do periodic prolonged fasting

- Consume more potassium

**\*We recommend consulting with your doctor before making any dietary changes or before you start taking any new supplements, especially if you have any existing health conditions.**

## Could Calcium Silicate In The Trace Minerals Enhanced Contribute To Th 75Ffd9

# Could calcium silicate in the Trace Minerals Enhanced contribute to the formation of calcium oxalate in the body?

No, calcium silicate in Trace Minerals does not break down into calcium oxalate in the body. Calcium silicate does not release oxalates. Calcium oxalate forms when free calcium ions bind with dietary oxalates. The calcium from the silicate form is unlikely to contribute to this.

## What Is The Most Effective Remedy For Depression

# What is the most effective remedy for depression?

There is an interesting link between BDNF and depression. It’s been found that there is no way to diagnose depression. But, it was also found that people who are depressed have low levels of BDNF. Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) is an important molecule involved in learning and memory.

So an interesting question is how to enhance BDNF. All of the trials delivering BDNF into the central nervous system have failed. So, how can we enhance it naturally?

BDNF is basically a fertilizer for the brain. It helps with nerve growth, nerve differentiation, and the maintenance of the synapse between the nerves.

**Benefits of BDNF:**

- It can help improve learning

- It can help improve long-term memory

- It helps higher thinking

- It helps you think more clearly

- It helps you become more mentally alert

- It can decrease inflammation

- It can increase the absorption of neurotransmitters

**Things to help enhance BDNF and get out of depression:**

- Deep sleep (at least 7 high-quality hours of deep sleep)

- Exercise (the fastest and most effective method of increasing BDNF)

- Sunlight

- Intermittent fasting and periodic prolonged fasting

- Healthy Keto®

- Avoiding sugar

- Magnesium

## Can I Add Carrots To My Salad On Keto

# Can I add carrots to my salad on keto?

Yes in moderate amounts.

**What is the glycemic index of carrots?**

It’s 72, which is high.

**What is the glycemic index?**

It’s a scale of carbohydrates and how fast each carbohydrate will raise your blood sugar. Below 55 is low, above 70 is high.

But, we need to look at the whole picture.

The glycemic load is the concentration of carbohydrates in a food. The glycemic load will take into consideration the fiber, as well.

The calculation for glycemic load is:

The glycemic index multiplied by the number of carbs divided by 100. Less than 10 would be low, over 21 would be high.

**For carrots:**

72 multiplied by 4 g divided by 100 = 2.88 (very low)

Even though carrots are high on the glycemic index, they have a lot of fiber which inhibits the glycemic reaction.

But, different variables, like taking the carrot juice out of the carrot fiber, or cooking the carrots, can raise the glycemic index.

Overall, are carrots healthy? Yes.

Are carrots one of the keto-friendly vegetables? Yes. 

Can I eat corn on keto? No, due to the high carbohydrate content.

Corn nutritional profile:
Potassium 476 mg
Carbohydrates 123 g
Sugar 1 g
Protein 16 g

## What Are The Potential Consequences Of Straying From The Ketogenic Diet

# What are the potential consequences of straying from the ketogenic diet?

When you have a cheat meal and you eat carbs, you spike insulin which then reacts to store glucose. You end up with a low blood sugar situation. This is when hunger sets in, the cravings start, and other negative effects like anxiety happen.

Cheating on keto can kick you out of fat burning for 1 to 3 days.

Of course, when you eat carbs you will feel better, but not for very long. Soon after the carbs, you’re left wanting more and more. By eating carbs you’re also depleting a lot of essential nutrients.

How to recover from a cheat day on keto:

- Drink apple cider vinegar with water

- Start fasting

- Exercise

- Take potassium and sodium

- Consume B vitamins

## What Are The Most Reliable Predictors Of A Heart Attack

# What are the most reliable predictors of a heart attack?

Calcium and cholesterol act as band-aids to help repair the artery. But this is late on the chain of events after inflammation and after high insulin. High insulin starts this chain of events in place with the eventual hardening of your arteries, high blood pressure, and plaquing.

The coronary artery feeds the heart muscle blood and if this muscle does not get its oxygen, then it cramps and you get a heart attack. A simple test (CAC) costing under $100 and taking 2 seconds, can give you valuable feedback on your past lifestyle and score things for you. Reducing insulin with healthy ketosis and intermittent fasting is the first action to start with since high insulin triggered this problem in the first place.

**\*The above information is not intended for diagnosis. If you have any health concerns you should consult your physician.**

## What Are The Most Common Mistakes That People Make On Intermittent Fasts

# What are the most common mistakes that people make on intermittent fasts?

Intermittent fasting provides a ton of health benefits. But some common intermittent fasting mistakes could cause it to be more difficult than it should be. For example, starting to quick and fasting for too long instead of slowly adjusting your eating window will cause many people to quit. Intaking more potassium, B vitamins and trace minerals can help with this.

Overindulging in carbs during an eating window will also make fasting more difficult as it spikes your insulin levels. Not eating enough nutrients or consuming low-quality ingredients during your eating window will also ruin your fasting experience. Finally, not consuming enough fat during your meals causes you to feel much hungrier during your fast, and can make you want to quit.

## Are Celery And Nut Butter Good On Keto

# Are celery and nut butter good on Keto?

Absolutely, yes! Celery and nut butter can be a good alternative to salad for some people. It’s hard for some people to consume the amount of salad that they need, but eating celery with peanut butter is easier. 

The peanut butter or nut butter should be organic and shouldn’t have any added sugar. There also shouldn’t be any extra oils in the peanut butter other than peanut oil. If you do choose celery with peanut butter instead of salad, you may want to consume a good amount of it.  Celery is low carb, but high fiber. Fiber is a carb, but it doesn’t affect your blood sugar. 

**A few celery nutrition facts:**

• Starch—0 

• Potassium (per cup of celery)—262mg

• Sodium (per cup of celery)— 80mg

**A few benefits of celery with nut butter:**

1\. An alternative to salad

2\. It can help pH and reduce the risk of gout

3\. It can help reduce hunger (because of the fat in the nut butter)

4\. It can help lower stress

## What Strategies Can Ensure Sufficient Potassium Intake On A Carnivore  81977C

# What strategies can ensure sufficient potassium intake on a carnivore diet, given its inherent dietary restrictions?

You need 4700 mg of potassium each day, more than any other mineral.

Potassium is important for the sodium-potassium pump present in all of your cells, which allows the contraction and relaxation of your nerves.

Too much potassium is known as hyperkalemia, and too little is known as hypokalemia. Symptoms of high potassium include diarrhea, muscle pain, and muscle numbness. Symptoms of low potassium include constipation, muscle cramps, and fatigue.

Potassium is vital for exercise performance. If you don’t have enough, you’ll probably feel weak or tired. One of the causes of low potassium is low magnesium.

Kidney disease can cause high potassium. If the kidney is not functioning properly, it won’t be able to get rid of potassium. It’s very rare to develop too much potassium in the blood from dietary intake.

Blood pressure medications or side effects of an adrenal condition known as Addison's can also cause high potassium.

Diuretics and steroids can cause low potassium. Surgeries and injuries can also cause low potassium.

The following vegetables are some of the best sources of potassium:

•1 cup of beet leaves 1300 mg

•1 cup of Swiss chard 900 mg

•1 cup spinach 840 mg

•1 avocado 500-700 mg

•1 cup of beets 520 mg

•1 cup of salad 350-500 mg

Bananas contain around 300 mg of potassium but have too much sugar.

Here are some of the best sources of potassium on the carnivore diet:

•1 cup of bone broth 500 mg

•3 ½ oz beef 350 mg

•3 ½ oz octopus 650 mg

•3 oz salmon 300 mg

•1 large egg 63 mg

•3 oz beef liver 125 mg

•3 oz chicken 300 mg

## Can I Diagnose Magnesium Deficiency With A Blood Test

# Can I diagnose magnesium deficiency with a blood test?

Magnesium deficiency is notoriously difficult to diagnose accurately. Only about 1% of the body's magnesium is present in the blood, while the majority is stored within cells, bones, and muscles.

Therefore, standard blood tests, which measure serum magnesium levels, often fail to reflect an individual's true magnesium status. Even if blood levels appear normal, a person may still be deficient at the cellular level.

This difficulty in assessment leads to a significant underdiagnosis of magnesium deficiency, even though it is believed to be quite prevalent.

## What Part Of Day Is The Magnesium Lowest And Highest

# What part of day is the magnesium lowest and highest?

Magnesium levels do exhibit a natural ebb and flow throughout the day, following a circadian rhythm.

Typically, magnesium levels tend to be highest in the evening and lowest in the morning. This pattern is thought to be linked to the body's natural sleep-wake cycle and hormonal fluctuations.  

- **Evening:** Magnesium levels rise in the evening, promoting relaxation and preparing the body for sleep. Magnesium helps to calm the nervous system and regulate the production of melatonin, a sleep-inducing hormone.  

- **Morning:** Magnesium levels are lowest in the morning, coinciding with the body's natural wake-up process. This decrease in magnesium may contribute to increased alertness and energy levels.

Understanding this natural fluctuation in magnesium levels can be helpful in managing magnesium intake and optimizing its benefits. For example, taking a magnesium supplement in the evening may help promote relaxation, while taking it in the morning might not be as effective.

It's important to note that individual variations in magnesium levels can occur, and factors like stress, exercise, and diet can also influence magnesium levels.

## Does Chlorophyll Contain Magnesium

# Does chlorophyll contain magnesium?

Magnesium is indeed a central component of chlorophyll, the pigment that gives plants their green color. In plants, magnesium deficiency manifests as a loss of green coloration, often appearing as yellowing or bleaching of the leaves. This is because without sufficient magnesium, the plant cannot produce enough chlorophyll to maintain its vibrant green hue.

While it would be convenient if humans also turned green to signal magnesium deficiency, our bodies unfortunately don't work that way. We have more subtle signs and symptoms, like muscle cramps, fatigue, headaches, and irregular heartbeat, which can make it challenging to detect a deficiency early on.

That's why it's important to be aware of the risk factors for magnesium deficiency, such as certain medications, digestive issues, or poor dietary intake, and to consider getting your magnesium levels checked if you experience any concerning symptoms.

## Is Calcium Important For The Heart

# Is calcium important for the heart?

Maintaining calcium balance is crucial for heart health. Medications for various heart conditions, particularly arrhythmia, often target calcium levels by either reducing excess calcium or indirectly controlling it through increased magnesium levels. This highlights the importance of magnesium in maintaining healthy calcium balance, crucial for preventing and addressing heart problems.

- **Calcium balance is crucial for heart health**: Calcium plays a vital role in heart muscle contraction. However, too much or too little calcium can disrupt the heart's electrical signals, leading to arrhythmias (irregular heartbeats) and other heart problems.

- **Medications target calcium levels**: Many heart medications, especially those for arrhythmias, work by influencing calcium levels. Some directly reduce calcium influx into heart cells, while others indirectly control it by affecting other ions like magnesium.

- **Magnesium's role**: Magnesium is important for maintaining calcium balance. It helps regulate calcium channels in cells, influencing how much calcium enters and leaves.

In conclusion, maintaining the right balance of calcium is essential for a healthy heart.

**Important Note:** It's always best to consult with a healthcare professional for any specific questions or concerns regarding heart health, medications, and mineral balance.

## Does Magnesium Work With Calcium

# Does magnesium work with calcium?

Magnesium plays a critical role in regulating calcium and maintaining proper muscle and nerve function.  

Here's how magnesium influences calcium and overall muscle health:

- **Calcium Channel Regulation:** Magnesium helps control the flow of calcium ions in and out of cells, including muscle cells. If magnesium levels are low, calcium can flood into the cells, leading to overstimulation and muscle contractions (like eye twitching).  

- **Parathyroid Hormone Regulation:** Magnesium is needed for the proper function of the parathyroid glands, which regulate calcium levels in the blood. Low magnesium may lead to impaired parathyroid function, potentially contributing to calcium imbalances.  

- **Muscle Relaxation:** Magnesium acts as a natural muscle relaxant, helping to counterbalance the stimulating effects of calcium. Adequate magnesium levels promote smooth muscle function and reduce the likelihood of spasms and twitches.  

If you suspect a magnesium deficiency, it's important to consult with your doctor to discuss appropriate supplementation.

## How Does Magnesium Intake Affect Sleep

# How does magnesium intake affect sleep?

Magnesium Deficiency and its Effects:

- **Magnesium controls sodium:** Magnesium helps regulate sodium levels in the body.

- **Sodium deficiency & cortisol:** Low sodium can trigger an increase in cortisol (stress hormone), affecting sleep and overall adrenal health.

- **Salt for sleep:** Consuming a bit more salt, particularly sea salt, in the evening can help regulate cortisol, promoting better sleep.

- **Healthy salt intake:** Choose whole foods like tomatoes with a sprinkle of salt, or even just a small amount of sea salt with water, rather than processed snacks high in unhealthy sodium.

**Key takeaway:** Magnesium deficiency can indirectly affect cortisol levels by impacting sodium regulation. Adequate salt intake, especially in the evening, can help improve sleep and adrenal function. However, it's important to focus on healthy sources of salt and avoid processed foods.

---

## Can I Take Calcium And Magnesium Together

# Can I take calcium and magnesium together?

Generally, it's **not recommended** to take magnesium and calcium supplements at the same time.

Here's why:

- **Competition for Absorption:** Magnesium and calcium compete for the same absorption pathways in your gut. Taking them together can lead to decreased absorption of one or both minerals.  

- **Potential Imbalance:** If you're already deficient in one mineral, taking them together could further exacerbate the imbalance.

However, there are nuances to consider:

- **Specific Needs:** Some individuals might benefit from taking both supplements if they have deficiencies in both minerals. In such cases, it's important to consult a healthcare professional to determine the appropriate dosage and timing.

- **Timing:** If you need to take both supplements, consider spacing them out by a few hours to minimize competition for absorption.

**Overall, the best approach is to:**

- **Talk to your doctor or a registered dietitian:** They can assess your individual needs and provide personalized recommendations.

- **Prioritize dietary sources:** Whenever possible, try to get these minerals from whole foods. Magnesium-rich foods include leafy greens, nuts, seeds, and whole grains. Calcium-rich foods include dairy products and leafy greens

## How Can I Get Enough Potassium On A Carnivore Diet

# How can I get enough potassium on a carnivore diet?

Potassium is important for the sodium-potassium pump present in all of your cells, which allows the contraction and relaxation of your nerves. Too much potassium is known as hyperkalemia, and too little is known as hypokalemia. Symptoms of high potassium include diarrhea, muscle pain, and muscle numbness. Symptoms of low potassium include constipation, muscle cramps, and fatigue. Potassium is vital for exercise performance. If you don’t have enough, you’ll probably feel weak or tired. One of the causes of low potassium is low magnesium.

Kidney disease can cause high potassium. If the kidney is not functioning properly, it won’t be able to get rid of potassium. It’s very rare to develop too much potassium in the blood from dietary intake.

Blood pressure medications or side effects of an adrenal condition known as Addison's can also cause high potassium.

Diuretics and steroids can cause low potassium. Surgeries and injuries can also cause low potassium.

Here are some of the best sources of potassium on the carnivore diet:

•1 cup of bone broth 500 mg

•3 ½ oz beef 350 mg

•3 ½ oz octopus 650 mg

•3 oz salmon 300 mg

•1 large egg 63 mg

•3 oz beef liver 125 mg

•3 oz chicken 300 mg

## How To Prevent Dental Plaque From Forming

# How to prevent dental plaque from forming?

Dental plaque is a biofilm of microbes. A biofilm is a calcium shell built to protect a group of microbes. Plaque is one of the primary causes of gingivitis, bad breath, and tooth decay. You can brush and floss regularly and still get plaque! Your mouth contains the second-largest group of microbes in your body. The majority of these microbes are known as commensal, so they’re not necessarily friendly but also not unfriendly. If you kill them, you could end up with a candida infection or oral thrush.

Plaque develops when this friendly relationship turns into a pathogenic relationship. Dental plaque biofilms can develop under stress! Poor diet, sugar consumption, smoking, alcohol, and antibiotics can also contribute to dental plaque formation. Certain chemicals can mimic antibiotics in the mouth. Ironically, chlorhexidine, the main chemical in mouthwash, mimics antibiotics in the mouth. It also increases acidity and the risk of tooth decay.

Fluoride is in the majority of toothpastes and our water supply. It’s been around for 60 years, but there have never been any randomized controlled trials on fluoride in our water. Fluoride is not controlled by the FDA, CDC, EPA, or the American Dental Association—it's controlled by a private entity. It’s best to filter your water to remove fluoride. You’ll want to get the good microbes back into your mouth to remove dental plaque.

Consume probiotic-rich foods like kimchi, sauerkraut, and kefir.

If you chew gum, make sure to choose xylitol gum.

## What Are Some Unexpected Benefits Of Iodine

# What are some unexpected benefits of iodine?

Iodine is highly antiestrogenic. Estrogen dominance increases the risk of cancer, especially in the breast, ovary, and uterus. Iodine causes cancer cells to self-destruct. Iodine strengthens the thyroid, which improves your overall health. It also strengthens the immune system and reduces inflammation.

Iodine is also vital for a healthy pregnancy. Iodine is considered a halogen, so other halogens like bromide and fluoride compete with iodine in the body. Increasing your iodine intake can help detox these other halogens. Try drinking water with unrefined sea salt for several days, then begin taking Lugol’s iodine solution—a mixture of two different types of iodine. Take this solution for about five days, then take two days off.

Also, consume between 3 and 9 grams of vitamin C, 400 mg of magnesium, 100 mg of selenium, and the complete B-complex to detox these other halogens completely. If you have hyperthyroidism, do not take iodine.

Just because you’re allergic to shellfish does not mean you are allergic to iodine.

Goitrogenic foods like cruciferous vegetables and lima beans block iodine—but if you regularly consume sea kelp, it counters any bad effects. High amounts of iodine can be beneficial for respiratory viruses. Iodine also binds with mercury and aluminum, helping rid the body of toxic metals.

## Is Raw Milk Safe For Consumption

# Is raw milk safe for consumption?

Many people believe that raw milk is the number one cause of pathogens in dairy, but is it the raw milk itself causing the problem, or is it contaminated milk? It's important to remember that just because something is pasteurized doesn't automatically make it safe. It's also important to understand that E. coli is not just found in raw milk but can be present in pasteurized milk, too. In fact, we all have E. coli bacteria in our gut right now, which helps with digestion. The problem arises when certain strains of E. coli become pathogenic due to unsanitary conditions on the farm where the milk is produced.

This is why knowing where you're getting your dairy products from is crucial, and ensuring that the farm follows strict hygiene protocols. If proper precautions are taken and the farm is clean, raw milk can be a beneficial option. One of the main benefits of consuming raw milk and raw milk cheese is that they contain enzymes that aid digestion. For example, lactase helps break down lactose (milk sugar) making it easier to digest for those intolerant to lactose. Raw dairy products also contain probiotic-friendly bacteria that support our immune system and gut health.

Research has shown that children who consume raw milk have lower incidences of asthma, allergies, ear infections, and respiratory infections than those who consume pasteurized milk. Choosing high-quality raw dairy products from grass-fed cows also provides additional benefits, such as higher levels of essential minerals, including calcium, phosphorus, magnesium, and conjugated linoleic acid (CLA), which can aid in weight loss and have anti-inflammatory effects. Of course, it's important to research and purchase grass-fed raw dairy products from a reputable source that prioritizes cleanliness.

## What Are The Benefits Of Rice Water For Hair

# What are the benefits of rice water for hair?

Rice water contains B vitamins and amino acids essential for the hair. Fermented rice water contains pitera, a byproduct of fermentation often used in skin care. Pitera helps brighten the hair and also helps with dandruff and itchiness. Fermented rice water contains lactic acid, which decreases dullness and frizziness. It also contains magnesium and selenium. Fermented rice water increases nitric oxide, which helps bring oxygen to the hair's root.

To make fermented rice water, combine 2 cups of organic rice in a bowl with 4 cups of water. Massage the rice with water and drain. Add 2 cups of water to the wet rice and allow the mixture to sit at room temperature for 2 hours. Strain the liquid into a glass jar and cover lightly. After 48 hours, cover your fermented rice water with a lid and store it in the refrigerator. The cold temperature will slow down bacterial growth. To use fermented rice water for your hair, apply it to your hair and scalp, leave it on for 20 minutes, and then rinse. Do this twice per week for hair growth and healthier hair. Fermented rice water helps repair the hair and puts beneficial microbes back into the hair. It can also be used on your face!

## Can Magnesium Deficiency Cause Eye Twitching And How Does It Affect Ne C451Cc

# Can magnesium deficiency cause eye twitching, and how does it affect neuromuscular function?

Magnesium plays a crucial role in muscle and nerve function.

When magnesium levels are low, your muscles and nerves can become overexcited, leading to involuntary muscle contractions or spasms. This can manifest as eye twitching, also known as eyelid myokymia.  

Magnesium helps regulate calcium levels, which are also important for muscle function. Low magnesium levels can lead to an influx of calcium into muscle cells, causing them to contract more easily. This can contribute to eye twitching and other muscle cramps and spasms.  

If you experience persistent eye twitching, you should speak to your healthcare professional for guidance on whether magnesium supplementation would be appropriate.

## What Are The Key Benefits Of Vitamin C And How Does It Support Immune  330E7F

# What are the key benefits of vitamin C, and how does it support immune function and antioxidant activity?

Heart attacks are the number one cause of death worldwide, so it makes sense to discover the cardiovascular health benefits of vitamin C. There’s a condition called atherosclerosis, or hardening of the arteries. Sometimes people believe it’s caused by consuming too much cholesterol, but it’s not. Your body makes its own cholesterol in large amounts. It may show up to heal damage to a blood vessel, but it’s not the cause.

The cause of damage to an artery is structure weakness in the blood vessel itself. The innermost lining of the artery has what are called endothelial cells composed of collagen, and they need vitamin C to stay strong. Vitamin C is a cofactor for collagen production and vascular smooth muscle. You have muscles around your arteries that help them contract and relax, so it’s critical to maintain their elasticity. Yet, for example, insulin can cause your arteries to thicken and harden.

High insulin, which causes insulin resistance, is one of the key factors that causes vitamin C deficiency. There are nearly 500 clinical trials showing that vitamin C supplementation leads to an improvement in endothelial function. If the arterial wall gets damaged, your body sends cholesterol, calcium, and protein to repair the damage by forming a clot. Vitamin C also helps keep the clot from breaking off and causing a stroke or heart attack.

Classic signs of vitamin C deficiency are scurvy and fragile blood vessels. How do you become deficient? Well, by developing insulin resistance, and poor eating habits; specifically not eating enough vegetables, smoking, taking medications, and drinking alcohol.

I urge you to consume foods high in vitamin C, including bell peppers, cabbage, sauerkraut, and leafy greens. Nearly all vegetables have vitamin C.

Now you know the cardiovascular health benefits of vitamin C!

## Is Calcium Supplementation Considered An Essential Component In The Ma 29473F

# Is calcium supplementation considered an essential component in the management and prevention of osteoporosis and osteopenia?

**Calcium supplementation carries risks, especially for those with osteoporosis or osteopenia.** While calcium is essential for bone health, research suggests excess calcium intake (especially from supplements) can increase the risk of heart attacks and strokes. One notable study found that people taking over 1400 mg of calcium daily had a significantly higher risk of heart attack. Additionally, calcification in arteries is a common issue, and excess calcium does not automatically strengthen bones.

The body maintains a delicate calcium balance. Too much intracellular calcium can lead to cell death. This highlights the importance of regulating calcium levels rather than simply increasing intake.

**Vitamin C** may offer a safer alternative for supporting bone health. Studies suggest that higher doses of vitamin C (at least 6000 mg daily) could improve bone density. Vitamin C may help suppress osteoclasts (cells that break down bone) and promote calcium absorption into bones.

## Bloating   The Ultimate Indicator Of The Right Diet

# Bloating - The Ultimate Indicator of the Right Diet

Have you ever felt like a balloon ready to pop after a big meal or constantly battling the urge to unbutton your jeans? You're not alone. Digestive woes affect a whopping 70% of us, but the good news is that gut health is the key to easing much of this discomfort.

Think of your gut health journey as a puzzle where everything from diet to exercise plays a role. Even seemingly innocent habits like drinking through a straw or consuming dairy can trigger bloating.

Let's explore why certain foods make us feel like we've swallowed a balloon and uncover dietary changes that offer relief. Say goodbye to nights spent on the couch fighting discomfort and hello to a more comfortable you.

The small intestine is your body's unsung hero, breaking down food and absorbing nutrients. Its vast surface area, covered in villi and microvilli, ensures you get the most out of every bite. This intricate design is essential for transforming proteins, fats, and carbs into usable energy.

Your gut bacteria are also crucial players, assisting in breaking down food that your enzymes alone can't handle. A healthy gut microbiome, fueled by fiber-rich foods, is a powerhouse for overall well-being.

But what affects your small intestine's health? Processed foods, seed oils, synthetic starches, and sugars are like unwanted guests, causing inflammation and damage. These troublemakers can disrupt your gut's delicate balance.

Small Intestinal Bacterial Overgrowth (SIBO) is another culprit. It's like an overcrowded party where microbes end up in places they shouldn't be, leading to excessive bloating and fermentation. If you're constantly battling bloat, SIBO might be to blame.

Your diet is your gut's best friend. Fiber, found in abundance in salads, is essential for healthy digestion and stool quality. Gradually increasing fiber intake can transform sluggishness into lightness and energy.

Variety is also key to gut health. By diversifying your plant intake, you introduce new microbes that enrich your gut's ecosystem. Even occasional fasting can give your digestive system a break, promoting microbial diversity and reducing inflammation.

Digestive health isn't just about avoiding discomfort; it's about overall well-being. Your nervous system and colon are interconnected, so nourishing meals are essential for maintaining balance. Magnesium-rich leafy greens are natural peacekeepers, preventing colon spasms.

Nutrients like magnesium, B vitamins, and zinc are vital for nerve function and repair, supporting a happy gut and a happier you. Simple dietary tweaks, like adding spinach to your smoothie or choosing whole grains, can significantly impact your digestive health.

Your body often sends signals about its needs through bloating, constipation, or floating stool. These signs can indicate potential issues with your gallbladder, pancreas, or overall digestion. Bloating might be a whisper from dairy products or a shout from carbonated drinks. Stool quality, whether floating or hard, hints at possible malabsorption or fiber deficiency.

These signs are your body's way of communicating. Listen to them and adjust your diet accordingly. By avoiding trigger foods and making necessary changes, you can say goodbye to stomach pain and hello to improved gut health.

Boosting stomach acid is another key to better digestion. Betaine hyaluronic chloride can help increase stomach acid levels, leading to easier digestion, better nutrient absorption, and a stronger defense against harmful bacteria. However, consult a healthcare professional before making significant changes.

Remember, gut health is a journey, not a destination. It's about finding balance and listening to your body. By making informed choices, incorporating fiber-rich foods, embracing variety, and supporting your stomach acid, you can pave the way to a happier, healthier gut and a more vibrant you.

## Are Dietary Supplements Essential For Maintaining Health If A Person I Bbb04C

# Are dietary supplements essential for maintaining health if a person is already healthy and following a balanced diet?

**What Does "Healthy" Really Mean?**

You might think you're healthy if you're not taking medications or visibly overweight. But true health goes deeper – it's about boundless energy, deep sleep, balanced digestion, zero inflammation, and strong adrenal function. Honestly, I haven't met many people who fit that description perfectly! We all have our own health struggles.

**Why Supplements Matter, Even for the "Healthy"**

Even if you feel great, our modern world makes it tough to get all the nutrients you need from food alone. American soil is often depleted, leaving our fruits and vegetables lacking compared to those grown in other parts of the world. Unless you were raised on food sourced from incredibly rich soil, that's a whole different story.

**Your Past Shapes Your Present**

Your history influences your current health – your past diet, stress levels, and exercise habits. Supplements can be crucial in supporting those weak links, which often show up as digestive problems, adrenal fatigue, inflammation, or sleep issues.

**Detox and the Power of Food (and Supplements)**

True detoxification requires a ton of vegetables, especially the cruciferous kind. But most of us don't eat the huge quantities needed to hit our daily nutrient targets. Think about it – do you consistently eat seven to ten cups of high-quality veggies to get your 4,700mg of potassium? That's where my supplements come in – they fill the gaps and bolster those areas where you might need the most support.

## How Can I Optimize My Diet For Better Magnesium Intake

# How can I optimize my diet for better magnesium intake?

To ensure adequate magnesium intake, it's best to focus on a diet rich in magnesium-dense whole foods. While supplements can be beneficial, dietary changes should be the first approach.

**Top Dietary Sources of Magnesium:**

Excellent sources include leafy greens like Swiss chard and kale, nuts, seeds, legumes, and whole grains. Avocados, dark chocolate, and fatty fish such as salmon and mackerel also provide substantial magnesium.

When selecting grains, opt for minimally processed varieties like quinoa, buckwheat, and oats, which offer higher magnesium levels than refined grains.

**Improving Magnesium Absorption:**

Be mindful that phytates in grains can inhibit magnesium absorption. Techniques like soaking, sprouting, or fermenting grains can enhance bioavailability. Additionally, while spinach is rich in magnesium, its high oxalate content may hinder absorption. Lower-oxalate greens like Swiss chard and kale are better options for maximizing magnesium intake.

## Whats The Worst Food For My Teeth

# What's the worst food for my teeth?

Our diet plays a crucial role in maintaining our overall health, including the health of our teeth and gums. Certain foods can lead to tooth enamel erosion, causing dental problems such as cavities, decay, and sensitivity.

**Here are some of the worst foods you should avoid for your teeth:**

• Diet soda

• Candy

• Powdered starches

• Liquid sugar containing high-fructose corn syrup

• Soda with phosphoric acid

• Gummy bears and caramels

But out of all these, the worst food for your teeth is not sugar but citric acid!

**Citric acid is a common ingredient in many processed foods and drinks, including fruit juices, diet sodas, and even some toothpaste. Despite being found naturally in fruits like lemons and limes, the citric acid used in processed products is often synthetically made. Citric acid is a powerful calcium chelator, which means it binds with calcium and pulls it out of teeth. This can lead to erosion and demineralization of teeth, causing them to weaken and become more susceptible to cavities.**

The pH of citric acid is also a contributing factor. While the ideal pH in the mouth is slightly above 7 (neutral or slightly alkaline), citric acid has a lower pH of around 3 to 6, making it even more damaging. The worst type of citric acid for teeth is trisodium citrate, also known as sodium citrate. It's commonly found in many processed products and is a major contributor to tooth erosion.

**So what can you do to protect your teeth from the harmful effects of citric acid?**

• Rinse your mouth with water after consuming anything

• Check labels carefully and opt for products without synthetic citric acid

• Use toothpaste that does not contain citric acid, or make your own at home using natural ingredients

## What Natural Remedies Can Effectively Alleviate Heartburn Acid Reflux  E2Afbc

# What natural remedies can effectively alleviate heartburn, acid reflux, or GERD without the use of medication?

**We're told that the cause of acid reflux, heartburn, and GERD is too much acid. But, I've found that rather than the overproduction of acid, these issues are typically caused by an underproduction of acid.** Two main conditions cause low stomach acid: hypochlorhydria and achlorhydria. Symptoms of both these conditions include acid reflux, heartburn, and GERD. Hydrochloric acid is there to help you break down food, absorb minerals and vitamins, and protect against pathogens. A deficiency in hydrochloric acid can lead to a myriad of health concerns. One of the side effects of antacids or other acid-suppressing medications is a loss of stomach acid. This can temporarily cause someone to feel better but can lead to other health issues.

**Top causes of low stomach acid:**

• Hypothyroidism

• Poor diet

• A suppressed immune system

• Antacids

• Low-salt diets

• Potassium deficiency

• Zinc deficiency

• Iodine deficiency

• Eating too frequently

**Betaine hydrochloride** is the best natural remedy for heartburn, GERD, and acid reflux. However, you shouldn't take it if you have an ulcer, and don't take betaine hydrochloride on an empty stomach. Consuming the Healthy Keto diet® and doing intermittent fasting may also be beneficial.

## How To Prevent Dental Plaque Formation

# How to prevent dental plaque formation?

**Dental plaque is a biofilm of microbes. A biofilm is a calcium shell built to protect a group of microbes. Plaque is one of the primary causes of gingivitis, bad breath, and tooth decay. You can brush and floss regularly and still get plaque!**

Your mouth contains the second-largest group of microbes in your body. The majority of these microbes are known as commensal, so they’re not necessarily friendly but also not unfriendly. If you kill them, you could end up with a candida infection or oral thrush. Plaque develops when this friendly relationship turns into a pathogenic relationship. Dental plaque biofilms can develop under stress! Poor diet, sugar consumption, smoking, alcohol, and antibiotics can also contribute to dental plaque formation.

Certain chemicals can mimic antibiotics in the mouth. Ironically, chlorhexidine, the main chemical in mouthwash, mimics antibiotics in the mouth. It also increases acidity and the risk of tooth decay. Fluoride is in the majority of toothpastes and our water supply. It’s been around for 60 years, but there have never been any randomized controlled trials on fluoride in our water. Fluoride is not controlled by the FDA, CDC, EPA, or the American Dental Association—it's controlled by a private entity. It’s best to filter your water to remove fluoride.

You’ll want to get the good microbes back into your mouth to remove dental plaque. Consume probiotic-rich foods like kimchi, sauerkraut, and kefir. If you chew gum, make sure to choose xylitol gum.

## Risks Associated With Over Alkalization

# Risks Associated with Over-Alkalization

## **Risks Associated with Over-Alkalization**

Drinking too much alkaline water can lead to a condition known as [alkalosis](https://www.drberg.com/blog/what-is-alkalosis). You may experience muscle spasms and abnormal sensations when your body is overly alkaline. But it doesn't stop there.

### **Hypochlorhydria or Achlorhydria - Consequences of Over-Alkalization**

If the stomach becomes excessively alkaline, conditions like hypochlorhydria or achlorhydria can develop. This affects protein digestion and mineral absorption negatively. Moreover, it also increases allergy risks.

In extreme cases of over-alkalization, [low potassium](https://www.drberg.com/blog/top-symptoms-of-having-low-potassium) and calcium levels in the blood might occur. You wouldn't want that.

### **Alkalosis and Urinary Health**

The pH balance in our urine plays a crucial role in maintaining urinary health. Drinking excessive amounts of alkaline water can upset this delicate balance.

This alteration potentially heightens infection risk because an imbalance allows harmful bacteria to thrive more easily. [Studies have shown](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3571898) that urinary tract infections are more common when the urine's pH is imbalanced.

## What Are The Most Effective Methods Or Treatments For Dissolving Kidne 9Bbd36

# What are the most effective methods or treatments for dissolving kidney stones, and how do they work to aid in their dissolution and removal?

The most common type of kidney stone is a calcium oxalate stone. In this situation, you have high oxalates and calcium and low citrate.

You may have high oxalates from consuming too many high-oxalate foods. Oxalates are in a lot of foods, including keto-friendly foods. High calcium in the urine can be due to a genetic mutation. Your body makes citrates, which bind with calcium to lessen the amount of free calcium in the body. Free calcium is what can bind to oxalates.

Drinking more fluids during the day is one of the best ways to prevent kidney stones. I suggest drinking at least two and a half liters of fluids per day if you're prone to getting kidney stones. Another great way to prevent kidney stones is to add electrolyte powder containing potassium citrate or magnesium citrate to your water.

## How To Alleviate Acidosis Symptoms

# How to alleviate acidosis symptoms?

While apple cider vinegar and kombucha can offer various health benefits, consuming too much acidic substance can lead to [acidosis](https://www.drberg.com/blog/symptoms-of-acidosis-and-what-causes-it). Acidosis occurs when the body's pH levels become too acidic, which can cause multiple symptoms and health problems.

### **Recognizing Symptoms**

It's essential to be aware of the signs and symptoms of acidosis, especially if you regularly consume acidic foods and drinks like apple cider vinegar and kombucha. Some common symptoms of acidosis include:

- Fatigue and weakness

- Headaches

- Rapid breathing

- Confusion

- Decreased oxygen levels

- Difficulty breathing

If you experience these symptoms after consuming apple cider vinegar or kombucha, it's important to stop consuming these drinks and seek medical attention if the symptoms persist or worsen.

To help alleviate the symptoms of acidosis, [you can try consuming alkalizing minerals](https://www.drberg.com/blog/why-alkalizing-your-entire-body-is-dangerous) such as potassium, calcium, and magnesium. These minerals can help balance the body's pH levels and reduce the acidity in your system.

Alternatively, consuming a small amount of baking soda mixed with water can also help neutralize excess acid in the body.

## What Are The Most Effective Treatment Options And Management Strategie 482617

# What are the most effective treatment options and management strategies for addressing Dupuytren’s contracture?

Dupuytren’s contracture a condition in which one or more fingers becomes permanently bent in a flexed position. So there's a couple of different theories of it. They don't really know exactly why it is, but I will say that I would take because we have a contracture, I would take magnesium first.

You can take different versions like glycosinate is a, is a good type of magnesium and I wouldn't also avoid calcium. I would probably take a calcium. Usually you can get magnesium with calcium in there and that way you have the minerals to allow the contraction and relaxation of muscles. Now the other point about this contraction is that if your pH is too on the alkaline side, that can create these minerals from working correctly. So you may find that if you acidify the body with either ongoing apple cider vinegar and or a tainted hydrochloride, you can take it when you eat for your digestive system. You may find that that allows us minerals to work a lot better as well.

it's either a pH problem, I'm guessing, or a mineral problem between magnesium and calcium.

## What Do I Do If I Have Hormonal Imbalances On Keto

# What do I do if I have hormonal imbalances on Keto?

## **Hormonal Imbalances & Calcium Absorption**

Our bodies are complex systems, with various factors influencing nutrient absorption. Hormonal balance is one such factor. [Hormonal imbalances](https://www.drberg.com/blog/how-hormonal-imbalance-really-occurs) can affect the absorption of minerals like calcium, which is crucial for bone health and nerve impulses.

During menopause, hormone levels can vary significantly - particularly a decrease in estrogen - which may lead to decreased mineral uptake, such as calcium.

Postmenopausal women tend to have lower bone density due to reduced calcium absorption, making them more susceptible to osteoporosis.

### **Balancing Hormones For Improved Mineral Absorption**

The good news? Adopting a healthy ketogenic lifestyle may help. The Healthy Keto Diet focuses on consuming nutrient-dense foods that are rich in vitamins and minerals for optimal body function.

- Foods high in healthy fats (like avocados) support hormone production by providing the necessary building blocks for hormones.

- Maintaining stable blood sugar levels through low-carb intake helps prevent insulin spikes, which could disrupt other hormone balances.

- Plenty of leafy greens provide an excellent source of calcium without the risk associated with dairy consumption.

## What Are The Potential Causes Of Low Energy And How Do Factors Such As A01E2F

# What are the potential causes of low energy, and how do factors such as lifestyle, medical conditions, and nutritional deficiencies contribute to this issue?

Having low energy can be caused by many things. The causes below have simple remedies that will reduce the fatigue. Normally you should have a good energy level without it crashing throughout the day.

**Cause #1: Potassium deficiency**

Potassium is a very important electrolyte (electrically charged mineral) for your body and its energy levels. You need 4,700 mg of potassium daily to support your body’s energy metabolism. If you are deficient in potassium, it can definitely cause low energy. You can mainly get potassium from raw vegetables.

**Cause #2: High insulin**

Insulin is a hormone that lowers the blood sugar after it spikes and also stores it as fat in your body. If you consume a lot of sugar and refined carbs this can result in insulin lowering your blood sugar below its normal level. This will cause irritation, tiredness, fatigue, and low energy until you eat sugar and carbs again. Additionally, over time it will become hard for your cells
to get enough potassium, because high amounts of insulin over a long time period reduce the ability of your cells to absorb potassium.

**Cause #3: Insufficient sleep**

Sleep allows your body to recharge and be ready for the next day, energy-wise. If you are not sleeping well or you sleep but don’t rest throughout the night, this can cause problems with low energy the next day.

**Cause #4: Energy drinks**

Energy drinks can be the cause of low energy, because they contain a lot of sugar as well
as caffeine (stimulant). Caffeine will give you a synthetic sense of energy and eventually (if
you consume it regularly and often) will wear out your adrenals (stress-regulating glands). Consuming energy drinks will give you a sense of energy for some time, but will result in a feeling of fatigue soon after. This tends to make you want to drink more energy drinks.

**Cause #5: Not enough phytonutrients**

Your body has certain components in the cells called mitochondria that can be considered as small energy factories. Your mitochondria are under constant assault from smoking, pollution and chemicals, along with high sugar, insulin and other factors. There are certain foods from plants that are called phytonutrients, as well as certain nutrients, that prevent the damage. The same phytonutrients also repair your mitochondria.

## Dr. Bergs Opinion On The Carnivore Diet

# Dr. Berg's Opinion on the Carnivore Diet

I’m going to share my opinion of the carnivore diet after following it for 2 weeks. Not everyone does well on the same diet, so it’s important to experiment with different diets to find the right one for you.

Many people do very well on the carnivore diet! The carnivore diet can be very helpful for people with gut issues and autoimmune conditions. While on the carnivore diet, I ate beef, pork, eggs, seafood, shellfish, and dairy. I discovered that I had been experiencing bloating due to my nut consumption. I didn’t experience any energy changes because I already have high energy.

For the first few days, I didn’t have any bowel movements. This was probably because my gut microbes needed to adjust.

Some people wonder about vitamin C intake on the carnivore diet. When you go on the carnivore diet, your need for vitamin C decreases.

I do not plan to continue the carnivore diet. I will continue eating the same proteins along with salads made from high-quality ingredients. I’ll also consume fermented vegetables like sauerkraut, kimchi, and pickles. I love to add extra virgin olive oil, parmigiano reggiano, nutritional yeast, and feta cheese to my salads. The calcium in cheese binds to any oxalates that are in your salad, removing them from the digestive system.

I’ll also add berries to my diet, but I won’t be eating any nuts!

## What Are The Dangers Of Excessive Salt Consumption

# What are the dangers of excessive salt consumption?

Signs of consuming too much salt include:

\- Edema (swelling in eyes, hands, feet, or legs)

\- Thirst

\- High blood pressure

\- Headache

\- Restlessness

\- Irritability

\- Nausea

\- Fatigue

Signs of sodium deficiency include:

\- Weakness

\- Low blood pressure

\- Increased neurotransmitters

\- Vascular stiffness and high blood pressure

\- Insulin resistance

Insulin resistance often causes high blood pressure, influenced by factors like a high-carb diet or intermittent fasting. Diuretics, commonly used for hypertension, may lead to sodium and potassium loss. For those with sodium sensitivity or signs of deficiency, ensuring adequate potassium intake is crucial, alongside a balanced mineral intake. Sea salts like Baja Gold Sea Salt offer a comprehensive mineral profile, including lower sodium content.

## Does The Consumption Of Water Play A Role In The Formation Of Kidney Stones

# Does the consumption of water play a role in the formation of kidney stones?

The most common type of kidney stone is calcium oxalate. Consuming calcium helps prevent stones by binding with oxalates in the digestive system, preventing their absorption into the bloodstream and accumulation in the kidneys. Drinking mineral water does not cause kidney stones.

**Foods high in oxalates:**

\- Almonds

\- Spinach

\- Kiwi

\- Beets

\- Chocolate

**Recommendations:**

\- Avoid high-oxalate foods if prone to stones

\- Consume calcium with oxalate-rich foods

\- Prefer calcium citrate, magnesium, orotate, or lactate over calcium carbonate

\- Maintain adequate fluid intake (at least 2.5 liters daily)

## What Factors Might Contribute To Experiencing Salt Cravings At Night

# What factors might contribute to experiencing salt cravings at night?

**If you crave salty foods like popcorn, peanuts, or chips, especially at night, this video is for you. I believe it’s because you’re deficient in sodium.** But why would you crave those junk foods and not just regular salt? It’s like when a pregnant woman craves ice cream, or how some people crave dirt. They may be deficient in calcium, or iron. Apparently when you’re deficient your body will initiate a craving for that particular mineral or nutrient you’re missing.

The World Health Organization (WHO) advises people to lower their salt intake to the equivalent of about one teaspoon per day. Most Americans consume one thousand times more than that! It’s coming from foods with hidden salts like refined carbs, bread, and deli meats, and not from the salt shaker.

But maybe it’s not the salt but the other ingredients in these foods. Before refrigeration, we salted foods to preserve them and the risk of heart attacks and high blood pressure was lower than now.

If you look at it logically, you add more salt, have more fluid, have higher blood pressure, have more heart attacks, right? But check out the links below to some studies I recommend you read. If you go on a low salt diet your risk of stroke, heart problems, and insulin resistance actually increases. Another study shows that when you increase sodium in your diet your risk of these conditions plummets. Why? Because people increasing their sodium were also increasing their potassium. Potassium protects your heart.

**The focus is on a low salt diet but hardly any emphasis on increasing potassium or, more importantly, removing refined carbs from the diet. In other words, to consume salt-free refined carbohydrates**. Your body has a hormone called aldosterone, which has one purpose: to hold sodium. Without sodium your nerves can’t conduct nerve impulses, your muscles can’t contract, and your fluids would be out of balance. You wouldn’t be able to transport calcium and other nutrients. A low salt diet triggers aldosterone, which has a cascade effect on your body. The side effects of not enough sodium are worse than having too much.

**The combination of a salt-free diet, diuretics, and drinking a lot of water is dangerous for your heart. When you’re on a ketogenic diet you need more salt. Add it back in. Consume one to one and one/half teaspoons per day of sea salt. Increase your vegetable intake. This should banish your salt cravings.**

## What Exercises Do You Recommend For Flabby Arm Fat

# What exercises do you recommend for flabby arm fat?

**The main reason that people tend to have fat arms is the loss of collagen, which happens over a period of time as a person grows older. Out of all the hormones, the growth hormone tends to be the single most critical factor that is responsible for losing arm fat. In adults, the growth hormone controls factors such as fat burning, tightening muscles, protein synthesis, energy. The major causes of flabby arms are lower levels of growth hormone and high cortisol levels.**

To lose arm fat and avoid loose skin one must lower cortisol levels and raise the growth hormone. Lower cortisol levels can be achieved by low-intensity exercises (walking), sleeping, avoid stress, potassium foods, avoid sugar. Higher growth hormone can be achieved by high-intensity exercises, sleeping, proteins, avoid sugar.

**Loose skin normally stems from a loss of collagen, which occurs when the adrenal glands become stress.** This is common during and after menopause, primarily because the adrenal glands act as a backup gland for the ovaries. The buffer for cortisol is GH (Growth Hormone) and as GH drops, there is nothing left to counter the bad effects of cortisol.

**LOWER CORTISOL**

1\. Low-intensity exercise

2\. Increase sleep

3\. Support adrenal gland

4\. Avoid stress

5\. Increase potassium

6\. Increase B vitamins

7\. Avoid sugar

**RAISE GROWTH HORMONE**

1\. High-intensity exercise

2\. Increase sleep

3\. Increase some protein (not more than 6 ounces per meal)

4\. Intermittent fasting - only 3 meals per day - no snacks

5\. Decrease Cortisol and insulin

6\. Support the liver

## I Want To Go On A Ketogenic Diet But I Dont Want To Cause Kidney Stone C183Ed

# I want to go on a ketogenic diet, but I don’t want to cause kidney stones. What can I do to prevent them?

To prevent kidney stones or gout on the ketogenic plan, consider these tips:

1\. Increase citrates by adding 1 lemon to your water daily. Despite being acidic, lemon turns alkaline in the body, which helps prevent stone formation.

2\. Consume ample vegetables to ensure sufficient nutrient intake.

3\. Stay hydrated by increasing fluid intake, and consider adding 1 tsp of sea salt per day or electrolyte powder to maintain hydration.

4\. Avoid cruciferous vegetables and spinach to reduce oxalate intake. If you do consume foods high in oxalates, pair them with calcium-rich foods in the same meal to bind oxalates and prevent stone formation. Avoid consuming oxalates and calcium separately to prevent stone formation.\]

**\*We recommend consulting with your doctor before making any dietary changes, especially if you have any existing health conditions.**

## Keto Kale Shake Without Fruits Or Berries

# Keto Kale Shake without Fruits or Berries

I want to tell you about making kale shakes without berries or fruit since some people don’t want the carbohydrates those items contain. First, blend the kale. I use the organic frozen kale from Trader Joe’s, and fill the blender about two-thirds full with the frozen kale.

Next, I add water to the same level as the kale, then blend for four minutes. Make sure you use a high-powered blender, or else the kale doesn’t come out smooth. The reason I blend the kale first is that otherwise, it foams up too high if you put in other ingredients before blending it.

Then add the rest of the ingredients, blending briefly after you add each one: one to three teaspoons of lemon juice, which helps prevent kidney stones and calcium deposits. One scoop of raw wheatgrass juice powder, lemon-flavored, which contains stevia and adds some sweetness without the carbs. One teaspoon of electrolyte powder, to get the benefit of its trace minerals and extra potassium.

Be sure to blend only briefly! If you do it too long, the shake will foam and overflow the blender. If you want to consume this shake as a meal, add one teaspoon of coconut oil. You can add more if you want. This gives you some seriously good fat. I love 100 percent organic, virgin, cold-pressed, and unrefined coconut oil.

There aren’t many carbs in the kale and low in protein. This is a very low-glycemic drink. If you’re on a two-meal per day schedule, you can drink this shake during your eating window, or in the morning when you wake up. What I do is drink half of it with a meal, wait an hour, then drink the rest. I store the shake in mason jars.

This shake is sometimes my entire salad for the day! It doesn’t really matter exactly when you drink it, it’s a matter of how much you can consume with a meal without feeling stuffed. If you need to, break it up into portions and consume a little at a time.

## What Are Effective Ways To Increase Energy Levels While Following A Ke 624E94

# What are effective ways to increase energy levels while following a ketogenic diet?

Feeling tired on keto can result from poor sleep, stress, nutritional deficiencies, or the adaptation phase as your body transitions to burning fat. Increasing B vitamins or potassium may help.

Fatigue can also be linked to mitochondrial health. Mitochondria produce ATP, and oxidative stress from smoking, pollution, and high sugar can damage them. Antioxidants, especially from whole foods like cruciferous vegetables and omega-3-rich sources, help combat this damage.

Avoid synthetic antioxidants; focus on natural sources. If you're not getting enough high-quality vegetables, consider adding a plant-based shake for a week to boost energy. Keto can be challenging, but it’s a protective mechanism worth maintaining!

## How Is Intermittent Fasting Connected To Blood Sugar Levels And The Ad F3E08B

# How is intermittent fasting connected to blood sugar levels and the adrenal glands?

When transitioning between meals, hypoglycemia (low blood sugar) may occur. Normally, the adrenals and liver raise glucose levels. Weak adrenals can lead to severe drops in blood sugar, causing symptoms. Strong adrenals typically prevent hypoglycemia during intermittent fasting (IF). IF isn't harmful to adrenals, but with weak adrenals, it should be approached gradually, incorporating more fat, B vitamins, and potassium.

## Why Arent My Blood Sugar Levels Lowering With Intermittent Fasting And Af83F0

# Why aren't my blood sugar levels lowering with intermittent fasting and ketosis?

You likely have severe insulin resistance with high insulin and poor cell absorption, leading to high blood sugars. To lower your blood sugars, try the following:

**1\. Reevaluate Your Diet:** Ensure you're consuming protein, carbs, and fats properly and eating enough vegetables. Consider reducing your carbohydrate intake—if you eat 50 grams a day, cut it to 20; if 20 grams, reduce to 10 grams.

**2\. Reduce Meal Frequency:** Shorten your eating window by consuming fewer meals.

**3\. Increase Nutrients:** Add B vitamins (from nutritional yeast), potassium (from electrolytes), zinc, and chromium to your diet.

**4\. Exercise:** Regular physical activity can improve insulin resistance.

**5\. Address Health Issues:** Focus on the most significant health issues you have and work on improving them.

**6\. Improve Sleep and Manage Stress:** If you have insomnia or high stress, take steps to address these.

**7\. Be Patient:** It may take more time on keto and intermittent fasting to see improvements in your blood sugars.

## What Are The Symptoms Associated With Electrolyte Deficiency That May  4A68Ba

# What are the symptoms associated with electrolyte deficiency that may occur during weight loss?

When you lose a lot of weight on a certain eating plan, you can lose a lot of water weight along with fat. In fact, many people lose fluid first, and with that comes electrolytes. This can lead to an electrolyte deficiency.

1\. Low calcium Low calcium can cause cramps, irritability, chronic cough, and depression.

2\. Low magnesium Low magnesium can cause weak muscles, hyper irritability, and irregular heartbeat or palpitations.

3\. Low potassium Low potassium can cause fatigue, cramps, constipation, nausea, and sugar craving.

4\. Low sodium Low sodium can cause headaches, fatigue, loss of appetite, nausea, and fuzzy thinking/brain fog.

## What Strategies Can Be Employed To Address Feelings Of Fatigue When Un 6Fe2Cc

# What strategies can be employed to address feelings of fatigue when unable to fall asleep?

**Try these 7 tips for falling asleep easier when you’re tired:**

1\. No water past 7 pm - Consuming water before bed can cause you to feel like you have to use the restroom, especially if you have insulin resistance or pre-diabetes.

2\. Limit caffeine intake - One 8oz cup of coffee a day should be your limit. Excess caffeine can make it difficult to fall asleep.

3\. Limit protein - Too much protein can act as a stimulant. Keep your protein consumption to 3 to 8 oz per meal.

4\. Use up body energy - Having too much energy before bed can make it difficult to fall asleep. Try using up your energy by going on long walks, exercising, and doing physical work.

5\. Catch the first circadian wave - Your first circadian wave is typically around 9:30 pm. Try to catch this wave to make falling to sleep easier.

6\. Take a sleep aid before bed - Natural sleep aids can help you get to sleep faster when it comes time for bed. Calcium lactate is a great natural supplement that can help with sleep.

7\. Keep your room on the colder side - A warm body temperate may keep you up at night. People tend to sleep better in a slightly cool environment.

## Is Fever Beneficial To The Body

# Is fever beneficial to the body?

Fever is a natural defense mechanism that helps the body fight infections by mobilizing white blood cells and speeding up recovery. Attempting to reduce a fever immediately can prolong the illness. Natural approaches to support the body during fever include taking appropriate nutrients like calcium lactate and trace minerals, and occasionally fasting. It's important to monitor fever levels and seek medical advice if they exceed specific thresholds based on age. Additionally, factors like body temperature variations, dietary influences, sleep conditions, and smoking can affect overall body temperature regulation.

## What Are Some Good Magnesium Foods

# What are some good magnesium foods?

**Top magnesium foods:**

1\. Pumpkin seeds

2\. Spinach

3\. Swiss chard

4\. Almonds

5\. Leafy greens

6\. Dark chocolate (sugar free)

When people have low stomach acids, they can't absorb magnesium as well. This occurs when people have heartburn or acid reflux (which is counter-intuitive) or GERD.

Most of the magnesium is stored in the bone, it's involved in enzyme activation. We need this mineral for generation of energy, decreases stress, constipation, nerve and muscle physiology. Magnesium can help lower blood pressure, help with constipation, lower stress and enhance sleep.

Magnesium is at the heart of chlorophyll in leafy greens.

## How Long Does Magnesium Usually Stay In The Body

# How long does magnesium usually stay in the body?

Certain minerals go through the body quickly, while other minerals don’t.

For example, minerals like sodium, iron, and calcium tend to be retained in the body. But, magnesium, potassium, and zinc are not held in the body for very long.

What determines the retention or recycling is how healthy the kidneys are. If your kidneys are very healthy, you may only lose a very small amount. But, if your kidneys are unhealthy, you could lose a lot more. There is a huge gap when it comes to how much magnesium your body will hold versus excrete.

The kidneys have the ability to get rid of excess magnesium, so it’s rarely toxic to the body. But, the body will get rid of .5-70% of magnesium within a 24 hour period. It’s very important to get plenty of magnesium.

The average American only consumes 200-300mg of magnesium per day. I believe a person should consume more like 500-600mg per day. Certain diseases, like diabetes, can cause the need for magnesium to go way up. This is because you likely aren’t retaining magnesium if you have blood sugar problems. Drinking a lot of alcohol can also severely decrease the ability to hold magnesium.

The number one symptom of a magnesium deficiency is fatigue. This is because the mitochondria (the energy factories of your cells) need magnesium to create the energy currency of the body. Palpitations and muscle weakness are a few more symptoms. If you crave chocolate, you may have a magnesium deficiency.

## Whats The Important Purpose Of Magnesium

# What's the important purpose of magnesium?

Magnesium is needed in a lot of different functions in the body, but its primary purpose is to act as a calcium antagonist. Calcium is very toxic in the body unless it’s in normal amounts. Taking 500mg or more of calcium per day could potentially increase your risk of a heart attack or stroke.

Calcium is essential, but we need it in smaller amounts. Calcium doesn’t exit the body very easily. There are even many different disease processes out there that involve the accumulation of calcium. Magnesium is the key mineral to help prevent this.

Hypercalcemia is a condition where there is too much calcium in the blood.

Symptoms of hypercalcemia:

• Arrhythmias

• Abdominal pain

• Paralytic ileus

• Vomiting

• Excessive or reduced urination

• Psychosis

• Strong desire for sleep

• Constipation

## What Are The Health Benefits Of Honey Compared To Other Sweeteners

# What are the health benefits of honey compared to other sweeteners?

Honey is a sweetener that contains a lot of good stuff. However, it still is 50% fructose and 50% glucose. This means it can slow down your weight loss, and it has a relatively high glycemic index.

**Raw honey benefits**

What you should know is that although honey has some nutrients, it is very high in fructose. Fructose puts stress on the liver and can create a lot of problems.

If you had to choose between honey and sugar, honey might be the better option because it has some antioxidants and some antimicrobial properties. But, overall, honey is low in actual nutrients. It may be better than refined sugar, but not by much.

- Antimicrobial

- Anti-inflammatory

- Anti-allergy

- Helps lower blood pressure

- Can help with allergies

- Can help decrease complications from diabetes

- High in nutrients

    - B vitamins

    - magnesium

    - calcium

    - potassium

    - antioxidants

    - phytonutrients (healthy substances found in plants)

**Where to get it**

You can get it in a regular grocery store. If you want to get benefits from honey, get a raw version of it, not pasteurized. Pasteurized honey is almost like pure sugar, and its potential health- boosting properties have been cooked away.

If you want to consume honey, you may want to try raw manuka honey. This type of raw honey is unprocessed, and it has a lot of great properties.

## What Are The Common Causes Of Bedwetting

# What are the common causes of bedwetting?

Bedwetting is a common problem in children, but many adults can have accidents or near accidents too. Getting up to use the bathroom in the middle of the night has the same root cause as bedwetting.

**Cause #1: High insulin**

Bedwetting is caused by high levels of insulin. And that results from a high-carb diet. Carbohydrates spike your insulin levels. Over time, this causes the cells to develop a resistance to insulin--which then causes higher insulin production by your body. As you know, Insulin lowers blood sugar. When the blood sugar goes down your body lets go of excess liquid. This can happen at night.

**Remedies:**

- Avoid sugar and refined carbs

- Avoid grains

- Do an intermittent fasting plan

- Do a Healthy Keto® diet

- Consume vegetables (7 to 10 cups daily)

- Consume vegetable shakes

**Get plenty of insulin-regulating nutrients**

• chromium
• potassium
• B vitamins (nutritional yeast)

## What Are The Most Important Benefits Of Baking Soda

# What are the most important benefits of baking soda?

Baking soda, also known as sodium bicarbonate, is widely used in baking. Many people get relief from things like acid reflux when they take baking soda, but it comes with a package. The stomach helps you digest proteins, absorb minerals, and kill pathogens. It’s designed to produce and make acid. The stomach should normally be extremely acidic.

A person can experience acid reflux if they lose their stomach acids. Many people think that a person with acid reflux has too much acid, but they actually don’t have strong enough acid.

Baking soda is very alkaline. So, when you take baking soda, you’re going to feel better temporarily, but you’re not fixing the root problem. If you do this, the issue could actually get worse over time because you’re taking the acid out of the stomach and you’re not adding it back in.

**Side effects of taking baking soda long-term**

- It alkalizes the stomach

- Creates problems with protein absorption

- Creates problems with mineral absorption

- Decreases the ability of the stomach to kill pathogens

- Depletes your potassium reserve

- Decreases chlorides

- Baking soda has high levels of sodium

## What Are The Possible Reasons For Excessive Thirst

# What are the possible reasons for excessive thirst?

Increased thirst is a condition where you are more thirsty than normally. It usually happens with frequent urination. This can create a problem as you can lose your electrolytes fast.

**Cause #1: Diabetes / insulin resistance**

If you have insulin resistance or diabetes either can cause excessive thirst. This is because water follows blood sugar. Having these conditions you lose your water fast and the loss signals to your brain, causing you to want to drink more water.

**Cause #2: Potassium/Sodium imbalance**

Having a balanced ratio of sodium-potassium is needed for proper hydration in the body. Normally the ratio should be about 4,700 mg of potassium to 1,000 mg of sodium per day, a 4.7 to 1 ratio. If you have high amounts of sodium, this can create potassium deficiency symptoms; and it applies the opposite way too.

**Cause #4: Too much calcium**

When you consume too much calcium or you have too much calcium in the body this is the condition called hypercalcemia. One of its side effects is frequent urination and excessive thirst.

**Cause #5: Certain drugs and medicines**

If you consume certain drugs, psych drugs, diuretics or even steroids they can cause your body to lose fluid or you may have excessive thirst as one of their side effects.

## Can I Consume Red Bull On Keto

# Can I consume Red Bull on keto?

No. In theory, energy drinks are supposed to help increase brain energy, exercise performance and endurance. However, most energy drinks will actually cause brain fog and reduce exercise performance – and the ingredients will deplete the cells.

The big problem with energy drinks is that the ingredients don’t give you real energy. These drinks are composed mostly of caffeine and sugar. Caffeine is not a fuel, it’s a stimulant. It makes you think you have energy, but really it’s just revving up your adrenal glands. There are also crazy amounts of sugar in energy drinks, which will later make you more tired and grumpy, and will make you want another energy drink. A lot of this sugar is not just glucose. It’s fructose.

These drinks also contain a lot of sodium and not enough potassium. You need to look for an energy drink that has all of the electrolytes, the electrically charged minerals that really do help to energize your cells. Potassium helps recharge the batteries in your cells. Magnesium feeds the mitochondria.

## Can I Eat Peanut Butter On Keto

# Can I eat peanut butter on keto?

Yes. The peanut butter or nut butter should be organic and shouldn’t have any added sugar. There also shouldn’t be any oils in the peanut butter other than peanut oil. Consume in small amounts and don’t overdo it.

Also, peanuts are high in oxalates and those can cause kidney stones. You can add some calcium or cheese with the meal (not separately) to make the oxalates bind in the digestive tract instead of going to the kidney.

## Why Do I Have A Dry Mouth On Keto

# Why do I have a dry mouth on keto?

Adults produce 0.5 to 1.5 liters (2 to 6 cups) of saliva daily. On keto, without starches and sugars, the need for amylase and saliva decreases. Additionally, keto increases the need for electrolytes, especially potassium and magnesium.

Reducing carbs often leads to fewer vegetable intake, causing a mineral deficiency. Consuming 7 to 10 cups of salad daily provides the necessary potassium (4,700 mg). Healthy Keto® emphasizes vegetable intake to maintain electrolyte balance.

To prevent dry mouth on keto, increase vegetable consumption, use a good electrolyte powder, and add Himalayan sea salt for better hydration.

## Why Should I Consume Apple Cider Vinegar For Weight Loss On Keto

# Why should I consume apple cider vinegar for weight loss on keto?

Apple cider vinegar (ACV) is effective due to its acetic acid content. Acetic acid aids mineral absorption, mobilizes calcium, improves protein digestion, and boosts the immune system. ACV also helps improve blood sugar levels by increasing glucose sensitivity, leading to less insulin production and more fat burning.

Many people have overly alkaline blood pH. ACV, being acidic with a pH of 2.5, can slightly alter body pH, enhancing mineral transport, enzyme function, thyroid stimulation, and metabolism. It's also beneficial for stomach issues like heartburn, acid reflux, GERD, and indigestion, often caused by too alkaline conditions. As we age, our stomachs become more alkaline, so we need more acid.

## Can Sport Drinks Cause Dehydration And Weight Gain

# Can sport drinks cause dehydration and weight gain?

When you think about a sports drink, the first thing that comes to mind is hydration and increased performance. However, the ingredients in most sports drinks could cause the exact opposite. In fact, many studies show that sports drinks do not help your performance at all. 

**Here’s why:**

1\. Sugar dehydrates you because it depletes minerals. Sports drinks are filled with tons of sugar. Some of them have the same amount of sugar as a soda. This can cause even more dehydration. Gatorade contains 36 grams of sugar.

2\. Sports drinks raise your insulin levels, which blocks fat burning and increases fat storage. 

3\. Insulin spikes and sugar crashes can make you tired. In turn, your performance may suffer significantly. 

4\. Sports drinks may lower your potassium, magnesium, and chromium. In summary, sports drinks are not good for hydrating you or losing weight. Instead, go with water or a keto-friendly sports drink with no sugar.

## What Are The Common Causes Of Low Back Pain And How Do Factors Such As 020Cd8

# What are the common causes of low back pain, and how do factors such as muscle strain, injuries, and underlying medical conditions contribute to this issue?

If you are experiencing pain in the low area of the back, this can have several causes. Most of them are connected to your kidneys. However, the pain could be due to muscle imbalances or a pinched nerve.

**Cause #1: Kidney stones / oxalates crystallization**

Oxalates are substances that are located in some foods. Oxalates can create crystallization in the kidneys, resulting in low back pain and kidney stones. The best way to resolve such a problem would be to avoid foods high in oxalates.

Additionally, consuming more water and other fluids should help with kidney stones in general. You also should take electrolytes to stay hydrated. Too acidic a body pH or consuming salts in high amounts can contribute to stone formation, specifically uric acid stones.

**Remedies:**

- As a general remedy, do an acupressure technique to relieve pain in the back:

    • watch this video
    • draw an imaginary line through your body from an epicenter of your back
    • massage the area in the front that is directly opposite from the epicenter of your back pain • the best way to know if you have hit the right spot: it will be tender

- Avoid these foods:

    • spinach
    • almonds • chocolate • rhubarb

- Consume lemon water to block oxalates

- Drink more water

- Consume electrolytes

- Consume moderate amounts of salts (reduce if needed)

- If you have too acid a pH (acidosis), alkalize the body:

    - consume more vegetables

    - take potassium citrate

**Cause #3: Too much protein**

Consuming too much protein can affect your kidneys and can result in low back pain. Additionally, if you consume a lot of protein, a large part of it will not be digested and will turn into waste products in your body. Protein should be consumed in moderate amounts daily (3 to 6 oz per meal).

**Remedies:**

- Consume moderate amounts of protein (3 to 6 oz per meal)

**Cause #4: Muscle imbalances and pinched nerves**

Muscle imbalance can cause low back pain. For example if you are developing only one set of leg muscles (like in cycling) without paying attention to additional or opposite ones, you can create additional pressure on your muscles and as result on your back. Another example would be sitting and crossing your legs only on one side and not doing the same with the other leg to balance it out; this can result in a pinched nerve on one side.

**Remedies:**

- If you find yourself repeatedly crossing your legs from one side, alternate and cross from the other side

- If you are cycling, work out your glutes and the back side of your legs to balance the muscles out

- You can also do yoga to strengthen your weak muscles

- As a general remedy, do an acupressure technique to relieve pain in the back:

    - watch this video

    - draw an imaginary line through your body from an epicenter of your back

    - massage the area in the front that is directly opposite from the epicenter of your back pain

    - the best way to know if you hit the right spot: it will be tender

**Other causes:**

- Acidosis

## Whats The Main Purpose Of Magnesium

# What's the main purpose of magnesium?

Magnesium is needed in a lot of different functions in the body, but its primary purpose is to act as a calcium antagonist. Calcium is very toxic in the body unless it’s in normal amounts.

Taking 500mg or more of calcium per day could potentially increase your risk of a heart attack or stroke. Calcium is essential, but we need it in smaller amounts. Calcium doesn’t exit the body very easily. There are even many different disease processes out there that involve the accumulation of calcium. Magnesium is the key mineral to help prevent this.

**Hypercalcemia is a condition where there is too much calcium in the blood.**

Symptoms of hypercalcemia:

• Arrhythmias

• Abdominal pain

• Paralytic ileus

• Vomiting

• Excessive or reduced urination

• Psychosis

• Strong desire for sleep

• Constipation

## Is Magnesium An Effective Supplement For Sleep

# Is magnesium an effective supplement for sleep?

Magnesium is a very important mineral that is involved in many different biochemical reactions.

**One of the effects magnesium has is to help someone sleep.** 

**How magnesium may help improve sleep:**

1\. It increases serotonin and melatonin 

2\. It increases GABA 

3\. It decreases adrenaline (lowers the fight or flight mechanism)

4\. It promotes muscle relaxation

5\. It decreases inflammation (C-reactive protein)

6\. It helps decrease restless leg syndrome 

7\. It supports the heart (may lessen angina and arrhythmia)

8\. It helps decrease PMS cramping

## Why Do We Need Magnesium

# Why do we need magnesium?

**These are some of the most commonly known benefits of magnesium:**

1\. Leg cramps

2\. Relaxation & calmness

3\. Sleep

4\. Inflammation

5\. Blood sugar

6\. Electrolyte

7\. Bone health

8\. Energy (ATP)

Magnesium has a significant effect on the cardiovascular system. However, it’s also important that you consume a healthy diet. Taking magnesium won’t make much of a difference if you’re eating an unhealthy, carb-loaded diet.

The best sources of magnesium are vegetables. The average person only consumes 1.5 cups of vegetables each day—but you need 7 to 10 cups of vegetables daily for optimal health.

**Other sources of magnesium include:** • Grains (avoid!) • Green vegetables • Nuts and seeds • Seafood • Meats • Berries

## What Are The Primary Causes Of Heart Palpitations

# What are the primary causes of heart palpitations?

Palpitations are either a skipped heartbeat, an extra pounding, or a speeding up of your heart rate. The rhythm of the heart is controlled by electrolytes (potassium, magnesium sodium, and calcium).

You can be deficient in these minerals if you omit them from the diet like not eating enough vegetables. You can also have insulin resistance and thereby not absorb electrolytes and develop palpitations. Insulin resistance also forces the body to make more insulin because it's now resistant. This is another reason why you see palpitations as a side effect of taking insulin. Or you can have low stomach acid and not absorb minerals. It takes an acidic stomach to absorb minerals. When you are low in stomach acids, you then get acid reflux (heart burning or GERD), and in fact, palpitations are one of the associative symptoms of having acid reflux and now you know why.

## What Are The Benefits Of Sea Kelp

# What are the benefits of sea kelp?

**These are the 7 health benefits of the iodine in sea kelp:**

1\. Helps balance estrogen. If a woman is estrogen dominant she may develop ovarian cysts or fibrocystic breasts.

2\. Enhances your IQ (your cognitive performance), especially in a growing child. If you’re pregnant, take sea kelp to reduce the chance of the baby’s brain being smaller. Iodine can also enhance your growth in general.

3\. Contains ten times more calcium than milk. We all know the problems with milk from a commercial dairy, with added hormones and the low quality of food that cows eat.

4\. Sea kelp has many more nutrients such as magnesium, potassium, iron, zinc, vitamin C, and B vitamins

5\. Contains the phytochemical fucoidan, which has powerful anti-cancer properties. It’s an antioxidant and has anti-inflammatory properties too.

6\. Contains vanadium, a trace mineral that helps control your blood sugars and address insulin resistance. (Sea kelp contains all trace minerals, but iodine seems to be the most concentrated.)

7\. Contains amino acids, although a fairly small amount so you’d have to consume large quantities to reap the benefits. Just be aware there are amino acids in seaweed.

## Can A Deficiency In Potassium Influence Blood Sugar Levels And What Me 42591A

# Can a deficiency in potassium influence blood sugar levels, and what mechanisms might explain the relationship between these two factors?

Yes, having a potassium deficiency can cause blood sugar issues. When you consume more carbohydrates, you become insulin resistant, which leads to higher blood sugar levels. Potassium is involved in storing glucose as glycogen. Increasing potassium intake can aid with proper glucose storage. This is why potassium is a key ingredient of Blood Sugar Support Advanced Formula.

## What Can I Do To Address Sleep Problems While Following A Ketogenic Diet

# What can I do to address sleep problems while following a ketogenic diet?

If you aren’t following Healthy Keto®, you may be lacking sleep-promoting nutrients like B vitamins, magnesium, calcium, and potassium. This deficiency can occur during the transition phase as your body adapts to burning fat for energy—a process that initially leads to increased alertness since fat provides more than double the energy storage potential compared to carbohydrates. As a result, you might feel more awake, while carbohydrates can cause fatigue, often making you feel sleepy after consumption.

To improve your sleep and expedite the transition to ketosis, consider increasing your intake of minerals, particularly potassium, as well as B vitamins, and incorporating more daily exercise to utilize excess energy. Other factors that may contribute to sleeplessness on a ketogenic diet include excessive coffee consumption, not practicing intermittent fasting, low calcium levels, bloating from kale, or waking up due to fluctuations in blood sugar levels. Addressing these issues can help enhance your overall sleep quality while adapting to the ketogenic lifestyle.

## Why Is There A Warning On The Canadian Version Of The Electrolyte Powder

# Why is there a warning on the Canadian version of the Electrolyte Powder?

The statement “Not to be used following vigorous exercise” is required on the Canadian Electrolyte Powder label (NPN 80106216) because of the high potassium content (1,000 mg per serving).

 According to Health Canada’s product licensing standards, when a supplement provides potassium at or above certain thresholds (typically ≥975 mg per day), this specific caution is required. The reason is that potassium levels in the body can shift significantly after vigorous exercise or dehydration, and individuals may be more susceptible to electrolyte imbalances under these conditions, especially if they have kidney issues or are taking medications that affect potassium levels.

The warning is part of Health Canada’s broader safety guidance for high-potency electrolyte products, aimed at helping reduce the risk of complications such as low blood pressure, irregular heart rhythms, or muscle weakness when potassium is consumed inappropriately during recovery.

## Is Licorice Root In Supplements Heathy

# Is licorice root in supplements heathy?

Licorice root in supplements can be healthy when used appropriately. Dr. Berg highlights its numerous benefits, such as helping to balance cortisol levels, reducing inflammation, supporting liver detoxification, and aiding conditions like ulcers, gastritis, and viral hepatitis. It is also an adaptogen, meaning it helps the body manage stress by regulating cortisol levels.

Dr. Berg uses licorice root in his Adrenal Stress Advanced Formula supplement because of its adaptogenic properties and ability to support adrenal health and stress relief. However, he cautions against excessive use, as it can lead to side effects like potassium loss, sodium retention, or increased blood pressure in sensitive individuals.

## How To Reshape Your Face

# How to Reshape Your Face

**High Cortisol and Moon Face: Understanding the Connection**

One of the most noticeable signs of Cushing's syndrome, a condition caused by elevated cortisol levels, is a "moon face." This facial fullness is due to fat redistribution triggered by chronically high cortisol. The medication Prednisone can also cause a similar effect.

**Cortisol's Impact on Your Body**

Cortisol not only shifts fat to your face and midsection, creating a hump on your back and red cheeks, but it also weakens your muscles and thins your legs. Internally, it can raise your cholesterol and lipids, disrupt your sodium and potassium balance, elevate your blood pressure, and compromise your immune system.

**The Insulin Connection**

High cortisol indirectly contributes to facial puffiness by converting protein into glucose. This elevates insulin levels, promoting fat storage and making fat loss more difficult. Factors like carb intake, frequent eating, certain oils, nutrient deficiencies, stress, overexercising, and medications can also trigger insulin.

**5 Strategies for a Leaner Face**

1. **Reduce Meal Frequency:** Implement intermittent fasting and avoid snacking to encourage your body to burn stored fat for energy.

2. **Dietary Changes:** Cut down on carbohydrates, especially sugar and starch. Refer to my card cutout for a list of ingredients to avoid.

3. **Boost Protein Intake:** Include high-quality, grass-fed meat like beef, lamb, or goat in your diet.

4. **Manage Stress:** Engage in activities that promote relaxation and well-being, such as walking, exercise, and physical work. Reduce time spent on your phone.

5. **Prioritize Sleep:** Ensure you're getting adequate sleep. If possible, even try to go back to sleep if you wake up early.

## Does Potassium Deficiency Cause Diabetes

# Does potassium deficiency cause diabetes?

Diuretics are commonly used to treat high blood pressure. But, they come with side effects, including an increased risk of developing diabetes.    On the flip side, ace inhibitors, also used to treat high blood pressure, protect against diabetes and lower the risk of diabetes.  I believe the big difference between these two drugs, when it comes to diabetes risk, is what they do to potassium.

Diuretics deplete potassium, and without enough potassium, insulin can't be released very well. A deficiency of insulin can then lead to diabetes. Ace inhibitors increase potassium by helping to prevent the loss of potassium.  So why do we even need a drug—why aren't we just consuming more potassium? Many people support healthy blood pressure and healthy blood sugar levels by taking potassium. 

The RDAs for potassium are 4700 mg. It might surprise you, but bananas aren't a good source of potassium. A few of the best sources of potassium are:  

• Leafy greens 

• Potatoes 

• Avocado 

• Electrolyte powder

## The Adrenal Potassium Connection

# The Adrenal Potassium Connection

Potassium is essential for our body's overall function, playing a vital role in quality sleep, supporting neural activities, and stabilizing blood sugar and blood pressure. A healthy adult typically requires 4,700 milligrams of potassium daily, equating to seven to ten cups of potassium-rich foods.

However, there are two exceptions where this recommended intake does not apply: Cushing's syndrome and Addison's disease.

Cushing's syndrome occurs when the adrenal gland overproduces cortisol, leading to symptoms like weight gain, fatigue, and high blood pressure. When cortisol levels eventually drop, it can result in adrenal fatigue. Adding potassium in this scenario may not be beneficial.

Addison's disease, conversely, is characterized by insufficient cortisol levels. This can cause inflammation, weight loss, pigmentation changes, and a weakened immune system. In this case, increasing potassium intake could worsen the condition. Consuming salt is a more suitable approach for individuals with Addison's.

Understanding these conditions and their relationship with potassium is crucial for maintaining optimal health. Consult your doctor for personalized advice if you have Cushing's syndrome or Addison's disease.

## What Are Some Really Serious Symptoms Of Potassium Deficiency

# What are some really serious symptoms of potassium deficiency?

Extremely low potassium levels can be life-threatening. Seek immediate medical help if you experience the following potassium deficiency symptoms:

- Severe Muscle Weakness: This goes beyond general weakness and involves your muscles not functioning as they should. Severe muscle weakness might even lead to paralysis.

- Difficulty Breathing: This occurs because low potassium can disrupt the muscle function involved in breathing.

- Confusion and Mood Changes: This symptom is more than just brain fog. With severe potassium deficiency, you can become confused or disoriented and have sudden, extreme mood shifts.

---

## What Are Some Severe Potassium Deficiency Symptoms

# What are some severe potassium deficiency symptoms?

As a potassium deficiency progresses, you may encounter more severe potassium deficiency symptoms, some of which are serious:

- Heart Palpitations: Feeling like your heart is skipping a beat or fluttering? These sensations, known as heart palpitations, can be unnerving. While not all palpitations indicate a severe problem, persistent palpitations could result from low potassium. Because potassium plays such a vital role in regulating your heartbeat, an imbalance can throw your heart rhythm off. You might feel an occasional flutter or more noticeable, rapid beats in your chest. If this is something you've experienced, getting your potassium levels checked is crucial.

- Numbness and Tingling: That “pins-and-needles” sensation you get when your foot falls asleep is tingling (also known as paresthesia), often occurring alongside numbness, where you lose sensation. Potassium plays a role in nerve health and function. When your potassium drops too low, nerve signals may misfire. This often presents as numbness or that odd tingling feeling, mainly in your extremities, like hands and feet.

- Muscle Weakness: Low potassium can manifest as muscle weakness beyond the occasional cramp. If you’re having a hard time going about your daily activities due to weakness, look into low potassium as a possible cause. Weakness in severe cases of hypokalemia can lead to paralysis, this is when it becomes a medical emergency.

## Whats The Most Serious Symptom Of Potassium Deficiency

# What's the most serious symptom of potassium deficiency?

Potassium is essential for our health, and we need a substantial amount—approximately 4700 mg daily! Unfortunately, many people's diets are heavily skewed towards processed foods high in sodium and low in potassium, leading to an imbalance in the critical sodium-potassium ratio. Ideally, this ratio should be 2:1 in favor of potassium.

This balance is vital as every cell relies on a sodium-potassium pump to generate electrical currents, which are the driving force behind our nervous and muscular systems. Additionally, potassium plays a significant role in maintaining healthy blood vessels, and a deficiency can contribute to high blood pressure—a condition often overlooked in conventional medicine despite its prevalence.

A lack of potassium can manifest in various ways, including fatigue, muscle problems, constipation, tremors, irregular heartbeat, mental disturbances, headaches, low back pain, dizziness, excessive nighttime urination, swelling, elevated pulse rate, and even an increased risk of stroke. The most alarming consequence of severe potassium deficiency is sudden cardiac death, with a tenfold increase in risk for those with low levels.

To avoid such complications, it's crucial to incorporate potassium-rich foods into your diet. Leafy greens, squash, nuts, shellfish, bone broth, avocado, pumpkin seeds, and sunflower seeds are excellent sources.

Conversely, a diet high in refined sugars, starches, and grains, coupled with stress, steroid use, gut inflammation, and alcohol consumption, can deplete your potassium levels. It's essential to be mindful of these factors to maintain a healthy balance and safeguard your well-being.

## What Steps Should Be Taken If Youre Experiencing Unexplained Back Pain

# What steps should be taken if you're experiencing unexplained back pain?

First try the techniques in the video, and see if your lower back pain resolves. If not, then this could be why you still have lower back pain:

**You could have kidney stones.** They often occur only on one side. You can get them if you’re consuming a lot of spinach and nuts, and not drinking enough lemon juice in water. An excellent remedy for either oxalate stones or uric acid stones is hydroxy-citrate. I don’t recommend any particular brand, but you can research it yourself. It’s a very powerful compound that helps dissolve stones. I believe it’s more effective than potassium citrate.

**To prevent kidney stones, drink lemon juice in your water. Apple cider vinegar is another good remedy.**

**You could have endometriosis,** which is excess tissues growing in your abdomen. There’s a high level of estrogen involved. You could have fibroids, which is also a condition of estrogen dominance, or ovarian cysts. Another possibility is poly cystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS), which is a condition of high levels of androgens. If you have any of these, increase your intake of cruciferous vegetables, eliminate dairy, increase your intake of sea kelp, and do intermittent fasting.

**You also want to go low carb if you have PCOS.** High carbs increase your insulin, which in turn increases your androgens. In other words, do healthy keto.

**You may have an enlarged prostate**, in which case do keto and intermittent fasting, but also avoid dairy.

**Repetitive exercises** may also be the cause of your lower back pain. If possible, reverse the direction of the exercise to balance it out. If you’re a cyclist, the muscles you build up in your legs can throw off your lower back.

**Finally, you may be sitting too much!** Get a foam roller and put it under your back to create the arch it needs.

## Why Are My Feet Shrinking On Keto

# Why are my feet shrinking on Keto?

This condition is called fluid retention. Glycogen is the storage of sugar in the body and when you are consuming a lot of carbohydrates, you are running your body out of the stored sugar. Each gram of glycogen is bonded to 2 grams of water. When you are doing a healthy ketogenic diet plan and intermittent fasting, it is very normal that you will dump a lot of the fluid.

• Glucose holds H2O

• Water follows glucose

• Glucose retains sodium

• Glucose rids excessive amounts of potassium

## How Can I Determine If I Am Salt Sensitive Or Potassium Deficient

# How can I determine if I am salt sensitive or potassium deficient?

People that are salt sensitive are usually told to stay away from sodium. But did you know that we need 1000mg of sodium and 4700mg of potassium RDA? If you are deficient in sodium, you experience headaches, fatigue, lethargy, nausea, and weak muscles. Sodium and potassium work together. Instead of accepting the diagnosis that you need to cut down your salt, try to increase your potassium intake to 4700mg daily. This will especially help with high blood pressure. Increase your potassium by taking supplements, but it's best to eat 7-10 cups of vegetables.

## Can A Deficiency In Potassium Contribute To The Development Of Heart Failure

# Can a deficiency in potassium contribute to the development of heart failure?

**A potassium deficiency is also known as hypokalemia. Potassium is involved in muscle physiology, nerve physiology, and cardiovascular physiology. You can develop atrial fibrillation, high blood pressure, or a high pulse rate with low potassium levels. Low potassium can also lead to insulin resistance and cravings for carbs.**

The symptoms of potassium deficiency include:

• Tiredness

• Leg cramps

• Weakness

• Constipation

• Tremors

A recent article highlights the fact that maintaining normal potassium levels is vital to supporting a healthy heart. Potassium can help reduce your risk of artery disease, stroke, and heart attack. It can also help support your artery elasticity.

**The best sources of potassium are:**

• Beet tops

• Vegetables

## Can A Ketogenic Diet Help Reverse Kidney Disease

# Can a ketogenic diet help reverse kidney disease?

High levels of glucose and insulin create oxidative damage to four tissues; brain (nerves), heart, eye, and kidney. B-hydroxybutyrate that is in ketone can provide an alternative fuel, it also has benefits for the kidney and decreases oxidative stress. Ketosis can counter the damage from a high-carb diet.

**Important Points:**

• Potassium is protective of the kidney

• Certain amino acids can slow progression of kidney damage

• It is important to consume nutrient-dense foods – it protects against the side effects and complications of the oxidation

• low carb diet – it is very beneficial to the kidney

***We recommend consulting with your doctor before making any dietary changes, especially if you have any existing health conditions.***

## Whats The Most Important Electrolyte

# What's the most important electrolyte?

Your heart, your fluid, your energy, and your nutrients in and out of the cell is dependent on the sodium and potassium pump. However, potassium is the most difficult to get from the diet. High levels of cortisol (stress), insulin, sugar, diuretics, excessive salt, and surgery, all can deplete potassium. However, you need between 7-10 cups of salad or veggies to get your daily requirement of 4700mg.

## What Foods Should I Avoid To Fall Asleep Faster

# What foods should I avoid to fall asleep faster?

**Things that can prevent sleep:**

**1\. Snacking**

When you snack, you’re triggering insulin, which can lead to insulin resistance. This can cause frequent urination at night and sleep apnea.

**2\. Sugar**

Consuming sugar can lead to insulin resistance. It can also deplete your potassium. Potassium relaxes the body.

**3\. Protein**

Protein is a stimulant and will wake you up. Make sure you only have a moderate amount of protein with vegetables. Also, make sure you don’t have your protein too late at night.

**4\. Coffee and tea**

Coffee and tea contain caffeine, which is a stimulant. One small cup of coffee or tea without sugar is fine.

**5\. Alcohol**

Alcohol can dehydrate you, affect your liver, and affect your hormones, which can keep you up at night.

**6\. Protein and sugar**

Combining protein and sugar will raise insulin and can lead to insulin resistance, which will prevent sleep.

**7\. Drinking excessive amounts of water**

Drink when you’re thirsty. Having lemon juice or apple cider vinegar with your water is more hydrating than water alone.

## Is Sodium An Important Ingredient In Electrolyte Powder

# Is sodium an important ingredient in Electrolyte Powder?

Sodium plays a crucial role in electrolyte powders for several reasons:

1. **Fluid Balance**:

    - Sodium helps manage water distribution in your body, ensuring that cells don't either shrink or bloat with too much water. This balance is essential for maintaining proper hydration levels.

2. **Electrical Currents**:

    - Sodium is vital for creating electrical currents that facilitate various physiological functions, including nerve signal transmission and muscle function.

3. **Blood Pressure Regulation**:

    - Sodium helps regulate blood pressure. An imbalance in sodium levels can lead to either high or low blood pressure, both of which can have significant health implications.

4. **Nutrient Exchange**:

    - The sodium-potassium pump, a critical cellular mechanism, actively transports potassium into and shuffles sodium out of cells. This process is essential for nutrient exchange and waste removal at the cellular level.

5. **Energy Production**:

    - Sodium is necessary for maintaining an electrical charge within cells, which is crucial for producing adenosine triphosphate (ATP), the body's main energy currency.

These functions underscore the importance of sodium in electrolyte powders, making it a key component for maintaining overall health and physiological balance.

## Are Diuretics Helpful For High Blood Pressure

# Are diuretics helpful for high blood pressure?

The most common treatment for high blood pressure is diuretics. But, diuretics can cause you to lose both sodium and potassium.  People who are salt sensitive or who have symptoms of a sodium deficiency are really deficient in potassium.

Sodium and potassium work together in the body, and you need twice as much potassium as you do sodium. The average person needs 2300mg of sodium and 4700mg of potassium per day.

## Why Do I Feel Sleepy After Eating Salads

# Why do I feel sleepy after eating salads?

## **Post-Meal Fatigue from Salads**

**Feeling tired after a salad? Here's why:**

Gut Bacteria and Fiber:

\- Salads are high in fiber.

\- Gut bacteria ferment fiber, producing short-chain fatty acids.

\- This process can signal the brain to slow down, causing fatigue.

\- Too much fiber too quickly can overwhelm your digestive system, leading to bloating and tiredness.

**Misconceptions:**

\- Potassium: Essential for health, not likely to cause drowsiness in salad amounts.

\- Hidden Sugars: Usually not enough in salads to cause an energy crash.

**Main Point:**

\- High fiber in salads can lead to post-meal fatigue due to digestion.

## Is Coconut Milk Or Water Keto Friendly

# Is coconut milk or water keto-friendly?

**Canned coconut milk (1 cup):**

Fat—58g

Carb—13g

Fiber—5g

Net carb—8g

Potassium—631g

**Silk coconut milk (1 cup):**

Fat—4g

Carb—1g

Potassium—310g

Depending on what type of coconut milk you get, it’s going to be more or less keto-friendly, but even 8g of carbs aren’t too bad. You just want to make sure you have less than 20g-30g of carbs per day to really get into ketosis.

**Overall, is coconut milk keto-friendly? Yes.** And, it works great in coffee and in all kinds of keto-friendly recipes.

**Coconut water (1 cup):**

Fat—0.5g

Carb—11g

Potassium—600mg

Sodium—282mg

A lot of people consume coconut water for electrolytes because the potassium/sodium ratio is pretty good. I do think the carbs are a bit too high for keto. But, depending on how many other carbs you have in a day, you may still be able to get away with it. It’s definitely much better than juice or soda.

## Can I Eat Bananas On Keto

# Can I eat bananas on keto?

No, due to high sugar and fat content.

Many people think that bananas are the best source of potassium. Although bananas do have some potassium, you would have to consume 12 bananas, on average, to get the amount of potassium that your body needs on a daily basis.

We need about 4700 mg of potassium each day and bananas only have between 300 and 400 mg. To put this amount of potassium in perspective, that would be 7 to 10 cups of salad per day.
