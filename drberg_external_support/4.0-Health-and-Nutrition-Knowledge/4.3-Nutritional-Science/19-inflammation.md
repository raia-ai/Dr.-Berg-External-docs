## What Factors Contribute To The Poor Absorption Of Curcumin In The Body

# What factors contribute to the poor absorption of curcumin in the body?

Curcumin is the main polyphenol or phytonutrient in the spice turmeric.

**Benefits of curcumin:**

• It has powerful antioxidant properties

• It’s a powerful anti-inflammatory

• It can be effective for exercise-induced inflammation

• It may help with muscle soreness

• It may help with exercise recovery

• It may help with arthritis

• It may help with anxiety

• It has been shown to be effective for metabolic syndrome

• It may be effective for degenerative eye conditions

The only problem is that curcumin doesn’t absorb well in the body. It’s fat-soluble, which means unless you take it in a certain way, you probably won’t absorb much of it.

**How to increase the absorption of curcumin:**

1\. Take it with piperine (black pepper)

2\. Take it with fat

3\. Heat it slightly

## Is Pork Meat Inflammatory

# Is pork meat inflammatory?

Yes, pork can be inflammatory, especially if it is commercially bought and highly processed. Here are some key points from Dr. Berg's recommendations:

- **Commercially Bought Pork**: Commercially bought pork is often highly processed and may contain GMO grains, soy, and corn in the animal feed. Additionally, antibiotics and arsenic-based drugs are commonly used in livestock treatments, which can contribute to inflammation.

- **Formaldehyde in Feed**: Formaldehyde is sometimes used in pork feed to fight off bacteria, which can pose serious health risks and contribute to inflammation.

- **Processed Meats**: Processed meats like bacon and hot dogs, which are often made from pork, are high in trans fats and can increase inflammation in the body.

To reduce inflammation, it is recommended to choose pasture-raised or grass-fed pork, which is less likely to contain harmful additives and is higher in beneficial nutrients.

## Should I Cook Turmeric

# Should I cook turmeric?

You would think that heat would destroy all compounds. But, in the case of certain herbal remedies, heat actually seems to enhance certain phytonutrients.

In an interesting study, they tested roasting, boiling, and cooking turmeric at temperatures of 180 degrees Celcius or 356 degrees Fahrenheit for 70 minutes. They measured the total antioxidant capacity.

They found three very powerful antioxidants not only survived but were enhanced with this heat. This is called thermal degradation. It enhances the concentration and increases the solubility of certain phytonutrients.

**3 powerful phytonutrients in turmeric:**

**1\. Ferculic acid**

• It’s an antioxidant

• It helps protect the skin

• It helps counter sun damage

**2\. 4 vinyl guaiacol:**

• It enhances Nrf2 (decreases cellular stress and increases antioxidant defense mechanism)

**3\. Vanillin**

• It’s an antioxidant

• It’s an anti-inflammatory

• It’s antimicrobial
