## What Are The Potential Health Implications Of Alkalizing The Body And  Fd21D3

# What are the potential health implications of alkalizing the body, and how does this approach influence systemic pH balance and overall physiological function?

The alkaline-cancer myth is that if you alkalize your body, you will be better protected against cancer. This is not true.

The first question you have to ask is, what part of the body are they even talking about? The stomach, intestines, saliva, urine, and blood all have different pH levels. Are they saying that you need to alkalize the entire body? This would cause devastating effects.

It’s true that tumors grow faster in an acidic environment; however, tumors and cancers make an acidic environment.

No studies show that alkalizing the body will reduce the risk of cancer.

Cruciferous vegetables are incredible for lowering the risk of cancer. The nutrients in cruciferous vegetables help cut off the blood supply to cancerous cells, making it far more difficult for them to live and replicate.

## How Can I Enhance And Optimize My Bodys Antioxidant Defense System

# How can I enhance and optimize my body's antioxidant defense system?

Antioxidants are crucial for neutralizing free radicals and oxidative damage, preserving DNA integrity and overall health. They can be endogenous (produced by the body) or exogenous (from food or supplements). Glutathione from sources like beef and cruciferous vegetables, and selenium from Brazil nuts and fish, are powerful examples. Maintaining a diverse antioxidant network helps mitigate oxidative stress, supported by a healthy diet, supplements, stress management, adequate sleep, exercise, and intermittent fasting.

## What Are The Common Causes Of Low Back Pain And How Do Factors Such As 020Cd8

# What are the common causes of low back pain, and how do factors such as muscle strain, injuries, and underlying medical conditions contribute to this issue?

If you are experiencing pain in the low area of the back, this can have several causes. Most of them are connected to your kidneys. However, the pain could be due to muscle imbalances or a pinched nerve.

**Cause #1: Kidney stones / oxalates crystallization**

Oxalates are substances that are located in some foods. Oxalates can create crystallization in the kidneys, resulting in low back pain and kidney stones. The best way to resolve such a problem would be to avoid foods high in oxalates.

Additionally, consuming more water and other fluids should help with kidney stones in general. You also should take electrolytes to stay hydrated. Too acidic a body pH or consuming salts in high amounts can contribute to stone formation, specifically uric acid stones.

**Remedies:**

- As a general remedy, do an acupressure technique to relieve pain in the back:

    • watch this video
    • draw an imaginary line through your body from an epicenter of your back
    • massage the area in the front that is directly opposite from the epicenter of your back pain • the best way to know if you have hit the right spot: it will be tender

- Avoid these foods:

    • spinach
    • almonds • chocolate • rhubarb

- Consume lemon water to block oxalates

- Drink more water

- Consume electrolytes

- Consume moderate amounts of salts (reduce if needed)

- If you have too acid a pH (acidosis), alkalize the body:

    - consume more vegetables

    - take potassium citrate

**Cause #3: Too much protein**

Consuming too much protein can affect your kidneys and can result in low back pain. Additionally, if you consume a lot of protein, a large part of it will not be digested and will turn into waste products in your body. Protein should be consumed in moderate amounts daily (3 to 6 oz per meal).

**Remedies:**

- Consume moderate amounts of protein (3 to 6 oz per meal)

**Cause #4: Muscle imbalances and pinched nerves**

Muscle imbalance can cause low back pain. For example if you are developing only one set of leg muscles (like in cycling) without paying attention to additional or opposite ones, you can create additional pressure on your muscles and as result on your back. Another example would be sitting and crossing your legs only on one side and not doing the same with the other leg to balance it out; this can result in a pinched nerve on one side.

**Remedies:**

- If you find yourself repeatedly crossing your legs from one side, alternate and cross from the other side

- If you are cycling, work out your glutes and the back side of your legs to balance the muscles out

- You can also do yoga to strengthen your weak muscles

- As a general remedy, do an acupressure technique to relieve pain in the back:

    - watch this video

    - draw an imaginary line through your body from an epicenter of your back

    - massage the area in the front that is directly opposite from the epicenter of your back pain

    - the best way to know if you hit the right spot: it will be tender

**Other causes:**

- Acidosis

## What Are The Common Symptoms Of Tonsillitis And How Do They Impact Thr 564C88

# What are the common symptoms of tonsillitis, and how do they impact throat health and overall comfort?

Tonsillitis means inflamed tonsils. Tonsils are little glands on both sides of your inner throat. Tonsils are primarily involved in protecting your respiratory (breathing-related) organs from harmful microbes and viruses. In fact tonsils are the first line of your respiratory immune defense.

Symptoms:

- Infection in your throat

- Sore throat

- Inflamed tonsils

- Swollen throat

**Cause #1: High-carb diet**

Over years of practice I noticed a common characteristic of patients who had tonsil problems. Most of them were on a high-carb diet. Eating sugar and refined carbs will spike your insulin (fat- storing hormone), which in turn acts as an inflammatory hormone. This in itself can deplete your body of nutrients important for a healthy immune system.

**Cause 2: Weak immune system**

If you have a weak immune system, this can cause inflammation of your tonsils because they are part of it. Usually, tonsillitis is caused by viral or bacterial infection. Therefore, improving your ability to fight infections and bacteria will reduce the inflammation and improve the health of the body in general, including giving additional strength to your tonsils.

## What Are The Common Causes Of Bedwetting

# What are the common causes of bedwetting?

Bedwetting is a common problem in children, but many adults can have accidents or near accidents too. Getting up to use the bathroom in the middle of the night has the same root cause as bedwetting.

**Cause #1: High insulin**

Bedwetting is caused by high levels of insulin. And that results from a high-carb diet. Carbohydrates spike your insulin levels. Over time, this causes the cells to develop a resistance to insulin--which then causes higher insulin production by your body. As you know, Insulin lowers blood sugar. When the blood sugar goes down your body lets go of excess liquid. This can happen at night.

**Remedies:**

- Avoid sugar and refined carbs

- Avoid grains

- Do an intermittent fasting plan

- Do a Healthy Keto® diet

- Consume vegetables (7 to 10 cups daily)

- Consume vegetable shakes

**Get plenty of insulin-regulating nutrients**

• chromium
• potassium
• B vitamins (nutritional yeast)

## Should I Take Exogenous Ketones To Help Me Be Successful On Keto

# Should I take exogenous ketones to help me be successful on keto?

You probably don’t need this if you are doing the ketogenic diet for real, eating healthily and doing intermittent fasting.

Exogenous means coming externally to the body, versus endogenous which means coming directly from the body. Exogenous ketones have become increasingly popular – promoting getting into ketosis within 3 hours. But doing this doesn’t emphasize correcting your diet, and it doesn’t require you to cut your carbs as low.

Using this sort of product completely defeats the purpose of keto and intermittent fasting. Taking these ketone salts doesn’t necessarily mean that your body is burning your own fat as fuel; you could actually just be burning ketones from the supplement and might not even lose any weight.

When you are on the ketogenic diet you create your own endogenous ketones by decreasing your carbs and using your own body fat as fuel.

## What Lifestyle Changes Can Promote Longevity Improve Health And Reduce Eefbbf

# What lifestyle changes can promote longevity, improve health, and reduce age-related diseases?

If we look at risk factors for heart disease, high LDL increases your risk by 38 percent. But insulin resistance increases your risk by 540 percent.

Other risk factors for cardiovascular disease, like diabetes, metabolic syndrome, and hypertension, can be caused by insulin resistance. This seems to mean that insulin resistance is the biggest risk factor for premature cardiac death.

The most popular mainstream treatment for high cholesterol is statin drugs. Studies have shown that statins can potentially lead to insulin resistance and diabetes. Healthy mitochondria are essential to longevity. Statins may also impair the mitochondria and increase apoptosis (death of the mitochondria).

An interesting study links higher LDL cholesterol to inversely affecting mortality. This means that having higher LDL may help extend your lifespan. Cholesterol is involved in a myriad of functions in the body—it’s essential for a healthy life.

Blood thinners and even the heart-healthy diet recommended by the American Heart Association can also contribute to insulin resistance and high blood sugar. To live longer, improving insulin resistance, making insulin more sensitive, and stabilizing your blood sugar is crucial.

**The most important things you can do to support healthy insulin and blood sugar include:**

1\. Getting on a low-carb diet (the ketogenic diet)

2\. Doing intermittent fasting

3\. Not restricting cholesterol

4\. Consuming vegetables

5\. Exercising

## Is Keto Not For Me If I Feel Better On Carbs

# Is keto not for me if I feel better on carbs?

To answer that question, first let’s cover why you feel better on carbs.

Usually in this situation you are dealing with low blood sugars (hypoglycemia). With this condition you will find that you can’t go from one meal to the next without feeling irritable or you can’t handle going a certain amount of time without eating some carbs.

When you consume sugar or refined carbs this will raise your blood sugar and you will feel better. However, shortly after you will feel cravings and hunger again. This is because your body will produce insulin to lower the blood sugars.

So if you feel better on carbs it simply means you have insulin and blood sugar problems and a ketogenic diet is definitely for you. Once you get through the transition period (to fat burning), you will feel uplifted, with more energy and better cognitive function.

## I Have Really Bad Acne. Will Keto Help Me With This

# I have really bad acne. Will keto help me with this?

The Healthy Keto® diet can effectively address acne, eczema, psoriasis, dermatitis, and other skin issues by regulating hormonal imbalances. These conditions often stem from high androgen levels, which can lead to increased oil production in the skin and consequently, acne. Insulin plays a significant role in triggering androgens, and its reduction through the combination of keto and intermittent fasting (IF) can help lower androgen levels. IF complements keto by further reducing insulin, offering a powerful approach to managing skin problems by addressing hormonal imbalances.

## What Techniques Can Quickly Reduce Blood Pressure And How Do They Help Fa92D6

# What techniques can quickly reduce blood pressure, and how do they help regulate hypertension?

High blood pressure, a prevalent condition, can significantly impact your overall health. Grasping its intricacies is key to effective management. Let's delve into the causes and strategies to control blood pressure levels.

Your autonomic nervous system plays a crucial role in regulating blood pressure. Stress can trigger an increase, leading to elevated systolic and diastolic readings, indicating the force exerted by your heart during and between beats.

Controlled breathing exercises offer a natural way to manage blood pressure. The "5-Second Breath Rule," involving slow and deliberate inhales and exhales, signals your autonomic nervous system to relax, potentially reducing blood pressure.

Incorporating breathing exercises into your bedtime routine can enhance sleep quality. Consistent practice fosters relaxation and promotes better rest, ultimately contributing to blood pressure management.

Beyond breathing, lifestyle changes are pivotal. A balanced diet low in salt and rich in whole foods, coupled with regular physical activity, can significantly impact blood pressure regulation. Dietary approaches like keto and intermittent fasting may also aid in managing hypertension.

Additionally, turmeric, known for its anti-inflammatory properties, has shown potential in lowering blood pressure. Its active compound, curcumin, may influence blood pressure regulation.

By understanding the causes of high blood pressure and adopting a holistic approach encompassing breathing exercises, dietary adjustments, physical activity, and lifestyle changes, you can empower yourself to achieve better blood pressure control and overall well-being.

## Do Women Need More Carbs On Keto And Intermittent Fasting

# Do women need more carbs on Keto and Intermittent Fasting?

A lot of women ask because when they eat carbohydrates, they feel better. You might be one of them. So it seems logical to conclude you need carbs. When you’re intermittent fasting but not yet keto-adapted, and your blood sugar drops, your brain function takes a hit. You may feel moody, irritable, and have brain fog. Then you eat carbs, and you feel so much better.

But what’s really going on is that your body isn’t responding to insulin correctly. You have insulin resistance. In response, your pancreas makes several times more insulin than is healthy. The combination of high insulin and intermittent fasting crashes your blood sugar, and you feel terrible.

**The solution is to fix the insulin resistance and get your insulin levels normal, not eat more carbs. You heal insulin resistance by keeping carbs low, and by fasting. Once you fully adapt to fat for fuel, your brain will no longer need carbohydrates to function well.
**
It takes time to teach your body to burn fat and be in ketosis. Eating certain foods and easing into intermittent fasting will help you feel better. Give your brain time to adapt to fat burning. If you still get symptoms like brain fog and irritability, add more protein instead of carbohydrates.

**My answer is no, women don’t need more carbs on keto and intermittent fasting. You just need to fully understand what’s happening within your body. Then move gradually into the keto diet and intermittent fasting.**

## Whats The Difference Between Lazy And Dirty Keto

# What's the difference between lazy and dirty keto?

**Lazy keto** - Lazy keto is when you do not count calories or ketones. You primarily focus on counting carbohydrates—and keeping them below 50 grams per day. Lazy keto also involves consuming a moderate amount of protein (roughly 3-8 oz per meal) and consuming high amounts of fat (without focusing on the quality of fat).

**Dirty keto** \- Dirty keto completely ignores the quality of your nutrients. Those who do dirty keto often eat at fast-food restaurants and consume processed cheese and meats. Dirty keto may also include a lot of MSG, low-nutrient foods, non-organic ingredients, high amounts of omega-6 fatty acids, and trans fats. On dirty keto, you might consume a heavily-processed fast-food burger without the bun, which—although keto-friendly—contains a lot of unhealthy ingredients. Overall, the difference between lazy keto and dirty keto is that dirty keto doesn’t focus on the quality of food at all. Those on dirty keto may consume some very unhealthy foods.

## What Interventions Can Quickly Relieve Abdominal Gas And Bloating And  66Cb68

# What interventions can quickly relieve abdominal gas and bloating, and how do they address the underlying causes?

Struggling with abdominal gas and bloating? You're not alone! This common issue affects countless individuals, causing discomfort and frustration. But don't worry, there are solutions.

**What Causes Gas and Bloating?**

Before jumping to conclusions like irritable bowel syndrome or celiac disease, consider these four potential culprits:

1. **SIBO (Small Intestinal Bacterial Overgrowth):** An excess of bacteria in the small intestine leads to gas production (hydrogen and methane), causing bloating, constipation, and abdominal pain. A hydrogen methane breath test can diagnose SIBO.

2. **Too Many Methanogens:** These microbes produce hydrogen and methane gas, consuming starches and sugars. An imbalance can cause bloating and constipation.

3. **Low Stomach Acid:** Insufficient stomach acid hinders protein digestion, leading to gas and bloating. It can also contribute to SIBO development.

4. **Decreased Bile:** Bile, produced by the liver, is essential for fat digestion. Insufficient bile can cause gas, bloating, and pain on the right side of the body.

**What to Do About It:**

1. **Lower Carbs and Fiber:** Reduce your intake of carbohydrates and fiber, especially for a month if your symptoms are severe. Opt for cooked vegetables over raw and avoid synthetic carbohydrates and fibers. Intermittent fasting can also help clear your system.

2. **Add Betaine HCL:** This natural amino acid compound increases hydrochloric acid, aiding protein digestion, mineral absorption, and microbe elimination. Take supplements before meals, avoiding calcium at the same time.

3. **Avoid Dairy:** If you're lactose intolerant or sensitive to casein, eliminate dairy products from your diet.

4. **Add Bile Salts:** If you experience pain on your right side, try purified bile salts after meals. Combine with betaine hydrochloride before meals for optimal digestion.

**Conclusion:**

By understanding these potential causes and following the recommended solutions, you can overcome gas, bloating, and related digestive issues. Remember, consult your doctor for personalized advice and diagnosis.

## What Can I Do To Address Sleep Problems While Following A Ketogenic Diet

# What can I do to address sleep problems while following a ketogenic diet?

If you aren’t following Healthy Keto®, you may be lacking sleep-promoting nutrients like B vitamins, magnesium, calcium, and potassium. This deficiency can occur during the transition phase as your body adapts to burning fat for energy—a process that initially leads to increased alertness since fat provides more than double the energy storage potential compared to carbohydrates. As a result, you might feel more awake, while carbohydrates can cause fatigue, often making you feel sleepy after consumption.

To improve your sleep and expedite the transition to ketosis, consider increasing your intake of minerals, particularly potassium, as well as B vitamins, and incorporating more daily exercise to utilize excess energy. Other factors that may contribute to sleeplessness on a ketogenic diet include excessive coffee consumption, not practicing intermittent fasting, low calcium levels, bloating from kale, or waking up due to fluctuations in blood sugar levels. Addressing these issues can help enhance your overall sleep quality while adapting to the ketogenic lifestyle.

## Whats The Best Probiotic For An Autoimmune Condition

# What's the best probiotic for an autoimmune condition?

An autoimmune disease is a condition in which the immune system attacks its own tissues. It is typically characterized by low regulatory T-cells and high Th17 and Th2 cells. T-reg cells prevent autoimmune diseases by supporting an appropriate immune response. There are natural ways to support your immune system so that it operates at an optimal level. Poor gut health and gut inflammation can block the function of vitamin D3. Without enough vitamin D, T-reg cells do not work properly.

The majority of the population is vitamin D-resistant. To support the immune system, you need 8,000 to 10,000 IU of vitamin D daily, but even more to overcome resistance. Poor gut health, inflammation, and low vitamin D are a perfect storm for developing an autoimmune condition.

B. infantis and L. reuteri are vital for your immune system, but many people don’t have them because these probiotics are very sensitive to antibiotics. These two important microbes help prevent autoimmune diseases, greatly affect T-reg cells, and suppress inflammatory immune cells.

L. reuteri helps increase oxytocin, one of the most potent anti-stress hormones. High cortisol levels mean high stress, which suppresses the immune system. The best way to consume l. reuteri is to cultivate it in a dairy product.

If you’re low in selenium, you will have higher amounts of inflammatory immune cells. Selenium helps lower Th17, Th2 cells, and auto-antibodies involved in autoimmune disorders. Prolonged fasting can improve your immune system by increasing T-reg cells and creating new stem cells.

## What Foods Can Help To Reverse Kidney Damage

# What foods can help to reverse kidney damage?

Potassium protects kidney health in several ways. It helps lower high blood pressure, which damages the kidneys and protects against kidney stones. Too much sodium can be hard on the kidneys, but the remedy is more potassium.

A proper diet with adequate vitamin D, potassium, and magnesium can significantly improve kidney health.

The following foods protect the kidneys from damage and support kidney health:

1\. Vegetables: asparagus, celery, bell peppers, cabbage, cauliflower, garlic

2\. Magnesium-rich foods: pumpkin seeds, leafy greens, avocadoes, magnesium glycinate

3\. Probiotic-foods: kefir, yogurt, sauerkraut, kimchi

4\. Moderate amounts of high-quality protein

5\. High-antioxidant foods: strawberries, blueberries, blackberries, beets

6\. Quercetin: onions

7\. Extra virgin olive oil

Consuming tea is a great way to stay hydrated and support kidney health. Polyphenols found in tea are very beneficial for the kidney. Green, nettle, dandelion, turmeric, and decaffeinated black tea are all great options. Frequent eating can overtax the kidneys' filtration system. A low-carb diet and intermittent fasting are very beneficial for kidney health. Intermittent fasting can decrease the stress on the kidneys and significantly reduce insulin. Too much insulin can be damaging to the kidneys.

## How Breakfast Affects Your Day

# How breakfast affects your day?

What you eat for breakfast affects your ability to focus, your creative ability to solve problems, and how well you sleep at night. A carb-heavy breakfast promotes insulin resistance, which inhibits your ability to absorb fuel. The first place you’ll notice this is in your brain.

Ketones are a much better fuel for your brain than sugar. To make ketones, you need to lower your carbs and sugar. You can also produce ketones by fasting. While fasting, your body must convert to making ketones for energy. Carbohydrate breakfast foods leave you hungry within an hour-and-a-half of eating. Sugary cereal is a poor choice for breakfast. Magic Spoon or keto-friendly granola without added sugar is a better option.

Oatmeal is generally one of the most ultra-processed foods. If you want to eat oatmeal for breakfast, look for regular oatmeal without sugar. The best option for oatmeal is steel-cut oats, although they take longer to cook. Oatmeal and wheat are heavily sprayed with glyphosate, which has been shown to cause cancer and problems with your gut. Choose organic to avoid this problem.

Replacing your breakfast food with protein such as meat, bacon, and eggs can significantly change your energy levels and cognitive function. Eggs and bacon are the perfect healthy morning breakfast. You can also add avocado or cheese. Cheese is very nutritious, a good source of protein, and has good bacteria due to the fermentation process. Yogurt is a great breakfast option. Choose organic Greek or Bulgarian yogurt without added sugar, or make your own yogurt. Instead of giving your kids Wonder bread, try a sprouted bread like Ezekiel bread. Add peanut butter for extra protein. Red meat and pork sausage are also great breakfast foods.

It’s important to prioritize sleep! Losing just one hour of sleep can significantly affect your blood sugar and cognitive state.

## How Can I Remove Skin Tags And Warts Overnight

# How can I remove skin tags and warts overnight?

High insulin can increase one's susceptibility to skin tags. People with diabetes, overweight people, and women with PCOS are at a higher risk of developing them. When you produce too much insulin over a period of time, you can develop insulin resistance. Too much insulin is caused by eating too many carbs or frequent eating. Insulin resistance makes it difficult to absorb glucose. Over time, this deprives your brain cells of fuel, leading to memory problems, concentration problems, and early dementia.

**The solution** is to give your body an alternative fuel source, such as ketones, fatty acids, and protein. To do this, lower your carbs and do intermittent fasting. This will lower insulin and prevent growths like skin tags and warts.

A virus that comes out of remission can create warts if your immune system is compromised. Sufficient vitamin D can support the immune system and put these viruses back in remission. Take 10,000 IU of vitamin D daily, especially in winter.

**Povidone iodine** is an excellent remedy for skin tags. It has potent antiviral and antimicrobial properties, so it’s also good for warts. Iodine dissolves the protein in the skin tag and acts as a dehydrator.

**Garlic** contains allicin, a powerful antiviral compound effective against warts. Because it’s often difficult to differentiate between warts and skin tags, add garlic to ensure your remedy is effective.

**Crush one clove of garlic** and combine one drop of garlic with one drop of iodine. Apply the mixture to your wart or skin tag and cover it with a band-aid. Repeat this every day until your skin tag or wart is gone.

## How Can I Possibly Improve Sperm Count And Quality

# How can I possibly improve sperm count and quality?

Ways to Increase Sperm Count and Quality:

Dietary Changes:

Avoid Soy Products: Soy has been directly associated with lowering sperm count due to its rich content of isoflavones, which are phytoestrogens and may act as endocrine disruptors.

## What Are The Foods That Destroy Kidneys

# What are the foods that destroy kidneys?

Protect Your Priceless Kidneys: 7 Foods to Limit or Avoid

Your kidneys work tirelessly to filter toxins and waste from your blood. Safeguarding these vital organs is crucial for overall health. Unfortunately, several common foods can pose a threat to their well-being, potentially leading to serious complications.

- **Instant Noodles:** Beware of the preservative TBHQ often found in instant noodles, which can be toxic to your kidneys.

- **Foods High in Artificial Dyes:** Those vibrant colors in candies like Skittles come at a cost. The artificial dyes used can harm your kidneys.

- **Fried Chicken:** Indulging in fried chicken occasionally is fine, but frequent consumption can be problematic. The combination of high heat, seed oils, and breading can trigger glycation, a process that can clog your kidneys.

- **Commercial Bread:** Many commercial breads contain potassium bromate, a chemical linked to kidney cancer. Check ingredient lists and choose breads without this additive.

- **Soda:** Phosphoric acid in soda is harmful to your kidneys. Plus, the high sugar content contributes to diabetes, a leading cause of kidney damage.

- **Agave Syrup:** Don't be fooled by its "healthy" image. Agave syrup is high in fructose, which burdens your liver and kidneys.

- **Cereals:** Cereals are often loaded with refined sugar, seed oil, and refined starch, none of which are kidney-friendly. Additionally, some cereals may contain traces of glyphosate, a concerning pesticide.

## What Foods Are Considered Poisonous

# What foods are considered poisonous?

**Beware of these seemingly healthy foods:**

1. **Granola Bars:** Nature Valley granola bars contain GMO ingredients, which are linked to the herbicide glyphosate, a potential carcinogen. They also contain high amounts of sugar, unhealthy seed oils, and refined starches.

2. **Agave Syrup:** Though often marketed as a healthier sweetener, agave syrup is actually 85% fructose. Fructose is processed by the liver like a toxin, and its excessive consumption can lead to health problems.

3. **Flavored Yogurt:** Despite being promoted as healthy, flavored yogurts are often loaded with sugar - sometimes even more than a candy bar! Many of the probiotics in them also won't survive stomach acid. Opt for whole-fat, Bulgarian, Greek yogurt, or kefir without added sugar instead.

4. **Non-Dairy Creamers:** While seemingly a healthy swap for milk, non-dairy creamers often contain unhealthy ingredients like high fructose corn syrup, glucose syrup, maltodextrin, and trans fats. Stick to regular cream or half-and-half, or choose non-dairy options without these ingredients.

5. **Soy Milk:** Soy products like soy milk can have estrogenic effects, which may lead to unwanted hormonal imbalances. Soy milk is also a highly processed food, unlike actual milk.

6. **Fast-Food Lettuce:** Salads may seem healthy, but fast-food lettuce is often coated in preservatives and washed in chlorine. Dressings are also usually packed with unhealthy ingredients.

7. **Puffed Cereals/Rice Cakes:** These highly processed foods offer little nutritional value. One chemist even observed rats dying after being fed puffed cereal!

**Remember:** It's always important to read the ingredients list carefully and choose whole, unprocessed foods whenever possible.

## Bloating   The Ultimate Indicator Of The Right Diet

# Bloating - The Ultimate Indicator of the Right Diet

Have you ever felt like a balloon ready to pop after a big meal or constantly battling the urge to unbutton your jeans? You're not alone. Digestive woes affect a whopping 70% of us, but the good news is that gut health is the key to easing much of this discomfort.

Think of your gut health journey as a puzzle where everything from diet to exercise plays a role. Even seemingly innocent habits like drinking through a straw or consuming dairy can trigger bloating.

Let's explore why certain foods make us feel like we've swallowed a balloon and uncover dietary changes that offer relief. Say goodbye to nights spent on the couch fighting discomfort and hello to a more comfortable you.

The small intestine is your body's unsung hero, breaking down food and absorbing nutrients. Its vast surface area, covered in villi and microvilli, ensures you get the most out of every bite. This intricate design is essential for transforming proteins, fats, and carbs into usable energy.

Your gut bacteria are also crucial players, assisting in breaking down food that your enzymes alone can't handle. A healthy gut microbiome, fueled by fiber-rich foods, is a powerhouse for overall well-being.

But what affects your small intestine's health? Processed foods, seed oils, synthetic starches, and sugars are like unwanted guests, causing inflammation and damage. These troublemakers can disrupt your gut's delicate balance.

Small Intestinal Bacterial Overgrowth (SIBO) is another culprit. It's like an overcrowded party where microbes end up in places they shouldn't be, leading to excessive bloating and fermentation. If you're constantly battling bloat, SIBO might be to blame.

Your diet is your gut's best friend. Fiber, found in abundance in salads, is essential for healthy digestion and stool quality. Gradually increasing fiber intake can transform sluggishness into lightness and energy.

Variety is also key to gut health. By diversifying your plant intake, you introduce new microbes that enrich your gut's ecosystem. Even occasional fasting can give your digestive system a break, promoting microbial diversity and reducing inflammation.

Digestive health isn't just about avoiding discomfort; it's about overall well-being. Your nervous system and colon are interconnected, so nourishing meals are essential for maintaining balance. Magnesium-rich leafy greens are natural peacekeepers, preventing colon spasms.

Nutrients like magnesium, B vitamins, and zinc are vital for nerve function and repair, supporting a happy gut and a happier you. Simple dietary tweaks, like adding spinach to your smoothie or choosing whole grains, can significantly impact your digestive health.

Your body often sends signals about its needs through bloating, constipation, or floating stool. These signs can indicate potential issues with your gallbladder, pancreas, or overall digestion. Bloating might be a whisper from dairy products or a shout from carbonated drinks. Stool quality, whether floating or hard, hints at possible malabsorption or fiber deficiency.

These signs are your body's way of communicating. Listen to them and adjust your diet accordingly. By avoiding trigger foods and making necessary changes, you can say goodbye to stomach pain and hello to improved gut health.

Boosting stomach acid is another key to better digestion. Betaine hyaluronic chloride can help increase stomach acid levels, leading to easier digestion, better nutrient absorption, and a stronger defense against harmful bacteria. However, consult a healthcare professional before making significant changes.

Remember, gut health is a journey, not a destination. It's about finding balance and listening to your body. By making informed choices, incorporating fiber-rich foods, embracing variety, and supporting your stomach acid, you can pave the way to a happier, healthier gut and a more vibrant you.

## What Are The Best And Worst Belly Bloating Foods

# What are the best and worst belly bloating foods?

Feeling bloated after a meal is a common issue, but understanding the culprits behind belly bloat can be a game-changer. Dietary choices and underlying conditions like IBS or lactose intolerance play significant roles in this discomfort.

**Understanding Belly Bloat**

Bloating is that uncomfortable feeling of fullness and tightness in your stomach. It can be caused by various factors, including:

- **Diet:** Certain foods, especially those high in FODMAPs, can trigger gas production and bloating. Eating too quickly or consuming large meals can also strain your digestive tract.

- **Medical Conditions:** IBS and lactose intolerance are common conditions often associated with bloating.

- **Other Factors:** Swallowing air, carbonated drinks, and hormonal changes can also contribute.

**Foods That Fight Bloating**

- **High-Fiber Foods:** Soluble fiber, found in avocado, sunflower seeds, and hazelnuts, can reduce bloating by absorbing water and softening stool. However, excessive insoluble fiber from vegetables and whole grains can lead to gas and bloating. Gradually increase your intake and choose low-gas options like berries, citrus fruits, and cooked vegetables.

- **Ginger Tea:** Ginger has anti-inflammatory and carminative properties, soothing the digestive tract and relieving gas.

**Worst Foods for Bloating**

- **Cruciferous Vegetables:** Broccoli, cauliflower, and Brussels sprouts are nutritious but can cause bloating due to their high FODMAP content. Cooking them thoroughly and consuming them in moderation can help.

- **Dairy Products:** For those with lactose intolerance, dairy can trigger bloating. Try lactose-free alternatives or fermented dairy products with probiotics.

- **High-Sodium Foods:** Excess salt leads to water retention, exacerbating bloating. Choose whole, unprocessed foods, low-sodium options, and increase potassium intake.

**Lifestyle Changes**

- **Mindful Eating:** Eating slowly and chewing thoroughly reduces air swallowing and aids digestion.

- **Hydration:** Drinking plenty of water prevents constipation and bloating.

**Bloating and Fasting**

Bloating during fasting can occur due to changes in eating patterns. Stay hydrated, consume fiber-rich foods during non-fasting periods, avoid carbonated drinks, and consider natural remedies like peppermint or ginger tea.

**Conclusion**

Understanding the best and worst foods for belly bloating empowers you to make informed dietary choices and enjoy your meals without discomfort. Remember, a balanced diet, mindful eating, and proper hydration are key to a happier gut.

## Ways Your Body Tells You   You Have A Disease

# 8 Ways Your Body Tells You - You Have a Disease

1\. Heart attack/cardiovascular disease Symptoms of heart disease include chest pain, left jaw pain, left shoulder pain, and pain that goes down your left arm. You might also feel dizzy or out of breath when walking upstairs.

Vitamin E in the form of tocotrienols and vitamin K2 can help support the health of your heart and arteries.

2\. Stroke Early warning signs of a stroke involve issues on one side of the body. You might also experience slurred speech. If you think you’re having a stroke, get to the emergency room quickly!

3\. Infections If you have an infection, you may experience a tickle in your throat, a cough that won’t go away, sneezing, or a runny nose.

Take 50,000 IU of vitamin D3 and consume zinc, vitamin C, and echinacea. Don’t suppress your fever!

4\. Fatty liver disease If you have a fatty liver, you’ll have feelings of fullness, tightness, or tenderness under the right rib cage. You might experience referred pain in the right shoulder or right rhomboid.

Intermittent fasting and the ketogenic diet may help reverse a fatty liver. It’s also important to avoid alcohol.

5\. Gallstones Warning signs of gallstones include dark urine, stool that floats, light-colored stool, and constipation.

Gallstones are the result of low bile salts, so increasing bile salts may help.

6\. Kidney stones Pain in the abdomen on one side or flank pain can signify kidney stones.

Try drinking 2 ounces of lemon juice with water. Take magnesium glycinate and avoid foods high in oxalates.

7\. Ulcers If you have an ulcer, you might feel burning stomach pain that typically feels better after eating.

Wheatgrass juice powder with water and zinc carnosine may help improve your condition.

8\. Diabetes If you have diabetes, you’ll find it very difficult to skip a meal.

You’ll likely experience carb cravings and need a nap after eating. Keto and intermittent fasting may greatly help improve your symptoms.

## Why Can A Fatty Liver Slow Your Thyroid   Hypothyroid

# Why Can a Fatty Liver Slow Your Thyroid - Hypothyroid?

Fatty liver disease can be caused by alcoholism, but it can also be caused by a diet rich in sugar and refined carbohydrates, with lots of frequent eating. This causes insulin spikes and can lead to insulin resistance.

These dietary choices lead to inflammation and scar tissue on the liver, eventually leading to a condition known as non-alcoholic fatty liver disease(NAFLD).

A large abdomen or gut is one of the most common fatty liver signs, but the best way to identify a fatty liver is through ultrasound.

A fatty liver diminishes your liver function causing your cholesterol to go up, and your bile production to go down. When you don’t have enough bile, you can’t effectively remove cholesterol.

The thyroid gland produces the hormone T4, which is converted to T3 in the liver. A fatty liver causes problems with the thyroid because the liver is unable to convert T4 into T3, the active form of the thyroid hormone.

If you cannot convert enough T4 to T3, you will develop hypothyroidism. When you have a slow thyroid, you build up even more cholesterol. Hypothyroidism also slows down your metabolism and causes weight gain.

Keto and intermittent fasting address the root cause of these issues by improving the symptoms of insulin resistance. You can also increase your intake of cruciferous vegetables and all other vegetables to help reverse a fatty liver over time.

Choline is very efficient at removing fat from the liver, and can be taken as a supplement to support fatty liver disease.

## How Should I Address Vertigo

# How should I address vertigo?

While Vitamin D and Magnesium play significant roles in calcium regulation, there are additional things you can do. Incorporating a proper diet, along with specific lifestyle changes, might help reduce your risk. Let’s explore these further:

### **1\. Hydration: Strike a Balance**

Dehydration can often mimic the sensations of vertigo, making proper hydration crucial for managing the condition. But there's a catch – simply increasing your water intake might not always be the solution.

As odd as it sounds, just like dehydration, excessive water consumption can also disrupt your body's electrolyte balance, potentially making vertigo worse.

Instead, aim for a healthy balance and consider incorporating electrolyte-rich drinks. These drinks can be especially helpful if you're experiencing BPPV symptoms. They are especially useful during a fast.

### **2\. Reduce Caffeine and Alcohol Intake**

Both caffeine and alcohol are known diuretics. This means they can actually exacerbate dehydration by increasing fluid loss, potentially worsening vertigo. So, it’s best to enjoy these beverages in moderation.

Consider limiting their consumption, especially if you're prone to frequent vertigo episodes. Too much caffeine or alcohol can make you go to the bathroom more, which can lead to dehydration.

### **3\. Manage Stress Effectively**

We know that stress negatively affects overall health, but you may be surprised to learn that stress can also worsen vertigo symptoms. The symptoms of BPPV can be triggered by certain head positions, and stress can make these symptoms worse.

Engage in stress-reducing activities such as deep breathing exercises. Experiment with what works best for you to keep your stress in check.  Managing stress can help you find relief from your vertigo.

### **4\. Address Food Sensitivities**

Sometimes, underlying food sensitivities might trigger inflammation and worsen your vertigo. Common culprits include dairy, gluten, and processed foods. If you find you have these issues, trying an elimination diet can help identify any potential triggers.

Once you pinpoint them, eliminating or reducing their consumption might bring you some relief. If you have BPPV, your healthcare provider may recommend certain dietary changes, which could include avoiding certain trigger foods.

## What Effective Strategies Can I Implement To Alleviate Restless Leg Sy Be1A91

# What effective strategies can I implement to alleviate restless leg syndrome and address the burning sensation in my feet?

That condition sounds to me like something like peripheral neuropathy. So hopefully you're taking Benfotiamine. That's for peripheral neuropathy.And it usually comes with alpha-lipoic acid together. Those are two wonderful things for the nerves. I don't know what your diet looks like, but I hope you get on keto and intermittent fasting because that would ultimately correct it.

This is really a problem with this issue with the depletion of vitamin B1 when you're taking so many carbs. On a rare occasion, it could be coming from an imbalance with magnesium and calcium.

## What Are Some Tips For A Balanced And Nutrient Dense Diet

# What are some tips for a balanced and nutrient-dense diet?

1. Focus on [Nutrient-Dense Foods](https://www.drberg.com/blog/the-most-nutrient-dense-food-in-the-world): Fill your plate with whole, unprocessed foods like vegetables, fruits, healthy fats, and lean protein. These foods naturally provide a greater sense of fullness and support stable blood sugar levels.

2. Listen to Your Body's Signals: Learn to differentiate between true hunger cues and emotional eating. This will help you nourish your body when it genuinely needs it and break free from unhealthy eating patterns.

3. Experiment with [Intermittent Fasting](https://www.drberg.com/blog/intermittent-fasting): If appropriate for you, explore intermittent fasting. This can increase insulin sensitivity and give your digestive system a break, potentially making “moderation” with certain foods more manageable. This doesn't mean you can't enjoy a delicious meal once in a blue moon.

The journey to a healthy relationship with food looks different for everyone.

Incorporating more nutrient-dense whole foods while mindfully approaching those more likely to trigger cravings or blood sugar spikes can create lasting positive change without strict adherence to “everything in moderation."

Always consult a qualified healthcare professional to find a personalized approach that aligns with your unique health needs. Your healthcare provider may even suggest you cut sugar intake or get your sugar fix in a healthy way.

## Why Is Fast Food So Addictive

# Why is fast food so addictive?

The Fast Food Industry's Tactics: How They Keep You Hooked and Harm Your Health

The average American consumes 150-200 fast food meals a year, spending $1500-$2000 on this habit. But what keeps us coming back for more, even though it's detrimental to our health?

The fast food industry employs various strategies to maintain our cravings:

- **Color Psychology:** McDonald's uses red and yellow, colors that trigger impulsivity, boost serotonin, and even encourage faster eating.

- **Targeting Children:** Playgrounds and happy meals entice young customers, creating lifelong habits.

- **Upselling & Pricing Tricks:** "Would you like fries with that?" or prices ending in 9 are tactics proven to increase sales.

Beyond marketing, the quality of ingredients is a major concern:

- **Low-Quality Meat:** McDonald's, a major beef buyer, uses factory-farmed beef fed with grains and antibiotics.

- **Processed Ingredients:** Fast food is rife with high fructose corn syrup, inflammatory oils, refined flours, and fillers like maltodextrin.

While fast food may seem like a cheap, convenient option, the long-term health consequences are significant. The inflammatory ingredients contribute to chronic diseases like obesity, diabetes, and heart disease.

Don't be fooled by the fast food industry's tricks. Choose whole, unprocessed foods for a healthier, happier life.

## As Someone With Elevated Cholesterol Is Keto Even Possible While I Eat 31Fee6

# As someone with elevated cholesterol, is keto even possible while I eat only fish?

Absolutely because here's some data that you may not know. Cholesterol many times especially the kind that can invade your arteries is converted from carbs. So if you're doing the fatty fish hence you're going to be fine. Then do the rest vegetables, not the grains, not the sugar because the fatty liver can be coming from nonfat sources. It could be coming from vegan carbohydrates. And so they found that if you do a low carb diet the fat on your liver potentially can reduce to 50% in two weeks.

I would combine the healthy keto with the fish and do an intermittent fasting together. That'll be your best bet. I'd probably add into the mix the milk thistle because that's one of the best remedies for supporting liver and improving liver enzymes. The cruciferous vegetables are great for the liver.

**\*Please keep in mind that the above is not a medical advice. You should see your doctor about any possible medical conditions.**

## What Causes Hives And Itchiness Urticaria

# What causes hives and itchiness-urticaria?

**Understanding Itchiness, Hives, and Bile Salts**

Itchiness and hives can sometimes be linked to low bile salt levels. Here's why:

- **Bile's Role in Digestion:** Your liver produces bile, which is stored and concentrated in your gallbladder. When you eat, your gallbladder releases bile into your small intestine. Bile works with enzymes to break down fats and absorb essential vitamins and fatty acids from your food.

- **Bile Release and Stomach Acid:** Adequate stomach acid (a specific pH level) is needed to trigger bile release.

**Conditions Linked to Itchiness, Hives, and Low Bile Salts:**

- **Acid Reflux and GERD:** These digestive issues can interfere with proper bile release.

- **Gallbladder Removal:** Without a gallbladder to store bile, its release could be disrupted.

- **Liver Dysfunction:** Liver problems can impair bile production.

- **High Cholesterol and Gallbladder Stones:** These conditions may affect bile flow and function.

**Potential Remedies for Low Bile Salts:**

- **Purified Bile Salts:** Bile Salt Supplements

- **Healthy Ketosis and Intermittent Fasting:** These dietary approaches should be discussed with a healthcare professional to see if they could improve bile production and function.

## What Vitamin Deficiency Mimics Dementia

# What vitamin deficiency mimics dementia?

**Vitamin B12: Vital for Brain Health and Beyond**

Vitamin B12 is crucial for brain function. Deficiency can cause symptoms resembling dementia. Here's what you need to know:

- **Why B12 Matters:** Supports healthy brain cells and nerve function.

- **Where to Find It:** It is primarily found in animal products (meat, fish, dairy), though some microbes also produce it. Vegan and vegetarian diets may increase the risk of deficiency.

- **Low Stomach Acid: A Common Culprit:** Stomach acid (HCL) is needed to absorb B12. Age, antacids, and certain medications (like Metformin) can reduce HCL levels.

- **Boosting Stomach Acid:** Betaine hydrochloride may help normalize acidity.

- **Medication Side Effects:** Dementia-like symptoms can be caused by common medications like antacids, sleep aids, blood pressure drugs, and more.

- **Other Potential Nutrient Deficiencies:** Low levels of vitamin B1 (linked to high sugar/carb intake), zinc, and vitamin D can also mimic dementia symptoms.

**Preventing and Addressing B12 Deficiency**

- **Brain-Boosting Diet:** Emphasize fatty fish, seafood, and red meat while following a healthy keto and intermittent fasting plan. This provides B12 and ketones, which are an alternative fuel for the brain.

- **Supplementation:** Betaine hydrochloride may help if low stomach acid is the cause.

**\*Please keep in mind that the above is not a medical advice. You should see your doctor about any possible medical conditions.**

## The Role Of Liver And Adrenals In Blood Sugar Regulation

# The Role of Liver and Adrenals in Blood Sugar Regulation

## **The Role of Liver and Adrenals in Blood Sugar Regulation**

Regarding [intermittent fasting](https://www.drberg.com/blog/the-7-important-intermittent-fasting-rules), the liver and adrenal glands play a crucial role in stabilizing blood sugar levels. These two organs work together to prevent hypoglycemic reactions, making fasting more challenging and dangerous for some people.

I've seen firsthand how important it is to maintain the health of your liver and adrenals if you want to succeed with intermittent fasting. Let's look at how these organs function and what you can do to support them.

### **Understanding Hypoglycemia and Its Impact**

[Hypoglycemia, or low blood sugar](https://www.drberg.com/blog/the-best-hypoglycemia-tip), can cause unpleasant symptoms like dizziness, irritability, and difficulty concentrating.

For people practicing intermittent fasting, these symptoms can be especially problematic and may even lead to fainting or seizures in severe cases.

It's essential to recognize the signs of hypoglycemia so you can take steps to prevent it from derailing your fasting efforts. Some common symptoms include:

- Shakiness or trembling

- Rapid heartbeat

- Sweating

- Confusion or difficulty focusing

- Irritability or mood swings

### **The Interplay Between Liver Health and Blood Sugar Levels**

The liver plays a vital role in regulating blood sugar by storing excess glucose as [glycogen](https://www.drberg.com/blog/what-is-glycogen) and releasing it into the bloodstream when levels drop too low.

However, liver damage from conditions like fatty liver disease or cirrhosis can impair this function, making it harder to maintain stable blood sugar during fasting periods.

When the liver cannot store and release glucose effectively, you may experience more frequent or severe hypoglycemic episodes. This can make intermittent fasting feel like an uphill battle, even if you do everything else right.

According to Dr. Berg, "Hypoglycemic reactions can be prevented by the adrenals and the liver." So if you're struggling with low blood sugar during fasting, it's worth taking a closer look at the health of these two key organs.

## Cognitive Enhancements Through Fasting

# Cognitive Enhancements Through Fasting

Fasting can significantly enhance cognitive functions such as learning, memory, and alertness. It boosts synaptic plasticity, which is vital for forming and strengthening neuronal connections, thereby improving memory and learning abilities. Animal studies indicate that intermittent fasting can enhance spatial memory and increase the expression of genes related to synaptic plasticity.

Additionally, fasting promotes mental clarity and alertness by increasing ketone production, providing a stable energy source for the brain. It also reduces brain inflammation, which is linked to various neurological conditions, including depression, anxiety, and neurodegenerative diseases.

## What Natural Remedies Can Effectively Alleviate Heartburn Acid Reflux  E2Afbc

# What natural remedies can effectively alleviate heartburn, acid reflux, or GERD without the use of medication?

**We're told that the cause of acid reflux, heartburn, and GERD is too much acid. But, I've found that rather than the overproduction of acid, these issues are typically caused by an underproduction of acid.** Two main conditions cause low stomach acid: hypochlorhydria and achlorhydria. Symptoms of both these conditions include acid reflux, heartburn, and GERD. Hydrochloric acid is there to help you break down food, absorb minerals and vitamins, and protect against pathogens. A deficiency in hydrochloric acid can lead to a myriad of health concerns. One of the side effects of antacids or other acid-suppressing medications is a loss of stomach acid. This can temporarily cause someone to feel better but can lead to other health issues.

**Top causes of low stomach acid:**

• Hypothyroidism

• Poor diet

• A suppressed immune system

• Antacids

• Low-salt diets

• Potassium deficiency

• Zinc deficiency

• Iodine deficiency

• Eating too frequently

**Betaine hydrochloride** is the best natural remedy for heartburn, GERD, and acid reflux. However, you shouldn't take it if you have an ulcer, and don't take betaine hydrochloride on an empty stomach. Consuming the Healthy Keto diet® and doing intermittent fasting may also be beneficial.

## Should You Limit Glutamine When You Have Cancer

# Should you limit glutamine when you have cancer?

For Individuals with Cancer, Dr. Berg mentions that cancer cells can consume glutamine, suggesting that if you have cancer, you might need to consider strategies like using a glutamine inhibitor or adjusting your diet. He suggests that intermittent fasting for extended periods and reducing protein intake could be beneficial.

While glutamine is a necessary amino acid for various bodily functions, its consumption or supplementation should be carefully considered in the context of cancer. This implies that direct supplementation with glutamine might not be recommended for cancer patients without careful consideration of their overall dietary and treatment plan.

If you have cancer, **it's essential to consult with your healthcare provider before taking glutamine supplements or making significant changes to your diet, especially regarding glutamine intake**. Dr. Berg's advice highlights the complexity of glutamine's role in the body and the need for a tailored approach to nutrition and supplementation for cancer patients.

## Are My Ketone Levels Elevated Beyond A Safe Range

# Are my ketone levels elevated beyond a safe range?

Ketone levels become a concern when they reach 9 or 10 mmol/L, which is typically only seen in individuals with diabetes who may neglect their insulin regimen. For most individuals, normal ketone levels range from 0.5 to 3 mmol/L. Engaging in fasting can elevate ketone levels, often reaching around 4 mmol/L, while exercise can push levels to approximately 5 or 6 mmol/L. However, it is unlikely for levels to exceed this range in healthy individuals. If you have concerns about your ketone levels, it is advisable to consult a healthcare professional for personalized guidance.

## Does Human Growth Hormone Hgh Help With Tightening Loose Skin And If S 704871

# Does Human Growth Hormone (HGH) help with tightening loose skin, and if so, how does it contribute to skin elasticity and firmness?

**HGH is considered the anti-aging hormone. One of its key functions is anything to do with protein: prevention of muscle mass loss, improvement of the collagen surrounding your joints, and providing a healthy glow to your skin.**

Some people actually get it injected, which I don’t recommend because of the side effects. And it’s expensive, about $1,500 per month. Don’t buy it! Your body makes it in the pituitary gland, and activates it through the liver.

**There are a number of things that will decrease your human growth hormone, including:**

● Stress, with its high levels of cortisol

● Sugar

● High levels of insulin, the result of frequent eating, excessive protein, being diabetic or pre-diabetic

● Overtraining, if you’re exercising too much without enough sleep

● Alcohol

**Now, I’ll explain what increases HGH. They include:**

● Exercise, which can trigger a 400 to 700 percent increase. The key is to do short bursts of high intensity training such as sprints or spin bike intervals.

● Intermittent fasting can increase HGH by up to 1,300 percent in women and 2,000 percent in men. It’s the most potent stimulator of human growth hormone.

● Going on keto, because you decrease insulin

● Getting better quality sleep

● Having a healthy liver. If your liver is fatty or you have cirrhosis, that inhibits the production of HGH.

When you take action to stimulate your own human growth hormone, you can help tighten your sagging skin.

## What Are Essential Remedies And Treatments To Consider When Youre Feel 365De6

# What are essential remedies and treatments to consider when you're feeling unwell or sick?

**To combat an infection, try to determine if you’re dealing with a viral infection or a bacterial infection.**

**Viral infection symptoms will be more systemic.** If you have a viral infection, you’ll notice more body aches and chills. Bacterial infection symptoms will be localized. Fevers are typically higher with a bacterial infection. A sore throat associated with a viral infection is often accompanied by a runny nose and a cough. If a sore throat is caused by a bacterial infection, you’ll feel more localized pain without a runny nose.

**A dry cough** is associated with a viral infection, while bacterial infections are associated with a productive cough. Respiratory infection, the common cold, flu, bronchitis, and infections involving the sinuses and lungs are generally viral. Pneumonia can be both bacterial and viral.

A viral infection typically lasts 1 to 2 weeks. A bacterial infection will probably last a bit longer, but this depends on your immune system. Mucus associated with a viral infection is usually clear or white and green or yellow with a bacterial infection.

**The best viral infection remedies are elderberry and olive leaf extract. For bacterial infections, try garlic, oregano oil, and echinacea.**

**The following remedies for infection work for both viral and bacterial infections:**

•Take a hot bath or shower/dress warm

•Get more sleep

•Take zinc, vitamin D, and vitamin C

•Fasting

•Increase sea salt intake

•Improve emotional state

•Get more sunlight (UVB and infrared rays)

•Take cod liver oil

**Stress, age, and poor gut health can increase your susceptibility to infection. Refined sugar and other refined foods deplete zinc and vitamin C, also increasing your susceptibility to infection.**

## What Can I Do For Prostate Issues

# What can I do for prostate issues?

For individuals experiencing prostate issues, it is important to consider the potential impact of dairy consumption. Dairy products can elevate hormonal levels, including estrogen, which may contribute to prostate enlargement. Reducing or eliminating dairy, particularly milk and certain cheeses, could alleviate some symptoms.

Additionally, many men report frequent nighttime urination, often attributed to prostate enlargement. However, implementing intermittent fasting and reducing carbohydrate intake—particularly by avoiding late-night snacking—can significantly improve urinary retention. Transitioning to two meals or even one meal per day may enable better bladder control, allowing for uninterrupted sleep. This shift in dietary habits may reveal that the underlying issue is related to insulin resistance rather than solely a prostate condition.

## What Common Mistakes Should Be Avoided When Dealing With Acne To Preve Bcd8Fa

# What common mistakes should be avoided when dealing with acne to prevent worsening the condition and promote clearer skin?

**The biggest mistake you can make when you're trying to get rid of your acne is trying to wash the acne off of your face.** Blackheads and acne are not dirt that you can simply wash off. When you use detergents, cleansers, alcohol wipes, antibacterial creams, you are literally destroying your microbiome on the surface of your skin.

Your skin contains millions of microbes that act as a barrier, which is involved in your immune system. When you remove that layer of good bacteria, you lose the bacterial diversity. In turn, this increases the inflammation on the skin—it can even cause acne.

This is also why one of the side effects of antibiotics is acne. Acne involves the sebaceous glands. These glands secrete an oil called sebum. Acne is essentially inflammation of these glands with excess amounts of sebum as well as pus and bacteria formation.

**Acne comes from high levels of androgens, which are hormones.** Your androgen levels spike when you're a teenager. In turn, this causes a problem with your sebaceous glands. What causes excess levels of androgens? Insulin. High levels of insulin can throw off your hormone balance. The cause of high insulin is a high-carb diet.

**If you cut the carbs out, the acne will go away. The healthy keto diet and intermittent fasting are the two best ways to promote healthy insulin levels. Try going keto, and let me know how that works for you in the comments below.**

## What Are Potential Remedies Or Lifestyle Adjustments That Could Help R 4Af2B5

# What are potential remedies or lifestyle adjustments that could help reduce the frequency of nocturnal urination, and what underlying factors might contribute to this condition?

Nocturia is the urge to urinate at night when you should be sleeping, and it can interfere with your ability to get a good night’s sleep.

Nocturia is usually said to be caused by a bladder infection, a kidney infection, prostate issues, or aging. People with nocturia are not typically urinating a full bladder of urine. This means there must be an issue with the sensors in the bladder or the valve of the bladder.

If there’s too much sugar in the blood, a phenomenon known as osmotic diuresis can occur. This causes excess sugar and water to be excreted, which is why diabetics and people who are obese are at an increased risk for nocturia. If you have sleep apnea, you are also at an increased risk for nocturia.

Insulin resistance is the leading cause of obesity, diabetes, and sleep apnea, all of which lead to nocturia. Research has shown that insulin resistance itself can cause nocturia. The best way to address nocturia is to fix insulin resistance. To do this, stop snacking at night and work towards eliminating snacking altogether. Cut down your carb intake to less than 30 grams per day and do intermittent fasting. To speed things up, try consuming one tablespoon of apple cider vinegar in a glass of water before meals and exercise regularly.

## Are There Specific Beverages Known To Alleviate Symptoms Of Depression

# Are there specific beverages known to alleviate symptoms of depression?

Green tea, known for its unfermented leaves, contains active compounds beneficial for health, including reducing depression. Studies show drinking green tea can lower depression rates significantly, with L-theanine contributing to mood stabilization. Green tea affects brain regions like the prefrontal cortex, nucleus accumbens, and hippocampus, improving cognitive function and memory. It also offers anti-carcinogenic, antimicrobial, and neuroprotective properties.

Other natural methods to combat depression include:

- **Exercise:** Similar to Zoloft, exercise reduces depression symptoms. High-intensity interval training is particularly effective.

- **Vitamin D:** Deficiency increases depression risk; sunlight exposure and supplements are crucial.

- **Fasting:** Can enhance bodily functions and reduce depression symptoms due to its survival properties.

These approaches can complement each other in managing and alleviating symptoms of depression naturally.

Inflammation is a vital immune response but can become chronic due to various factors:

1\. **Vitamin D Deficiency:**

\- **Cause:** Linked to chronic inflammation and autoimmune conditions.

\- **Remedies:** Sunlight exposure, vitamin D supplements, and vitamin K2 for calcium balance.

2\. **Allergies:**

\- **Cause:** Triggered by food or environmental allergens, leading to systemic inflammation.

\- **Remedies:** Identify and avoid allergens, use apple cider vinegar, and manage diet.

3\. **Low Cortisol:**

\- **Cause:** Stress-related adrenal fatigue or cortisol resistance exacerbate inflammation.

\- **Remedies:** Support with vitamin B1, improve sleep, manage stress, and consider adrenal support supplements.

4\. **High Insulin:**

\- **Cause:** Insulin resistance from excessive carb intake leads to systemic inflammation.

\- **Remedies:** Adopt Healthy Keto® diet, intermittent fasting, and potassium-rich foods.

5\. **Infection:**

\- **Cause:** Viral or bacterial infections can sustain inflammation if immune response is compromised.

\- **Remedies:** Boost immune system with vitamin D, intermittent fasting, and natural antibiotics.

6\. **Omega-6 Fatty Acids:**

## What Strategies Can Be Employed To Naturally Boost Growth Hormone Leve 386175

# What strategies can be employed to naturally boost growth hormone levels as you age?

In adults, growth hormone is essential for muscle building, fat burning, and overall health, including joints and bones. Aging leads to declining levels, affecting muscle, cognition, mood, and metabolic health.

Factors hindering growth hormone include insomnia, sleep apnea, high blood sugar, insulin, chronic stress, and liver issues. Rather than synthetic replacements, supporting natural production through methods like intense exercise, milk thistle for liver support, a Healthy Keto® diet, and intermittent fasting is recommended.

For ketogenic dieters experiencing muscle dehydration, adequate electrolyte-rich hydration and adjusting carb intake to around 50 grams per day from sources like berries can help maintain muscle health without refined carbs and sugars.

## What Steps Should I Take If I Continue To Experience Bloating Despite  2Edfc3

# What steps should I take if I continue to experience bloating despite using apple cider vinegar?

These are the symptoms of low stomach acid:

● Inability to absorb minerals, leading to a potential deficiency of iron, calcium, or any other minerals

● Decreased ability to absorb amino acids, which can show up as hair loss, loose skin, or incomplete digestion of protein, among other things

● Leaky gut, which can lead to allergies

● Bloating, abdominal pain, and acid reflux

● SIBO, small intestine bacterial overgrowth, when bacteria grow where they shouldn’t, in your small intestine, and whenever you consume fiber or probiotics it gets worse

● An infection in your lower digestive tract

● Constipation or diarrhea

● Sluggish gallbladder

You can take betaine hydrochloride or apple cider vinegar to improve stomach acid. Fasting also helps, as does drinking coffee. But so too does taking vitamin B3 (niacin). Common symptoms of B3 deficiency include anxiety, depression, fatigue, and skin problems, which the B3 you do have will address first, possibly preventing it from making more stomach acid. There’s a condition called B3 dependency, which may be caused by stress or certain microbes. When you’re stressed, your body oxidizes adrenaline and needs B3 to replenish it. And because tryptophan converts to B3, you need enough stomach acid to do so. As well, you need B3 to produce the energy called ATP from the mitochondria in your stomach cells. If you think you have low stomach acid, I recommend you take 50 to 100 milligrams of vitamin B3 per day, or more if you’re really stressed.

## What Are The Primary Causes Of Low Testosterone And How Do Factors Suc A375F1

# What are the primary causes of low testosterone, and how do factors such as age, hormonal imbalances, and medical conditions contribute to this issue?

Low testosterone in men mainly is caused by the excess amount of other hormones in your body that counter testosterone. These hormones are cortisol, insulin and especially estrogen. The main remedy is to decrease the amounts of these hormones, which should greatly improve this condition.

**Symptoms:**

- Decreased libido

- Decreased erections

- Decreased vitality

- Weight gain (midsection)

- Can’t build muscle mass

- Skin thinner and softer

- Voice higher

- Prostate enlargement

- Breast tissue (man boobs)

- Loss of body hair

- Loss of collagen

- Reduction of sperm

**Cause #1: High estrogen**

High amounts of estrogen (the female hormone that is also produced in small amounts in a male body) can greatly lower the amounts of testosterone in your body. Consuming foods that are high in estrogen (like soy or GMO foods) can do that. If you have high amounts of body fat, it can do that too, as human body fat contains certain proteins that convert testosterone to estrogen.

**Remedies:**

- Consume foods that will lower estrogen levels:

    - cruciferous vegetables (natural estrogen blockers)

    - DIM (concentrated cruciferous)

    - white button mushrooms

    - mushrooms in general

    - celery

    - parsley

    - olive oil

- Avoid foods that will increase estrogen:

    - soy

    - vegetable oils

    - GMO foods

    - alcohol

    - soy-fed chicken

    - soy-fed beef

**Cause #2: High insulin**

One of the effects of insulin (the fat-storing hormone) is to lower testosterone in your body. If you are on a high-carb diet, this will increase the amount of insulin produced by your body to lower the blood sugar spikes after meals. Consuming snacks too often will raise insulin level after each of those snacks, too.

**Remedies:**

- Avoid refined sugar and carbs

- Avoid snacking

- Do the Healthy Keto® diet

- Do an intermittent fasting plan

**Cause #3: High cortisol**

Your body is producing the stress hormone called cortisol to help you adapt to stressors from your environment. Cortisol in itself will lower testosterone levels in the body. If the stress is constant, or chronic, this can overwork your adrenals--making them produce excess cortisol too often.

**Remedies:**

- Take vitamin B1:

• nutritional yeast • benfotiamine

- Improve your sleep

    - avoid blue lights (computer/phone) before going to bed

    - disconnect electronic devices from the outlets before going to bed

    - take naps if needed

    - try to go to bed before 10:30 p.m.

- Avoid watching news (bad news can keep you in a bad mood)

- Take magnesium

- Take vitamin D

- Do the Healthy Keto® diet

- Take long walks outside (at least 45 minutes)

- Regularly exercise (don’t overtrain)

- You can also take my Adrenal & Cortisol Support

- You can also take my Adrenal Stress Advanced Formula

**Cause #2: High amounts of stress**

General remedies to raise the level of testosterone in your body

Once you’ve eliminated and remedied the main causes of low testosterone, the remedies below might not be needed. Your body should be producing enough testosterone by then, since there is nothing lowering it or converting it to something else. But you can apply the remedies below as additional ways to elevate your testosterone levels.

**Remedies:**

- Consume more cholesterol (helps to make testosterone)

- Consume moderate amounts of protein (6 to 8 oz of protein in meal)

- Full-body exercise

- HIIT exercise

- Improve sleep

- Consume zinc (100 mg / day)

- Consume korean red ginseng

- Take L-arginine

- Take D-aspartic acid

**Other causes:**

- Aging

- Fatty liver

- Too much iron

- Medications:

    • statins

    - high blood pressure meds

    - medications for diabetes

## What Should I Do If I Continue To Experience Bloating Despite Drinking C169A8

# What should I do if I continue to experience bloating despite drinking apple cider vinegar?

These are the symptoms of low stomach acid:

● Inability to absorb minerals, leading to a potential deficiency of iron, calcium, or any other minerals

● Decreased ability to absorb amino acids, which can show up as hair loss, loose skin, or incomplete digestion of protein, among other things

● Leaky gut, which can lead to allergies

● Bloating, abdominal pain, and acid reflux

● SIBO, small intestine bacterial overgrowth, when bacteria grow where they shouldn’t, in your small intestine, and whenever you consume fiber or probiotics it gets worse

● An infection in your lower digestive tract

● Constipation or diarrhea

● Sluggish gallbladder

You can take betaine hydrochloride or apple cider vinegar to improve stomach acid. Fasting also helps, as does drinking coffee. But so too does taking vitamin B3 (niacin).

Common symptoms of B3 deficiency include anxiety, depression, fatigue, and skin problems, which the B3 you do have will address first, possibly preventing it from making more stomach acid. There’s a condition called B3 dependency, which may be caused by stress or certain microbes. When you’re stressed, your body oxidizes adrenaline and needs B3 to replenish it. And because tryptophan converts to B3, you need enough stomach acid to do so.

As well, you need B3 to produce the energy called ATP from the mitochondria in your stomach cells. If you think you have low stomach acid, I recommend you take 50 to 100 milligrams of vitamin B3 per day, or more if you’re really stressed.

## Can Augmenting Dietary Fiber Intake Serve As A Viable Strategy For All 809237

# Can augmenting dietary fiber intake serve as a viable strategy for alleviating constipation?

The recommended 7 to 10 cups of salad every day is not just for the purpose of fiber, but for the nutrients, phytonutrient, minerals and vitamins. The fiber will help to feed the colon, but if your digestive system is compromised and you don’t have the capacity to digest too much vegetables it will cause gas, bloating and pain.

**Conditions Which You Would NOT Want to Consume Fiber**

• Diverticulitis

• Constipation

• Bloating

• Abdominal Pain

• IBS

• Food Allergies

• SIBO or Small Intestinal Bacterial Overgrowth

• Hemorrhoids

## Can Toothpaste Be Considered A Viable Therapeutic Intervention For Acn 26C514

# Can toothpaste be considered a viable therapeutic intervention for acne management?

Toothpaste is formulated for your teeth, not your skin. There are actually several ingredients in toothpaste that are not good for your skin.

**A few of these ingredients are:**

1\. Sodium bicarbonate This is very alkaline and can irritate your skin. It can also disrupt the natural bacteria of your skin.

2\. Sodium lauryl sulfate This can be too harsh on the skin. It can remove the oil layer and can cause irritation or even a rash.

3\. Triclosan This may make your bacteria resistant to antibiotics.

4\. Fluoride This could create a condition called fluoroderma, which actually looks like acne. If you want nice skin, don’t put toothpaste on it.

**Instead, try these four things:**

• Lower your carbs (get on the healthy keto diet)

• Do intermittent fasting

• Take probiotics

• Avoid dairy

## What Steps Should Be Taken If Youre Experiencing Unexplained Back Pain

# What steps should be taken if you're experiencing unexplained back pain?

First try the techniques in the video, and see if your lower back pain resolves. If not, then this could be why you still have lower back pain:

**You could have kidney stones.** They often occur only on one side. You can get them if you’re consuming a lot of spinach and nuts, and not drinking enough lemon juice in water. An excellent remedy for either oxalate stones or uric acid stones is hydroxy-citrate. I don’t recommend any particular brand, but you can research it yourself. It’s a very powerful compound that helps dissolve stones. I believe it’s more effective than potassium citrate.

**To prevent kidney stones, drink lemon juice in your water. Apple cider vinegar is another good remedy.**

**You could have endometriosis,** which is excess tissues growing in your abdomen. There’s a high level of estrogen involved. You could have fibroids, which is also a condition of estrogen dominance, or ovarian cysts. Another possibility is poly cystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS), which is a condition of high levels of androgens. If you have any of these, increase your intake of cruciferous vegetables, eliminate dairy, increase your intake of sea kelp, and do intermittent fasting.

**You also want to go low carb if you have PCOS.** High carbs increase your insulin, which in turn increases your androgens. In other words, do healthy keto.

**You may have an enlarged prostate**, in which case do keto and intermittent fasting, but also avoid dairy.

**Repetitive exercises** may also be the cause of your lower back pain. If possible, reverse the direction of the exercise to balance it out. If you’re a cyclist, the muscles you build up in your legs can throw off your lower back.

**Finally, you may be sitting too much!** Get a foam roller and put it under your back to create the arch it needs.

## What Factors Could Explain The Phenomenon Of Losing Hair On The Scalp  A6Fff3

# What factors could explain the phenomenon of losing hair on the scalp while experiencing increased facial hair growth?

**This symptom is related to a condition called, PCOS (polycystic ovarian syndrome).**

Insulin resistance causes high androgens and if you are sensitive to androgens, your hair could fall out. But insulin resistance is not associated with PCOS, it CAUSES PCOS. Insulin resistance causes a spike in insulin which converts to androgens and facial hair growth.

**The solution is to do intermittent fasting and healthy ketosis.**

**\*The above information is not intended for diagnosis. If you have any health concerns you should consult your physician.**

## What Are The Various Factors That Can Contribute To Low Testosterone Levels

# What are the various factors that can contribute to low testosterone levels?

Taking statins for high cholesterol can lower testosterone production due to reduced cholesterol levels in the body. Low-fat diets and liver damage can also contribute to testosterone deficiency, manifesting in symptoms like low libido and erectile dysfunction.

Surprisingly, high iron levels, often from supplements or fortified foods, can further disrupt testosterone balance. Accumulating excess iron, especially with conditions like hemochromatosis, can lead to joint inflammation, oxidative damage in arteries and the brain, fatigue, memory issues, and blood sugar problems.

To address high iron levels naturally:

\- Consider IP-6 (phytic acid) on an empty stomach and EDTA to chelate iron.

\- Incorporate green tea and intermittent fasting.

\- Donate blood regularly to reduce iron stores.

\- Avoid iron-rich foods and supplements.

\- Increase zinc intake to support iron regulation.

Consult with a healthcare provider to test iron levels and discuss appropriate management strategies.

## Why Are My Feet Shrinking On Keto

# Why are my feet shrinking on Keto?

This condition is called fluid retention. Glycogen is the storage of sugar in the body and when you are consuming a lot of carbohydrates, you are running your body out of the stored sugar. Each gram of glycogen is bonded to 2 grams of water. When you are doing a healthy ketogenic diet plan and intermittent fasting, it is very normal that you will dump a lot of the fluid.

• Glucose holds H2O

• Water follows glucose

• Glucose retains sodium

• Glucose rids excessive amounts of potassium

## Why Do Triglycerides Elevate On Keto

# Why do triglycerides elevate on keto?

Your fat is a storage place for triglycerides. When you do keto and enter a state of ketosis, the triglycerides are mobilized, and they come out of the fat cell. They’re there to be used as energy.  I believe fasting 12-14 hours before you get your triglycerides tested is very important. This way, the test isn’t affected by what you just ate or drank that may have temporarily caused your triglycerides to be higher. Consuming alcohol or carbs two days before the test can also cause your triglycerides to be temporarily high. 

**A few potential causes of high triglycerides:** 

• A hypothyroid condition 

• A problem with the gallbladder 

• The transitional phase of keto 

• Hidden carbohydrates 

• Hidden fats

## What Are Some Effective Methods For Increasing Oxygen Levels In The Body

# What are some effective methods for increasing oxygen levels in the body?

VO2 max is the volume of oxygen your body can consume over a certain amount of time. You can get this test from doctors who specialize in sports medicine.

To increase your VO2 max, you need to consider two things:

1\. CO2 - CO2 allows oxygen to go deep into the tissues.

2\. Lactic acid - Built-up lactic acid affects your pH and muscles, making breathing and exercising more difficult. Top athletes with efficient mitochondria, who have increased their capacity to absorb oxygen and get rid of lactic acid, have bulletproofed themselves against disease. They also have high VO2 max scores. This makes the VO2 max test a good measurement to help evaluate your overall health. The best ways to increase VO2 max, and therefore, longevity: 1. Exercise • Do HIIT (high-intensity interval training) 2. Increase CO2 tolerance • Practice nasal breathing • Practice holding your breath

3\. Increase your lactic acid tolerance • Do HIIT • Get plenty of thiamine (vitamin B1) • Avoid sugar

4\. Hypoxic training • Restrict air while exercising or exercise at high altitudes

5\. Respiratory muscle training • Try inspiratory muscle training and expiratory muscle training

6\. Plyometric training • Try explosive short bursts of exercise

7\. Fartlek training • Try speeding up and slowing down your pace sporadically while running

8\. Cross-training • Combine different exercises in one workout

9\. Sleep • Sleep eight or nine hours a night

10\. Don’t overtrain • Get plenty of recovery between workouts

11\. A healthy diet • Get on the Healthy Keto® diet • Do intermittent fasting

To optimize sleep quality:

1\. Avoid drinking water after 7 pm to minimize disruptions from restroom visits, especially if you have insulin resistance or pre-diabetes.

2\. Limit caffeine intake to one 8 oz cup of coffee per day, as excess caffeine can interfere with falling asleep.

3\. Control protein consumption to 3 to 8 oz per meal, as too much protein can act as a stimulant.

4\. Expend energy through activities like long walks, exercise, or physical work to help facilitate falling asleep.

5\. Aim to sleep during the first circadian wave around 9:30 pm for easier sleep initiation.

6\. Consider natural sleep aids like calcium lactate to promote faster sleep onset.

7\. Maintain a slightly cool room temperature for optimal sleep, as people generally sleep better in cooler environments.

---

## What Factors Can Disrupt A Good Nights Sleep

# What factors can disrupt a good night's sleep?

Sleep significantly impacts health, particularly heart function and longevity. Poor sleep correlates with disrupted blood sugar, increased cravings, higher cortisol levels, and mood disturbances.

Factors hindering good sleep include high cortisol, low levels of vitamin D, calcium, magnesium, potassium, B12, B1, and zinc. Additionally, poor sleep environments, melatonin supplementation, exposure to blue light and EMF, and stimulant consumption affect sleep quality.

Improving sleep involves cutting out sugar, adopting a low-carb diet, avoiding late or excessive eating, and focusing on relaxed breathing techniques to facilitate faster sleep onset.

## What Are The Underlying Causes Of Air Hunger

# What are the underlying causes of air hunger?

When traditional causes like asthma, pneumonia, COPD, or heart conditions are ruled out, persistent difficulty breathing (pseudo-dyspnea) may persist. Here are some natural remedies for specific underlying causes:

1\. **Silent reflux**: Consider chlorophyll, wheatgrass juice powder, betaine hydrochloride (if tolerated), and diluted apple cider vinegar consumed through a straw (if no gut or esophageal irritation).

2\. **Alkalosis**: Address with betaine hydrochloride (if tolerated), diluted apple cider vinegar, Healthy Keto® diet, intermittent fasting, and TUDCA supplementation.

3\. **Costochondritis**: Try massaging and stretching the spine, and using a mobility stick for relief.

4\. **COVID**: Consider thiamine (vitamin B1) for potential respiratory support.

These natural approaches aim to alleviate symptoms and address underlying causes of pseudo-dyspnea effectively.

## What Are The Potential Health Risks Associated With The Presence Of Gl D19B13

# What are the potential health risks associated with the presence of glucose in urine?

It means that your blood sugars or the glucose in your blood are minimally at 225 or more – this is one of the ways that the body is trying to get rid of the toxic glucose by peeing it out and it is called Osmotic Diuresis.

The complication of having this is it pulls out minerals specifically potassium, sodium, chloride, and more that cause dehydration.

**Low Minerals Symptoms:**

• Headache

• Fatigue

• Confusion

• Purple nails

• Heart problems

## What Are Top Foods To Lose Belly Fat

# What are top foods to lose belly fat?

Cortisol, a stress hormone, converts protein into sugar, prompting the liver to produce sugar from non-carbohydrate sources like fat, ketones, and protein. High cortisol levels lead to increased sugar production, which elevates insulin, and in turn, contributes to belly fat. Consuming a high-carb diet, sugar, or eating frequently also spikes insulin, leading to belly fat.

Belly fat typically appears after the liver becomes fatty, as visceral fat around the organs often results from fat spill-off from the liver. Therefore, the best foods to reduce belly fat are those that lower insulin, decrease cortisol, or support liver health.

Ten foods that help reduce belly fat:

1\. Eggs

2\. Salmon

3\. Cod liver and cod liver oil

4\. Sauerkraut

5\. Cruciferous vegetables

6\. Hamburger

7\. Avocados

8\. Broccoli sprouts

9\. Asparagus

10\. Nutritional yeast (non-fortified)

## Why Arent My Blood Sugar Levels Lowering With Intermittent Fasting And Af83F0

# Why aren't my blood sugar levels lowering with intermittent fasting and ketosis?

You likely have severe insulin resistance with high insulin and poor cell absorption, leading to high blood sugars. To lower your blood sugars, try the following:

**1\. Reevaluate Your Diet:** Ensure you're consuming protein, carbs, and fats properly and eating enough vegetables. Consider reducing your carbohydrate intake—if you eat 50 grams a day, cut it to 20; if 20 grams, reduce to 10 grams.

**2\. Reduce Meal Frequency:** Shorten your eating window by consuming fewer meals.

**3\. Increase Nutrients:** Add B vitamins (from nutritional yeast), potassium (from electrolytes), zinc, and chromium to your diet.

**4\. Exercise:** Regular physical activity can improve insulin resistance.

**5\. Address Health Issues:** Focus on the most significant health issues you have and work on improving them.

**6\. Improve Sleep and Manage Stress:** If you have insomnia or high stress, take steps to address these.

**7\. Be Patient:** It may take more time on keto and intermittent fasting to see improvements in your blood sugars.

## Can Adrenal Fatigue Lead To Weight Gain

# Can adrenal fatigue lead to weight gain?

Adrenal fatigue, particularly chronic stress, can lead to weight gain, exacerbated by poor dietary habits. Cortisol, released during stress, increases energy (sugar) storage as fat when unused, and can degrade muscle mass by converting it into sugar. Additionally, cortisol inhibits fat burning, making ketosis difficult.

Addressing stress sources is crucial. Implementing Healthy Keto and intermittent fasting can help, along with ensuring adequate intake of vitamin D, vitamin C, and potassium.

## What Causes A Stinky Odor After Urination

# What causes a stinky odor after urination?

If you are not on a ketogenic diet and you’re not doing intermittent fasting, but you’re getting a stinky urine odor, it could be a urinary tract infection, liver damage, eating the wrong foods, or not having enough vegetables.

If you are on a keto diet, it could also be ketones that aren’t being burned. This often happens if you’re still adapting to keto. Keto adaptation can take several weeks. Over time, you will burn those ketones, and they won’t cause an odor.

If you have an ammonia smell, it could be that you’re consuming too much protein, or you have liver damage.

**Here’s what you can do for a strong urine odor:**

1\. Liver support - consume plenty of healthy vegetables (beet tops and dandelion greens)

2\. Fluids - drink plenty of water throughout the day

3\. Adjust proteins - lower your protein (3-6 oz is plenty)

4\. Chlorophyll - wheatgrass juice powder is a great source of chlorophyll

## What Strategies Can Be Employed To Address Feelings Of Fatigue When Un 6Fe2Cc

# What strategies can be employed to address feelings of fatigue when unable to fall asleep?

**Try these 7 tips for falling asleep easier when you’re tired:**

1\. No water past 7 pm - Consuming water before bed can cause you to feel like you have to use the restroom, especially if you have insulin resistance or pre-diabetes.

2\. Limit caffeine intake - One 8oz cup of coffee a day should be your limit. Excess caffeine can make it difficult to fall asleep.

3\. Limit protein - Too much protein can act as a stimulant. Keep your protein consumption to 3 to 8 oz per meal.

4\. Use up body energy - Having too much energy before bed can make it difficult to fall asleep. Try using up your energy by going on long walks, exercising, and doing physical work.

5\. Catch the first circadian wave - Your first circadian wave is typically around 9:30 pm. Try to catch this wave to make falling to sleep easier.

6\. Take a sleep aid before bed - Natural sleep aids can help you get to sleep faster when it comes time for bed. Calcium lactate is a great natural supplement that can help with sleep.

7\. Keep your room on the colder side - A warm body temperate may keep you up at night. People tend to sleep better in a slightly cool environment.

## What Are The Most Effective Strategies For Stress Management

# What are the most effective strategies for stress management?

1\. Increase your sleep - If you aren’t getting enough sleep at night, you’re not going to be able to be patient and stress-free throughout the day. Avoid blue light before bed and get 7-8 hours of quality sleep.

2\. Get plenty of vitamin B1 - Vitamin B1 directly affects your tolerance to stress. Get vitamin B1 from a natural source, like nutritional yeast.

3\. Lower your carbohydrates - A high-carb diet will cause significant blood sugar and insulin fluctuations, which can cause significant irritability and boost your stress.

4\. Avoid the news - The news can be overwhelmingly negative, and it can add unnecessary fear and stress to your life.

5\. Exercise - Exercise increases the oxygen in your blood and lowers your stress naturally. Long walks are especially good for lowering your stress levels.

6\. Magnesium - This mineral is great for lowering your stress levels. 7 cups of vegetables and a bottle of mineral water a day will give you plenty of magnesium.

7\. Vitamin D - Get plenty of sunlight or supplement vitamin D. Vitamin D helps reduce stress and anxiety as well as support healthy sleep.

## What Are The Most Effective Natural Methods To Enhance Testosterone Levels

# What are the most effective natural methods to enhance testosterone levels?

1\. Increase your cholesterol intake - Do not go on a low-fat diet! Cholesterol is a precursor to testosterone.

2\. Moderate protein - High amounts of protein can cause insulin to spike, which can disrupt a healthy hormone balance. 6-8 oz of meat per meal should be plenty.

3\. Lower your carbs - Carbohydrates boost your insulin levels, which can lower your T level. A low-carb diet such as keto is ideal for boosting your testosterone naturally. Add intermittent fasting for an extra boost.

4\. Exercise - High-intensity interval training (HIIT) will help stimulate testosterone.

5\. Sleep - Getting enough sleep is vital to normal and healthy hormone levels. Poor quality and duration of sleep can cause an increase in cortisol, which can throw off your testosterone level. Long walks are great for getting better sleep and lowering cortisol.

6\. Lower your estrogen - Testosterone and estrogen oppose each other. If you have high estrogen, you will have lower testosterone. Avoid soy and non-organic products.

7\. Supplements - Zinc, Korean red ginseng, L-arginine, and D-aspartic acid are great supplements for supporting healthy testosterone levels.

The last couple of things I want to mention is that a fatty liver, high iron levels, and statin drugs may also cause low testosterone levels. Make sure you talk with your doctor about these potential problems.

## What Causes Palpitations After Eating

# What causes palpitations after eating?

Palpitations, irregular heartbeats such as skipped or extra beats, can stem from various causes related to cardiac function:

1\. **Digestive Issues (Gallbladder Problems)**: Address with intermittent fasting and avoiding refined carbs and vegetable oils, opting for a healthy keto diet.

2\. **Alkalinity**: Manage through healthy keto practices and incorporating apple cider vinegar to balance pH levels.

3\. **Low Potassium**: Causes include diuretics, diarrhea, antacids, and insufficient dietary intake of potassium-rich foods (7-10 cups of vegetables daily).

Managing these factors can help alleviate palpitations and promote heart health.

## Is Hypoglycemia The Opposite Of Diabetes

# Is hypoglycemia the opposite of diabetes?

Diabetes is hyperglycemia, hyper meaning “high” and hypo meaning “low”.

Hypoglycemia is not the opposite of hyperglycemia - it is the precursor or the thing that will turn into diabetes sooner or later. The difference between the two is that hypoglycemia is the prediabetic state while in hyperglycemia there is already an insulin resistance.

What to Do for Hypoglycemia:

• Intermittent Fasting

• Reduce Carbs

## How Can Fatty Liver Disease Contribute To A Slowdown In Thyroid Function

# How can fatty liver disease contribute to a slowdown in thyroid function?

Fatty liver disease can stem from excessive alcohol consumption or a diet high in sugars and refined carbohydrates, leading to insulin spikes and insulin resistance. This condition, known as non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), causes liver inflammation and scar tissue formation.

Common signs include abdominal obesity and can be diagnosed via ultrasound, revealing diminished liver function and reduced bile production. A fatty liver impairs cholesterol regulation and interferes with thyroid hormone conversion (T4 to T3), potentially leading to hypothyroidism and metabolic slowdown.

Addressing these issues with a ketogenic diet and intermittent fasting can alleviate insulin resistance symptoms. Increasing intake of cruciferous and other vegetables, along with choline supplements, supports the removal of fat from the liver, aiding in the reversal of fatty liver disease over time.

## What Steps Should Be Taken If Conventional Acne Treatments Prove Ineffective

# What steps should be taken if conventional acne treatments prove ineffective?

Let's say you've tried everything to get rid of acne, including the healthy version of keto and fasting, but you still have acne. What can you do? If you haven't tried healthy keto and fasting yet, this combination may be very beneficial to help clear up acne.

A spike in androgens, a spike in estrogen, or a spike in both of these hormones could be what's behind your acne. Stress is one thing that can spike androgens and cause acne. It's important to do what you can to lower your stress levels.

DHT is something that can trigger acne. A few potential remedies for acne in this situation are saw palmetto, stinging nettle root, or black cohosh. A spike in estrogen (estrogen dominance) can be behind acne, especially cystic acne. There is an enzyme called aromatase that converts testosterone into estrogen. A few potential natural remedies for acne in this situation are stinging nettle root, cruciferous vegetables, and DIM.

Your liver regulates excessive amounts of hormones, especially estrogen. There could be something going on creating a buffer. A powerful natural remedy for this situation is milk thistle. Of course, the ketogenic diet and intermittent fasting may be beneficial too.

High levels of insulin can potentially cause acne and many other symptoms. Consuming a high-carb diet could cause high levels of insulin.

Dairy may also cause high estrogen. If you have a problem with acne, cutting out dairy may clear it up.

**Tips to get rid of acne:**

• Avoid dairy

• Avoid sugar and refined carbs

• Lower your stress

• Take certain herbs based on your situation

• Take zinc

• Take cod liver oil

• Avoid fluoride

## What Are The Primary Causes Of Hepatitis C

# What are the primary causes of Hepatitis C?

Hepatitis C is a viral infection that targets liver cells, leading to inflammation and potentially severe complications like diabetes, cirrhosis, and liver cancer. Symptoms include fatigue, flu-like symptoms, dark urine, abdominal pain, and jaundice.

Causes and remedies:

\- **Infection:** Hepatitis C is transmitted through blood contact. Strengthening the immune system is crucial. Adopting the Healthy Keto® diet and intermittent fasting can reduce liver inflammation and aid recovery. Limiting iron intake starves the virus.

\- **Supporting Liver Health:** Consume antioxidants like parsley, cruciferous vegetables, milk thistle, and vitamins (C, E, B complex). Enhance immune function with oregano oil, garlic, and vitamin D. Avoid liver-damaging substances such as alcohol, vegetable oils, and omega-6 fatty acids.

\- **Medications:** Reduce medication intake under medical supervision as some medications can strain the liver.

Managing these factors supports liver recovery and overall health when dealing with hepatitis C.

## How Does Exercise Function As A Natural Antidepressant And What Eviden E17Ee6

# How does exercise function as a natural antidepressant, and what evidence supports its effectiveness in improving mood and alleviating symptoms of depression?

## **Exercise as a Natural Antidepressant**

Finding yourself stuck in the grip of depression can be challenging. But did you know that exercise might help? Yes, moving your body isn't just good for physical health - it's like an antidepressant without a prescription.

### **Exercise's Impact on Energy Levels and Stress**

Regular physical activity is proven to boost energy levels. When we move our bodies, blood circulation improves, bringing more oxygen and nutrients to our cells. This helps us feel more energetic.

Besides giving us an energy lift, exercise also plays a significant role in stress management. It prompts the release of endorphins - our body’s natural mood boosters. So, when life gets stressful (as it often does), getting active can provide some much-needed relief.

### **Exercise for Better Sleep**

A consistent workout routine could lead to better sleep, too. Regular exercisers tend to fall asleep faster and enjoy deeper sleep than those who remain inactive. And because good quality sleep is linked with improved mental well-being, this means less room for depressive thoughts.

## What Are The Main Causes Of High Androgen Levels

# What are the main causes of high androgen levels?

Excess androgens, male sex hormones present in both men and women, lead to symptoms like facial hair, hair loss, and PCOS in women, and hair loss and prostate issues in men.

**Causes and Remedies:**

1\. **Conversion to DHT:**

Enzymes convert testosterone to DHT, exacerbating symptoms:

\- Use spearmint tea, red reishi mushroom, licorice, green tea, black cohosh, chaste tree, and DIM supplements.

2\. **Estrogen Conversion Blockage:**

Glyphosate in non-organic foods inhibits enzyme activity:

\- Avoid GMOs and choose organic foods.

3\. **High Insulin:**

Refined carbs and sugar spike insulin, increasing androgens:

\- Avoid refined carbs, sugar, and snacking; follow Healthy Keto® diet and intermittent fasting.

4\. **High Stress:**

Stress boosts adrenal androgen production:

\- Take vitamin B1, manage stress, improve sleep, and take walks.

\- Supplement with calcium, potassium, and magnesium.

\- Consider adrenal support supplements.

These steps help regulate androgen levels, alleviating associated symptoms and supporting overall health.

## What Are The Potential Causes Of Joint Pain

# What are the potential causes of joint pain?

Joint pain is a problem that can be resolved by nutrition and proper diet. Certain foods and nutrients can reduce the inflammation and speed the recovery process of your joints and bones.

**Cause #1: Nutritional deficiencies**

When you are lacking certain vitamins in your body it can cause a lot of joint pain. This is because these certain vitamins are required for the healthy functioning of your joints and body tissues.

**Vitamin D3** is one of the most powerful natural anti-inflammatory vitamins. It will help with joint pain and reduce inflammation.

**Vitamin K2** is a vital nutrient that helps to move excess calcium deposits from your joints into your bones.

**Vitamin C** helps to develop and repair bones and joints in your body by making collagen (proteins for bones and joints). If you have fatigue in addition to joint pain that’s a good indicator of vitamin C deficiency.

Colostrum is a great anti-inflammatory and a good supplement for joint pain.

**Vitamin D3 (get 20,000 to 40,000 IU daily):**

- Consume cod liver oil

- Get more exposure to the sun

- Take a vitamin D3 supplement

**Vitamin K2** (get 300 to 400 mcg daily):

- Consume vitamin K2-rich foods:

    - grass-fed milk

    - cheese

    - butter

    - goose liver

    - grass-fed organic egg yolks

- Get vitamin K2 supplement (MK-7 version)

**Vitamin C:**

- Consume vitamin C-rich foods:

    - sauerkraut

    - bell pepper

    - berries

    - raw lemons

- Take natural vitamin C complex (not ascorbic acid)

- Avoid refined carbs and sugar

- Avoid snacking

- Consume colostrum for joint pain

**Cause #2: Mycotoxins**

Mycotoxins are various poisons which are released from mold and fungus that can affect your joints and your immune system in a bad way. One thing to know is that consuming refined carbs and sugar will worsen the problem as mold and fungus live on sugar and carbs.

**Remedies:**

- If you have mold in your house, locate and get rid of it

- Avoid antibiotics

- Avoid GMO foods

- Avoid sweets and carbs

- Consume grapefruit seed oil

- Consume bentonite clay

- Consume garlic

- Do the Healthy Keto® diet

- Do an intermittent fasting plan

**Cause #3: Omega-6 fatty acids**

When you consume certain oils that contain omega-6 fatty acids, they can greatly spike the inflammation in your body and this alone can cause you to have joint pain. The solution would be to avoid foods with omega-6 fatty acids and to consume more foods with omega-3 fatty acids (these are anti-inflammatory).

**Remedies:**

- Avoid foods containing omega-6 fats:

- corn oil

- soy oil

- canola oil

- cottonseed oil

- sunflower oil

- vegetable oils in general

- too many nuts

- Substitute with these oils containing omega-3:

- butter

- olive oil

- coconut oil

- cod liver oil

- high-quality fish oil

- Consume fatty fish

- Consume sardines

**Other causes:**

- Muscle compensation

- Rheumatoid arthritis

- DJD (degenerative joint disease)

- Gallbladder problem (indicated by right shoulder pain)

- Injuries

- Sacroiliac (S-I)

## What Are The Possible Causes Of An Irregular Heartbeat

# What are the possible causes of an irregular heartbeat?

An irregular heartbeat can take many forms: slow heart rates, fast heart rates or skipped heartbeats. These are often known as arrhythmias (if they are persistent) or palpitations (if they are not chronic but happen from time to time).

**Cause #1: Gallbladder issues**

Gallstones, bile sludge, and bile duct blockages can cause heart palpitations. Based on an interesting study it was revealed that because of overload and inflammation in the gallbladder, certain signals through your body alter your healthy heart function. One of the best ways to fix this is to reduce the load of the gallbladder by doing intermittent fasting. It will reduce the load on your digestive system.

**Cause #2: Low electrolytes**

Electrolytes are electrically charged minerals that allow the muscles to contract and relax and the nerves to transmit communications throughout the nervous system. The heart is made up of muscle tissue, so if your electrolytes are low you can develop palpitations.

**Cause #3: Alkalosis**

The pH of your blood is important for healthy heart function. If your pH is too high (alkaline), then you can develop a heart arrhythmia. Improving your pH will also increase the absorption of electrolytes in your body, which should normalize your heartbeat. The good thing is that it can be fixed very easily.

**Cause #4: Insulin resistance**

One of the insulin functions is to allow your cells to absorb electrolytes. When you are on a high-carb diet you can develop insulin resistance. This happens because high carbs increase the production of insulin in order to lower the blood sugar. When this occurs too often, your cells will not tolerate high insulin amounts anymore, and therefore become resistant to it. As a result, your cells absorb lesser amounts of electrolytes. The result can be irregular heartbeat.

## Can I Get Rid Of Kidney Stones On Keto

# Can I get rid of kidney stones on keto?

The ketogenic diet itself doesn't directly counter kidney stones, but certain remedies can help prevent them:

1\. Phytic acid can prevent calcium crystallization, a common cause of kidney stones. Increase intake by consuming moderate protein and plenty of vegetables.

2\. Take vitamin C to bind with calcium and prevent stone formation.

3\. Stay hydrated and add electrolytes to your fluids, especially if sedentary.

4\. Drink lemon water and ensure adequate intake of vitamin B6 and calcium-rich foods like grass-fed dairy.

5\. Consider calcium orotate as a supplement, as it may reduce calcium buildup in the kidneys.

6\. Address magnesium deficiency, but if consuming ample vegetables, additional supplementation may not be necessary.

If you've strayed from the keto plan, simply resume it along with intermittent fasting. Gradually transition into ketosis, reduce snacking, and supplement with potassium, sodium, and nutritional yeast. Additionally, take the opportunity to deepen your understanding of the ketogenic diet to enhance self-control and success.

**\*We recommend consulting with your doctor before making any dietary changes, especially if you have any existing health conditions.**

## Is It Possible To Follow A Ketogenic Diet Without A Gallbladder

# Is it possible to follow a ketogenic diet without a gallbladder?

Yes.

With the keto diet, 75% of your calories are coming from fat. The purpose of the gallbladder is to store and concentrate bile, which is the detergent that breaks down fats. Foods, especially fats, trigger the release of bile. Bile helps absorb fat-soluble vitamins, essential fatty acids, etc.

Without a gallbladder, you could have incomplete fat digestion or a deficiency in important fat-soluble vitamins.

You could try taking Dr. Berg’s Gallbladder Formula (see drberg.com) if you don’t have a gallbladder, to get more purified bile salts. This could potentially help you have enough bile to support complete digestion. You may also want to do intermittent fasting along with the keto diet.

**\*We recommend consulting with your doctor before making any dietary changes, especially if you have any existing health conditions.**

## Does Keto Make Your Pee Smell

# Does keto make your pee smell?

It can, during the keto adaptation period.

If you are on a keto diet, the smell usually comes from the ketones that aren’t being burned. This often happens if you’re still adapting to keto. Keto adaptation can take several weeks. Over time, you will burn those ketones and they won’t cause an odor.

If you are not on a ketogenic diet and you’re not doing intermittent fasting, but you’re getting a stinky urine odor, it could be a urinary tract infection, liver damage, eating the wrong foods, or not having enough vegetables.

Here’s what you can do for a strong urine odor:

- Liver support – consume plenty of healthy vegetables (like beet tops and dandelion greens)

- Fluids – drink plenty of water throughout the day

- Adjust proteins – lower your protein (3 to 6 oz is plenty)

- Chlorophyll – wheatgrass juice powder is a great source of it

## What Are Effective Treatments Or Strategies For Managing Vascular Calc 1206B1

# What are effective treatments or strategies for managing vascular calcification and osteoarthritis?

To manage vascular calcification and osteoarthritis, vitamin K2 is essential. It helps prevent calcium deposition in the arteries and works synergistically with vitamin D3 to alleviate arthritis and stiffness. Ensure you follow a healthy keto diet and practice intermittent fasting to reduce oxidative stress. While chelation therapy can be considered, prioritizing vitamin K2 is key.

## What Are The Best Snack Foods For Low Blood Sugar

# What are the best snack foods for low blood sugar?

A person with low blood sugar might be accustomed to snacks like protein bars and an apple with peanut butter. There is so much hidden sugar in these snacks that such snacks are nor recommended; with them, every time you snack you are worsening the problem of low blood sugar. You can become a real hypoglycemic which is almost a pre-diabetic situation. Normal blood sugars are between 80 to 90, but not over 100.

When you eat a snack, no matter what you snack on, you elevate your sugars. Once the sugar goes high it triggers the hormone insulin to drive the sugar down, so you end up with a low blood sugar situation. Snacking keeps the blood sugar levels going up and down, up and down, and perpetuates the problem.

The way out of this is to change what you eat at your meals. Watch Dr. Eric Berg’s videos about the Healthy Keto® and intermittent fasting plan; this diet will help you keep your blood sugars under control.

## Is It Okay To Do Carb Cycling On Keto And Intermittent Fasting

# Is it okay to do carb cycling on keto and intermittent fasting?

Avoid carb cycling on keto and intermittent fasting. Consuming refined carbs disrupts ketosis, switching your body to sugar burning.

People often crave carbs because of low blood sugar and energy. However, incorporating carbs blocks keto, which relies on very low carb intake.

With proper adaptation, you'll transition to fat burning efficiently, maintaining high endurance and stable performance. Aim to build a strong health reserve so occasional deviations from keto have minimal impact.

## What Happens When I Overeat

# What happens when I overeat?

Overeating can lead to increased stress on the digestive system, causing gas, bloating, nausea, and constipation. Regularly elevated insulin levels can result in insulin resistance (prediabetes) and an overworked pancreas. Poor digestion and excess food intake can also decrease sleep quality and cause the body to convert surplus food to body fat. The following day, you may experience increased cravings, moodiness, inflammation, and a slowed metabolism.

## What Mechanisms Explain How Elevated Cortisol Levels Can Lead To Weight Gain

# What mechanisms explain how elevated cortisol levels can lead to weight gain?

Cortisol increases your energy in stressful situations by converting energy into sugar. However, when this energy isn't used—such as in a sedentary job—it gets stored as fat. Worse, cortisol can convert muscle into sugar, reducing muscle mass. Additionally, cortisol prevents fat burning, making it difficult to achieve ketosis. To manage cortisol effectively, identify and reduce sources of stress. Follow a Healthy Keto® diet and practice intermittent fasting. Ensure you get plenty of vitamin D, vitamin C, and potassium to support overall health.

## What Are The Primary Risk Factors And Underlying Causes Of Breast Cancer

# What are the primary risk factors and underlying causes of breast cancer?

**Two Common Triggers of Breast Disease:**

• Excessive Amounts of Estrogen

Recommendation: High-Quality Source Sea Kelp and Cruciferous Vegetables Avoid Soy/GMO Products and Go Organic

• High Levels of Insulin – It can make the cells grow, divide and multiply

Recommendation: Do Ketogenic Diet and Intermittent Fasting Sugar and Refined Carbohydrates trigger insulin

**Mammograms**

• Mammograms can be traumatic because you are putting the breast on the plate and you are creating compression.

• Inflammatory Oncotaxis – a term that describes a condition where cells travel in the areas of inflammation in trauma. They use Ionizing Radiation, these little wave particles that go through and disrupt the electrons and certain molecules in your cells.

\*The above information is not intended for diagnosis. If you have any health concerns you should consult your physician.

## What Are The Most Effective Strategies For Significantly Boosting And  6E48Af

# What are the most effective strategies for significantly boosting and sustaining energy levels?

**Coffee doesn't give you energy. I**t gets rid of the fatigue molecule so that you don’t feel tired. Glucose and sugar might seem to give you an energy boost, but they actually make you tired!

**Here are 7 ways to raise your energy levels naturally without a crash.**

**1\. Magnesium**

Magnesium is a cofactor to make ATP, which is like the battery source for the body. The #1 symptom of low magnesium is fatigue. Magnesium-rich foods include spinach, almonds, avocado, and fish.

**2\. Sodium-potassium pump**

The sodium-potassium pump in your cells allows you to generate an electrical charge that powers your muscles and your nervous system. Adequate sodium and potassium intake is crucial for healthy energy levels. Electrolyte powder can help if you’re not consuming enough sodium and potassium from your diet.

**3\. Mitochondrial biogenesis**

Creating more mitochondria through consistent exercise can boost energy levels. Fasting, intermittent fasting, cold therapy, and polyphenols can also increase mitochondria. Polyphenols are found in certain vegetables, herbs, berries, and dark chocolate.

**4\. Ketones**

If you follow a keto diet, you can get your body running on ketones. Ketones produce more energy than glucose.

**5\. Carnitine**

Carnitine is a compound that can help transport fat into the mitochondria. Carnitine helps increase exercise endurance, delays the fatigue factor, and acts as an antioxidant to decrease damage in the muscles. Red meat is the best source of carnitine.

**6\. Apple cider vinegar**

Apple cider vinegar can be used by the mitochondria as fuel. Add one tablespoon to a glass of water each day.

**7\. B vitamins**

B vitamins are intimately involved with every part of your mitochondria that generates ATP from your food. Nutritional yeast is one of the best sources of B vitamins.

## What Factors Related To The Menstrual Cycle May Contribute To Hair Loss

# What factors related to the menstrual cycle may contribute to hair loss?

On day 15, when you’re ovulating, you get a huge spike in estrogen. In the next two weeks, you’re going to get a huge spike in progesterone and androgens.

The time of the month you’re losing your hair can give us clues as to which hormone is involved. Most women tend to lose hair during the second half of the menstrual cycle when there is a spike in androgens. But, even a female in menopause may continue to lose their hair to some degree.

**If you’re pre-menopause** and you’re experiencing hair loss in the second half of your cycle, you may need to lower your androgens. The best way to lower your androgens is to lower your insulin. You can lower your insulin by lowering your carbohydrates. You would want to go on the Healthy keto diet and do intermittent fasting.

**If you’re post-menopausal** and your hair is falling out, you may be low in progesterone, androgens, and estrogen. In this situation, taking DHEA may be beneficial. But be sure to only take a small amount (10-30mg a day), or it may have an opposite effect causing hair loss.

What if you’re postpartum and you’re experiencing hair loss because of a severe drop in estrogen? In this case, 10mg of DHEA may help. For PCOS, your androgens are too high. In this situation, you could try doing keto and intermittent fasting, as well as taking inositol.

For a heavy period, you would not want to take DHEA. Instead, you can try taking DIM and get plenty of iron. It’s possible to have a slow thyroid because of an increase in estrogen. In this situation, DIM may be beneficial as well as bile salts and selenium.

If you’re losing your hair after you stopped taking birth control pills, this could be from a decrease in estrogen. Taking inositol may be a great remedy in this case.

**Two additional causes of hair loss to keep in mind are:**

1\. A trace mineral deficiency

2\. A B vitamin deficiency

## Why Does Fasting Lower Your Thyroid Hormone T3 A Little Bit

# Why does fasting lower your thyroid hormone T3 a little bit?

Sometimes, going on a fast can lower a thyroid hormone called T3. This is the active form of the thyroid hormone. 

The pituitary communicates to the thyroid through a hormone called the thyroid stimulating hormone. One of the main ways hypothyroidism is diagnosed is by looking at the thyroid stimulating hormone. When you’re fasting and doing the healthy keto diet, you won’t see a change in the thyroid stimulating hormone. So, you are not going to have a true hypothyroid condition. 

The thyroid releases T4, which is the inactive form of the thyroid hormone. To become activated, it has to work through the liver and into the kidney. It converts from T4 to T3 (the active form). There is also something called reverse T3, which is the inactive version of T3. What determines the rate and ratio of this conversion of T4 to T3 or reverse T3 is the metabolic need. 

When you do a fast, you may see a slight decrease in T3. But, you will see an increase in the reverse T3. You’re body is becoming more efficient with its fuel, so the need for the active form of the thyroid hormone is going to be slightly less. The body will then put some of that hormone into a reserve until you need it. 

**Situations where you could see higher amounts of reverse T3:**

**1\. When you’re doing fasting**

**2\. When you’re recovering from:**

• A stroke 

• An injury 

• Overtraining 

• An illness 

• A surgery 

**3\. When you’ve just lost a good amount of weight**

## How Does Fasting Influence Your Genes

# How does fasting influence your genes?

Your genes are your blueprints or your code for building proteins. These proteins are involved in all of the biochemistry in your body—from making hormones and neurotransmitters to releasing stored glucose for fuel.

You have millions upon millions of these proteins, but they have to be instructed on what to do. When someone does fasting, many interesting things happen to your genetics. Fasting is one very important part of your epigenetics.

**Epigenetics are things that influence your genes. Your genes are like a series of light switches—they can be turned on and turned off. Epigenetics has the ability to turn on and off each light switch.**

As an example, fasting positively influences the gene CFHR1, which regulates your cholesterol. It also influences the SIRT-3 gene, which has anti-aging potential. Fasting also down-regulates genes like the APP gene that helps lower amyloid plaque, which is seen in neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer’s. Fasting may also play a role in other genes that influence cancer risks.

**Fasting can help:**

• Lower inflammation

• Support your immune system

• Lower syndrome X

• Support healthy brain cells

• Promote a healthy mood and mind

## Does Fasting Help With Copd

# Does fasting help with COPD?

**COPD is a condition triggered by chronic smoking or pollution that causes an inflamed irritated lung which develops scar tissue and obstructs the lungs capacity to receive oxygen and eliminates oxygen.**

**COPD Symptoms:**

• Coughing

• Mucus

• Shortness of Breath

• Chronic Adrenals

It is highly recommended to do the combination of the healthy ketogenic diet and intermittent fasting.

## Will Fasting Help With Chronic Pain And Inflammation

# Will fasting help with chronic pain and inflammation??

Fasting has a significant influence on chronic pain management. Regular intermittent fasting or prolonged fasting can help generate ketones, which serve as an alternative fuel source with antioxidant properties that protect neurons and have anti-pain effects. Fasting also releases and recycles serotonin, a mood-related neurotransmitter that can reduce neuropathic pain and fibromyalgia, conditions often exacerbated by low serotonin levels.

Additionally, fasting stimulates neurogenesis, the regrowth of nerve cells, which can expedite recovery from nerve damage and alleviate pain. The process releases endorphins, improving mood and decreasing pain. Fasting also affects neurotransmitter receptors and increases BDNF (brain-derived neurotrophic factor), which supports brain health and repair. In contrast, frequent eating or overeating may lead to increased oxidation in the vascular system, negatively impacting nerve health.

## Whats The Difference Between Fasting And Starvation

# What's the difference between fasting and starvation?

Fasting is when you deplete the glycogen reserves (stored sugar in the liver and the muscles) and fat for energy. Starvation differs because it means you have already depleted your glycogen and fat reserves, and the body is now breaking down muscles and organs are breaking down for fuel.

Fasting is healthy because it helps your body repair damaged cells while purging necessary fat and glycogen reserves. Starvation is extremely damaging and causes long-term health problems and even death if left unaddressed.

## Does Ketogenic Diet Increase Or Decrease Heart Disease

# Does Ketogenic diet increase or decrease heart disease?

One of the main causes of heart disease is high insulin, and the ketogenic diet is designed to lower insulin. To take it to the next level and lower your insulin, even more, you may want to also do intermittent fasting.

## Why Does Protein Help With Low Blood Sugar

# Why does protein help with low blood sugar?

With hypoglycemia, insulin lowers high blood sugar, often too much, resulting in low blood sugar. This happens because people with hypoglycemia have high insulin levels and lack counteracting hormones. While glucose, fat, and ketones are common fuels, protein can also be converted into glucose via gluconeogenesis, providing energy and helping stabilize blood sugar.

Consuming protein helps balance blood sugar by stimulating both insulin and glucagon, unlike carbohydrates, which can cause a temporary spike followed by a drop. We recommend adopting a Healthy Keto® diet and intermittent fasting for those with hypoglycemia.

## What Are The Potential Effects Of High Blood Sugar Levels On Nerve Health

# What are the potential effects of high blood sugar levels on nerve health?

There could be damage to your motor or sensory nerves. The condition is called peripheral neuropathy. You can also have problems with the autonomic nerves and even the nerves to the eye, and high blood sugar can also affect the blood vessels that innervate your nerves.

Dr. Berg recommends the ketogenic approach and intermittent fasting, including adding B-vitamins (from the nutritional yeast). B-vitamins also supports the myelin sheath around the nerves.

## What Steps Should I Take If Ive Plateaued On A Ketogenic Diet And Inte 362Bd8

1. **Avoid Snacking**: Eliminate snacks throughout the day to maintain stable insulin levels.

2. **Adopt a Two-Meal Structure**: Limit your meals to twice a day, ensuring they are sufficiently high in healthy fats. This will help sustain satiety between meals and support metabolic function.

Implementing these changes may help you overcome the plateau and enhance your overall progress on a ketogenic diet combined with intermittent fasting.

## Why Am I Gaining Weight On Keto

# Why am I gaining weight on keto?

If you're not losing weight on keto, it might be due to frequent eating or hidden sugars, which keep insulin high and store fat. However, if you’re exercising, muscle gain can make you weigh more even as your waist gets slimmer, indicating keto is working.

To optimize keto:

\- Double-check your carb intake

\- Adjust your fasting pattern

\- Reduce vegetable intake if bloating

\- Limit fat to about 75g

\- Exercise regularly

\- Add 30 minutes to 1 hour of sleep

\- Include apple cider vinegar, potassium, vitamin B1, magnesium, and vitamin D

\- Reduce stress

\- Address underlying health issues

## Why Do I Still Have Acne On Keto

# Why do I still have acne on keto?

Normally, keto helps with acne by addressing underlying hormonal issues. Persistent acne may indicate high androgens, which increase skin oiliness. Androgens often rise due to high insulin levels, potentially from hidden sugars or artificial sweeteners. Implement intermittent fasting with your keto diet to help manage insulin levels.

Stress can also trigger cortisol release, spiking insulin and causing acne. Reduce stress by taking daily 45-minute walks, avoiding stress triggers, and consuming nutritional yeast.

To address acne, check food labels for hidden carbs or sugars, add healthy fats, consume purified bile salts, practice intermittent fasting, and eat 7 to 10 cups of vegetables daily. Additionally, consume probiotics or fermented vegetables. If stress is a problem, improve sleep, take naps, and continue with long outdoor walks.

## How Can I Prevent Bad Breath While Fasting

# How can I prevent bad breath while fasting?

To prevent bad breath while fasting, maintain a healthy ketogenic diet with high chlorophyll content from greens. This should minimize odor issues, especially once you're fully adapted to ketosis. If bad breath persists, consider incorporating probiotics such as sauerkraut or plain kefir to support gut health.

## Why Am I So Hungry On Keto

# Why am I so hungry on Keto?

Increased hunger may indicate that your body has not yet fully adapted to ketosis. It’s important to assess your carbohydrate intake, as it may be too high, which can hinder your ability to enter fat-burning mode. Additionally, incorporating intermittent fasting could be beneficial, as it helps facilitate the transition to ketosis.

During the initial adaptation phase, some hunger is normal; however, as your body becomes more efficient at burning fat for energy, you should experience a reduction in hunger. This decrease in appetite is a key indicator that the ketogenic diet is effectively working for you. If your hunger persists, consider consulting a healthcare professional for further guidance.

## What Dietary Recommendations Do You Have For A Teenager

# What dietary recommendations do you have for a teenager?

For children and teenagers, I recommend a dietary approach similar to that of adults, while ensuring they receive adequate calories and essential nutrients to support proper growth and development. Depending on individual circumstances, I suggest providing three balanced meals per day without snacks. Although intermittent fasting with two meals may be suitable for adults, it is generally not advisable for growing adolescents unless there are specific weight management concerns.

A healthy version of the ketogenic diet, featuring three well-rounded meals, can be particularly beneficial for the health and development of adolescents. If I were a teenager, given my knowledge of nutrition, this would be the approach I would advocate.

## How Long Does It Take To Get Back On Track With Keto After The Holidays

# How long does it take to get back on track with keto after the holidays?

After the holiday season, it is beneficial to resume healthy habits as soon as possible, rather than extending indulgence from Thanksgiving to New Year’s. Many individuals may overestimate their overall health and cannot afford prolonged periods of overeating.

A practical approach is to enjoy holiday meals while using digestive aids, such as digestive enzymes containing betaine hydrochloride, to facilitate digestion and enhance comfort during meals. After the holiday festivities, returning to your ketogenic routine quickly is advisable. Incorporating fasting post-indulgence can also support your transition back to ketosis. For additional strategies on mitigating the effects of overeating, I recommend checking out my video on the topic.

## How Can I Do Keto On A Budget

# How can I do keto on a budget?

Is it expensive, doc? Not if you add intermittent fasting and you can keep the same quality of you can increase the quality because you're not eating as frequent. You're going to save money.

An average person who does one meal a day or two meals a day would save between, you know, two or three to $400 a month. So I think you can reinvest that in increasing more quality, but, um, you know, people think that junk foods or less healthy foods are cheaper. Not necessarily.

You could go, you can get healthier foods. And I just don't, I look at the grocery store and it's, I mean, even going to a fast food restaurant, it'sreally expensive. But being a college student at one time, I would live on like two burgers for a buck. And yes, there are different ways you can cheap out, but you know, you're going to have to maybe do dirty keto if you do that. But I think I would just do intermittent fasting and then keep the quality higher as you find a better job so you can afford more food.

## Are High Ketones During Fasting Dangerous

# Are high ketones during fasting dangerous?

Ketoacidosis is a serious health concern that can have devastating health consequences. However, having ketones in the blood during a fast is rarely cause for alarm. In fact, it is often an indicator that your body is burning fat.

Ketoacidosis primarily happens to diabetics who don’t take the right amount of insulin. Ketoacidosis is very different from nutritional ketosis, which is beneficial and will result in ketone levels in the body being raised.
