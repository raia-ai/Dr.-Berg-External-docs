## What Are Pfas

# What are PFAs?

PFAS chemicals are called forever chemicals because they stay in the environment for thousands of years. They’ve been found in our fat cells and breast milk and are especially problematic in our drinking water. PFAS are linked to many health problems, including cancer, hormone problems, liver damage, and reproductive damage.

Forever chemicals are everywhere! They’re found in Teflon cookware, food packaging, and canned goods, and firefighters are exposed to them when they use their foam. PFAS were first introduced into the environment in the late 1940s and early 1950s. Companies used loopholes by conducting their own studies to classify their products as GRAS (generally recognized as safe).

To avoid the toxic side effects of PFAS, you should limit your exposure and build up your body’s tolerance to these toxic chemicals. The EWG (Environmental Working Group) evaluated 25 PFAS chemicals and found that only 3 water filters could effectively remove them from drinking water: Travel Berkey Gravity, Clearly Filtered, and Zero Water. Because the water supply exposes you to many of the forever chemicals, it’s a good idea to invest in a good water filter.

Forever chemicals build up in the body but don’t come out very easily. Here are some of the ways you can eliminate PFAS from the body and minimize their health effects:

•Sweating

•Autophagy

•Infrared light exposure

•Consuming spirulina and chlorella

Your body has detoxification enzymes that can help you eliminate poisons naturally. To help detoxify the body, consume foods with sulfur, such as eggs, garlic, and onion. Cruciferous vegetables like cabbage, broccoli, and Brussels sprouts are high in sulfur and other antioxidants that can help the detoxification process. Glutamine is a vital antioxidant that can help increase glutathione in the body. Red meat is the best source, and glycine and probiotics are also essential. It’s almost impossible to create a toxin-free environment! Trace minerals such as selenium, iodine, and copper, found in seafood and grass-fed red meat can help strengthen the biochemical pathways in your body to help eliminate forever chemicals.

## Can Damage To Brain Cells Lead To The Phenomenon Of Brain Fog

# Can damage to brain cells lead to the phenomenon of brain fog?

**Damage of brain cells**

Another cause of brain fog is damage of the brain cells, for example due to aging or injury. Additionally, lack of sleep can cause hormonal imbalance and this can result in a bad effect on your brain. Prolonged fasting will help not only with providing ketones to feed your brain, but also by activating autophagy (healing/detoxifying process in the body).

## Does Intermittent Fasting Kill Candida

# Does intermittent fasting kill candida?

A few symptoms of Candida are achiness of joints, fatigue, itchiness of the body, and digestive issues just to name a few. You want to stay away from sugar, birth control pills can accelerate it as well as stress.

Doing intermittent fasting for at least 18 hours or more will put your body in an autophagy state in which the body would eliminate yeast, mold, fungus, and candida. Adding Thyme oil, grapefruit, and seed extract can help with the healing process.

## Will Fasting Help Treat Stds

# Will fasting help treat STDs?

There’s a 2014 study about alternate day fasting – 12 weeks helped salmonella-infected mice clear pathogenic bacteria.

**Alternate day fasting is when you eat what you want every other day and on the days that you are fasting, you reduce the calorie intake. In dealing with bacteria and viruses in remission, here are things to consider:**

1\. Intermittent fasting restores microbe diversity in the gut – when you do intermittent fasting, it will strengthen the immune system.

2\. Autophagy – 18+ hours

3\. Vitamin D – Sun

## Should I Take Bcaas On Intermittent Fasting And Keto While Exercising

# Should I take BCAAs on Intermittent fasting and Keto while exercising?

This will spike insulin, but it's a minor point since the insulin spike is small. The real question is WHY are you taking it in the first place.

If you are taking it for recovery, then realize that those amino acids take several hours before they are turned into protein and you would be much better off taking B-vitamins (nutritional yeast) and minerals (electrolytes), since they are the cofactors or helps in the repair of muscles and the creation (synthesis) of muscle.

If you are taking BCAA to build muscle realize that intermittent fasting, in general, will already give you a protein-sparing effect and this protects you from the loss of protein. Growth hormones are spiked too, which helps with this.

Autophagy also occurs which is the recycling of proteins from the cell, thus reducing the need for taking extra protein.

## Does Intermittent Fasting Affect Eyes And Vision

# Does intermittent fasting affect eyes and vision?

Diabetes is a major cause of poor vision, affecting the kidneys, heart, nervous system, and eyes, and can lead to diabetic retinopathy, glaucoma, macular degeneration, and cataracts. These eye issues stem from insulin resistance, so addressing this can improve eyesight. Intermittent fasting is effective for reducing insulin resistance, normalizing blood sugar, and promoting autophagy, which helps clean up damaged proteins in the eyes. If vision worsens initially on keto and intermittent fasting, it indicates your body needs more time to adapt.

## How Can I Enhance Autophagy

# How can I enhance autophagy?

Autophagy is a process where the body removes and recycles damaged or unnecessary cells and cell parts, replacing them with new, undamaged components. This process can be induced by intermittent fasting, as long periods without eating allows the body to focus on repairs. Autophagy is beneficial because it is a neuroprotective state, cadio protective, and can boost the immune system.

## Can Intermittent Fasting Help With Psoriasis

# Can intermittent fasting help with psoriasis?

Yes, intermittent fasting can help with psoriasis. Here are some key points from Dr. Berg's recommendations:

- **Reducing Inflammation**: Intermittent fasting has been shown to reduce inflammation in the body, which is a key factor in many chronic diseases, including psoriasis. By giving your digestive system a break and allowing your body to focus on repair and regeneration, you can help calm the inflammatory response and promote overall healing.

- **Cell Regeneration**: During fasting periods, the body undergoes a process of cell regeneration, which can help strengthen the immune response. This process is beneficial for skin health as it helps remove damaged cells and promotes the growth of new, healthier cells.

- **Hormonal Balance**: Intermittent fasting can help regulate insulin levels and increase growth hormone levels. This hormonal change triggers autophagy, a cellular cleanup operation that eliminates accumulated cell debris, which could otherwise trigger skin issues like psoriasis.

- **Immune System Enhancement**: Fasting has been shown to enhance immune function by stimulating the production of white blood cells and antibodies, helping your body fight off infections and diseases more effectively. A stronger immune system can better manage autoimmune conditions like psoriasis.

By incorporating intermittent fasting into your routine, you may experience improvements in psoriasis symptoms due to reduced inflammation, enhanced cell regeneration, and a stronger immune system. Always consult with your healthcare provider before making significant changes to your diet or fasting regimen.

## Protective Effects Of Fasting On The Brain

# Protective Effects of Fasting on the Brain

Fasting enhances cognitive function and safeguards brain health through several mechanisms. It increases neuronal plasticity by boosting levels of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), which supports neuron growth and survival, leading to improved learning and memory.

Fasting also offers neural protection by reducing oxidative stress and inflammation in the brain. It promotes the production of antioxidant enzymes that neutralize free radicals, protecting brain cells from damage.

Additionally, fasting triggers autophagy, a process that cleanses brain cells by breaking down and recycling damaged proteins and organelles. This "spring cleaning" helps maintain cellular health and may be particularly beneficial in preventing neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer's.

## How Can One Effectively Overcome Addiction And Implement Strategies To 847507

# How can one effectively overcome addiction and implement strategies to prevent relapse for long-term recovery?

**Addiction to substances like nicotine, alcohol, and drugs can be incredibly difficult to overcome. These addictions harm our mental and physical health and deplete essential nutrients in the body, particularly NAD.**

**NAD is a crucial coenzyme involved in over 500 different chemical reactions in the body.** It plays a vital role in energy production, DNA repair, and maintaining proper cellular functioning. However, addiction to substances like nicotine, alcohol, and drugs can significantly deplete NAD levels in the body.

**Symptoms of NAD deficiency include fatigue, muscle soreness, weight gain, difficulty sleeping and concentrating, brain fog, and decreased stamina. These symptoms can make it even harder for someone to overcome an addiction.**

**WHAT TO DO**

To combat NAD deficiency, consider taking vitamin B3, also known as niacin. Niacin helps increase NAD levels in the body, improving energy, helping to reduce withdrawal symptoms and cravings, and aiding in addiction recovery.

Some people may experience a flushing response on their skin when taking niacin, which can be uncomfortable. In this case, no-flush niacin can be used instead. In addition to supplementing with niacin, there are other ways to increase NAD levels in the body, such as intermittent fasting, following a healthy ketogenic diet, and regular exercise. These lifestyle changes can support addiction recovery and overall well-being. In some cases, clinics offer IV therapy for NAD to help with addiction recovery. However, this can be expensive and not accessible to everyone.

## Does Intermittent Fasting Boost The Immune System

# Does intermittent fasting boost the immune system?

Fasting improves the function of white blood cells, including macrophages, neutrophils, and monocytes. Remarkably, 85% of your immune system is located in your gut. Additionally, a process called autophagy helps the body clean up old, damaged parts and flush out microbes such as viruses, bacteria, fungi, yeast, and mold. Intermittent fasting is an excellent tool for reducing allergies, gut inflammatory conditions, and even the risk of certain diseases.

## Is Fasting Good Or Bad For The Liver

# Is fasting good or bad for the liver?

The liver is one of the only organs that can completely regenerate if you have at least 25% of your liver left. If you look down and you have a gut, chances are you have a fatty liver. Fasting however, can help boost the liver's regenerative potential and reduce your weight, which also alleviates pressure on this organ.

Fasting for over 18 hours (after receiving professional medical advice) can help reverse fatty liver disease, reduce an enlarged liver, lower liver enzymes, improve fibrosis, and even stimulate autophagy (the body's repair process). Taking choline and applied cider vinegar in conjunction with fasting.

## Do I Need A Multivitamin Supplement On Intermittent Fasting

# Do I need a multivitamin supplement on Intermittent Fasting?

When you consume less frequent foods, growth hormone is elevated and this protects you from the loss of protein and helps you get into autophagy, which helps you recycle protein better.

Amino acids are easy to get even if you do one meal a day. Fatty acids are also easy to get on this plan, because your proteins normally already contain the fat. This will also supply the fat soluble vitamins (A,D,E,K) and then we get to vitamins. Vitamins come in two categories, fat-soluble and water-soluble.

The water-soluble vitamins like C and B complex can be gotten from your vegetables and nutritional yeast. Your minerals can also be gotten from your vegetables, but trace minerals are difficult to get. You may want to take some extra sea kelp or seafood to get these.
