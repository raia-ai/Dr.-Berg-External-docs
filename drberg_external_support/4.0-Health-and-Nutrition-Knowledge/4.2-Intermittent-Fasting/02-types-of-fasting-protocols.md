## What Brand Of Creatine Monohydrate Does Dr. Berg Recommend

# What brand of creatine monohydrate does Dr. Berg recommend?

**Creatine Monohydrate: Enhancing Strength and Recovery** 

While Dr. Berg doesn't have a specific brand recommendation for **creatine monohydrate**, it's a popular supplement known for its benefits in strength training and muscle recovery. 

Creatine is naturally formed from three amino acids: **arginine, glycine, and methionine**. Within your muscles, it combines with phosphate to help **recycle ATP**, which is essentially the energy currency your muscles use. This process aids in rapid energy recovery during intense activities. 

**Key Benefits of Creatine:** 

- **Tolerate Heavy Weight Training:** Creatine can help you push through more intense workouts. 

- **Muscle Recovery:** It supports faster recovery of your muscles after exercise. 

- **Muscle Strength:** Regular supplementation can lead to increased muscle strength. 

- **Muscle Size:** It can contribute to gains in muscle size. 

**Types of Creatine and Allergy Considerations:** 

There are different types of creatine available. Two versions often considered superior are: 

- **Creatine Ethyl Ester:** Some believe this form is better absorbed, though research is mixed. 

- **Micronized Creatine:** This is a very common and effective form, known for its fine particle size which can improve solubility and reduce stomach upset. 

It's important to note that some individuals can be **allergic to creatine**. If you're trying it for the first time, it's wise to **start with a small amount** to ensure you don't have an adverse reaction.  

**Best Practices for Buying Creatine Monohydrate:** 

When purchasing creatine, especially creatine monohydrate, here’s what to look for to ensure you get a high-quality product: 

1. **Third-Party Testing:** Choose brands that utilize **third-party testing**. This means an independent lab verifies the product's purity, potency, and absence of contaminants (like heavy metals or unwanted byproducts). This information is often displayed on the product's label or the manufacturer's website. 

2. **No Fillers or Additives:** Opt for products with minimal ingredients. You primarily want just creatine monohydrate, not a lot of unnecessary fillers, artificial flavors, or sweeteners, unless you prefer a flavored version from a reputable brand. 

3. **Mixability:** Micronized creatine generally mixes well in water or other beverages, reducing grittiness. Check reviews to see if users report good mixability. 

4. **Brand Reputation:** Purchase from well-established and trusted supplement brands with a history of quality control and customer satisfaction.

## This 1 Thing Can Replace Our Entire Medical System

# This 1 Thing Can Replace Our Entire Medical System

Fasting has gained significant attention for its potential to address the root cause of many chronic illnesses: insulin resistance. By abstaining from food for a period, you can effectively "reset" your body's metabolism and improve its sensitivity to insulin.

**How Fasting Works:**

- **Activates Survival Genes:** Fasting triggers survival mechanisms within your body, prompting it to utilize stored fat and ketones for energy instead of relying solely on glucose.

- **Ketosis:** It typically takes around 3 days of fasting to enter ketosis, a metabolic state where your body efficiently burns fat for fuel.

- **Insulin Sensitivity:** Fasting enhances your cells' responsiveness to insulin, allowing for better blood sugar regulation.

- **Cortisol Levels:** Contrary to popular belief, fasting does not elevate cortisol (stress hormone) levels.

**Types of Fasting:**

- **Water Fasting:** Consuming only water during the fasting period.

- **Dry Fasting:** Abstaining from both food and water. Dry fasting may offer additional benefits like accelerated weight loss and enhanced detoxification, but it should be approached with caution and under appropriate guidance.

**Important Considerations:**

- **Listen to Your Body:** Don't force yourself to fast longer than feels comfortable. Pay attention to your body's hunger cues.

- **Nutrient Intake:** If you experience hair loss or menstrual irregularities while fasting, it could indicate a lack of protein. Prioritize high-quality protein sources like grass-fed red meat, which provides essential amino acids, trace minerals, and B vitamins.

- **Essential Minerals:** Ensure adequate intake of sea salt, magnesium (around 400mg), and zinc (around 50mg) to support overall health during fasting.

- **Hydration and Sleep:** Stay well-hydrated (especially during water fasting) and prioritize getting enough sleep.

**Disclaimer:** While fasting can offer significant health benefits, it's crucial to consult with your healthcare provider before starting any fasting regimen, especially if you have any underlying health conditions or are taking medications.

## What Are 7 Bad Habits That Can Ruin Your Liver

# What are 7 bad habits that can ruin your liver?

**7 Lifestyle Factors That Damage Your Liver (And How to Fix Them)**

1. **Overuse of Over-the-Counter Medications:**

    - Surprisingly, common painkillers like Tylenol can lead to serious liver damage if taken excessively. It's crucial to be aware of the potential risks of all medications, even those available without a prescription. Don't assume they're harmless just because they're easily accessible.

    - Natural remedies like milk thistle and NAC can offer liver support.

2. **Leading a Sedentary Lifestyle:**

    - When you consume more calories than you burn, it stresses your body at the cellular level. Regular exercise not only helps you manage your weight but also boosts your immune system, improves circulation, and reduces stress – all of which benefit your liver. Make physical activity a regular part of your routine.

3. **Poor Dietary Choices:**

    - The combination of seed oils (like vegetable or canola oil) with sugar or starch is a recipe for liver damage. These ingredients are found in most processed foods and contribute to insulin resistance, a major factor in fatty liver disease, obesity, and other health issues.

4. **Prioritizing Convenience Over Nutrition:**

    - Busy schedules often lead to grabbing fast food or unhealthy snacks. These choices typically lack essential nutrients and can harm your liver. Plan your meals ahead of time so you're not tempted to make poor choices on the go.

5. **Chronic Stress:**

    - Stress disrupts sleep, affects blood sugar, and can even weaken your immune system. Vitamin B1, vitamin D, exercise, and spending time in nature can all help manage stress levels.

6. **Excessive Alcohol Consumption:**

    - Alcohol is processed directly by your liver, putting a significant strain on it. Sugary mixed drinks are particularly harmful. Limit your alcohol intake and avoid making it a daily habit.

7. **Nutrient Deficiencies:**

    - Your liver needs specific nutrients to function optimally. Include plenty of cruciferous vegetables (broccoli, cauliflower, kale), garlic, onion, and quality protein sources like grass-fed beef and wild-caught fish in your diet to support liver health.

Remember, your liver plays a vital role in your overall health. Taking steps to protect it can have a major positive impact on your well-being.

## What Are The Foods That You Should Avoid For Alzheimers

# What are the foods that you should avoid for Alzheimer's?

In my opinion, what you eat is the most important thing that influences dementia or Alzheimer’s disease. There is one food I believe you have to avoid if you’re trying to improve symptoms of Alzheimer’s disease, and that is refined carbohydrates. Surprisingly, insulin is actually neuroprotective, and carbs increase insulin. If you’re deficient in insulin, your risk for amyloid plaquing goes up.

But this doesn’t mean you should consume more carbs. A high-carb diet is associated with high blood sugar, and people with high blood sugar or diabetes have an increased risk of Alzheimer’s disease. When your insulin is too high, your body starts protecting itself against excess insulin, leading to insulin resistance. Insulin resistance is a deficiency of insulin inside the cells. It's important to have just the right amount of insulin.

Refined carbs and sugar can also create brain inflammation. Not only that but sugar and refined carbs can destroy the energy sources for neurons and create oxidation and free-radical damage while also decreasing antioxidants.

This is why it’s key to fix insulin resistance. If you fix insulin resistance, the neurons can get the level of insulin they need for neuroprotection and to help decrease inflammation.

**How to support healthy insulin levels:**

1\. Get on the keto diet (run your body on ketones)

2\. Do intermittent fasting

3\. Do OMAD

4\. Consume nutrient-dense foods

5\. Decrease stress

## Which Type Of Carbohydrate Lowers Ldl Cholesterol Quickly And How Does 31125B

# Which type of carbohydrate lowers LDL cholesterol quickly, and how does it work?

Ever wondered why doctors recommend vegetables for high cholesterol? The secret lies in vegetable fiber! It's like having tiny bodyguards fighting cholesterol in your system.

**Understanding Cholesterol and Bile Salts**

Your body produces more cholesterol than you consume. Bile salts, produced by the liver, act as a detergent, breaking down fats and escorting excess cholesterol out of your body. Insufficient bile production can lead to constipation and increased cholesterol levels.

**Vegetable Fiber: The Cholesterol-Lowering Champion**

Vegetable fiber is superior to other fibers for reducing cholesterol. It acts like a sponge, soaking up bile salts and preventing their reabsorption into the bloodstream. Unlike other fibers, vegetable fiber doesn't raise insulin levels, making it an ideal choice.

**Nutritional Powerhouses**

Vegetables are low in sugar, high in fiber, and packed with phytonutrients, vitamins, and minerals, making them essential for overall health and cholesterol management.

**How Fiber Works its Magic**

- **Binds with Cholesterol:** Fiber traps cholesterol in the gut, preventing it from entering the bloodstream.

- **Increases Bile Production:** Fiber encourages the liver to produce more bile salts, further aiding cholesterol elimination.

- **Stabilizes Blood Sugar and Insulin:** Fiber doesn't spike blood sugar or insulin levels, unlike simple carbs.

- **Nourishes Gut Microbes:** Fiber feeds beneficial gut bacteria, which produce short-chain fatty acids that reduce inflammation and promote gut health, crucial for managing cholesterol.

**Dietary Recommendations**

- **Increase Vegetable Intake:** Aim for at least five servings of fiber-rich vegetables like broccoli, carrots, and Brussels sprouts daily.

- **Avoid Sugars and Starches:** Reduce consumption of sugary drinks and refined carbohydrates, as they raise blood sugar and indirectly contribute to high cholesterol.

**Conclusion**

Lowering cholesterol naturally starts with adding more vegetables to your diet. They are your allies in the battle against high cholesterol, thanks to their fiber content and nutritional benefits. By making simple dietary changes, you can take control of your health and enjoy a cholesterol-friendly lifestyle.

## How Do You Know When Autophagy Starts

# How do you know when autophagy starts?

Autophagy is associated with various signs, including increased ketone levels, reduced appetite, and increased cognition. 

Bad breath can also signal autophagy as the body produces a type of ketone called acetone, which can lead to body odor and bad breath.

## And What Are Its Potential Effects On Muscle Recovery And Hypertrophy

# ?, and what are its potential effects on muscle recovery and hypertrophy?

It might sound counterintuitive, but subjecting your body to cold temperatures could be the muscle growth boost you need. I'm talking about cold showers, ice baths, or even cryotherapy.

When you're exposed to cold, your body goes into overdrive trying to maintain its core temperature. This process generates a tremendous amount of energy, leading to the production of brown fat, a metabolically active type of fat that stimulates calorie burning and fat loss.

This can be especially beneficial for those aiming to add bulk while keeping body fat in check.

The magic, however, extends beyond fat burning. Studies, both in animals and humans, reveal that cold therapy can stimulate specific muscle genes responsible for muscle growth. It’s almost like hitting the reset button on your body, prompting it to adapt and grow stronger.

Additionally, it can reduce post-workout inflammation, promoting faster recovery and muscle repair. This enhanced recovery can help you get back to your training program faster and continue making progress toward your muscle growth goals.

Don't be scared to embrace the chill. Start with short bursts of cold exposure and gradually increase the duration as your tolerance builds. Remember, it’s the shock and recovery cycle that does the trick.

## How Often Should I Do A 24 Hour Fast

# How often should I do a 24-Hour fast?

While some people fast for 24 hours once a week, others practice this type of fast once or twice a month or whenever needed.  

***We recommend consulting with your doctor before making any dietary changes or before you start taking any new supplements.***

## Is The Omad Diet Safe

# Is the OMAD diet safe?

Yes, OMAD can be safe when nutrient-dense meals are paired with supplementation.  

However, OMAD is an extreme intermittent fasting method that isn’t suitable for everyone.   

It’s recommended to consult a healthcare professional before starting OMAD to minimize the risk of adverse health effects.

---

## I Do Omad And Can Not Sleep Now   What Do I Do

# I do OMAD and can not sleep now - what do I do?

Starting OMAD (One Meal A Day) can sometimes lead to sleep issues due to blood sugar fluctuations. Consider adding a small portion (around 50 grams) of blueberries to your meal to ease this transition. Blueberries offer some carbohydrates for blood sugar stability, which could help you sleep better. Ideally, this would also help prevent a morning rise in cortisol, a stress hormone that can disrupt sleep.

## How To Safely Extending A Fasting Window   Intermittent Fasting   Prol 6F5845

# How to Safely Extending a Fasting Window - Intermittent Fasting - Prolonged Fasting

To safely extend intermittent fasting into prolonged fasting, follow a gradual and well-planned approach to allow your body to adapt to more extended periods without food. Here are some guidelines for prolonging a fasting window: 

1. Extend your intermittent fast from a 20:4 fasting and feeding window to a 22:2 or an OMAD intermittent fast. Pay attention to how your body responds. If you experience fatigue, a lowering of mood, or anxiety, these could be signs that you’re advancing too quickly.  Once you have safely completed OMAD, return to a 20:4 or 22:2 fasting pattern for a day or two before you attempt your following OMAD intermittent fasting pattern.  Once you have established a regular pattern of OMAD fasting, it is a good idea to have a weekly feeding day, with an extended feeding window with three meals, to ensure you build up your nutrient reserves for the following OMAD schedule. 

2. Before attempting a 36- or 48-hour fast, it's crucial to establish a consistent OMAD eating pattern and a solid nutritional foundation. Always consult your doctor, especially if you have any health concerns. During extended fasts, follow the safety guidelines listed above. 

3. A 72-hour fast or longer must be performed with a healthcare provider, as the longer the fast, the longer the recovery period between prolonged fasts.  As a general guideline, for every *day* of a prolonged fast, you should recover and rebuild your nutrient reserves for at least the same number of *weeks* before your next prolonged fast.  For example, a 3-day fast (72 hours) should be followed by three weeks of recovery before attempting another 3-day fast.  This general guideline should be followed only after consulting your healthcare provider before your next prolonged fast.

## What Exercise Burns The Most Calories

# What exercise burns the most calories?

We're diving into the truth about calorie burning and the best exercises to maximize it.

It's crucial to understand that the type of calories you burn is directly linked to your diet. A sugary diet leads to burning sugar calories, while a sugar-free, higher-fat diet promotes fat burning.

Overtraining is a common pitfall, as it elevates cortisol levels, which can break down muscle protein. Instead, prioritize the health of your mitochondria – the powerhouses of your cells.

Healthy mitochondria are key to energy levels, recovery, and endurance. Factors like certain medications (e.g., statins) can weaken them, so it's important to support them through:

- Exercise with ample rest

- Maintaining thyroid health

- Building muscle mass

- Intermittent fasting

- Cold therapy

- Including meat in your diet

Mitochondrial health can be assessed through metabolomics testing. Additionally, addressing insulin resistance, which can harm mitochondria, is vital. Growth hormone can be beneficial in reducing insulin resistance, building muscle, and promoting fat burning.

Remember, a high-carb diet can hinder fat burning. It's essential to look beyond just calories and focus on overall fat loss, which is 85% diet and only 15% exercise.

For maximum calorie burning, opt for high-intensity exercises that engage multiple muscle groups.

Let's get started on optimizing your calorie-burning potential!

## What Strategies Can I Employ To Enhance My Sleep Quality While Simulta 65D2Cb

# What strategies can I employ to enhance my sleep quality while simultaneously ensuring optimal nourishment for my cells?

When someone has some type of defect in their genes, and everyone does have some defects and mutations to their genes, and there's some great DNA testing that you can do, you'll see more of this as time goes on. It doesn't mean that those genes will always be expressed, because they're not the controlling factor. You have epigenetics, which is above your genes. So it's lifestyle. It's when you eat. It's what you eat. It's the stress level, all these other things. But what you're trying to do, which is smart, is trying to do fasting. And it's been hard, so you have to snack.

First of all, you need to start including the apple cider vinegar with water with your meals, and maybe even before you go to bed, because that's one of the best things to regulate your blood sugars. Even if someone does a high-carb diet, if they consume that apple cider vinegar with water, their blood sugars will be better, even if you have something called the dawn phenomenon in the morning, where your blood sugars are high.

The other thing is to look back at my videos on your meal and compare it to what I recommend to what you're doing. You might need more fat with the meal. Because if you're truly in ketosis, to be able to get the benefits, you need to go. You should lose your appetite, so you should not be hungry at all, and you should feel good, and everything should be fine. So the fasting for your condition is so vitally important, because that way all these cool things will happen when you start fasting to your blood like normalization of all sorts of things.

You may also need to add a little bit of salt and water in the evening and drink that. That does help sleep, especially if you have what you have. And there's other remedies, too, like vitamin D3 before bed and zinc before bed. These are all just natural things that I would do versus snacking.

## Exercise Considerations During A Prolonged Fast  Safety

# Exercise Considerations During a Prolonged Fast & Safety

An appropriate level of physical activity is acceptable during a prolonged fast.  Below are guidelines for exercise while fasting. 

1. **Choose Light Activities**: During a prolonged fast, engaging in light physical activities such as walking or yoga is advisable. These types of exercises help maintain muscle mass without excessively draining energy reserves. 

3. **Avoid High-Intensity Workouts**: High-intensity exercise is too demanding during a prolonged fast. It significantly increases fatigue and demands on nutrient reserves, increasing muscle loss risk due to the lack of calorie intake. 

4. **Focus on Recovery**: Since the body's recovery might be reduced during a fast, ensuring adequate rest and recovery time between physical activities is crucial. 

5. **Monitor Your Body's Response**: Pay close attention to how your body responds to exercise during fasting. If you experience unusual fatigue, dizziness, or other concerning symptoms, reducing the intensity or duration of your workouts is advised. 

These recommendations aim to balance the benefits of exercise with the need to conserve energy and prevent adverse effects during a prolonged fast. 

This information is provided from [Dr. Berg's Guidelines for Prolonged Fasting.docx](https://realdrberg-my.sharepoint.com/:w:/g/personal/shawnh_drberg_com/EazcZ9dNJ6VDhEOO13hV0F8BnVvc-Ge6y2mYjpN-FnojYg?e=RHdisz&clickparams=eyJBcHBOYW1lIjoiVGVhbXMtRGVza3RvcCIsIkFwcFZlcnNpb24iOiI1MC8yNDAzMzEwMTgxNyIsIkhhc0ZlZGVyYXRlZFVzZXIiOmZhbHNlfQ%3D%3D).

## Prolonged Fasting   Build Up Nutrients With Healthy Keto

# Prolonged Fasting - Build Up Nutrients with Healthy Keto®

An adequate nutrient reserve is essential to a safe prolonged fast.  Healthy Keto® is a low-carb, high-fat, moderate-protein diet focusing on high-quality, nutrient-dense foods.   

Healthy Keto® emphasizes organic vegetables, full-fat organic dairy, and wild-caught, grass-fed, pasture-raised meat, fish, fowl, and eggs to maximize vitamin and mineral nutrients.  Healthy Keto® replaces unhealthy oils like soy, corn, and canola oil with healthier butter, coconut, avocado, olive, and animal fats to help reduce inflammation and support improved nutrient absorption.  Dr. Berg’s Healthy Keto® also encourages the consumption of 7 to 10 cups of vegetables daily for adequate vitamins and mineral nutrients. 

**Always Start with Intermittent Fasting** 

Intermittent fasting serves as a foundational step before transitioning to prolonged fasting for several reasons: 

1. **Adaptation to Fasting State:** Intermittent fasting helps your body gradually adapt to periods without food. This adaptation can make the transition to prolonged fasting smoother and more manageable. 

2. **Metabolic Flexibility:** Intermittent fasting enhances your body's ability to switch between using glucose and fat as energy sources. This metabolic flexibility is crucial for prolonged fasting, where your body needs to utilize fat stores for energy over extended periods efficiently. 

3. **Building Fasting Tolerance:** Starting with intermittent fasting allows you to build knowledge of your hunger signs and learn how your body responds to fasting. This experience is valuable when you extend the fasting duration in prolonged fasting. 

4. **Safety and Efficacy:** Gradually increasing fasting duration through intermittent fasting is essential to a safer and more efficient fast than jumping directly into prolonged fasting, which can be more challenging and has a higher risk of adverse effects if not done correctly. 

Starting with intermittent fasting prepares your body and mind for the more intensive experience of prolonged fasting, potentially enhancing both the experience and the benefits. 

To start intermittent fasting, you can follow these steps: 

1. **Choose Your Fasting Plan**: Decide a fasting schedule that suits your lifestyle. Standard plans include the 16:8 method, where you fast for 16 hours and eat during an 8-hour window. 

2. **Gradually Increase Fasting Time**: Begin by slowly extending your overnight fast. For example, delay breakfast by an hour and gradually increase until you can comfortably skip it. 

3. **Stay Hydrated**: During fasting periods, drink plenty of water and electrolyte water. Black coffee or herbal teas should be consumed in limited amounts, as they can dehydrate you. 

4. **Listen to Your Body**: Pay attention to how your body responds. If you experience fatigue or feel unusually cold, these could be signs that you’re advancing too quickly. 

5. **Nutrient-Dense Foods**: During your feeding window, choose nutrient-dense foods, such as those on the [Healthy Keto® Approved Foods](https://www.drberg.com/ketosis-approved-foods) list. 

6. **Consult Healthcare Providers**: If you have any health conditions or concerns, consult a healthcare provider before starting an intermittent fasting regimen. 

This information is provided from [Dr. Berg's Guidelines for Prolonged Fasting.docx](https://realdrberg-my.sharepoint.com/:w:/g/personal/shawnh_drberg_com/EazcZ9dNJ6VDhEOO13hV0F8BnVvc-Ge6y2mYjpN-FnojYg?e=RHdisz&clickparams=eyJBcHBOYW1lIjoiVGVhbXMtRGVza3RvcCIsIkFwcFZlcnNpb24iOiI1MC8yNDAzMzEwMTgxNyIsIkhhc0ZlZGVyYXRlZFVzZXIiOmZhbHNlfQ%3D%3D).

## What Could Be The Underlying Causes Of Significant Abdominal Distensio B7C910

# What could be the underlying causes of significant abdominal distension or a large belly that is not attributed to excess fat?

**This type of protruded stomach is caused by a damaged liver. The damaged liver is causing leakage of fluid and accumulation of a protein fluid in the abdominal cavity.** 

With this condition, there is a replacement of the normal healthy liver cells with fibrous scar tissue, and you end up losing the function of the liver cells.  Cirrhosis doesn't happen overnight. It takes years to develop. This could happen from consuming alcohol, or from years of poor eating. It usually starts with inflammation, and typically the person will have a fatty liver as well. The inflammation is part of an immune response, and the body heals with scar tissue. 

Typically, what's done medically, is the lower the person's sodium, and put them on diuretics. 

**Here are a few natural things you can do:**

1\. Lower your carbohydrates 

2\. Stop consuming alcohol 

3\. Consume moderate protein and fat 

4\. Consume cruciferous vegetables

5\. Intermittent fasting 

6\. Give it time (3 years)

## The Sugar Industrys Influence On Dietary Guidelines

# The Sugar Industry's Influence on Dietary Guidelines

## **The Sugar Industry's Influence on Dietary Guidelines**

Did you know the sugar industry holds significant sway over our dietary guidelines? They make up only 2% of farms but account for a third of all donations from US agriculture.

It's like David throwing stones at Goliath, except this time, David has a serious sweet tooth.

### **Unveiling the Power of Lobbyists**

Sugar lobbyists have mastered the art of influence to shape dietary recommendations. Just imagine them as puppeteers controlling how we perceive and consume sugar in our diets.

Their tactics are subtle yet effective, like adding just enough sugar to your coffee without making it overly sweet.

Their power extends far beyond merely advocating for their interests. They're also skilled in altering perceptions about food pyramid recommendations—twisting scientific facts into knots that even Houdini would struggle with.

### **Discrediting Anti-Sugar Research**

Besides shaping guidelines, these clever folks are adept at undermining research suggesting harm from high-sugar consumption—it’s as if they've turned deflecting criticism into an Olympic sport.

In their world, science isn't always black or white; it's often coated with a layer of sugary deception.

As cunning as foxes sneaking through henhouses under the moonlight, they work tirelessly to discredit any evidence that paints sugar in less than glowing terms.

## **The Surprising Truth About Obesity and Metabolism**

Contrary to commonly assumed, not all obese people have a [slow metabolism](https://www.drberg.com/blog/how-to-fix-a-slow-metabolism); research has revealed that approximately 20% maintain regular metabolic rates. Studies show that around 20% of obese individuals carry standard metabolic rates.

### **Obesity Doesn't Always Mean Poor Metabolism**

You may be astounded to find out that some people classified as overweight have normal metabolisms.

They defy the stereotype of [obesity](https://www.drberg.com/blog/the-answer-to-obesity-is-obvious-if-you-look-at-the-statistics), leading inevitably to diabetes or heart disease. Just like you can't judge a book by its cover, you can't predict an individual's health based on weight alone.

Despite carrying extra pounds, they avoid the common trap of developing insulin resistance - a critical factor in metabolic syndrome and related conditions such as [type 2 diabetes](https://www.drberg.com/blog/what-to-eat-to-correct-diabetes) and cardiovascular diseases.

This group is often called "metabolically healthy obese" (MHO), but don't be misled – it doesn't imply obesity is good for health.

However, don't let this term fool you – it does not mean obesity is healthy. It merely means these individuals appear resilient against the usual detrimental effects of excess body fat.

[Research suggests](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22804876), though somewhat controversially due to conflicting findings from various studies, about one-fifth of those who are clinically defined as 'obese' actually fall into this MHO category.

This throws up fascinating questions for scientists looking at how we approach dieting strategies and overall health promotion.

## **The World Health Organization's Stance on Sugar Consumption**

The World Health Organization (WHO) has a clear-cut guideline regarding the daily sugar intake. According to them, your sweet tooth should be limited to 12 teaspoons of added sugar daily.

It's easy to see how quickly we can surpass the WHO recommendation of no more than 12 teaspoons of added sugar per day when one soda contains nearly that amount. And what happens if we do?

Things start getting sticky – not in the fun caramel way.

### **The Not-So-Sweet Consequences**

High consumption may lead to numerous health issues, including diabetes and heart disease. It's almost as if consuming too much sugar is akin to inviting unwanted guests into our bodies - they're hard to get rid of once they've made themselves comfortable.

In other words, while enjoying sweets now and then won't cause any harm, consistent overconsumption could turn life sour fast.

## What Are Some Scientifically Supported Strategies And Techniques For A E367Fd

# What are some scientifically-supported strategies and techniques for accelerating the process of falling asleep, and how can they enhance sleep onset and overall sleep quality?

**First, let’s take a look at the reasons why you might be having trouble getting to sleep.**

1\. Overtraining or too much exercise causes the sympathetic nervous system to go up, keeping your adrenaline high and preventing sleep.

2\. If your room is too hot, it can interfere with your sleep quality.

3\. High carb consumption and stress deplete vitamin B1. Vitamin B1 is essential for the parasympathetic nervous system, so a deficiency will keep you up at night. Try taking vitamin B1 before bed for better sleep.

4\. Too much caffeine is a common cause of poor sleep.

5\. Poor gut health can inhibit good sleep. Kefir as a probiotic can help!

6\. Insulin resistance inhibits the absorption of tryptophan, a precursor to melatonin. This can interfere with your ability to fall asleep fast.

7\. Some people have trouble sleeping after being on keto or the carnivore diet for a long period of time. This is because their insulin is very low. Try having a cup of berries with your last meal to fix this problem.

8\. Sodium deficiency can cause problems with your sleep. This can be caused by fasting, OMAD (one meal a day), or not adding enough sodium to your diet. Low sodium can cause your sympathetic nervous system to go up which can keep you from sleeping.

If you want to know how to fall asleep instantly, try this simple sleep technique! You’re going to breathe in a way that synchronizes your heartbeat and blood pressure to the rhythm of your breathing. This will help stimulate the parasympathetic nervous system, inducing sleep very quickly. Try practicing with a timer first! Breathe in for 5 ½ seconds and breathe out for 5 ½ seconds. This will give you about 5 ½ breaths per minute. When doing this technique, breathe through your nose, and within minutes you will fall asleep.

## Can My Intermittent Fasting Window Be Flexible

# Can my intermittent fasting window be flexible?

Yes, your intermittent fasting window can be flexible. It's beneficial to adjust it and see what works best for you. For instance, you might try shifting your eating times—perhaps starting with a first meal earlier in the day and finishing with a second meal by mid-afternoon. Experimenting with different schedules can help you find the optimal routine.

## I Try To Do Omad Regularly But I Get Hungry At Night. What Do You Recommend

# I try to do OMAD regularly but I get hungry at night. What do you recommend?

Feeling hungry at night while doing OMAD suggests you may not be fully adapted yet, which can take time. I recommend lowering your carb intake and incorporating exercise to help with this adjustment. If, after a few weeks, you're still struggling with hunger, it's important to listen to your body. Not everyone can sustain prolonged fasting, so eat when you're genuinely hungry, and allow your body to guide your eating schedule.

## What Does The Presence Of Belly Fat Indicate About An Individuals Heal 9Debf4

# What does the presence of belly fat indicate about an individual's health, and what factors contribute to its accumulation?

[See Video/Image/Document](https://hls-player.drberg.com/asset?path=migrated-assets/belly-fat-is-merely-a-symptom)

**For you to have a big belly, you first have to have a fatty liver.**  The liver becomes fatty due to consuming too many carbs, which turn to fat in the liver and around the organs. Eventually, the fat from the liver will spill over into other organs. All of this comes from a high-carb diet as well as frequent eating. 

In many cases, people don't associate their belly fat with any other health problems. At least, initially. They may not even see a high blood sugar problem for a few decades. This is because insulin is taking care of the blood sugar levels. But, doctors don't typically test insulin levels, so they won't see that your insulin is too high and is leading to a blood sugar problem. 

**You probably won't know you have a fatty liver.** You'll just see that you have a large belly. But, as the years go on, you can develop diabetes.  The deeper cause of insulin resistance is really a fatty liver. The liver can't function right, and everything starts backing up. But, a high-carb diet is what's really behind all of this. 

**Other symptoms of high blood sugar and high insulin:**

• Frequent urination 

• Fatigue 

• Sleep apnea 

• A weakened immune system 

• Arthritis 

• Cravings 

• Metabolic syndrome (high blood pressure, heart disease, fatty liver diabetes type 2) 

All of these things, plus the belly fat, are coming from the same things: a high carb diet, high blood glucose, and high insulin. But, the good news is that the Healthy Keto diet and intermittent fasting may help.

## You Best Strategy Against Cancer

# You Best Strategy Against Cancer

**Understanding Cancer and the Potential Benefits of Fasting**

**Key Differences Between Normal and Cancer Cells**

- **Origin:** Cancer cells develop from mutated normal cells.

- **Mitochondrial Damage:** Damage to cellular powerhouses (mitochondria) can trigger the transformation from normal to cancerous.

- **Fuel Preference:** Cancer thrives on sugar, while normal cells have more flexibility.

- **Lifespan:** Cancer cells can replicate indefinitely, unlike normal cells.

- **Growth Rate:** Cancer cells multiply much faster than normal cells.

**How Fasting May Combat Cancer: Key Mechanisms**

- **Mechanism 1: Fuel Starvation:** Fasting reduces glucose, the primary energy source for cancer cells.

- **Mechanism 2: Amino Acid Deprivation:** Fasting limits glutamine and arginine, alternative fuel sources for some cancers.

- **Mechanism 3: Autophagy:** Fasting triggers cellular cleanup, potentially shrinking tumors and hindering cancer growth.

- **Mechanism 4: Immune Boost:** Fasting strengthens your cancer-fighting immune system.

- **Mechanism 5: Hormone Reduction:** Fasting lowers IGF-1 (problematic in existing cancer), insulin, and estrogen, which may fuel cancer risk.

- **Mechanism 6: Inflammation Control:** Fasting helps reduce inflammation, a factor in cancer development.

- **Mechanism 7: Ketone Impact:** More research is needed, but some natural inhibitors (alpha-lipoic acid, garcinia, etc.) may block a process that benefits cancer cells.

**Fasting Protocols: Prevention vs. Active Cancer**

- **Prevention:** Aim for 16-hour fasts with an 8-hour eating window, plus a low-carb diet.

- **Active Cancer:** Consider 18-20 hour fasts, 48-hour fasts weekly, or extended fasts under medical supervision. Prioritize cruciferous vegetables, healthy proteins, and fats.

**Important Note:** Always consult your doctor before starting any fasting regimen, especially if you have cancer. This information is for educational purposes and not a substitute for medical advice.

## What Can You Do If Youre No Longer Losing Weight While Fasting Postpartum

# What can you do if you’re no longer losing weight while fasting postpartum?

**When you actually go through pregnancy or actually deliver, you have this spike of estrogen that pops up. It interferes with your metabolism. Estrogen does contribute to certain types of fat.**

**I would work on getting into what's called keto adaptation a little bit more to the point where it's easier to do fasting.** That does take weeks, but it's dependent on how many carbs that you eat when you eat. So maybe finding substitutes for those carbs because the problem is that all it takes is a little bit of carbs to knock you out of fat burning for a longer period of time.

**The other thing is adding in twice a week high intensity interval training just to start to stimulate the exercise, but don't do it more than twice a week. But when you do it, like do it really good. In between that, do long walks and then try to get an extra hour of sleep.**

**To make fasting easier, sometimes it's helpful if when you do eat, you just add a little more fat to go longer.** But over time, it's gonna be easier to fast. If you're having any problems fasting for a longer period of time, all that means is that you have to either lower your carbs when you eat or just give it more time and then build up to that.

## How Can I Burn More Calories Without Exercising And Eating Less

# How can I burn more calories without exercising and eating less?

I’ll show you how to burn more calories without exercising or eating less. Yes, it’s absolutely possible if you have the right information. Most people believe you have to exercise more and eat fewer calories because one pound of fat is 3,500 calories. So if it’s an average of 1800-2200 calories to run my body, and I eat fewer calories than that but exercise more, the problem is solved.

A UK website that gets over 43 million views per month says this: don’t skip your breakfast, eat regular meals, eat plenty of fruit and vegetables, walk more to get more steps, drink more water, consume higher fiber foods, use a smaller plate, and don’t ban any specific food. They say you must eat in moderation. But here’s the big problem. You have two types of stored fuel; glycogen (sugar) and fat. The average person has 1700 calories of stored glycogen but 100,000 calories of fat. So how do you burn more fat calories? Because the goal isn’t to just burn off sugar calories then get hungry for carbs.

**Doing everything in moderation will burn off glycogen but not fat. You have to treat types of calories differently. So, lower your carbs, eat moderate protein (the only time the advice to eat in moderation is accurate), and increase your fat consumption. Bring your carbs as close to zero as possible to maximize your fat burning.**

**As you feed your body fewer carbs your metabolism actually speeds up. You heal a condition called insulin resistance. Exercise is responsible for only about 15 percent of your weight loss. 85 percent is diet.**

This is how to burn more calories without exercising or eating less.

## What Are The Health Benefits And Nutritional Advantages Of Incorporati 7E4B14

# What are the health benefits and nutritional advantages of incorporating lemon into the diet?

Lemon is a fruit that has many different benefits for our bodies. It contains citric acid, which is a very strong type of acid. One interesting thing about lemon juice is that as soon as you consume it, it gets burned up in the body and turns alkaline.

It should be noted that it can help prevent uric acid stones, as well as help with acidosis. Lemon juice won’t alkalize the blood or body, but it will alkalize the urine.

**Benefits**

- May help decrease the risk of kidney stones

- High in vitamin C

- Helps with acidosis

- Can help reduce the risk of gout

- Has the highest concentrates of citrates of any food

- Helps to alkalize the body

- Low in fructose

**How to consume it**

If you’re doing fasting or keto, mix some lemon (about 1 oz) in water and drink that to help minimize acidosis and some of the symptoms of it.

You can also consume lemon juice. Make sure it is organic and not pasteurized—also that it doesn’t contain sugar.

## What Are The Most Effective Ways To Lose Belly Fat

# What are the most effective ways to lose belly fat?

Diets don’t work for belly fat. Why? Because it’s not a weight problem, it’s actually a hormone problem. It’s a cortisol problem. Diets don’t lower cortisol, they lower calories.  You also do not want to overtrain.

Exercise is a type of stress that can aggravate the belly. Instead of intense exercise, try going on long walks. 

Cortisol is a hormone from the adrenals. It’s triggered by all kinds of stress. 

**How to lose belly fat fast:**

• Minimize stress

• Sleep (Take Adrenal & Cortisol Support, try acupressure)

## What Are The Key Symptoms Of Ulcerative Colitis And How Do These Manif E09972

# What are the key symptoms of ulcerative colitis, and how do these manifestations affect digestive health and overall well-being?

Ulcerative colitis is a condition where you have inflammation in your colon and/or rectum with ulcers and bleeding. It’s an autoimmune condition, which means your immune system is attacking your own healthy cells in the colon.

**How to treat it**

With this autoimmune condition, your own immune cells are creating constant inflammation and irritation of the colon. The solution would be to reduce the inflammation and heal your colon from this condition. The remedies below will help to achieve that.

**Remedies:**

- Avoid snacking

- Do intermittent fasting

- Consume vitamin D (at least 40,000 IU per day)

- Consume zinc

- Consume cabbage juice

- Consume VSL#3 (probiotic type)

    - 4 to 8 capsules per day for 2 months

    - start gradually to avoid causing an immune reaction

- Consume wheatgrass juice

- You may need to avoid vegetables for 1 to 2 months (except for the above).

## What Are The Potential Reasons For Sugar Cravings And How Do Factors S Fc537C

# What are the potential reasons for sugar cravings, and how do factors such as hormonal fluctuations, emotional triggers, and dietary habits contribute to this desire?

Craving sugar is a very common problem, especially if you are trying to get onto a healthy diet. It can be caused by several underlying issues. Let’s break it down and look at some simple remedies to the problem.

**Cause #1: High-carb diet**

When you are on a high-carb diet your body will produce insulin (fat-storing hormone) to lower the blood sugar spikes. High blood sugar will make you feel satisfied after the high-sugar / high- carb meal. However, a few hours later, the insulin will drop the blood sugar too low, causing you to crave these foods again. The cycle repeats.

Additionally, consuming refined carbs and sugar increases the hormones and chemicals in the body that are related to pleasure, making you feel satisfied when you are consume them.

A high-carb diet is very addictive, with many side effects.

The solution is to get on the Healthy Keto® diet and intermittent fasting. When you start following them, in a few days your body will adapt to a new healthy type of fuel: ketones (instead of sugar).

Ketones are a byproduct of your body burning its own fat. If your body is adapted to ketones you will feel much more energetic, less stressed, healthier, and you will have no cravings or hunger whatsoever. As an additional reward, you will burn fat.

**Cause #2: Snacking**

Eating between meals, even if it’s not much food, will raise your level of insulin. This is because eating in general will raise insulin. Insulin in turn will lower your blood sugar levels, and shortly after your snack you will feel hunger and cravings again.

**Cause #3: Stress**

When you are undergoing stress, you may feel like eating sweets and carbohydrates. This usually has its roots in being accustomed to a high-carb diet. When you eat carbs out of stress, you may feel satisfied temporarily, because your blood sugar and dopamine (pleasure-related chemical produced by your body) go high. Shortly after, when they drop, you will feel stressed again and will crave carbs to feel better. The solution would be to get on the right diet and get your stress levels under control.

Additionally, if you constantly undergo stress, your stress hormone, called cortisol, is going to break down your body proteins and turn them into sugar. This will spike your blood sugar and make your body produce insulin to lower it. Once blood sugar is lowered below the normal level, you will crave sugar and carbs.

## Is Colon Cleansing Advantageous For Health

# Is colon cleansing advantageous for health?

There are several different types of colon cleansing: 

**• Colon hydrotherapy** 

This is where water goes up the rectum into the large intestine and flushes everything out. This can flush out you’re electrolytes. You may want to take electrolytes after, so you don’t become deficient. You’re also flushing out your friendly bacteria, which would need to be put back in. 

**• Herbal laxatives**

Creates a purging of the material out of the colon 

**• Colema** 

This is a combination of an enema and a colonic. The problem is that it’s very temporary. It also flushes out your electrolytes. If you’re already deficient in electrolytes, this can cause dizziness and even affect your heart. The apple juice a person is supposed to drink while doing the colema, can also keep the blood sugars up, preventing ketosis. 

Fixing your diet (doing keto) may be the best way to go. Typically, fixing the diet can fix whatever issue caused you to want to do the colon cleansing to begin with. I’m not against colon hydrotherapy as a short-term solution for constipation or other conditions. But, it should be supervised, and the electrolytes and friendly bacteria need to be put back in. 

**What you can do:** 

1\. Start fasting 

2\. Decrease inflammation 

3\. Consume phytonutrients 

4\. Consume fermented vegetables

## What Are The Potential Causes Of Skin Discoloration And How Do Factors 8D1087

# What are the potential causes of skin discoloration, and how do factors such as sun exposure, medical conditions, and hormonal changes contribute to this issue?

Discolored skin patches commonly develop in a certain part of the body due to a difference in melanin levels (melanin is a substance that gives color to the skin and protects it from the sun). Sometimes you may have darkened skin spots, or whitened. Each of these has its own causes and remedies.

**If you have dark skin spots**

There are few different hormonal causes for the irregular work of melanin resulting in darkened skin spots. Usually this means that melanin is overproduced in a certain area of the skin.

- Insulin is responsible for lowering the blood sugar levels in your body. Additionally, insulin increases the level of certain hormones called androgens, which are responsible for dark spots on the skin and for acne.

- If your body has excess estrogen that can be the reason for skin discoloration or dark spots, especially if intermittent fasting and a Healthy Keto diet didn’t resolve the skin condition.

- Cortisol is a hormone that is being produced when you are undergoing stress, whether mental or physical. If you have chronic stress, this will cause too-high cortisol, which can result in dark spots on your skin.

**If you have white skin spots (tinea versicolor)**

White skin patches are caused by the type of fungus that is called tinea versicolor. This fungus causes white/lighter spots on the skin, mainly on the chest and back. It does it by blocking melanin (the substance that is responsible for skin coloration).

## What Are The Main Benefits Of Exercise

# What are the main benefits of exercise?

Diet contributes to 85% of your progress with weight loss, and exercise contributes only 15%. But then, there are various benefits of exercise for your weight goal.

The first thing you should know is that all of the benefits of exercise are in recovery after the exercise. The problem is, many people don’t give their bodies enough time to recover. Then, they feel tired and fatigued, and don’t lose weight or gain any strength or stamina.

You must have good sleep and enough recovery time for your body to fully repair. Otherwise, you won’t lose weight and you won’t have any other benefits.

If you don’t feel good after a workout, you’re overtraining. This is not good for the heart. For hard-core workouts, you want to only do them every third day rather than every day. Between these workouts, you can do light exercises like long-distance walks and yoga.

The best formula for exercise is 1 minute of exercise and 5 minutes of rest. Repeat three times to get started, and then increase the number of repetitions. You always want short intervals of intense exercise and a long period of rest.

**Benefits**

- Increases oxygen

- Gives you energy

- Lowers stress

- Increases fitness

- Improves muscle tone

- Good for atrophy

- Increases muscle mass

- Improves blood sugars

- Enhances sleep

- Helps with joint stiffness

- Improves blood flow

- Increases flexibility

- Strengthens the heart

- Enhances cognitive function and mood

- Builds antioxidant reserves

**Exercise time**

The best time to work out is in the evening. When you work out in the evening, you recover much more quickly than if you work out in the morning. You also burn more fat.

Keep in mind that exercising in the evening will spike your cortisol a little bit, but it normalizes much faster. If you are an adrenal body type, you may benefit from walking in the morning. However, for those who are not, high-intensity interval training is ideal in the evening. If you work out twice a day, try doing your light workout in the morning and more intense exercises in the evening. You should see a big difference in your results and recovery when you work out in the evening.

**High intensity interval training (HIIT)**

High-intensity interval training is intermittent exercise. This can help stimulate growth hormone. Doing this high-intensity exercise intermittently is important because it won’t stimulate the opposing hormone: cortisol. It keeps the stress down while still stimulating growth hormone. The growth hormone is stimulated by the high intensity. Cortisol is stimulated by duration, which you’re keeping short.

**Long-distance walking**

Walking is a low-stress, higher-oxygen type of exercise (aerobic), and better for stress. If you have a history of being an athlete or doing a sport that involved lots of cardio, then your cells have developed a larger capacity to use energy and you will need to do regular exercise to release that energy.

**Tips for getting the most out of your workout**

• Get good sleep

• Don’t eat anything before, during or after your workout

• Avoid insulin-spiking foods

## What Are The Potential Causes Of Itchy And Red Eyes

# What are the potential causes of itchy and red eyes?

Having itchy, red eyes can create a number of difficulties in our daily lives. This condition can come from infections and allergies as well as nutritional deficiencies.

**Cause #1: Viral infection**

If you have an eye infection like pink eye, it can cause eye irritation, redness and inflammation. I suggest using colloidal silver as well as zinc and vitamin D to improve your immune system.

**Remedies:**

- Use 1 drop of colloidal silver in each eye 7 times per day

- Consume zinc

- Consume garlic

- Consume other natural antibiotics

Consume vitamin D

**Cause #2: Nutritional deficiencies**

There are several nutrients that your body needs for healthy functioning of the eyes. If you are deficient in them, this can create redness and irritation in the eyes.

\-If you are deficient in vitamin A, it can cause you to have dry eyes as well as a thickened mucus around the eyes that can result in itchiness and redness.

\-B vitamin deficiencies can cause redness or irritation in the eyes, especially B1 and B2 deficiencies.

\-Vitamin C helps keep veins and capillaries healthy and supports their work. If you have a small hemorrhage (bleeding) in the eye, vitamin C (along with vitamin K) can help repair it.

\-Vitamin D is one of the best nutritional anti-inflammatories; if you have red, irritated eyes, vitamin D can help resolve this condition.

**Remedies: Vitamin A:**

- Beef liver

- Egg yolks

- Cod liver oil

- Fatty fish

- Butter

- Cheese

    **B vitamins:**

- Nutritional yeast

- Eggs

- Meat

- Liver

- Fish

- Nuts

- Seeds

    **Vitamin C:**

- Sauerkraut

- Bell pepper

- Berries

- Raw lemons

    **Vitamin K:**

- Any type of dark leafy green

    **Vitamin D3:**

- Consume cod liver oil

- Get more exposure to the sun

- Take a vitamin D3 supplement

    **Improve the absorption of vitamins:**

- Consume apple cider vinegar (1 to 2 teaspoons stirred into about a cup of water)

- Consume betaine hydrochloride

• Take purified bile salts

**Cause #3: Allergies**

An allergy is an intolerance to certain foods or some substance in the environment (like pollen). If you have red, itchy eyes, there is a possibility that you have an allergy and your eyes are reacting to certain substances or food.

**Remedies:**

- Consume vitamin A

- Consume vitamin D

- Locate the source of the allergy by looking back and seeing what you were exposed to or what you ate before the eye irritation started, then avoid it.

    **Cause #4: High-carb diet**

    When you are on a high-carb diet your blood sugars elevate too high after eating. As a result your tear glands can stop producing tears. Insulin can also affect the blood flow to the nerve that goes to the cornea. Additionally, if you feel that there is something in the eye but nothing is in there, this is a sign of a blood sugar / insulin problem.

    **Remedies:**

- Avoid sugar and refined carbs

- Avoid snacking

- Do the Healthy Keto® diet

- Do an intermittent fasting plan

    **Other causes:**

- Blue lights causing irritation

- Lack of sleep

- Low blood sugar

- Anemia

- Lack of essential pancreatic enzymes

- Liver/gallbladder problem

- Alcohol

- IBS

## What Are The Potential Reasons For Memory Loss

# What are the potential reasons for memory loss?

Symptoms of memory loss have to do with the hippocampus. The hippocampus is an area of the brain that is responsible for short-term, long-term and spatial memory (remembering things that are located somewhere--for example where you parked your car).

**Cause #1: Nutritional deficiency**

There are several nutrients that are vital for the healthy functioning of the brain. If you are deficient in those nutrients, the hippocampus is the part of your brain that will be affected most. The good thing is that it can regenerate if you restore your normal levels of the nutrients.

\- Vitamin B1 is a very important vitamin for healthy brain function, as well as for your nervous system.

\- Vitamin D has many health-related functions, including healthy development and upkeep of the brain. Out of all brain areas that are affected by a D deficiency, the hippocampus feels the lack of vitamin D most.

\- If you are deficient in zinc (mineral) your hippocampus won’t work properly, resulting in short- term memory problems.

\- Additionally, If your brain doesn’t have enough oxygen this can result in damage to the hippocampus.

**Remedies:**

- Restore vitamin B1 in your body:

    - take nutritional yeast

    - avoid refined carbs and sugar

    - avoid things and people that stress you out

    - take long walks

- Restore vitamin D in your body:

    - take vitamin D3 (10,000 to 20,000 IU daily)

    - take virgin cod liver oil

- Restore zinc in your body:

    - consume beef liver

    - consume shellfish

    - take a zinc supplement

- Restore oxygen in your body:

    - exercise

    - take long walks outside daily (at least 45 minutes)

    - hyperbaric oxygen therapy

**Cause #2: High-carb diet**

If you are on a high-carb diet this can result in a brain starvation as blood sugar is not the best source of fuel for your brain, including the hippocampus. There is another type of fuel that your brain loves: ketones (a byproduct of your body burning its own fat). Additionally, intermittent fasting will trigger certain processes that will regenerate your hippocampus.

**Remedies:**

- Avoid refined carbs and sweets

- Avoid snacking

- Take MCT oil (source of ketones)

- Take exogenous ketones supplement

- Do the Healthy Keto® diet

- Do intermittent fasting

**Cause #3: High cortisol**

Cortisol is a stress hormone that is being produced by your adrenals (stress-regulating glands). High amounts of cortisol can damage your hippocampus. The solution to that would be to improve your mental and physical stress resistance and recovery.

**Remedies:**

- Consume vitamin B1:

• nutritional yeast • benfotiamine

- Improve sleep (take naps if needed)

- Take long walks outside daily (at least 45 minutes)

- Avoid things or people that stress you out

- You can also take my Adrenal & Cortisol Support

- You can also take my Adrenal Stress Advanced Formula

**Other causes:**

- Aging (Healthy Keto + intermittent fasting will help)

## What Are The Potential Causes Of Short Term Memory Loss

# What are the potential causes of short-term memory loss?

Short-term memory loss can create a lot of difficulties that make life harder. The area of the brain that is responsible for your short-term memory is called the hippocampus. Any type of damage to the hippocampus can cause problems with memory in general.

**Symptoms:**

- Asking the same questions repeatedly

- Forgetting where you just put something

- Forgetting recent events

- Forgetting something you saw or read recently

**Cause #1: Nutritional deficiency**

There are several nutrients that are vital for the healthy functioning of the brain. If you are deficient in these nutrients, the hippocampus will be affected most. The good thing is that it can regenerate if you restore your normal levels of those nutrients.

\-Vitamin B1 is a very important vitamin for healthy brain function as well as for your nervous system.

\-Vitamin D has many health-related functions, including healthy development and upkeep of the brain. Out of all the brain areas that are affected by vitamin D deficiency, the hippocampus feels the deficiency most.

## How Can I Assess The Safety Of Beauty And Skincare Products For My Nee E11088

# How can I assess the safety of beauty and skincare products for my needs, considering ingredients and potential allergens?

The skin is a human sponge that directly absorbs everything you put on it. An average female absorbs 4 pounds and 6 ounces of chemicals every single year or puts 515 synthetic chemicals on the skin every day. Some of these chemicals are carcinogens which are things that can cause certain types of disease.

Chemicals in Makeup:

• Carcinogens

• Neurotoxins – These go into the brain and the nervous system

• Endocrine Disruptors – Chemicals in the environment that mimic estrogen, which affect the different endocrine glands (thyroid, pancreas, adrenal gland, ovary)

**Ways to Get Chemicals Out of the Body:**

• Evaluate what your body is being exposed to – replace toxins with more natural and less toxic.

• Detox using cruciferous vegetables to help the liver break down these poisons – These are very unique vegetables that help to naturally detoxify without harmful effects.

• Do intermittent fasting – It is a physiological vacation from constantly eating all the time and gives the organs time to rest, heal and repair. It also triggers autophagy, where the body is recycling all the things that it doesn’t need and then builds new tissue.

• Make sure to eat enough healthy fats – fish (wild-caught salmon), coconut oil, seafood, nuts, seeds, olive oil, avocado

**Cruciferous Vegetables:**

• Kale

• Broccoli

• Cabbage

• Brussels sprouts

• Bok choy

• Arugula

• Collard Greens

• Radish

• Watercress

## What Are Some Common Foods Or Habits That Can Unexpectedly Lead To Spi 12E5A4

# What are some common foods or habits that can unexpectedly lead to spikes in blood sugar levels, and how can individuals better manage their glucose response through dietary choices?

Justin Richard, motivated by a family history of type 2 diabetes, decided to take control of his health by exploring the impact of food on his blood sugar levels. Using a continuous glucose monitor (CGM), he discovered how different foods affected him, particularly noticing the energy dips he experienced in his late 40s after consuming certain meals.

Initially, Justin followed his regular diet, which included a lot of processed foods. To his surprise, the CGM revealed how these foods caused significant and prolonged spikes in his blood sugar levels.

Through his experiments, Justin discovered some unexpected truths. He learned that white flour, bread, and even whole wheat bread had similar effects on his blood sugar, with Ezekiel bread being the least impactful. Additionally, he noticed that stress and lack of sleep caused his fasting blood glucose to rise significantly.

To manage his blood sugar levels, Justin adopted several strategies. He began combining carbs with protein, fat, and fiber to slow down digestion and reduce blood sugar spikes. He also found that drinking apple cider vinegar mixed with water before meals had a similar effect.

Justin shares his top tips for making healthier food choices and breaking bad eating habits:

1. Avoid grocery shopping on an empty stomach.

2. Resist the temptation to buy junk food at the store.

3. Take a walk after a large meal.

4. Don't consume sweets after meals or upon waking.

Based on his positive experience, Justin highly recommends the Signos CGM device as a tool for anyone interested in understanding and managing their blood sugar levels.

## Can I Do 5 Days Of Fasting And On The Weekends Eat Whatever I Want

# Can I do 5 days of fasting and on the weekends eat whatever I want?

Here are two reasons why this is not recommended:

- You are not going to adapt to a full state of ketosis.

- This provides no standard for what to eat.

Recommendation: do intermittent fasting every single day and do it correctly – start with 16:8 daily, then if you are comfortable with the ratio, start shortening the eating window a little bit at a time to notice better results.

## What Are The Most Effective Strategies For Supporting Pancreatic Healt B315C9

# What are the most effective strategies for supporting pancreatic health, and how can these methods help prevent pancreatic disorders and maintain overall metabolic well-being?

Dr. Berg recommends several strategies to support a healthy pancreas:

1. **Dietary Adjustments**:

    - **The Healthy® Keto Diet**: This diet encourages a low-carbohydrate lifestyle to manage and potentially reverse insulin resistance, which is crucial for pancreatic health.

    - **Intermittent Fasting**: Incorporating fasting into your routine can improve insulin sensitivity and support pancreatic health.

    - **Avoid Refined Carbohydrates and Sugars**: These are known triggers for insulin resistance, particularly in individuals with a pancreas body type.

2. **Natural Supplements**:

    - **Berberine**: This supplement helps regulate blood sugar levels and supports the cells in your pancreas responsible for insulin production.

    - **Beef Pancreas Extract**: Provides direct support to the pancreas.

    - **Milk Thistle**: Known for improving insulin sensitivity and supporting liver health, which is indirectly beneficial for pancreatic function.

3. **Lifestyle Modifications**:

    - **Regular Exercise**: Including interval training can help maintain healthy growth hormone levels, which are essential for overall endocrine health.

    - **Adequate Sleep**: Ensuring good quality sleep to support overall hormonal balance and reduce stress on the pancreas.

These strategies aim to enhance pancreatic function and overall metabolic health, thereby supporting better blood sugar management and reducing the burden on the pancreas.

## How Long Do I Need To Fast To Spike Brainpower

# How long do I need to fast to spike brainpower?

**To start seeing these incredible cognitive benefits, you have to fast for at least 18 hours a day.**

With an 18:6 intermittent fasting pattern, you would fast for 18 hours and have a 6-hour eating window. This means no snacking while fasting. You can eat during your 6-hour window, but I recommend only two meals. If you are still hungry, add more fat at the end of your meals.

Ketones are very therapeutic for your brain.

**There are three ways to get your body to produce ketones:**

1\. Go on the keto diet

2\. Fasting

3\. Exercise

## What Are The Intermittent Fasting Patterns For Different Body Situations

# What are the intermittent fasting patterns for different body situations?

**1\. Growth hormone**

This is an anti-aging hormone that helps burn fat and preserve muscle. Fasting, exercise, and sleep can spike growth hormone.

• Increases at 12+ hrs.

**2\. Autophagy**

This is a condition where your body is recycling damaged proteins and clearing out microbes.

• Increases at 18+ hrs.

**3\. Inflammation**

You can really see a drop in inflammation when you do OMAD (one meal a day). This also applies to sickness and speeding up the recovery process.

• A drop in inflammation may happen at 23+ hrs.

**4\. Cancer**

With cancer, consider doing OMAD with periodic prolonged fasting. This helps lower glucose and glutamine. Also, when you do eat, consume a lot of cruciferous vegetables.

• These effects may happen after 23+ hrs.

**5\. Stem cell**

This is a cell that hasn’t turned into anything yet. When you do a periodic fast for 72 hours, you’re going to stimulate some stem cells. This can help build new tissue.

• These effects may happen after 72+ hrs.

**6\. Stubborn weight**

If you have a really stubborn weight situation, consider doing OMAD every other day. Make sure you’re getting your nutrients.

• For stubborn weight, try eating one meal every 48 hours.

**7\. Diabetes**

This is a problem with excess sugar. With diabetes, you can really help the blood sugar situation with fasting. The problem is that you must check your blood sugars routinely, and talk to your doctor about adjusting your medications. Check with your doctor and fast gradually.

## Can Type 1 Diabetics Do Prolonged Fasts

# Can type 1 diabetics do prolonged fasts?

Dr. Berg Nutritionals staff, including Dr. Berg Advisors, do *not* encourage prolonged fasting. We are not healthcare professionals equipped with the tests and facilities to perform the necessary monitoring during a prolonged fast, nor do we have an individual's medical health records. Dr. Berg Advisors provide this document based on Dr. Berg's education for informational purposes only to those already on a prolonged fast or independently choosing to do one.

**Always consult with your healthcare provider before starting a prolonged fast.  If you're considering prolonged fasting, discussing the benefits and risks with your healthcare provider is essential.**

[Dr. Berg's Guidelines for Prolonged Fasting.docx](https://realdrberg-my.sharepoint.com/:w:/g/personal/shawnh_drberg_com/EazcZ9dNJ6VDhEOO13hV0F8BnVvc-Ge6y2mYjpN-FnojYg?e=RHdisz&clickparams=eyJBcHBOYW1lIjoiVGVhbXMtRGVza3RvcCIsIkFwcFZlcnNpb24iOiI1MC8yNDAzMzEwMTgxNyIsIkhhc0ZlZGVyYXRlZFVzZXIiOmZhbHNlfQ%3D%3D).

**The focus of type-1 diabetics is to keep their glucose level under control. This is important. However, it’s also important to keep an eye on your level of insulin. The number of carbs you eat determines the amount of insulin you need. So if you consume lots of carbs, you have to use a lot of insulin. Insulin takes excess glucose and starts to store it throughout the body.**

Taking too much insulin is just as bad as having too much glucose. Fasting will help lower the amount of insulin that you need. Many type-1 diabetics have something called double diabetes.

This is a situation where your pancreas isn’t able to produce insulin (type-1), and your cells are also resistant to insulin (type-2). This means that taking insulin doesn’t always work—your insulin receptors don’t absorb the insulin you inject.

Doing fasting and healthy keto helps prevent insulin resistance.

**While you fast, it’s important to also take nutrients, including:**

• Electrolytes

• B-vitamins

• Trace minerals

• Vitamin C

• Vitamin E

## How Often Should I Do Intermittent Fasting

# How often should I do Intermittent Fasting?

Intermittent fasting offers several schedules, each with its own benefits. The 16:8 method involves fasting for 16 hours and eating within an 8-hour window, typically with two meals. Alternatively, the 20:4 schedule extends the fasting period to 20 hours, followed by a 4-hour eating window, offering additional benefits for brain function, heart health, repair, and anti-aging. OMAD (One Meal A Day) condenses eating into a single daily meal, sometimes necessitating alternate-day OMAD for optimal results. While intermittent fasting, it's advisable to combine it with a healthy ketogenic diet. Try to start with three meals a day without snacking, gradually transition to fewer meals, and listen to your hunger cues so that you can adjust your intermittent fasting plan to best suit your needs.

## How To Avoid Excessive Bloating On Intermittent Fasting

# How to avoid excessive bloating on intermittent fasting?

When reducing meal frequency, increasing portion size can lead to bloating and stress the digestive system. Strategies to overcome this include separating macro-calories, stretching out meals over two hours, and avoiding combining too many food types. Additionally, issues like low stomach acid, certain bloat-inducing vegetables, food allergies like dairy, and fat intake are important to manage, as they can affect digestion and hunger levels differently for each person.

Adjustments should be made based on your individual needs and reactions, but after the body adjusts to a fast, bloating becomes very unlikely as the digestive system will be running smoother than ever.

## Im Not Losing Weight On Keto What Am I Doing Wrong

# I'm not losing weight on Keto, what am I doing wrong?

\### Key Tips for Succeeding on the Keto Diet

1\. **Focus on Fat, Not Carbs**: Your body burns fat only when glucose is absent. Avoid hidden carbs like maltodextrin and tapioca starch. Aim for less than 10 grams of carbs per day.

2\. **Mind Your Eating Habits**: Eating too frequently, consuming sugar alcohols, certain nuts, cheese, or specific vegetables can cause bloating and constipation. Snacking spikes insulin, leading to belly fat. Consider intermittent fasting to reduce insulin spikes.

3\. **Adjust for Age and Metabolism**: People over 40 may benefit from eating one meal a day (OMAD) due to a slower metabolism.

4\. **Understand Menopause and Metabolism**: During menopause, cortisol spikes can cause muscle atrophy, which may appear as fat. Keto helps rebuild muscle and heal insulin resistance over time.

5\. **Moderate Protein Intake**: Too much protein can raise insulin levels. Aim for 3-6 ounces per meal, up to 8 ounces if very active.

6\. **Prioritize Health Over Weight Loss**: Focus on overall health improvements, like increased energy, better cognitive function, and improved sleep, to support weight loss and well-being.

By following these guidelines, you'll not only enhance your chances of weight loss but also enjoy various health benefits on the keto diet.

## What Approaches Can Alleviate Lumbar Disc Pain And How Do They Target  B43Bb1

# What approaches can alleviate lumbar disc pain, and how do they target its causes?

Your intervertebral discs are made up of a gel-like center (nucleus pulposus) surrounded by tough rings (annulus fibrosus), all sandwiched between vertebral endplates. The center is mostly carbohydrate for holding fluid, while the outer rings are mostly protein for strength.

A herniated disc occurs when the gel-like center pushes through the outer rings, sometimes reaching the nerve root. This can cause pain due to inflammation and acidity within the disc.

Factors like type 2 diabetes, metabolic syndrome, and chronic high blood sugar increase the risk of disc herniation.

To potentially alleviate lumbar disc pain, consider these natural remedies:

1. Cut out inflammatory foods like sugar, refined carbs, and omega-6 fatty acids.

2. Practice intermittent fasting and occasional prolonged fasting.

3. Increase your intake of omega-3 fatty acids.

4. Supplement with vitamin D3 (20,000 IUs) and magnesium.

Remember, these are potential remedies and may not work for everyone. Always consult with a healthcare professional for personalized advice.

## Is It Safe And Beneficial To Undergo Colon Cleansing

# Is it safe and beneficial to undergo colon cleansing?

**There are several different types of colon cleansing:** 

• **Colon hydrotherapy** - This is where water goes up the rectum into the large intestine and flushes everything out. This can flush out you’re electrolytes. You may want to take electrolytes after, so you don’t become deficient. You’re also flushing out your friendly bacteria, which would need to be put back in. 

**• Herbal laxatives** - Creates a purging of the material out of the colon 

**• Colema** \- This is a combination of an enema and a colonic. The problem is that it’s very temporary. It also flushes out your electrolytes. If you’re already deficient in electrolytes, this can cause dizziness and even affect your heart. The apple juice a person is supposed to drink while doing the colema, can also keep the blood sugars up, preventing ketosis. 

Fixing your diet (doing keto) may be the best way to go. Typically, fixing the diet can fix whatever issue caused you to want to do the colon cleansing to begin with. I’m not against colon hydrotherapy as a short-term solution for constipation or other conditions. But, it should be supervised, and the electrolytes and friendly bacteria need to be put back in. 

**What you can do:** 

1\. Start fasting 

2\. Decrease inflammation 

3\. Consume phytonutrients 

4\. Consume fermented vegetables

## What Strategies Can Help Address The Hardening Of Heart Walls Includin 3C94Fc

# What strategies can help address the hardening of heart walls, including lifestyle changes, dietary adjustments, and medical treatments?

**If anything could actually extend the longevity of your heart it's the combination of keto and intermittent fasting and doing it healthily. The heart muscle and the inside of the arteries of your heart respond best to vitamin E.** So you should get something called tocotrienols which will immediately help any type of inflammation going on in those areas of your body. Your heart also will carry more oxygen, the heart muscle itself if it has enough vitamin E.

If we're talking about hardening of the arteries, we want to keep things elastic. And with aging, of course, you have more hardening. So there's a couple of things that I would focus on. **First is consuming the high potassium diet on this keto. The potassium and magnesium are going to make your arteries more flexible for sure. And being on a low carb is going to reduce any type of inflammatory condition because it's really all about inflammation that the body then responds as a band-aid and make things really stiff.**

There's some other things you can do to support the heart. Vitamin B3, like niacin with that flush. Also make sure you get enough sleep. And then the one last thing I would recommend is that I wouldn't be afraid of fatty foods. I'd be afraid of carbs because the fatty foods you'll have a lot of vitamin K2 which can help to decalcify the arteries if there is calcium in it.

## Is It Possible To Reduce The Size Of A Cancer Tumor And What Treatment 4Fbaf1

# Is it possible to reduce the size of a cancer tumor, and what treatments or strategies are most effective in achieving tumor shrinkage?

Dr. Berg Nutritionals cannot diagnose, treat, or cure any disease, including cancer. Any information provided is for informational purposes and does not replace medical treatment plans. Based on this understanding, here are steps that can be inferred to potentially help in reducing the size of a cancer tumor or support overall cancer treatment:

1. **Dietary Adjustments**:

    - Limit glucose (sugar) consumption: The link between food intake, especially glucose consumption, and cancer risk is significant. Reducing glucose intake can potentially slow down the growth of cancer cells, as they often rely on sugar for energy. The Healthy Keto diet is a great way to reduce glucose.

2. **Fasting**:

    - Implement fasting protocols: Fasting is a strategic approach that can weaken cancer cells. When you fast, your healthy cells become more resilient, while cancer cells may lose their competitive edge. This can potentially make the body less hospitable to cancer growth.

3. **Exercise**:

    - Regular physical activity: Integrating exercise into your routine can promote cellular repair and improve overall health. Exercise has been shown to support the body's ability to fight off cancer by strengthening the immune system and potentially inhibiting tumor growth.

4. **Reducing Inflammation**:

    - Adopt anti-inflammatory practices: Since cancer can spread into areas of inflammation, reducing inflammation in the body may help slow down or prevent the spreading of cancer cells. This can be achieved through dietary choices, lifestyle changes, and possibly supplements that have anti-inflammatory properties, such as vitamin D and turmeric.

5. **Stress Management and Social Connections**:

    - Manage stress and foster social connections: Chronic stress and loneliness can weaken the immune system and make the body more susceptible to cancer. By managing stress through techniques such as meditation, yoga, or therapy and by seeking out social connections and community support, you can strengthen your body's defenses against cancer.

**It's important to note that these steps should be considered supportive or complementary strategies in a comprehensive cancer treatment plan developed by healthcare professionals. Always consult with your doctor or a medical professional before making significant changes to your lifestyle, diet, or exercise routine, especially when dealing with cancer.**

## What Brand Of Vitamin E Tocotrienols Does Dr. Berg Recommend

# What brand of Vitamin E Tocotrienols does Dr. berg recommend?

When considering Vitamin E supplementation, it's important to understand the different forms and their unique benefits. 

**Understanding Tocopherols vs. Tocotrienols** 

Most people get sufficient **tocopherols** (alpha, beta, gamma, delta) through their diet, so supplementing with this form of Vitamin E isn't usually necessary. However, **tocotrienols** (alpha, beta, gamma, delta) are much harder to obtain from food sources and often where supplementation can be most beneficial. 

A key difference lies in their antioxidant power: tocotrienols are significantly more potent at neutralizing free radicals—up to 50 times faster than tocopherols. Vitamin E, as a whole, is a powerful lipid antioxidant, crucial for protecting the **cell membranes** throughout your body. Without adequate Vitamin E, these membranes can suffer various types of damage. Think of tocotrienols as incredibly fast-spinning antioxidants, efficiently cleaning up and neutralizing free radical damage. 

**Potential Benefits of Tocotrienols** 

The benefits associated with Vitamin E, particularly the tocotrienol forms, are extensive: 

- **Antioxidant Power:** They are highly effective at combating oxidative stress. 

- **Anti-Cancer Properties:** Research suggests potential anti-cancer effects. 

- **Cardioprotective:** They may help protect heart health. 

- **Liver-Protective:** Tocotrienols can support liver function. 

- **Cell Membrane Support:** They play a vital role in maintaining the integrity of cell membranes in your skin, brain, nervous system, and arteries. 

**Natural Sources of Tocotrienols** 

While harder to get, some dietary sources include: 

- Rice (though not typically consumed on a keto diet) 

- Palm oil 

- Annatto (considered one of the best and most potent sources) 

**Buying Vitamin E Tocotrienols** 

If you decide to supplement with Vitamin E, here's what to look for: 

- **Focus on Tocotrienols:** Since tocopherols are generally abundant in diet, prioritize supplements that feature **tocotrienols**. 

- **Source Matters:** Look for tocotrienol supplements derived from **annatto**. Annatto is often favored because it primarily contains delta- and gamma-tocotrienols, which are considered particularly beneficial and potent. Other sources like palm or rice can also be good. 

- **Check the Label for Specific Tocotrienols:** Ensure the product specifies which tocopherols (alpha, beta, gamma, delta) and tocotrienols (alpha, beta, gamma, delta) are included. Ideally, you want a product rich in the **gamma and delta tocotrienol** forms. 

- **"Full Spectrum" or "Mixed Tocotrienols":** Some products are labeled as "full spectrum" or "mixed tocotrienols," meaning they contain all four tocotrienol isomers. This can be beneficial for comprehensive support. 

- **Avoid Isolated Alpha-Tocopherol:** Be cautious of supplements that primarily contain high doses of isolated alpha-tocopherol, as this can sometimes interfere with the absorption and benefits of other Vitamin E forms, including tocotrienols. 

- **Quality and Purity:** As with any supplement, choose reputable brands that provide **third-party testing** for purity and potency. Look for certifications like GMP (Good Manufacturing Practice). 

- **No Fillers:** Check the "Other Ingredients" list to ensure there are no unnecessary fillers, artificial colors, or preservatives. 

While it can be beneficial to get the whole Vitamin E complex in supplement form (both tocopherols and tocotrienols), a common strategy is to ensure adequate tocopherol intake through diet and then specifically supplement with tocotrienols, ideally from a source like annatto.

## What Exercises Can Help Me Lose Weight

# What exercises can help me lose weight?

The type of calories you burn depends on your diet and exercise habits. If you consume sugar, you’re going to burn sugar calories. If you consume fat without sugar, you’ll burn fat. Avoid overtraining, which increases cortisol and can deplete protein from your muscles.

Calorie burning largely depends on the health of your mitochondria. Your energy levels, recovery time, and endurance can indicate whether your mitochondria are healthy. Certain medications like statins weaken the mitochondria.

To increase and strengthen your mitochondria, do the following:

• Exercise with adequate rest

• Focus on thyroid health

• Increase muscle mass

• Intermittent fasting

• Cold therapy

• Consume meat

Metabolomics can examine mitochondria to determine whether they’re getting enough fuel. Insulin resistance can destroy mitochondria. Growth hormone can reduce insulin resistance, help you build more muscle, and burn more fat. If your diet is too high in carbs, you won’t be able to burn fat. This is why it’s essential to look beyond calorie burning. Fat burning is only 15% exercise and 85% diet. The type of exercise that will help you burn the most calories is something that is high-intensity and involves as many muscles as possible.

## What Fat Is Considered Dangerous

# What fat is considered dangerous?

Fat storage is a survival mechanism, but there is a limitation to how much fuel can be stored. Once your body is out of storage, fat is placed around the organs. This type of fat is called visceral fat. If visceral fat is stored for too long, it spills into your organs. This is called ectopic fat. The good news is that when you burn fat, this is the first to go.

It’s not the number of calories that causes this excess fat storage; it’s the type of calories. Alcohol and ultra-processed foods like high fructose corn syrup cause visceral fat and liver fat. Chronic stress can even cause your body to turn things into sugar. Poor sleep can increase cortisol and visceral fat. Certain medications, such as steroids, antibiotics, antidepressants, and anti-anxiety drugs, can also increase visceral fat.

Seed oils, refined sugars, and starches in the diet directly contribute to mitochondrial damage and visceral fat. To lose visceral fat, you need to eliminate ultra-processed calories. Instead, consume nutrient-dense foods like red meat, eggs, and fish.

HIIT exercise is the best exercise for burning fat. HIIT involves short bursts of high-intensity exercise with rest. Weight training can help reduce belly fat by increasing muscle mass. Long walks can help reduce belly fat by burning fat and reducing stress.

Vitamin B1 helps reduce stress and improve sleep.

Nutritional yeast is one of the best sources of B1.

Vitamin D can also help you lose weight. If you can’t go out in the sun, take at least 10,000 IU of vitamin D3. Make sure to take magnesium with vitamin D3 because it allows for vitamin D's proper function and helps improve sleep. Fasting also helps to burn fat fast by reducing insulin spikes.

## Whats The One Vitamin That Reverses Nerve Damage

# What's the one vitamin that reverses nerve damage?

Viruses can hide in the ganglia (a nerve cell cluster) and turn off autophagy, a state in which the body recycles damaged proteins. Here, the viruses can lie dormant until stress levels rise, which increases cortisol and weakens the immune system. Emotional stress can significantly weaken the immune system. This is why many dormant viruses come out of remission after a stressful event, such as losing a loved one.

The herpes and shingles viruses are often seen after a significant stressor. These viruses need the amino acid arginine to survive. Lysine can block arginine and stop the reproduction of these viruses. You need at least 1000 to 3000 mg of lysine to block arginine.

Sciatica typically stems from a disc problem. Copper deficiency is at the root of many disc problems, so it can be an excellent solution for sciatica. A copper supplement or copper cream can help reduce sciatica pain.

Carpal tunnel syndrome is usually caused by a vitamin B6 deficiency. Along with increasing vitamin B6, you also need more vitamin B12 to support the myelin sheaths of your nerves.

Adequate vitamin D3 is vital for conditions like multiple sclerosis and helps reduce inflammation within the nerve cells. To put conditions like MS into remission, you need to take large amounts of vitamin D3—at least 50,000 IU.

The Coimbra Protocol is a well-researched method of using high doses of vitamin D3 to effectively reduce the symptoms of autoimmune conditions. Many people with diabetes develop a condition called peripheral neuropathy that causes numbness in the toes and feet. Vitamin B1 in the form of benfotiamine can penetrate the myelin sheath and help reverse nerve damage caused by high blood sugar. For vitamin B1 to work, you need the cofactor magnesium.

## What Kind Of Fat Is Dangerous

# What kind of fat is dangerous?

In this video, I'll share strategies to lose belly fat by targeting visceral fat, the harmful type stored around your organs.

**Understanding Fat Storage:**

Your body stores fat as a survival mechanism, but there's a limit. Excess fat, especially from unhealthy calories like alcohol and processed foods, accumulates around organs as visceral fat. If not addressed, it spills into organs as ectopic fat. The good news? This is the first fat burned when you lose weight.

**Causes of Excess Visceral Fat:**

- **Unhealthy calories:** Alcohol, high fructose corn syrup, and processed foods are major culprits.

- **Chronic stress:** Stress can trigger your body to turn substances into sugar, leading to fat storage.

- **Poor sleep:** Lack of sleep raises cortisol levels, contributing to visceral fat.

- **Certain medications:** Steroids, antibiotics, antidepressants, and anti-anxiety drugs can increase visceral fat.

- **Unhealthy fats and sugars:** Seed oils, refined sugars, and starches harm your mitochondria and promote visceral fat storage.

**Effective Strategies to Reduce Visceral Fat:**

- **Eliminate ultra-processed foods:** Focus on nutrient-dense options like red meat, eggs, fish, and vegetables.

- **HIIT exercise:** Short bursts of intense exercise followed by rest are highly effective for fat burning.

- **Weight training:** Build muscle to boost metabolism and burn more calories at rest.

- **Long walks:** Reduce stress and burn calories simultaneously.

- **Optimize nutrition:**

    - **Vitamin B1:** Found in nutritional yeast, it helps reduce stress and improve sleep.

    - **Vitamin D3:** Take 10,000 IU daily (with magnesium) if you lack sun exposure.

- **Consider fasting:** Fasting can help reduce insulin spikes and promote fat burning.

By understanding the causes of visceral fat and implementing these strategies, you can effectively reduce belly fat, improve your health, and achieve your weight loss goals.

## Can You Elaborate On The Biochemical Nature Of Inositol

# Can you elaborate on the biochemical nature of inositol?

Inositol is very effective in combating insulin resistance, especially when combined with Healthy Keto and intermittent fasting.

Inositol can help improve symptoms of polycystic ovarian syndrome(PCOS). This is because of its potent effect on insulin resistance, which often causes PCOS in the first place.

You can also take inositol for acne, which is often associated with PCOS. By improving insulin resistance, you can diminish the production of the androgens that cause acne.

Some other benefits of inositol include:

• Decreases cholesterol

• Helps neuropathy or peripheral neuropathy

• Reduces risk of kidney stones

• Helps with the menstrual cycle

• Decreases anxiety and depression

IP6 supplements are an excellent way to consume inositol. IP6 is a type of inositol and is also a phytic acid. Phytic acid is a very powerful antioxidant and chelator that helps the body get rid of excess iron.

In addition to the benefits of inositol, IP6 benefits include:

• Decreases the risk of fibroids

• Decreases the risk of cancer

• Decreases abnormal cells

## What Are Some Important Warning Body Signs That Shouldnt Be Ignored

# What are some important warning body signs that shouldn't be ignored?

These are important warning signs that shouldn't be ignored. It's crucial to consult with a healthcare professional for proper diagnosis and treatment if you experience any of these symptoms.

**5 Warning Signs You Shouldn't Normalize**

1. **Chronic Fatigue:** While fatigue can be a normal part of life, persistent exhaustion that doesn't improve with rest can be a sign of underlying issues like anemia, vitamin deficiencies, infections, or even chronic diseases.

2. **Sudden Weight Loss:** Unexplained weight loss, especially if it's significant, can be a red flag for conditions like hyperthyroidism, diabetes, or even cancer.

3. **Persistent Weakness:** Feeling weak all the time can be due to nutrient deficiencies (iron, magnesium, potassium, vitamin E), but it can also be linked to more serious conditions like anemia or neurological problems.

4. **Chronic Diarrhea:** Occasional diarrhea is common, but if it lasts for weeks or is accompanied by other symptoms like blood in the stool, it's important to investigate potential causes like infections, food intolerances, or inflammatory bowel disease (IBD).

5. **Persistent Stomach Pain:** Stomach pain that doesn't go away or gets worse could be a sign of gallstones, ulcers, pancreatitis, or even certain types of cancer.

**Important Note:**

- **Self-Diagnosis and Treatment:** While the suggestions you've provided (probiotics, intermittent fasting, etc.) may be helpful for some individuals, it's crucial to consult with a healthcare professional for proper diagnosis and personalized treatment plans.

- **Rare but Serious Conditions:** While many of these symptoms can be linked to less serious conditions, it's important to remember that they can also be signs of rare but potentially life-threatening illnesses.

- **Seek Professional Help:** If you're experiencing any of these warning signs, don't hesitate to reach out to a doctor or other healthcare provider for a thorough evaluation.

By paying attention to your body and seeking help when needed, you can ensure that any underlying health issues are addressed promptly and effectively.

## What Are Some Counterintuitive Health Tips That Despite Seeming Unusua 864Be0

# What are some counterintuitive health tips that, despite seeming unusual, have proven to be highly effective for improving health?

**Hormesis describes two things that might oppose each other. In terms of health, hormesis refers to a controlled dose of stress that makes positive changes for your body.**

With hormesis, you can adapt to various types of stress, including exercise, radiation, cold, heat, hypoxia, plant chemicals, pesticides, insecticides, and fungicides. Sulforaphane found in broccoli sprouts and radish sprouts triggers the heat shock protein that allows the body to strengthen its detoxification enzymes. In this instance, the body is exposed to a small amount of poison that strengthens its ability to get rid of other poisons.

**The liver** contains phase 1 and phase 2 detoxification enzymes that can take a poison and turn it into a harmless particle. Sulforaphane triggers this system.

**Exercise** is one of the best examples of hormesis. Exercise induces microinflammation but then allows the body to get rid of inflammation.

**Fasting** activates the body’s mechanisms that counter starvation. It encourages our brain cells to grow, increases mitochondria, and regenerates the immune system.

**Health is often counterintuitive.** For example, cutting fat won’t help you lose fat, and sterilizing your environment won’t protect you from getting sick.

You can’t develop a strong immune system without getting sick. Antibiotics destroy good bacteria in the body, which can lead to pathogen overgrowth. Antacids can lead to more heartburn because you need more acid to get rid of heartburn.

When you don't expose yourself to the sun, you put yourself more at risk for certain types of cancers. Many people have been told that the sun causes cancer, but the sun gives us vitamin D. Having a deficiency in vitamin D can increase your risk for cancer.

**One last example is dieting.** The more dieting you do in your lifetime, the more weight you will gain—especially if you’re doing it incorrectly.

## What Lifestyle Changes Do I Need To Make To Combat Chronic Inflammation

# What lifestyle changes do I need to make to combat chronic inflammation?

## **Lifestyle Changes to Combat Chronic Inflammation**

While chronic inflammation can have serious consequences for your health, the good news is that many lifestyle changes can help reduce inflammation in your body.

These include dietary modifications, regular physical activity, stress reduction, and improved sleep habits.

### **Diet Modifications for Reducing Inflammation**

One of the most effective ways to combat chronic inflammation is through your diet. Certain foods have been shown to have anti-inflammatory properties, while others can promote inflammation in the body.

Some of the best anti-inflammatory foods to include in your diet are:

- Fatty fish like salmon, sardines, and mackerel, which are rich in omega-3 fatty acids

- Leafy green vegetables like spinach and kale

- Berries, especially blueberries, raspberries, and strawberries

- Nuts and seeds, particularly walnuts and flaxseeds

- Olive oil

- Turmeric, ginger, and other spices with anti-inflammatory properties

On the other hand, there are certain foods that can promote inflammation in the body and should be limited or avoided. These include:

- Refined carbohydrates like white bread, pastries, and sugary snacks

- Fried foods and foods high in trans fats

- Red meat and processed meats like hot dogs and bacon

- Sugar-sweetened beverages like soda and sports drinks

Adopting a low-carb, high-fat diet like the ketogenic diet has also been shown to help reduce inflammation in some people. Additionally, practicing intermittent fasting may have anti-inflammatory benefits by giving your body a break from constant food intake.

### **The Importance of Physical Activity**

Regular physical activity is another key lifestyle factor for reducing chronic inflammation. Exercise has been shown to have anti-inflammatory effects in the body, partly by reducing levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines like TNF-alpha.

Aim for at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity aerobic exercise or 75 minutes of vigorous-intensity exercise per week, along with strength training exercises at least twice a week.

Even small amounts of physical activity can help reduce inflammation over time.

### **Reducing Stress and Improving Sleep**

[Chronic stress](https://www.drberg.com/blog/chronic-stress-literally-destroys-immunity) and poor sleep habits can also contribute to inflammation in the body. When you're stressed, your body releases cortisol and other stress hormones that can promote inflammation if they remain elevated for too long.

Similarly, lack of sleep or poor sleep quality can disrupt your body's natural inflammatory response and contribute to chronic inflammation over time.

To help reduce stress and improve sleep, try incorporating some of the following strategies into your daily routine:

- Engage in regular physical activity, which can help reduce stress and improve sleep quality

- Establish a consistent sleep schedule and create a relaxing bedtime routine

- Limit exposure to screens and electronic devices before bed

- Create a cool, dark, and quiet sleep environment

In addition to these lifestyle changes, increasing your intake of vitamin D3 through sunlight exposure or supplementation may also help reduce inflammation in the body.

Vitamin D3 has been shown to have anti-inflammatory properties and may help regulate the immune system.

Finally, avoiding excessive intake of omega-6 fatty acids, which are found in many processed foods and vegetable oils, may also be beneficial for reducing inflammation.

While some omega-6 fatty acids are essential for health, consuming too many of them in relation to omega-3 fatty acids can promote inflammation in the body.

## Managing Chronic Conditions With Fasting

# Managing Chronic Conditions with Fasting

Prolonged fasting offers significant benefits for managing chronic conditions such as diabetes, cancer, and degenerative diseases.

**Diabetes Management**

Fasting improves insulin sensitivity and regulates blood sugar levels, which can help mitigate complications associated with diabetes. Research published in *Diabetes Care* demonstrates that intermittent fasting can enhance insulin sensitivity and lower the risk of type 2 diabetes in individuals with prediabetes.

**Potential Cancer-Fighting Benefits**

Fasting may also have potential in cancer management by inducing ketosis, which deprives cancer cells of glucose needed for growth. A review in *Nature Reviews Cancer* highlights that fasting can enhance the effectiveness of chemotherapy and radiation while minimizing their side effects.

## Whats The Difference Between Sea Kelp And Sea Weed

# What's the difference between sea kelp and sea weed?

## **Sea Kelp vs. Seaweed**

If you're interested in health, nutrition, weight loss, the ketogenic diet, and intermittent fasting, then you may have heard of [sea kelp and seaweed](https://www.drberg.com/blog/kelp-vs-seaweed-whats-the-difference).

While they may seem interchangeable for marine plants that grow in nutrient-rich saltwater environments, there are some key differences between these two natural food sources.

Sea kelp is a brown algae growing along rocky coastlines worldwide. It's known for its high nutrient profile and has been used as a traditional medicine in many cultures throughout history.

In addition to being rich in vitamins A, C, D, and E, as well as minerals such as iodine and iron, it also contains fucoidan, which has potentially anti-inflammatory properties.

"Seaweed" refers to any marine plant or algae that grows in saltwater environments. This includes red algae (such as nori), green algae (such as sea lettuce), and brown algae (such as bladderwrack).

Like sea kelp, seaweeds contain nutrients, including vitamins B12 and C, calcium, magnesium, potassium, zinc, iron, and copper - making them one of nature's most nutrient-dense foods.

### **Differences Between Sea Kelp And Seaweed**

**Taste:** Sea kelp tends to have a milder flavor than other types of seaweeds, which can be pretty salty or bitter, depending on the variety.

**Nutrient profile:** While sea kelp and seaweed offer similar nutritional benefits, their specific vitamin/mineral content will vary based on species/variety.

**Uses:** Sea kelp is often used in supplements or added to foods as a natural source of iodine. Seaweeds are more commonly consumed whole, fresh, or dried and can be used in various dishes such as soups, salads, sushi rolls, etc.

While sea kelp and seaweed may like the same thing, they have distinct differences that set them apart. However, both offer an impressive nutrient profile, making them excellent additions to any healthy diet.

### **Rich in Trace Minerals** 

One of the most well-known benefits of sea kelp is its high [iodine](https://www.drberg.com/blog/8-unexpected-benefits-of-iodine-must-watch) content, which plays a crucial role in maintaining healthy thyroid function.

In addition to iodine, sea kelp contains other essential trace minerals such as selenium and zinc. These minerals are vital for various bodily functions, including [immune system support](https://www.drberg.com/blog/how-keto-protects-your-immune-system), antioxidant activity, and DNA synthesis.

## What Are The Initial Symptoms Or Warning Signs That May Indicate The O 57C800

# What are the initial symptoms or warning signs that may indicate the onset of colon cancer?

Colon cancer risk factors include smoking, excessive alcohol consumption, an unhealthy diet, obesity, and H. pylori infection. While red meat was once associated with colon cancer, recent studies suggest quality (grass-fed vs. grain-fed) matters more than type. Genetics play a minor role compared to lifestyle factors like diet and exercise, which influence gene expression through epigenetics.

Early indicators of colon cancer include blood in the stool, unexplained anemia, thin stools, worsening constipation, abdominal pain, and sudden weight loss or loss of appetite. Consult a doctor if these symptoms arise.

**To potentially prevent colon cancer:**

1\. Limit antibiotics and supplement with probiotics when necessary.

2\. Consider intermittent or prolonged fasting to support colon health.

3\. Include cruciferous vegetables (kale, broccoli, cabbage) for anti-inflammatory and probiotic benefits.

4\. Stay physically active to enhance mitochondrial function and reduce cancer risk.

5\. Use anti-cancer spices like garlic, thyme, and sage in your diet.

6\. Avoid inflammatory foods such as gluten, grains, seed oils, and junk food.

These strategies can help promote colon health and reduce the risk of developing colon cancer.

## Is Autophagy Safe For Someone With Cancer

# Is autophagy safe for someone with cancer?

Autophagy plays a complex role in cancer, acting as a double-edged sword. On one hand, autophagy can protect against disease by removing harmful pathogens and damaged cell parts, acting as a cellular bodyguard. This process is beneficial in preventing the onset of cancer by maintaining cellular health and integrity.

However, once cancer is present, the scenario changes. Autophagy can also aid cancer cells in surviving under stress by providing them a sort of "secret hideout" during their battle against the body's defense mechanisms. This means that while autophagy is generally a protective and beneficial process, it can inadvertently support the progression and survival of existing cancer cells under certain conditions.

Research is examining this paradoxical role of autophagy in cancer, with studies exploring how altering autophagy levels might influence cancer treatment. For example, some drugs traditionally used for other conditions, like hydroxychloroquine, are being investigated for their potential to interfere with this survival mechanism of cancer cells by inhibiting autophagy.

Given this complex relationship between autophagy and cancer, whether autophagy is safe or beneficial for someone with cancer depends on various factors, including the type and stage of cancer, overall health, and specific treatment plans. Individuals with cancer must consult with their healthcare providers before making any changes to their lifestyle or treatment plan that could affect autophagy. Healthcare professionals can provide personalized advice based on the latest research and the individual's circumstances.

## Can I Be Thin And Have Insulin Resistance

# Can I be thin and have insulin resistance?

Insulin resistance can affect individuals of all body types, including those who are thin and struggle to gain weight. It can impact blood sugar levels, mood, cognitive function, and may lead to fatty liver, which isn't always apparent physically.

When following a ketogenic diet, especially when combined with fasting, maintaining weight can be challenging.

## Is Juicing Advisable During Chemotherapy

# Is juicing advisable during chemotherapy?

Well, I don't recommend juicing anything on chemo because the fasting during chemo has a really interesting effect of lessening the side effects from chemo and radiation. So it actually gives you more protection, which is pretty wild.

You actually—if you fast when you have chemo, you actually will get through a lot better. But as far as juicing in general, maybe you want to get more nutrients, then you're going to have to just do a complete greens type thing and no fruit whatsoever because that fruit is just going to feed the cancer. The greens would be good. Cruciferous green would be good, but I don't know how you feel about juicing cruciferous. It's pretty bitter. But if you did juice a daikon radish, and that's one thing I've tried once.

## What Types Of Protein Sources Are Least Likely To Trigger Gout Symptoms

# What types of protein sources are least likely to trigger gout symptoms?

Uric acid, a protein byproduct, can crystallize in joints, causing inflammation, notably in gout. Key points include:

1\. Majority of uric acid (over 60%) originates internally, not from dietary sources.

2\. In gout, the issue lies predominantly in inefficient uric acid elimination by the kidneys, affecting 90% of sufferers.

On ketogenic diets and intermittent fasting:

\- Temporary spikes in uric acid occur during initial adaptation but typically normalize as the body adjusts. Uric acid serves as a potent antioxidant aiding in body healing and cleanup processes.

## Do The Same Rules Of Keto Apply To A Type 1 Diabetic

# Do the same rules of Keto apply to a type 1 diabetic?

I just interviewed someone on this one topic. But he was a fascinating interview, this doctor who actually not, not only was he a type one diabetic, but he ran 20 miles five days in a row and on no calories. He fasted for five days and he did fine.

**So the same rules apply, same rules apply. There's all this false information that we need more carbs if we're a type one diabetic for some reason, but then you're going to just take more insulin. The whole goal is to take the least amount of insulin because that extra insulin creates more problems.**

So yeah, it's the same, same rules. But of course, because you don't have insulin, then you have no way of controlling your carbs when you eat. So you have to monitor that level.

**And there's one condition with type one diabetes that we should bring up. It's called diabetic ketoacidosis.** And that's a situation where you forget to take your insulin and you're a type one and your ketones are out of control.They go way, way, way too high. But that condition is not going to occur if you control your blood sugars with your medication. And it's definitely not going to occur if you're not a diabetic.

## What To Do Before During And After A Workout

# What to do before, during and after a workout?

It’s no surprise that there is an association between a lack of exercise and many different health concerns. One of the biggest benefits of exercise is that it increases the mitochondria. Various diseases are related to mitochondrial dysfunction, including cancer. Exercise also increases stem cells, which can turn into just about anything your body needs.

Exercise helps reduce stress, balance blood sugar levels, supports sleep, and has many other incredible health benefits.

**The four variables of exercise:**

1\. Duration

2\. Intensity

3\. Recovery

4\. Frequency

You need to give your body time to recover, not just between workouts but also during workouts. It's important to rest between four to five minutes between each set. This will allow your body to replenish ATP and help you train with maximum power. Intensity is key with exercise. Focus on higher intensity with more sets and lots of recovery. Many of the benefits of exercise also occur one to two days later during sleep.

Just a small amount of refined carbs can nullify the benefits of exercise. However, if you have diabetes or insulin resistance and are trying to build muscle on the keto diet, you can increase your carbs to 50 grams per day. The type of carbohydrates you can consume are berries and protein.

Other essential tips to increase the benefits from your workouts and support recovery:

1\. Do high-intensity interval training (HIIT)

2\. Come to a full stop vs. active recovery during HIIT workouts

3\. Put more focus on eccentric motions (elongating the muscles)

4\. Do contrasting therapy after you exercise

5\. Build up to exercising during a fasting state (eat one to two hours after a workout)

6\. Consume enough salt and electrolytes (consume electrolyte powder if needed)

7\. Consume red meat, eggs, and high-quality cheese

8\. Don’t exercise over soreness and focus on sleep instead

9\. Take copper before bed to enhance sleep

## Can I Do Keto And Intermittent Fasting If Im A Diabetic On Metformin A 35Db2E

# Can I do Keto and Intermittent Fasting if I'm a diabetic on metformin and insulin?

Whether you have type 1 or type 2 diabetes, both conditions involve high blood sugar and insulin. Metformin makes insulin receptors more responsive, while insulin replaces what the pancreas lacks. In type 1 diabetes, insulin is used to control unstable blood sugars, often resulting in high insulin levels. High insulin is more dangerous than high sugar, as it can damage the retina, kidneys, arteries, and brain. The goal is to minimize insulin use. For type 1 diabetes, despite potentially irreversibly damaged beta cells, it's crucial to reduce insulin use by focusing on diet and intermittent fasting to lower carb intake and improve insulin resistance. Work with your doctor to adjust medications accordingly.

**\*We recommend consulting with your doctor before making any dietary changes, especially if you have any existing health conditions.**

## Can Eating Salad Contribute To Weight Gain

# Can eating salad contribute to weight gain?

Hidden carbs from croutons, dried fruit, or salad dressings can cause weight gain, but if you're following keto and intermittent fasting, they are likely not the issue.

Increased salad intake may lead to digestive issues if your body lacks the necessary microbes and enzymes. Vegetables contain two types of fiber: soluble (retains water) and insoluble (does not). Inadequate fiber breakdown can slow digestion and cause water retention, leading to weight gain.

To prevent this, try:

1\. Steaming vegetables to break down fiber.

2\. Choosing easier-to-digest vegetables like squash, cauliflower, broccoli, and asparagus.

3\. Gradually increasing vegetable intake to build up gut microflora.

This approach helps reduce bloating and water retention while your body adjusts to digesting fiber efficiently.

## What Are The Common Causes Of Nasal Congestion

# What are the common causes of nasal congestion?

Nasal congestion can create a lot of discomfort and difficulties breathing in your daily life. There are simple remedies that can be applied to this condition.

**Symptoms:**

- Stuffy nose

- Runny nose (mucus)

- Headache

- Allergy like symptoms

- Can’t breath

**Cause #1: Fungus**

The most common fungus that causes nasal congestion is called aspergillus fumigatus. If you have not enough friendly bacteria in the body--for example after having a history of taking antibiotics--the result can be an overgrowth of this fungus. One thing to know is that fungus uses carbs, sugar and Iron as food. I suggest using natural antibiotics while building up friendly bacteria in your body.

**Remedies:**

- Take oregano oil

- Take garlic

- You can also do a nasal rinse (Watch this video.)

- Avoid iron in the foods

- Avoid dairy and carbs

- Do intermittent fasting

- Do prolonged fasting (once or twice a month).

- As a general remedy for sinus relief:

    • take serrapeptase (200,000 IU)

- As a general remedy for sinus congestion:

• take serrapeptase (200,000 IU)
• do an acupressure technique (Watch this video.)
• mix 1 teaspoon of apple cider vinegar in water and drink it

**Cause #2: Rhinovirus**

Rhinovirus is a type of viral infection that can affect your nose and can keep them inflamed and congested. Most of the time it is seasonal, however it can be chronic.

**Remedies:**

- Take zinc (150mg)

- Take vitamin D (20,000 IU)

- As a general remedy for sinus congestion:

    - take serrapeptase (200,000 IU)

    - do an acupressure technique (Watch this video.)

- mix 1 teaspoon of apple cider vinegar in water and drink it

**Cause #3: Allergies**

Allergy means intolerance to certain types of foods or elements from outside, like pollen. Your body overreacts to the thing causing allergy, creating a lot of symptoms like inflammation, irritation, nose congestion etc. The best way to see if you have an allergy is to look back and see what you ate or were exposed to just before getting a sinus congestion. Chances are this is the unusual type of food or thing you were exposed to.

**Remedies:**

Take more vitamin A

- eat more meats

- virgin cod liver oil

- grass-fed butter

- kale

Improve the digestion of vitamin A by taking purified bile salts. As a general remedy for sinus congestion:

- take serrapeptase (200,000 IU)

- do acupressure technique (Watch this video.)

- mix 1 teaspoon of apple cider vinegar in water and drink it

## Which Acne Treatments Are Most Effective For Addressing Hormonal Acne  4Eaf1C

# Which acne treatments are most effective for addressing hormonal acne specifically, and how do their mechanisms of action differ from those targeting other types of acne?

The most effective treatment for hormonal acne often involves a combination of dietary and lifestyle changes. Low-carb diet, intermittent fasting, and stress-reducing techniques can lower the risk of menstrual acne and contribute to clearer skin.

## Can I Consume High Fructose Syrup

# Can I consume high-fructose syrup?

**If you follow keto and an intermittent fasting plan – no.**

The problem with high-fructose corn syrup is that it is 53% glucose and 42% fructose–the rest is composed of different types of sugars. The fructose can do some serious damage to
the liver. All of your cells have receptors for glucose, but not fructose. Only your liver can break down fructose. If you consume a lot of fructose, you can overload the liver and create all sorts of health problems.

High fructose corn syrup is also made in a lab with cornstarch. Corn is GMO, so you’re getting that added glyphosate.

Thankfully, high-fructose corn syrup and even sugar are becoming less popular. This may have something to do with the awareness caused by the keto diet.

## I Have Been On Healthy Keto And Omad For 5 Years. Do Cravings For Fatt 92Fe70

# I have been on Healthy Keto and OMAD for 5 years. Do cravings for fatty cheese and sour cream indicate a nutritional deficiency?

I think I would eat those things. Especially if you're craving fat. Consume the fatty cheese. Just make sure it's good quality. If you can find some good European cheese, that's raw. That would be the best for you.

## What Are Some Natural And Effective Methods To Enhance The Production  Dd7E57

# What are some natural and effective methods to enhance the production of Human Growth Hormone (HGH)?

Sprinting is an explosive form of HIIT and has the potential to drastically increase human growth hormone.

**Sprinting can be described as a short bout of full-speed running. Sprinting puts your body under maximum stress, but only for a short amount of time. Try sprinting for about 20 to 30 seconds at a time with 90 seconds of rest in between your sprints, working up to 8 sprints.**

Sprinting can be twice as effective as injecting human growth hormone. If you also decrease your stress levels, increase your sleep quality, and do keto and intermittent fasting, you can really boost HGH naturally.

**To best stimulate human growth hormone, you’ll want to do a short-duration, high-intensity workout with lots of rest. Growth hormone is stimulated by high-intensity exercise but decreases with the duration of exercise. If you have any issues like knee problems that may inhibit your ability to sprint, you can do this same type of exercise on a bicycle or while swimming.**

## How Will Fasting Affect Diabetes

# How will fasting affect diabetes?

**The difference between type-1 and type-2 diabetes is that type-1 diabetes is characterized by a lack of insulin due to pancreatic damage.**

Type-2 diabetes is characterized by a lack of insulin sensitivity. When you have insulin resistance, your body creates far too much insulin. However, this insulin isn't effective because your insulin receptors can't pull in the insulin. Over time, type-2 diabetes can exhaust the pancreas, causing a reduction in inulin production. In turn, some severe types of type-2 diabetes may require insulin shots.

**Hyperglycemia (high blood sugar) has similar side effects as high insulin. Both can cause damage to your nerves and blood vessels—especially in your eyes, kidneys, arteries, heart, and brain.**

An interesting study on three people found that fasting has the potential to reverse insulin resistance and restore insulin's effects on blood sugar levels. All three patients were able to stop taking insulin. Two of the three patients were able to eliminate all medications, and the other patient eliminated 3 out of 4 medications. These results seem to be due to the fact that lowering your consumption of carbs lowers your need for insulin. Keto and intermittent fasting combined may decrease the need for insulin even further. Make sure you do not stop taking your prescription medications without your doctor's approval. Work with your doctor to get healthier by doing keto and intermittent fasting.

## Im Feeling Weak And Fainting After 20 Hours Of Fasting   What Do I Do

# I'm feeling weak and fainting after 20 hours of fasting - what do I do?

**Realize this: you’re going from glucose metabolism to running on ketones and fatty acids, which takes time. And it will take a lot longer if you already have diabetes or insulin resistance. It could take months.**

Let’s say you’re at two meals. Your first meal is at 2pm and your second at 6pm, then you fast for twenty hours. If you’re having a hard time with this schedule, and you feel weak and faint, back up a little to eighteen hours of fasting. Eat at 12pm and 6pm. You haven’t given your body enough time to adapt. You want to let how you feel dictate how quickly you should go from, say, thirteen hours or so of fasting, eating three meals per day at 7am, 12pm, and 6pm. If you feel good, then go to eighteen, and then when you feel good, to twenty.

When you’re at three meals per day, avoid snacks and add more fat to your meals until you’re comfortable and your cravings go away. You also want to feel energetic and have good cognitive function.

**Fainting and feeling weak could be low sodium. Make sure you’re consuming at least one teaspoon of sea salt per day. If you’re exercising you may need a teaspoon and a half. You may also need to increase your B vitamins, especially B1, as well as your electrolytes: potassium and magnesium. Your B vitamins and electrolytes are involved in your metabolism, which helps you to make energy so if you're not taking them that could be why you feel weak and faint. You can add MCT oil to your diet, which gives you more ketones to run on.**

You may not be able to get into ketosis without some help if your insulin resistance is severe enough. Other people are using my fasting tea, which seems to help because it has certain phytonutrients to help their blood sugar.

The main point is to reduce your fasting window if you’re feeling weak and faint after twenty hours of intermittent fasting then gradually increase it.

## Who Shouldnt Do Intermittent Fasting

# Who shouldn't do intermittent fasting?

Certain individuals should avoid intermittent fasting due to specific health conditions. Pregnant women should maintain a nutrient-dense diet with three meals a day without restricting calories. Nursing mothers must ensure they receive all necessary nutrients to avoid deprivation. Individuals with neurodegenerative conditions, such as Alzheimer’s or Parkinson’s, should consume three meals daily with a low carbohydrate intake. Babies and small children should avoid sweets and maintain regular meals.

Those with eating disorders like anorexia and bulimia should also refrain from intermittent fasting. For people with hypoglycemia, intermittent fasting can be beneficial if introduced gradually with nutrient-dense foods to stabilize blood sugar levels. Anxiety can decrease with intermittent fasting as it supports adrenal gland function, and it can also improve sleep disorders by enhancing brain health and reducing the need for sleep. Women with hormonal issues, including PCOS, may benefit from intermittent fasting due to its positive effects on hormone regulation.

## What Factors Contribute To Elevated Blood Sugar Levels In The Morning

# What factors contribute to elevated blood sugar levels in the morning?

This condition, known as the dawn phenomenon, can affect those with type 1 or type 2 diabetes or severe insulin resistance. Elevated morning blood sugar can be caused by:

1\. Cortisol spike: Peaks between 6 and 9 am, increasing glucose production.

2\. Type 1 diabetes: Growth hormone spikes can raise blood sugar.

3\. Type 2 diabetes: The liver produces glucose, and hormones like glucagon and epinephrine may elevate blood sugar.

4\. Evening carbs: Consuming high-carb meals the night before.

To manage high morning blood sugar, try adhering to a healthy ketogenic diet and intermittent fasting. Exercising, avoiding carbs at night, and drinking diluted apple cider vinegar before bed can all help as well.

## How Can I Address Body Odor While On Keto

# How can I address body odor while on Keto?

There are a few things that could cause an odor in your urine or breath, like:

- Liver damage

- Infection

- Dehydration

- Asparagus

- Too much protein

As you transition to keto and intermittent fasting your ketones are going to go up. There
are three types of ketones, but the one that creates the most detectable odor on breath and in urine is acetone. If your urine is darker, cloudy, and has a strong odor chances are it’s going to be acetone (not the nail polish remover; that is different). Your sweat and breath can also have a strong odor as a result.

Your body actually makes acetone as a natural consequence of consuming more fat and less carbohydrate. It is a normal thing and not a concern at all.

To get rid of the odor, increase chlorophyll in your diet. It is a deodorizer that comes from leafy greens. Increase your fluids, and not just by drinking water, but using electrolytes with your water to become more hydrated.

Lastly, as long as you are consistent with your diet, the odor will go away as your body gets adapted to ketosis.

We also recommend trying Dr. Berg's Electrolytes Powder drink. This drink is a perfect keto-friendly beverage! Here is the link: [https://shop.drberg.com/electrolyte-powder-raspberry-lemon-100-servings](https://shop.drberg.com/electrolyte-powder-raspberry-lemon-100-servings)

## How Can I Efficiently Speed Up Muscle Growth

# How can I efficiently speed up muscle growth?

High-intensity exercise and protein consumption build muscle. Aim to consume .8 to 1.5 grams of high-quality protein per kilogram of lean body mass. Athletes may need to consume up to 2 grams of protein per kilogram.

1\. Creatine

Creatine is found in foods, but if you want to grow your muscles quickly, take creatine as a supplement. Creatine acts as a substitute for energy, especially for short-duration high-intensity exercise. Try taking 20 grams of creatine for five days, then a maintenance dosage of 3 grams daily for the rest of the month, and then continue this cycle between the large and small amounts.

2\. Cold therapy

Cold showers, cold immersion, and cryotherapy require your body to generate a tremendous amount of energy to maintain its core temperature. To do this, your body generates a type of fat known as brown fat, which stimulates white fat. This burns a lot of calories! Cold therapy increases the expression of muscle genes in both rats and humans. It increases RNA, which makes the proteins you need to build muscle. Cold therapy also decreases inflammation.

3\. Intermittent fasting

Intermittent fasting stimulates growth hormone, which increases muscle growth. Aim for two meals daily without decreasing your caloric intake—and cut the snacks! Intermittent fasting helps improve insulin resistance, which gets more insulin to the muscle.

4\. Arginine Arginine also increases growth hormone by inhibiting a hormone called somatostatin. Arginine has even been used to increase growth in children. Try taking 3 to 6 grams daily on an empty stomach 30 minutes before you work out.

## Can Omad Cause Nutrient Deficiencies

# Can OMAD cause nutrient deficiencies?

Yes, OMAD can cause nutrient deficiencies, which can lead to fatigue, poor concentration, irritability, skin issues, and hair thinning.  

However, nutrient gaps can be avoided by prioritizing a wide range of nutrient-dense whole foods and taking high-quality dietary supplements.

---

## Nutrition Strategies For Optimal Muscle Gain

# Nutrition Strategies for Optimal Muscle Gain

Macronutrient Balance: Achieving muscle growth requires a careful balance of protein, carbohydrates, and fats. Aim for approximately 1 gram of protein per pound of body weight to support muscle repair and growth. Include healthy fats—like those from avocados, nuts, seeds, and fatty fish—targeting around 0.5 grams per pound of body weight for hormone production and overall health.

Keto, Fasting, and Exercise: Combining ketogenic principles and intermittent fasting with strategic exercise routines enhances muscle development. Brined chicken thighs are a valuable addition, offering lean protein that supports muscle growth and aligns with both keto and fasting protocols.

## What Types Of Fats Are Suitable For A Keto Diet And Intermittent Fasting

# What types of fats are suitable for a keto diet and intermittent fasting?

Consuming healthy fats on the keto diet and during intermittent fasting is crucial to keep your digestive system healthy. The best fats to consume are in the following foods:

1\. Coconut oil

2\. Butter

3\. Olives

4\. Avocado

5\. Egg yolks

6\. Nuts and nut butter

7\. Seeds and seed butter

8\. Animal fats (grass-fed)

9\. Fish and fish oil

Bad fats should be avoided, as they will be harmful to weight loss efforts and overall health. Some bad fats include soy, corn, cottonseed, and canola.

Fats you can use in moderation, but should not rely on too heavily are safflower and sunflower seed oil.

## Whats A Perfect Fasting Window

# What's a perfect fasting window?

Research has found the optimum time of fasting is between 18-24 hours. So if your time of eating (window of eating) is 6 hours, and let's say you eat at 12 noon and then again at 6, this gives 6 hours of eating and 18 hours of fasting. Then, you can slowly adjust your body and graduate to shorter eating windows, until you are fasting for long periods with no discomfort.

If your metabolism is slow and you suffer from insulin resistance, you may benefit greatly from eating only one meal a day, or OMAD. This, in combination with proper sleep and exercise (particularly HIIT training), can boost weight loss efforts, improve insulin sensitivity, and support overall health.

## Can Fasting Hinder Growth In Young Children

# Can fasting hinder growth in young children?

If you're five years old probably don't do fasting very much but the type of fasting that I would recommend for children would be just three meals a day. No snacks.That's what I would recommend and make sure it's nutrient dense.

---

## What Quantity Of Vegetables Should I Consume While Doing Omad

# What quantity of vegetables should I consume while doing OMAD?

When following OMAD (One Meal a Day), the body becomes more efficient at recycling nutrients, so the typical recommendation of 8-10 cups of vegetables may not be necessary. Instead, focus on consuming smaller, high-quality portions of vegetables. For salads, aim for a moderate amount, while for denser vegetables like cabbage or broccoli, around 4 cups should suffice. Adjust based on your appetite and nutritional needs.

---

## Does Keto Cause Headaches

# Does keto cause headaches?

The phrenic nerve goes underneath the diaphragm on the right and left sides and it extends all the way up to the neck and head. On the right side, the phrenic nerve is very close to the gallbladder. If there is any type of congestion with the gallbladder, or bloating, it will put pressure on that nerve. So, if you have a headache on the right side of your head or neck pain on the right side, it could be related to the gallbladder.

When you’re on a ketogenic diet, you’re going to be consuming more fats. When you consume more fats, your body has to adapt to digesting them. You have to have enough bile for the process of digesting the fats. So your gallbladder could be a little overloaded – causing a headache. But it usually goes away pretty fast as your body adjusts to the fat-burning.

---

## Why Do We Only Need A Moderate Amount Of Protein On Keto

# Why do we only need a moderate amount of protein on keto?

This is because 3 oz to 6 oz of protein per meal won’t spike your insulin levels. (This amount may vary depending on your fitness level, metabolism and ability to digest protein.)

You also want to consider your fasting schedule. If you are only eating one meal a day, you may want to add a little more protein to your meal.

Consume grass-fed, grass-finished beef, pasture-raised chicken (with the skin) and eggs as well as wild-caught salmon as good protein sources. Always go for the fattier proteins as that will contribute to lower insulin levels.

## Whats The Worst Type Of Intermittent Fasting

# What's the worst type of intermittent fasting?

Alternate day fasting is when you would fast for one day, and then the next day, you would eat whatever you want. This is an ineffective method of fasting because it is inconsistent, so it makes it difficult for your body to reap the benefits of fasting. Another ineffective method of fasting is the 5:2 method,

With the 5:2 fasting pattern, you can eat whatever you want for five days, and then you fast for two days. This is a poor fasting method because it is essentially just calorie restricting two days a week, and will not actually benefit you in the many ways a 16:8 or 20:4 fasting pattern will.
