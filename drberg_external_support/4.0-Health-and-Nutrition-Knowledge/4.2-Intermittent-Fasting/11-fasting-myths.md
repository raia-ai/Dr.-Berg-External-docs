## What Do I Do If Im Experiencing False Hunger Cravings On Intermittent Fasting

# What do I do if I'm experiencing false hunger cravings on Intermittent Fasting?

Hunger during fasts is due to higher levels of cortisol, the adrenal hormone. Cortisol naturally spikes at 8 a.m. due to the circadian rhythm. This isn't caused by a lack of food but by a temporary hormonal shift that raises and then lowers blood sugar levels. The hunger pangs typically subside within 30-60 minutes. The longer you fast, the better your body will adjust, and the hunger pangs should subside.
