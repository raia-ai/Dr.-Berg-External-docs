## What Foods Should I Eat To Make Fasting Easier

# What foods should I eat to make fasting easier?

When you’re fasting, anything you consume other than water will break your fast to some degree. But, some food items you can consume will have a very minor effect on your ability to get back into fasting. The biggest things that will break your fast are refined carbs or sugar.

Making sure you have enough nutrients while fasting is critical, as this will make it easier. Some things you can consume to make fasting easier are MCT oil (can add it to coffee), electrolytes (be sure there are no added sugars), probiotics, B vitamins, apple cider vinegar, lemon juice, sea salt, amino acid blends, and kombucha tea.

## Is It Possible To Stop Snacking

# Is it possible to stop snacking?

The snacking and grazing cycle can lead to fluctuations in blood sugar and insulin levels, potentially contributing to insulin resistance over time. Here's what to consider:

1\. Eating in response to emotions like depression, fatigue, boredom, or stress can exacerbate these feelings and perpetuate the snacking cycle.

2\. Constantly consuming carbohydrates for pleasure may lead to dopamine resistance, impacting mood regulation.

3\. Mindless eating, such as eating out of habit or availability, can keep you trapped in the snacking cycle.

4\. Fasting, when done correctly, can help break this cycle by promoting the body's use of stored fat for energy, leading to reduced hunger and cravings.

5\. Proper fasting may result in improved mood, cognitive function, and overall well-being.

6\. Strategies to break the snacking cycle include skipping breakfast, understanding the relationship between eating and hunger, avoiding junk foods, staying physically active, and minimizing carb intake during meals.

## Why Do I Have Increased Cholesterol On A Ketogenic Diet

# Why do I have increased cholesterol on a Ketogenic diet?

A fat cell is composed of triglycerides and cholesterol. You are losing weight, you are losing fat, and as you do that the fat cell breaks down. You can burn the triglycerides part of the fat for fuel, but not cholesterol. Cholesterol will be eliminated. So this spike in cholesterol is temporary and will go down.

If you are concerned about your cholesterol or LDL, you may want to request an advanced lipid panel which measures the particle size.

Continue to consume large amounts of veggies to help flush your liver and other organs while you’re on a ketogenic diet and intermittent fasting. Bile salts are also extremely helpful. Bile salts help to regulate excessive amounts of cholesterol so a lack of bile salts can keep your cholesterol high.

## Will Nutritional Yeast Break A Fast

# Will nutritional yeast break a fast?

Nutritional yeast will not break a fast as it contains minimal calories and no sugar. It provides amino acids, trace minerals, and B vitamins. In the morning, I often chew three or four nutritional yeast tablets, which, while not the easiest to chew, make me feel good. You can also use the powdered form on salads for a nutty flavor. Nutritional yeast is an excellent source of B vitamins and won't interfere with fasting.
