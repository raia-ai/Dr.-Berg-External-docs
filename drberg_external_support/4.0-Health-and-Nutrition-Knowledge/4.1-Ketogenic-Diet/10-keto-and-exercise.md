## Is Tuna Good To Consume On Keto

# Is tuna good to consume on Keto?

Yes you can. Some types of tuna are good to consume, and certain types are bad. The “bad” types contain excessive amounts of mercury – 3 times as much as the “good” tuna varieties contain. Mercury interferes with certain enzymes involving selenium.

Some fish have more selenium than others. The mercury in the environment that the fish are exposed to might not affect you too much if the fish is high in selenium. This is because selenium can counter mercury. But if there is too much mercury in the fish, it can lock up the selenium enzymes, making them inactive.

This can create a lot of different symptoms, including:

- Tremors

- Headaches

- Nausea

- Insomnia

- Muscle weakness

- Twitches

- Mood swings

    Types of tuna that have lower amounts of mercury:

- Skipjack tuna

- Canned light tuna

    Types of tuna that have high amounts of mercury:

- Albacore tuna (canned white tuna)

- Ahi tuna (yellowfin tuna and bigeye tuna)

## How Can I Relieve Muscle Cramps That Im Experiencing While On Keto

# How can I relieve muscle cramps that I'm experiencing while on keto?

Add a potassium supplement and make sure you are getting enough potassium-rich greens. It may be a magnesium deficiency and is rarely a sodium deficiency. I recommend getting my Electrolyte Powder for this.

Watch this video where Dr. Berg explains the reasons for muscle cramps on Keto.
