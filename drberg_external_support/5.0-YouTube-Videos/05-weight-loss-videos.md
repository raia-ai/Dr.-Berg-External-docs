- **[00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZ7Hz6QQCOM&t=0s)** — The American Heart Association, the organization that is supposed to prevent heart disease, the number one killer worldwide.
- **[00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZ7Hz6QQCOM&t=7s)** — And they showed up at a committee in Texas where they're trying to pass a bill.
- **[00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZ7Hz6QQCOM&t=11s)** — This bill would restrict people from using food stamps for things like sugary drinks, candy, and other unhealthy foods.
- **[00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZ7Hz6QQCOM&t=19s)** — For the American Heart Association to be against this bill, that might be the surprise of the session.
- **[00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZ7Hz6QQCOM&t=25s)** — And out of all the groups that would oppose that bill, which shocked me, the American Heart Association's director for governmental relationships who came in and opposed it.
- **[00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZ7Hz6QQCOM&t=33s)** — I certainly understand why that might be surprising.
- **[00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZ7Hz6QQCOM&t=35s)** — Now, I think most people know that the American Heart Association gets a lot of funding from the junk food industry.
- **[00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZ7Hz6QQCOM&t=41s)** — But from a public relations standpoint, you don't want the American Heart Association opposing something like that.
- **[00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZ7Hz6QQCOM&t=48s)** — Well, they did. They were embarrassed.
- **[00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZ7Hz6QQCOM&t=49s)** — The Heart Association is concerned about potential impacts of this bill on participation and population health.
- **[00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZ7Hz6QQCOM&t=56s)** — I just was astonished that the American Heart Association was against our SNAP reform bill that would just say you can't have sugary drinks, you can't chips, cookies, limiting that and pushing people more to protein density rich foods.
- **[01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZ7Hz6QQCOM&t=72s)** — They now say that they're no longer opposing that bill.
- **[01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZ7Hz6QQCOM&t=75s)** — I certainly understand why that might be surprising.
- **[01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZ7Hz6QQCOM&t=76s)** — Did you realize that of all the foods, soda is the single most frequent item bought under the SNAP program?
- **[01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZ7Hz6QQCOM&t=84s)** — There's a lot at stake for the soda industry because the subsidies, dollars from taxpayers, pay for the SNAP program in the amount of $10 billion, not million dollars, $10 billion a year for that soda, which then lead to obesity, type 2 diabetes, then feeds big pharma because they're treating the side effects from the junk food industry.
- **[01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZ7Hz6QQCOM&t=105s)** — And on top of that, you have the American Heart Association that's supporting the funding of this thing.
- **[01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZ7Hz6QQCOM&t=111s)** — The soda lobbyists are just going haywire.
- **[01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZ7Hz6QQCOM&t=114s)** — Their latest meme or motto or campaign was saying that this is an issue of liberty, right?
- **[02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZ7Hz6QQCOM&t=120s)** — Freedom to choose what you want to eat.
- **[02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZ7Hz6QQCOM&t=122s)** — The American Heart Association has so many conflicts of interest.
- **[02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZ7Hz6QQCOM&t=126s)** — And what do I mean conflicts of interest?
- **[02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZ7Hz6QQCOM&t=128s)** — I mean money from actual industry, big pharma, big food.
- **[02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZ7Hz6QQCOM&t=131s)** — They have a whole section of the American Heart Association called the Industry Nutrition Forum, where they have Pepsi, General Mills, etc, etc.
- **[02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZ7Hz6QQCOM&t=141s)** — And of course, on various cereals, they have this little American Heart Association certified, okay, because they have the healthy grains of this whole grains.
- **[02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZ7Hz6QQCOM&t=151s)** — You can pay to get this certification.
- **[02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZ7Hz6QQCOM&t=153s)** — Of course, they have the frosted version right here, which also says can help you lower the cholesterol.
- **[02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZ7Hz6QQCOM&t=159s)** — But I don't see the little seal right here.
- **[02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZ7Hz6QQCOM&t=162s)** — Even though both of these have virtually the same amount of carbohydrates, both of these have whole grain oats, corn starch, sugar, corn syrup.
- **[02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZ7Hz6QQCOM&t=172s)** — And of course, the soda industry is also hitting social media big time.
- **[02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZ7Hz6QQCOM&t=176s)** — They're actually paying influencers a lot of money to help them object to this bill.
- **[03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZ7Hz6QQCOM&t=182s)** — In fact, certain influencers were paid over a thousand dollars a post for objecting to this.
- **[03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZ7Hz6QQCOM&t=187s)** — The campaigns that they're doing is they're pushing this food insecurity.
- **[03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZ7Hz6QQCOM&t=192s)** — We need to provide cheap food.
- **[03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZ7Hz6QQCOM&t=194s)** — The entire idea of subsidy came after the Depression when the farmers needed help.
- **[03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZ7Hz6QQCOM&t=199s)** — And this has evolved into a very corrupt operation.
- **[03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZ7Hz6QQCOM&t=202s)** — We're now we're making the junk food industry richer by paying for the raw material.
- **[03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZ7Hz6QQCOM&t=206s)** — Did you realize that one metric ton of that dent corn with the subsidies is one hundred and ninety five dollars?
- **[03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZ7Hz6QQCOM&t=213s)** — Do you have any boxes of corn flakes you can make with one metric ton of dent corn?
- **[03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZ7Hz6QQCOM&t=219s)** — Basically, we're paying the junk food industry to make this junk food.
- **[03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZ7Hz6QQCOM&t=223s)** — Then we're subsidizing the government SNAP program food stamps to make it very easy for people to consume this food.
- **[03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZ7Hz6QQCOM&t=230s)** — Now realize we already paid for a lot of the raw material for these junk foods to be made.
- **[03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZ7Hz6QQCOM&t=234s)** — Now we as taxpayers pay a second time for certain people that have food stamps to consume that junk food,
- **[04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZ7Hz6QQCOM&t=241s)** — which we know 90 percent of chronic disease comes from junk food.
- **[04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZ7Hz6QQCOM&t=245s)** — And the majority of big pharma treats the side effects from junk food.
- **[04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZ7Hz6QQCOM&t=249s)** — So as you can see, the system is not broken. It's working perfectly.
- **[04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZ7Hz6QQCOM&t=253s)** — It's just not working for you. Do the people that subsidize the SNAP program benefit?
- **[04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZ7Hz6QQCOM&t=258s)** — No. Who benefits? Big food and big pharma. Here's my thought on this whole thing.
- **[04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZ7Hz6QQCOM&t=262s)** — I think they should continue the SNAP program for nutrient dense foods, not ultra processed foods,
- **[04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZ7Hz6QQCOM&t=268s)** — because that would not only reduce chronic disease, it would also save a tremendous amount of money with all the prescription medication.
- **[04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZ7Hz6QQCOM&t=276s)** — We're really in a PR war right now where the junk food industry is trying everything it can to maintain these profits because there's a tremendous amount of money at stake.
- **[04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZ7Hz6QQCOM&t=287s)** — Just the soda industry subsidies alone. Ten billion dollars.
- **[04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZ7Hz6QQCOM&t=292s)** — A lot of the sweetener in the soda is high fructose corn syrup.
- **[04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZ7Hz6QQCOM&t=295s)** — It goes to the liver. It creates a fatty liver, creates high blood pressure, it creates diabetes, it inflames the inside of the arteries, it starts heart disease.
- **[05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZ7Hz6QQCOM&t=304s)** — But it's mind blowing to me that out of all the organizations, the American Heart Association was the one that stood up and opposed this bill.
- **[05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZ7Hz6QQCOM&t=313s)** — You have to realize that the junk food industry never is the one that's objecting to it.
- **[05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZ7Hz6QQCOM&t=318s)** — They use other organizations or front groups to do that type of work.
- **[05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZ7Hz6QQCOM&t=322s)** — Anyway, I am just really curious what you think about this topic. Please let me know in the comments down below.

- **[00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKKip5qp6_k&t=0s)** — Okay, we're in video two. The side effects of having insulin resistance, okay?
- **[00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKKip5qp6_k&t=5s)** — You're eventually going to become a diabetic if you're not already diabetic so far.
- **[00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKKip5qp6_k&t=9s)** — Belly fat. You will not be able to lose your belly fat because all this fat in the gut, and that is called disceral fat, is
- **[00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKKip5qp6_k&t=17s)** — insulin. Okay, that's what that's what's causing it. If you had low insulin, you wouldn't have a gut.
- **[00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKKip5qp6_k&t=24s)** — Acne. Okay, that's one side effect. Cystic acne.
- **[00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKKip5qp6_k&t=29s)** — Polycystic ovarian
- **[00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKKip5qp6_k&t=30s)** — disorder. Now, if you don't know anything about that, that's fine. Don't worry about it. But if you're a female and you have it,
- **[00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKKip5qp6_k&t=35s)** — it's where a female has high level of
- **[00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKKip5qp6_k&t=38s)** — androgen, high levels of androgen. That's a male hormone. So they have facial hair.
- **[00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKKip5qp6_k&t=42s)** — They lose their hair and they gain, they get a deep voice and they get fat. And
- **[00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKKip5qp6_k&t=47s)** — that comes from insulin. That's what causes it. High blood pressure.
- **[00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKKip5qp6_k&t=52s)** — High cholesterol.
- **[00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKKip5qp6_k&t=54s)** — Fatty liver.
- **[00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKKip5qp6_k&t=57s)** — Tired after eating.
- **[00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKKip5qp6_k&t=59s)** — Swollen belly, especially when you eat. Not satisfied after eating.
- **[01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKKip5qp6_k&t=66s)** — The great need for eating,
- **[01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKKip5qp6_k&t=68s)** — you can't go for a period of time without needing to eat something. And excessive urination at night.
- **[01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKKip5qp6_k&t=74s)** — Okay, those are all the side effects of insulin resistance. Okay?
- **[01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKKip5qp6_k&t=77s)** — All right, good. Now in the next video, I'm going to show you what to do about it. Check this out.

- **[00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ALt5tgCFgg&t=0s)** — So if you have that loose, saggy skin underneath your arms,
- **[00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ALt5tgCFgg&t=4s)** — you're going to be very excited to watch this video.
- **[00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ALt5tgCFgg&t=8s)** — Typically a person with loose skin underneath their arms
- **[00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ALt5tgCFgg&t=11s)** — might just think it's a fat problem and they just need to lose weight.
- **[00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ALt5tgCFgg&t=15s)** — So they do all this cardio and they change their diet
- **[00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ALt5tgCFgg&t=19s)** — and it doesn't do anything. So what I have to share with you first is
- **[00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ALt5tgCFgg&t=23s)** — what the problem really is and from there
- **[00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ALt5tgCFgg&t=26s)** — we can come up with a really good solution. Now there's a term I want to
- **[00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ALt5tgCFgg&t=29s)** — introduce you to
- **[00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ALt5tgCFgg&t=30s)** — called sarcopenia, age-related
- **[00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ALt5tgCFgg&t=33s)** — muscle loss. And this may or may not be happening to you depending on your age.
- **[00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ALt5tgCFgg&t=39s)** — And one other thing. Are you sitting down for this?
- **[00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ALt5tgCFgg&t=43s)** — Immobility. If you immobilize
- **[00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ALt5tgCFgg&t=46s)** — a muscle or a joint, is it the muscle that actually keeps the shape
- **[00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ALt5tgCFgg&t=51s)** — of the arm? The answer is no. It's this right here.
- **[00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ALt5tgCFgg&t=56s)** — So in our bodies we have saran wrap. We have a certain
- **[00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ALt5tgCFgg&t=59s)** — wrapping tissue that surrounds the muscle.
- **[01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ALt5tgCFgg&t=62s)** — And that tissue is called fascia.
- **[01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ALt5tgCFgg&t=65s)** — Fascia is the bag that surrounds the arm
- **[01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ALt5tgCFgg&t=68s)** — and holds everything in a nice tight
- **[01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ALt5tgCFgg&t=72s)** — way. And in this diagram here you'll see you have the skin
- **[01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ALt5tgCFgg&t=75s)** — and then just underneath it you have a layer of fat.
- **[01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ALt5tgCFgg&t=79s)** — It's called subcutaneous fat. And then you have the first layer
- **[01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ALt5tgCFgg&t=82s)** — of fascia. Okay.
- **[01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ALt5tgCFgg&t=85s)** — And then you have another layer of fat.
- **[01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ALt5tgCFgg&t=88s)** — And then you have another layer of fascia. And then you have the muscle.
- **[01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ALt5tgCFgg&t=93s)** — And fascia also becomes immobilized
- **[01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ALt5tgCFgg&t=98s)** — with immobility and aging.
- **[01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ALt5tgCFgg&t=101s)** — Yes, you might have some fat there that needs to be dealt with
- **[01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ALt5tgCFgg&t=104s)** — but probably the bigger problem is this atrophy of the fascia
- **[01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ALt5tgCFgg&t=107s)** — and the muscle. Now there's an interesting book that I'm reading
- **[01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ALt5tgCFgg&t=110s)** — right here. Fascia treatment with shock waves which
- **[01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ALt5tgCFgg&t=114s)** — I'm not recommending in this video anything about the shock waves. That
- **[01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ALt5tgCFgg&t=117s)** — would be
- **[01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ALt5tgCFgg&t=118s)** — for more of a myofascial problem which
- **[02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ALt5tgCFgg&t=122s)** — we're not talking about. But I want to share something in this book,
- **[02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ALt5tgCFgg&t=126s)** — this very expensive book. Fascia
- **[02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ALt5tgCFgg&t=129s)** — can change its tone. It has contractile cells within the fascia
- **[02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ALt5tgCFgg&t=134s)** — itself. It can change its tone. So the question is
- **[02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ALt5tgCFgg&t=138s)** — how? We just basically undo the immobility and we start to
- **[02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ALt5tgCFgg&t=143s)** — move it. But here's the problem. If you do this
- **[02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ALt5tgCFgg&t=148s)** — on more of an isolated basis where you're just working two muscles, right?
- **[02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ALt5tgCFgg&t=153s)** — You're extending the tricep or you're
- **[02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ALt5tgCFgg&t=155s)** — contracting the bicep. That doesn't involve the fascia. It only
- **[02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ALt5tgCFgg&t=159s)** — involves the muscle. Fascia is much more
- **[02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ALt5tgCFgg&t=163s)** — dynamic and it crosses over a lot of different muscle groups.
- **[02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ALt5tgCFgg&t=167s)** — So the type of solution that I'm going to recommend
- **[02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ALt5tgCFgg&t=170s)** — is not a two-dimensional contraction relaxation type
- **[02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ALt5tgCFgg&t=174s)** — exercise but more of a functional exercise that involves like at least
- **[02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ALt5tgCFgg&t=179s)** — 20 muscles. Because it's all one continuous unit.
- **[03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ALt5tgCFgg&t=183s)** — If you're just going to focus on this one small area with...
- **[03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ALt5tgCFgg&t=187s)** — if you're neglecting what it's connected to, the back part,
- **[03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ALt5tgCFgg&t=191s)** — we're probably not going to see much change. So I'm going to show you the
- **[03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ALt5tgCFgg&t=195s)** — exercises to start out with. Which I'm going to put a link down below.
- **[03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ALt5tgCFgg&t=198s)** — Rather than reinvent the wheel, you just need to watch how this person does
- **[03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ALt5tgCFgg&t=202s)** — this exercise because she did a wonderful job of doing
- **[03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ALt5tgCFgg&t=205s)** — the most incredible dynamic functional exercises
- **[03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ALt5tgCFgg&t=210s)** — with the arms without any added weight. The fascia adds elasticity,
- **[03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ALt5tgCFgg&t=218s)** — flexibility, posture. It holds everything up. If we didn't have it,
- **[03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ALt5tgCFgg&t=223s)** — we'd just basically be this big ball of mush. So really,
- **[03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ALt5tgCFgg&t=227s)** — the solution is a lot of movement in that area.
- **[03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ALt5tgCFgg&t=230s)** — Even in anatomy and physiology, when you take the courses, you learn the
- **[03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ALt5tgCFgg&t=234s)** — origin insertion of the muscles. And that's important.
- **[03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ALt5tgCFgg&t=238s)** — But in life, we're not just using like one or two muscles.
- **[04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ALt5tgCFgg&t=241s)** — The motions that we do in living are very, very dynamic.
- **[04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ALt5tgCFgg&t=245s)** — And that's why going to the gym and just isolating
- **[04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ALt5tgCFgg&t=248s)** — one muscle at a time, I don't think is the best workout. Especially
- **[04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ALt5tgCFgg&t=252s)** — for your fascia because the fascia wraps around and it goes to other muscles.
- **[04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ALt5tgCFgg&t=257s)** — It's one big sheath that kind of covers everything.
- **[04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ALt5tgCFgg&t=261s)** — All right, so here's the first step. Okay. And I would recommend watching
- **[04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ALt5tgCFgg&t=264s)** — this entire video. But this is an arm workout. So as
- **[04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ALt5tgCFgg&t=269s)** — you can see, she has a timer there. You can follow along.
- **[04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ALt5tgCFgg&t=274s)** — And she's just about ready to show you the first exercise
- **[04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ALt5tgCFgg&t=278s)** — that involve not just the arm, but the shoulder itself.
- **[04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ALt5tgCFgg&t=283s)** — No weights. Okay, then she goes to another workout right here where she's doing a
- **[04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ALt5tgCFgg&t=288s)** — different motion. Okay, this involving the shoulders, the arms, etc.
- **[04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ALt5tgCFgg&t=295s)** — Then she does a series of additional exercises, including this one where she's
- **[04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ALt5tgCFgg&t=299s)** — pushing her arms out and in. Okay, looks easy.
- **[05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ALt5tgCFgg&t=305s)** — Incredibly difficult. Okay, your arms are going to
- **[05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ALt5tgCFgg&t=308s)** — burn. So just do as much as you can this first workout. You don't want to get too
- **[05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ALt5tgCFgg&t=311s)** — sore. Now what you're doing in this functional exercise, you're doing a
- **[05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ALt5tgCFgg&t=315s)** — series of moves and motions that involve the fascia and the muscle.
- **[05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ALt5tgCFgg&t=322s)** — And you're going to do this workout as much as you can until you have no
- **[05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ALt5tgCFgg&t=326s)** — more soreness. Now it could take a week before all the soreness goes
- **[05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ALt5tgCFgg&t=330s)** — away. And then you want to do it again. You're going to keep doing these
- **[05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ALt5tgCFgg&t=334s)** — exercises over and over and over until the point where you can do them
- **[05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ALt5tgCFgg&t=337s)** — comfortably. And there's very little, if any, soreness at all.
- **[05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ALt5tgCFgg&t=342s)** — All right, so now that you went through this exercise, which you work
- **[05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ALt5tgCFgg&t=345s)** — in the muscle, we want to go heavier into the fascia using one of these
- **[05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ALt5tgCFgg&t=351s)** — right here. Okay, bands. And I found a really good exercise for that
- **[06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ALt5tgCFgg&t=360s)** — maneuver right here. We're going to take a look at it right now. Okay.
- **[06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ALt5tgCFgg&t=364s)** — And you can see this person is taking these bands and they're stretching
- **[06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ALt5tgCFgg&t=371s)** — all the way to the lateral side of their body. And they're really
- **[06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ALt5tgCFgg&t=376s)** — activating the fascia. All the fascia that comes underneath here comes
- **[06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ALt5tgCFgg&t=381s)** — all the way down your arm through here. Okay. So what we want to do is
- **[06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ALt5tgCFgg&t=386s)** — we want to stretch all of that because it's not just the exercise
- **[06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ALt5tgCFgg&t=390s)** — that stimulates the reversal of atrophy. It's also stretching. Stretching
- **[06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ALt5tgCFgg&t=396s)** — will help activate the fascial bag around this tissue and start
- **[06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ALt5tgCFgg&t=401s)** — tightening it because it has contractile tissue. And of course,
- **[06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ALt5tgCFgg&t=404s)** — you want to do the other side. Okay, with these bands.
- **[06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ALt5tgCFgg&t=409s)** — Do both sides. Okay, and you'll see that then he transitions to
- **[06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ALt5tgCFgg&t=415s)** — another maneuver, which is on your knees. It goes through that
- **[06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ALt5tgCFgg&t=419s)** — technique. Amazing stretches. I mean, for your fascia, it's going to
- **[07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ALt5tgCFgg&t=425s)** — tighten up underneath your arm and you're going to do both sides.
- **[07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ALt5tgCFgg&t=429s)** — And then once you graduated from that video, there's one more
- **[07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ALt5tgCFgg&t=432s)** — that I found. That's awesome. Now you're going to add weight
- **[07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ALt5tgCFgg&t=436s)** — to your arms while you do some of these exercises. And this
- **[07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ALt5tgCFgg&t=439s)** — video is called solid arms and shoulders 30 minutes strength
- **[07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ALt5tgCFgg&t=443s)** — workout with dumbbells. Okay. And of course you want to use the
- **[07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ALt5tgCFgg&t=446s)** — weight for this. So maybe you start out with a five pound weight,
- **[07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ALt5tgCFgg&t=450s)** — go to a 10 pound weight, maybe a 15 pound weight, but probably
- **[07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ALt5tgCFgg&t=454s)** — not anything more than that. So in this exercise, you can see
- **[07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ALt5tgCFgg&t=458s)** — that she has dumbbells. And she's basically going to work
- **[07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ALt5tgCFgg&t=462s)** — her arms one at a time over her head, which I like this a
- **[07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ALt5tgCFgg&t=465s)** — lot better than doing curls because you're working the
- **[07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ALt5tgCFgg&t=468s)** — entire arm, shoulder, everything. So you're not just working
- **[07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ALt5tgCFgg&t=471s)** — the tricep. It's very functional, very simple. And she
- **[07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ALt5tgCFgg&t=476s)** — has a countdown so you can do that. This is a great video. So
- **[07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ALt5tgCFgg&t=479s)** — I don't have to reinvent the wheel. These are three amazing
- **[08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ALt5tgCFgg&t=482s)** — videos that I think you can use in the recovery of the
- **[08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ALt5tgCFgg&t=488s)** — fascia underneath your arm, as well as the atrophied
- **[08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ALt5tgCFgg&t=491s)** — muscle underneath your arms. And on that note, I have the
- **[08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ALt5tgCFgg&t=495s)** — first video connected right here. Check it out.

- **[00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iaUspumK5ZU&t=0s)** — I'm going to show you exactly what to do to no longer have cold feet or cold hands.
- **[00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iaUspumK5ZU&t=6s)** — Typically, what do people mostly do? They wear maybe triple socks. They put their feet next to
- **[00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iaUspumK5ZU&t=11s)** — a heater every morning. They might use compression stockings. They maybe try to hydrate their body.
- **[00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iaUspumK5ZU&t=17s)** — Or maybe they actually put cayenne pepper in their socks. But the problem is it might not
- **[00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iaUspumK5ZU&t=21s)** — last. This problem keeps coming back. And so when you research this topic, it kind of boils
- **[00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iaUspumK5ZU&t=27s)** — Maybe you have a thyroid problem. Maybe you have peripheral artery disease or circulation.
- **[00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iaUspumK5ZU&t=34s)** — Or maybe Raynaud's phenomena where you have this circulatory problem where your extremities like
- **[00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iaUspumK5ZU&t=39s)** — your fingers or even your toes are blue because the body is not able to pump blood flow very
- **[00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iaUspumK5ZU&t=44s)** — effectively. Or maybe it's related to a nerve problem, a neuropathy because you're diabetic.
- **[00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iaUspumK5ZU&t=51s)** — You might have what's called peripheral neuropathy. But what if you have none of
- **[00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iaUspumK5ZU&t=54s)** — problems? And your freaking feet are freezing all the time and your fingers are cold. What do you
- **[01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iaUspumK5ZU&t=60s)** — do? Today I'm going to give you a good solution. And as a side note, if you do have Raynaud's
- **[01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iaUspumK5ZU&t=65s)** — phenomena, usually that's an autonomic nervous system problem and responds to B1. I would
- **[01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iaUspumK5ZU&t=72s)** — recommend taking the fat soluble version, benfotamine, which can also, by the way,
- **[01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iaUspumK5ZU&t=77s)** — help you if you have peripheral neuropathy. But that's just a side note. There's a really
- **[01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iaUspumK5ZU&t=82s)** — amazing, simple and expensive treatment to warm up your feet and hands. It involves exercising
- **[01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iaUspumK5ZU&t=90s)** — the arteries. The arteries have a muscle. It's a smooth muscle. And those muscles contract and
- **[01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iaUspumK5ZU&t=99s)** — relax. And that contraction is called vasoconstriction. And the relaxation is
- **[01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iaUspumK5ZU&t=103s)** — called vasodilation. So what I'm going to recommend is you exercise that system
- **[01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iaUspumK5ZU&t=108s)** — once or twice a day, only spending maybe a minute and a half to two minutes each day.
- **[01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iaUspumK5ZU&t=115s)** — And this treatment actually increases the mitochondria in your blood vessels. It'll
- **[02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iaUspumK5ZU&t=120s)** — increase oxygen circulation and it'll really greatly help the autonomic nervous system.
- **[02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iaUspumK5ZU&t=126s)** — So this is what you do. You take a bucket, maybe a five gallon bucket,
- **[02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iaUspumK5ZU&t=130s)** — and fill about one third of it with ice and the rest with water. Okay, then you're going
- **[02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iaUspumK5ZU&t=138s)** — to stick your feet in it and your hands in it if your hands are cold. And you're going to
- **[02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iaUspumK5ZU&t=143s)** — wait for about one to two minutes when your feet and hands start to change and become
- **[02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iaUspumK5ZU&t=151s)** — slightly warmer. Now what's happening is you're creating a hermetic effect. You're adding
- **[02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iaUspumK5ZU&t=156s)** — a mild stress, which might seem like a major stress. And what's going to happen is your body's
- **[02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iaUspumK5ZU&t=162s)** — going to start to adapt and the temperature of your feet are going to start to warm up
- **[02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iaUspumK5ZU&t=168s)** — over time. Over maybe three to four or five days after doing this on a daily basis or even
- **[02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iaUspumK5ZU&t=175s)** — twice a day. And sometimes it might take a couple weeks. But this cold therapy, you would
- **[03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iaUspumK5ZU&t=180s)** — think that it just creates a vasoconstriction and gets rid of the blood flow, but you're
- **[03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iaUspumK5ZU&t=185s)** — actually creating a lot of communication into your feet and your hands. Also pushing out a lot
- **[03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iaUspumK5ZU&t=192s)** — of lactic acid and waste products. And you're going to actually be probably very surprised how
- **[03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iaUspumK5ZU&t=198s)** — this works. Now, some of you are going, there's no way in heck I'm going to do this. But
- **[03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iaUspumK5ZU&t=202s)** — all I'm saying is you just might want to try it. Try it for three days. And I think
- **[03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iaUspumK5ZU&t=207s)** — you're going to be quite shocked how this is going to help you. It's probably the only thing
- **[03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iaUspumK5ZU&t=211s)** — you haven't tried before. But it's going to work. Now, when I was in practice,
- **[03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iaUspumK5ZU&t=216s)** — a lot of the therapies and treatments that I did were totally opposite of what mainstream
- **[03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iaUspumK5ZU&t=222s)** — does. I mean, I had techniques like even for pain, like whether you have pain in your foot
- **[03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iaUspumK5ZU&t=229s)** — or your knee or a part of your body, people would come in, they would fly in from around
- **[03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iaUspumK5ZU&t=234s)** — the world for this chronic pain syndrome problem that no one was able to fix. And what would I do?
- **[04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iaUspumK5ZU&t=243s)** — So if they had a problem on the left side of their body, you know what I would do? I would
- **[04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iaUspumK5ZU&t=247s)** — work on the opposite side. I would work on the good side. And the results I got were
- **[04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iaUspumK5ZU&t=252s)** — unbelievable. If you haven't seen any of my videos on pain relief, you can do a search on
- **[04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iaUspumK5ZU&t=257s)** — that. But when I was in practice, boy, these techniques were just highly effective.
- **[04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iaUspumK5ZU&t=261s)** — And people got results within a very short period of time. Whereas traditionally, and also the way
- **[04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iaUspumK5ZU&t=268s)** — I was taught is you do therapy on where you hurt. Well, the same thing applies to a lot of
- **[04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iaUspumK5ZU&t=273s)** — other things in healthcare. And especially if you have cold feet. I mean, the last thing that
- **[04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iaUspumK5ZU&t=279s)** — you would even imagine to do would be to add more cold to cold feet. The same thing with
- **[04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iaUspumK5ZU&t=285s)** — There's all sorts of high level athletes and Olympic athletes that train in low oxygen
- **[04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iaUspumK5ZU&t=292s)** — or high altitudes where there's thin air to add a stress to get their body to adapt to
- **[04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iaUspumK5ZU&t=298s)** — become stronger and more fit. I mean, I'll give you another example. I had one lady.
- **[05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iaUspumK5ZU&t=304s)** — She was an opera singer. Okay. And she flew in from somewhere in the United States. It
- **[05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iaUspumK5ZU&t=310s)** — wasn't close by. She heard from a friend who told her from another friend that I got good
- **[05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iaUspumK5ZU&t=316s)** — results with laryngitis and hoarseness of the throat. She had this huge event that she had to
- **[05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iaUspumK5ZU&t=323s)** — sing and not being able to perform was a major, major problem because he was scheduled
- **[05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iaUspumK5ZU&t=329s)** — and like within a week. So she flew out to see me and she had this scratchy throat right
- **[05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iaUspumK5ZU&t=335s)** — the scratchy hoarseness throat. And what did I do? I did work on the opposite side in the back
- **[05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iaUspumK5ZU&t=343s)** — part of her neck and I have videos of how to do this. And I pretty much did this like
- **[05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iaUspumK5ZU&t=348s)** — through the day, like every two hours through like one or two days. By the end of the first
- **[05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iaUspumK5ZU&t=353s)** — day, it was probably 50% better. By the end of the second day, it was close to 80 to 90% better.
- **[06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iaUspumK5ZU&t=360s)** — So all I'm saying is you should just try this technique to see if it works and then
- **[06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iaUspumK5ZU&t=365s)** — comment down below and then I'll go ahead and read the comments. I think you're going to
- **[06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iaUspumK5ZU&t=369s)** — find that it's very effective. Now since we're on the topic of circulation, if you do have
- **[06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iaUspumK5ZU&t=375s)** — peripheral neuropathy and you haven't watched this video, it might be a good idea. I put that
- **[06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iaUspumK5ZU&t=380s)** — video up right here.

- **[00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGEWoPmvPJY&t=0s)** — Now what would happen if you ate like a cow?
- **[00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGEWoPmvPJY&t=3s)** — I'm not talking about when you look out into the field and you see this cow grazing on the grass.
- **[00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGEWoPmvPJY&t=9s)** — I'm talking about what a cow eats in the last 200 days of its life.
- **[00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGEWoPmvPJY&t=13s)** — This cow is forced to consume a tremendous amount of starch.
- **[00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGEWoPmvPJY&t=17s)** — The cow is prevented from doing a lot of exercise because they're very small spaces
- **[00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGEWoPmvPJY&t=21s)** — and they're put in front of the starch three times a day.
- **[00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGEWoPmvPJY&t=24s)** — Their diet the last 200 days is about between 70 and 90 percent starch.
- **[00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGEWoPmvPJY&t=29s)** — Take a look at our food pyramid for a second.
- **[00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGEWoPmvPJY&t=33s)** — You can see at the very top, used sparingly, fats, oils and sweets.
- **[00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGEWoPmvPJY&t=37s)** — It says not to eat a lot of sugar.
- **[00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGEWoPmvPJY&t=38s)** — If we look at the very bottom, the majority of calories, 6 to 11 servings,
- **[00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGEWoPmvPJY&t=44s)** — should be in the form of starch.
- **[00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGEWoPmvPJY&t=46s)** — And that would be like bread, pasta, cereal, crackers, biscuits, things like that.
- **[00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGEWoPmvPJY&t=49s)** — The average American consumes between 65 to 70 percent of their calories as starches.
- **[00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGEWoPmvPJY&t=58s)** — I want to show you something. Corn chips.
- **[01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGEWoPmvPJY&t=60s)** — Okay, and we look at the back of the label.
- **[01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGEWoPmvPJY&t=61s)** — Tell me how many sugars we have.
- **[01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGEWoPmvPJY&t=63s)** — Zero sugars. How many carbohydrates?
- **[01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGEWoPmvPJY&t=65s)** — 18 grams. That's per serving size, per 15 chips.
- **[01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGEWoPmvPJY&t=69s)** — Now let's look at flour tortillas.
- **[01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGEWoPmvPJY&t=71s)** — Zero sugars, 25 grams of carbohydrate.
- **[01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGEWoPmvPJY&t=76s)** — Let's not forget corn flakes.
- **[01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGEWoPmvPJY&t=77s)** — Three grams of sugar and 35 grams of carbohydrate.
- **[01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGEWoPmvPJY&t=81s)** — I want to explain the very big confusion that people have related to carbohydrates.
- **[01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGEWoPmvPJY&t=85s)** — I think everyone knows that sugar is not that healthy.
- **[01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGEWoPmvPJY&t=88s)** — What about carbohydrates? If we deduct the sugars in the fiber, what is left?
- **[01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGEWoPmvPJY&t=92s)** — And the answer is starch.
- **[01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGEWoPmvPJY&t=94s)** — What's the difference between a sugar and a starch?
- **[01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGEWoPmvPJY&t=98s)** — A sugar molecule, like we call glucose, is like just one molecule of sugar.
- **[01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGEWoPmvPJY&t=102s)** — So sugar, and we're just going to talk about the basic foundation or building block of sugar, is glucose.
- **[01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGEWoPmvPJY&t=108s)** — But with a starch, you have a chain of glucose stuck together.
- **[01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGEWoPmvPJY&t=112s)** — Now you know what a starch is.
- **[01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGEWoPmvPJY&t=113s)** — And no, we're not just talking about whole starches like potato or even like rice or even whole grains.
- **[02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGEWoPmvPJY&t=120s)** — I'm talking about the refined stuff like this right here.
- **[02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGEWoPmvPJY&t=123s)** — Corn starch.
- **[02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGEWoPmvPJY&t=125s)** — And by the way, we consume a tremendous amount of this refined corn starch every single day in a lot of our foods.
- **[02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGEWoPmvPJY&t=134s)** — Let's just go back to this food pyramid for a second.
- **[02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGEWoPmvPJY&t=136s)** — You see the bottom foundation of the food pyramid should be mostly starches.
- **[02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGEWoPmvPJY&t=140s)** — 65% of our calories should be in the form of starches.
- **[02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGEWoPmvPJY&t=144s)** — These are actually hidden sugars.
- **[02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGEWoPmvPJY&t=146s)** — Ultra-processed starch is worse than sugar.
- **[02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGEWoPmvPJY&t=149s)** — These ultra-processed starches will jack up your blood sugar way more than just glucose.
- **[02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGEWoPmvPJY&t=156s)** — When you look at this food pyramid, what you're looking at is you're looking at a lot of refined carbohydrates we are recommended to eat.
- **[02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGEWoPmvPJY&t=164s)** — And the only reason that that's recommended is because the lobbyist groups are very very powerful.
- **[02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGEWoPmvPJY&t=170s)** — The food companies are extremely powerful.
- **[02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGEWoPmvPJY&t=172s)** — Only four companies control the entire grain market and they have a tremendous amount of money.
- **[02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGEWoPmvPJY&t=178s)** — Unfortunately, the scientists who actually create the food guidelines are just unfortunately very corrupt because it was found that over 90% of them had some type of vested interest or funding from Big Food.
- **[03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGEWoPmvPJY&t=192s)** — What's really unique about these starches is that they're incredibly profitable.
- **[03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGEWoPmvPJY&t=197s)** — You can buy one cubic ton of corn for $198.
- **[03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGEWoPmvPJY&t=203s)** — Don't worry, it gets more interesting because right here I have frozen corn.
- **[03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGEWoPmvPJY&t=207s)** — This is not the type of corn that is in all these other products.
- **[03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGEWoPmvPJY&t=212s)** — There are two types of corn.
- **[03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGEWoPmvPJY&t=213s)** — You have field corn or another name for that is dent corn.
- **[03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGEWoPmvPJY&t=217s)** — And then you have edible sweet corn, right?
- **[03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGEWoPmvPJY&t=221s)** — The type of stuff that you have a corn on the cob or you'd buy is frozen corn.
- **[03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGEWoPmvPJY&t=225s)** — And so this dent corn or field corn is not even edible.
- **[03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGEWoPmvPJY&t=230s)** — But this we use as the feed to fatten cattle to create a marbling effect of their muscles.
- **[03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGEWoPmvPJY&t=236s)** — And they make so many different things out of corn.
- **[03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGEWoPmvPJY&t=238s)** — They make ethanol.
- **[04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGEWoPmvPJY&t=240s)** — They turn the starch into corn flour and they can make modified food starch, modified corn starch, maltodextrin.
- **[04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGEWoPmvPJY&t=247s)** — In fact, there's over 50 different starches that they can make from various foods.
- **[04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGEWoPmvPJY&t=251s)** — And this is why they're a hidden sugar that you need to be aware of.
- **[04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGEWoPmvPJY&t=255s)** — Not only that, you can also make oil from corn as in corn oil,
- **[04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGEWoPmvPJY&t=260s)** — which is part of the seed oil, which actually is very, very unhealthy, even though they say it's heart healthy.
- **[04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGEWoPmvPJY&t=265s)** — An average American consumes eight gallons of seed oil every single year.
- **[04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGEWoPmvPJY&t=270s)** — Yes, we need to avoid sugar, but not many people are talking about the hidden sugar, the starches,
- **[04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGEWoPmvPJY&t=276s)** — especially the corn starches.
- **[04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGEWoPmvPJY&t=278s)** — Not only do they act like sugar, but they're also the most popular GMO food,
- **[04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGEWoPmvPJY&t=283s)** — which means they have traces of an herbicide called glyphosate.
- **[04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGEWoPmvPJY&t=287s)** — If we ask ourselves what would happen if we eat like a cow.
- **[04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGEWoPmvPJY&t=290s)** — Well, we have been eating like a cow for quite some time and you can see the results.
- **[04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGEWoPmvPJY&t=295s)** — We have obesity, fatty liver, we get heart disease, and the list goes on and on.
- **[04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGEWoPmvPJY&t=299s)** — The normal cow stomach is not meant to digest grains.
- **[05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGEWoPmvPJY&t=303s)** — It's meant to break down grass.
- **[05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGEWoPmvPJY&t=305s)** — Grass is fermented with bacteria and that fiber feeds the microbes.
- **[05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGEWoPmvPJY&t=310s)** — The problem with feeding grains to a cow is that the microbes now create this excess amount of acid
- **[05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGEWoPmvPJY&t=316s)** — and they get what's called acidosis and you get a lot of infection and that's not very healthy for a cow.
- **[05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGEWoPmvPJY&t=322s)** — This is one of the big reasons why in their food,
- **[05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGEWoPmvPJY&t=325s)** — they put a lot of antibiotics to counter this bacterial overgrowth.
- **[05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGEWoPmvPJY&t=330s)** — If we're consuming all this grain, we probably also have a similar thing.
- **[05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGEWoPmvPJY&t=334s)** — That's what happens when we consume the grains and it creates inflammation in the gut.
- **[05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGEWoPmvPJY&t=338s)** — That creates all sorts of allergies and abnormal fermentation in the wrong place.
- **[05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGEWoPmvPJY&t=343s)** — Normally, we need fermentation a little bit lower in the digestive tract, not in the small intestine.
- **[05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGEWoPmvPJY&t=347s)** — And so this is definitely not a what-if problem.
- **[05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGEWoPmvPJY&t=349s)** — This is like we have been consuming very similar foods to cattle for quite some time.
- **[05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGEWoPmvPJY&t=354s)** — And if I put some dent corn in front of you right now to see if you could actually eat it,
- **[05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGEWoPmvPJY&t=358s)** — you would absolutely not want to eat it.
- **[06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGEWoPmvPJY&t=361s)** — Unless we turn it into a powder and different things to make the texture a little bit easier to consume.
- **[06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGEWoPmvPJY&t=367s)** — An average person in America consumes 35.5 pounds of corn starch every single year.
- **[06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGEWoPmvPJY&t=375s)** — They consume 60 pounds of corn sweetener every single year.
- **[06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGEWoPmvPJY&t=380s)** — High fructose corn syrup and other sweeteners that are made from corn.
- **[06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGEWoPmvPJY&t=384s)** — And as far as corn seed oils, an average consumer consumes 11.5 pounds of this seed oil every single year.
- **[06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGEWoPmvPJY&t=392s)** — If we wanted to add the soy oil into that mixture, you can add another 28 pounds.
- **[06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGEWoPmvPJY&t=397s)** — So what should we do?
- **[06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGEWoPmvPJY&t=399s)** — Number one, we should not support these intensive farming practices.
- **[06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGEWoPmvPJY&t=403s)** — I would highly recommend not buying food from cows that are in feedlots.
- **[06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGEWoPmvPJY&t=408s)** — Instead, start buying grass-fed grass-finished beef.
- **[06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGEWoPmvPJY&t=411s)** — If you and I start buying grass-fed grass-finished animal products,
- **[06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGEWoPmvPJY&t=414s)** — these very large industrial farms are going to have to allow cows to live on more space to consume grass,
- **[07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGEWoPmvPJY&t=421s)** — what they were designed to consume.
- **[07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGEWoPmvPJY&t=422s)** — But people will not do that unless they have the awareness of what's going on.
- **[07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGEWoPmvPJY&t=426s)** — And at the core of what we feed our animals is dent corn and soy.
- **[07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGEWoPmvPJY&t=430s)** — The more that you avoid these foods, you can help make a difference
- **[07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGEWoPmvPJY&t=434s)** — and shift the market from the conventional grain-fed cattle.
- **[07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGEWoPmvPJY&t=438s)** — On that note, let's talk about the healthiest food that you possibly can eat.
- **[07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGEWoPmvPJY&t=443s)** — And I put that information in this video right here. Check it out.

- **[00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwxOavvgqA0&t=0s)** — Let's say, for example, you went two weeks with less than five hours of sleep each night.
- **[00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwxOavvgqA0&t=6s)** — What would actually happen? Now, some of you watching do get five hours of sleep or maybe six hours of sleep,
- **[00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwxOavvgqA0&t=11s)** — but you don't get seven or eight hours of sleep.
- **[00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwxOavvgqA0&t=14s)** — So some of these symptoms I'm going to talk about can affect you, but more on a moderate or mild basis.
- **[00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwxOavvgqA0&t=21s)** — But what you need to know is there's a huge, huge consequence of not getting enough rest.
- **[00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwxOavvgqA0&t=27s)** — I remember as a kid, I slept so good, I would get nine hours of sleep.
- **[00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwxOavvgqA0&t=32s)** — And then I got a little bit older and went through basic training, and I was really awakened at four o'clock in the morning.
- **[00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwxOavvgqA0&t=38s)** — Well, ever since then, I tend to get up at four o'clock, and that's why I go to bed a little bit earlier to try to get that seven hours.
- **[00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwxOavvgqA0&t=46s)** — So I've had a really long history of poor sleep to the extreme, whereas some nights I don't even sleep one minute.
- **[00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwxOavvgqA0&t=54s)** — I laid there the entire night. Torture.
- **[00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwxOavvgqA0&t=58s)** — So ideally getting seven to eight hours of sleep is super healthy.
- **[01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwxOavvgqA0&t=62s)** — I looked at some research on this.
- **[01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwxOavvgqA0&t=63s)** — 35 years ago, the average U.S. adult slept 7.7 hours, which nowadays it's significantly less.
- **[01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwxOavvgqA0&t=72s)** — I mean, even if we compare 20 years ago to now, there's way more people getting less than six hours of sleep than just 20 years ago.
- **[01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwxOavvgqA0&t=80s)** — As a nation or even the world, we're just getting less and less sleep.
- **[01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwxOavvgqA0&t=84s)** — So let's go through all the consequences of not getting enough sleep, especially if you're not getting at least five hours of sleep.
- **[01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwxOavvgqA0&t=90s)** — OK, first of all, why do we need rest in the first place? Right.
- **[01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwxOavvgqA0&t=93s)** — Well, that's when a lot of things recover. That's when our muscles recover.
- **[01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwxOavvgqA0&t=97s)** — That's when we burn the most fat. That is when our bodies do the most detoxification.
- **[01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwxOavvgqA0&t=103s)** — That's when our brains detox.
- **[01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwxOavvgqA0&t=106s)** — And so this is why when you don't get enough sleep, you're going to feel kind of toxic, especially in your head.
- **[01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwxOavvgqA0&t=112s)** — So the first problem you're going to run into if you're not getting enough sleep is fatigue or what they call daytime sleepiness.
- **[01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwxOavvgqA0&t=118s)** — And there's nothing worse than driving when you're tired, right?
- **[02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwxOavvgqA0&t=121s)** — Especially long road trips and you're just like dozing off at the road.
- **[02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwxOavvgqA0&t=124s)** — That could be very, very dangerous.
- **[02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwxOavvgqA0&t=126s)** — There are significant mood changes when you don't get enough sleep, way more than other types of cognitive problems like memory, attention and loss of focus.
- **[02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwxOavvgqA0&t=136s)** — Your mood will probably be one of the biggest things that will change.
- **[02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwxOavvgqA0&t=139s)** — You're no longer going to be happy and upbeat. You're going to be a bit depressed, agitated, and irritated.
- **[02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwxOavvgqA0&t=145s)** — Now, thinking about that, could you imagine how many people are put on psych drugs when really they just need a good night's rest?
- **[02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwxOavvgqA0&t=155s)** — The next thing I want to mention is the cognitive function, mainly memory, focus and concentration.
- **[02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwxOavvgqA0&t=162s)** — So if you are a student, right, trying to study or you're someone that has to focus on some type of creativity.
- **[02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwxOavvgqA0&t=169s)** — Let's say you're a writer or you have to come up with content or you're a content creator like myself.
- **[02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwxOavvgqA0&t=175s)** — Boy, being tired just shuts that right down.
- **[02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwxOavvgqA0&t=177s)** — And so this is why I like the brain booster industry.
- **[03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwxOavvgqA0&t=180s)** — All these different pills that people take, you know, caffeine to try to stimulate their mental capacities to help them focus, not to mention drugs as well.
- **[03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwxOavvgqA0&t=189s)** — Unfortunately, that's treating the symptom and not the cause. And that's why the person always gets worse.
- **[03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwxOavvgqA0&t=194s)** — Very interesting study, which I'll put down below, involving 3000 students who all got poor sleep.
- **[03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwxOavvgqA0&t=200s)** — Well, actually less than six hours. There were mood changes. There were behavior changes.
- **[03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwxOavvgqA0&t=205s)** — There was an increased desire for alcohol. There were self-esteem issues. There were decreased ability to learn.
- **[03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwxOavvgqA0&t=213s)** — Even on top of that, there was an increased elevation of a suicide risk.
- **[03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwxOavvgqA0&t=217s)** — The other thing that happens when you don't get enough sleep is you have something called sympathetic hyperactivity.
- **[03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwxOavvgqA0&t=224s)** — There's a part of the nervous system called the sympathetic nervous system.
- **[03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwxOavvgqA0&t=228s)** — And that system is in overdrive when you're not sleeping. So you're going to have more adrenaline.
- **[03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwxOavvgqA0&t=235s)** — You're going to have more cortisol because your adrenals are revved up.
- **[03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwxOavvgqA0&t=239s)** — And so, yes, it is true that having an overactive sympathetic nervous system or a stressed out or overactive adrenal can keep you up.
- **[04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwxOavvgqA0&t=247s)** — But also, not getting enough sleep can then cause the adrenals and the stress and the sympathetics to kick in.
- **[04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwxOavvgqA0&t=254s)** — The sympathetic nervous system is kind of like the accelerator of the nervous system.
- **[04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwxOavvgqA0&t=258s)** — And you're not going to be able to sleep if it's accelerated.
- **[04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwxOavvgqA0&t=261s)** — And so it's the other system that kind of puts the brakes on this fight or flight mechanism.
- **[04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwxOavvgqA0&t=267s)** — That's called the parasympathetic. Both of these systems can be measured.
- **[04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwxOavvgqA0&t=270s)** — And I may or may not have information on this when you're looking down below, searching for it in the description, but I will very soon.
- **[04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwxOavvgqA0&t=280s)** — There's a great tool that you can actually visualize this part of the nervous system and see where you're at.
- **[04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwxOavvgqA0&t=285s)** — You can look at your stress and you can also look at your ability to recover and many other aspects related to that.
- **[04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwxOavvgqA0&t=292s)** — Like, should you really be working out today or not? Maybe you should be walking.
- **[04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwxOavvgqA0&t=297s)** — Because if you're not sleeping in your sympathetic overdrive or hyperactive,
- **[05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwxOavvgqA0&t=303s)** — you should not be exercising of any type of high intensity at all.
- **[05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwxOavvgqA0&t=308s)** — You should be walking because it's going to put more strain on your heart.
- **[05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwxOavvgqA0&t=312s)** — So this sympathetic overdrive, especially if it's chronic, okay, it goes on for weeks and weeks and weeks beyond just two weeks,
- **[05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwxOavvgqA0&t=319s)** — but might go on for months or years, really put stress on your heart.
- **[05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwxOavvgqA0&t=324s)** — You're going to be at risk for cardiovascular problems, at risk for a stroke, at risk for being a diabetic.
- **[05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwxOavvgqA0&t=332s)** — Why? Because cortisol and adrenaline releases sugar, which then increases insulin.
- **[05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwxOavvgqA0&t=341s)** — Despite not eating any sugar, your sugar levels will be higher because even the name of the adrenal hormones,
- **[05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwxOavvgqA0&t=348s)** — another name for cortisol is glucocorticoids because it regulates glucose.
- **[05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwxOavvgqA0&t=353s)** — So this is why you have impairments with your glucose and problems with your blood sugars and insulin,
- **[06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwxOavvgqA0&t=360s)** — which then relate to weight gain and a fatty liver.
- **[06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwxOavvgqA0&t=363s)** — The other very unique thing that happens with that cortisol being elevated is your immune system shuts down.
- **[06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwxOavvgqA0&t=372s)** — It becomes paralyzed. When you have higher levels of cortisol, you have this lessening of the white blood cells.
- **[06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwxOavvgqA0&t=378s)** — They don't work. And this is why all of these conditions that involve autoimmune problems,
- **[06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwxOavvgqA0&t=385s)** — where you have these antibodies attacking your own tissues, or even people with certain skin problems,
- **[06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwxOavvgqA0&t=393s)** — allergies or inflammatory conditions because it's an overactive immune system, the general treatment is steroids.
- **[06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwxOavvgqA0&t=400s)** — What's a steroid? Cortisol. Because cortisol is anti-inflammatory, but it's also an immune suppressant.
- **[06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwxOavvgqA0&t=407s)** — If you can't sleep, right? You're getting less than five hours and you have this sympathetic overdrive
- **[06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwxOavvgqA0&t=412s)** — and you're trying to lose weight. Good luck. It's not going to happen. In fact, you can work with someone on their diet.
- **[06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwxOavvgqA0&t=418s)** — But boy, if the sleep is not right, and they're also exercising at the same time, you're just wasting your time.
- **[07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwxOavvgqA0&t=424s)** — Getting someone into a wonderful rejuvenating sleep, that can create huge changes in weight loss.
- **[07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwxOavvgqA0&t=430s)** — The next thing, getting less than five hours of sleep will impair your recovery.
- **[07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwxOavvgqA0&t=435s)** — I'm talking about recovery from an injury, recovery from stress, and recovery from exercise.
- **[07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwxOavvgqA0&t=444s)** — So most of the recovery, if not all the recovery from exercise, occurs when you are sleeping,
- **[07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwxOavvgqA0&t=451s)** — if you are sleeping. And so if you're exercising and not sleeping, you're not going to see the
- **[07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwxOavvgqA0&t=457s)** — benefit of the exercise. You break down the body and you keep breaking it down, but you never
- **[07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwxOavvgqA0&t=461s)** — recover. And you exercise over that, you'll have a lot of issues. So the rule of thumb is
- **[07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwxOavvgqA0&t=465s)** — don't ever do high intensity exercise when you haven't slept and when you have poor recovery.
- **[07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwxOavvgqA0&t=472s)** — You're not going to adapt and benefit from that exercise. But you can do walking. All right,
- **[07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwxOavvgqA0&t=477s)** — the next thing I want to talk about is sleep apnea, because this also falls in this same area
- **[08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwxOavvgqA0&t=483s)** — where the person is just not getting enough oxygen when they're sleeping. And that's why
- **[08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwxOavvgqA0&t=487s)** — they have to use a CPAP machine to blow oxygen or sometimes just air into their upper respiratory
- **[08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwxOavvgqA0&t=495s)** — and in their lungs. And this also includes a lot of people who have heavy snoring. And that
- **[08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwxOavvgqA0&t=500s)** — creates something called hypoxia. Okay, that's just a lack of oxygen. And anytime you have a
- **[08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwxOavvgqA0&t=505s)** — lack of oxygen, you also might have an extra increase of CO2. So not enough oxygen is bad.
- **[08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwxOavvgqA0&t=512s)** — Too much CO2 is bad. It can be toxic. So you need the balance of both. You don't want
- **[08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwxOavvgqA0&t=517s)** — oxygen either. You want some CO2 to allow that oxygen to penetrate deep into the cells. But you
- **[08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwxOavvgqA0&t=523s)** — need the right balance. But when you have like sleep apnea and you're obstructing air going
- **[08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwxOavvgqA0&t=529s)** — into your body, especially when you're sleeping, it can create even more severe
- **[08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwxOavvgqA0&t=534s)** — problems with your body. Like brain atrophy. The frontal cortex actually atrophies and shrinks
- **[09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwxOavvgqA0&t=541s)** — in people with bad sleep apnea because you're depriving the brain of oxygen when you're
- **[09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwxOavvgqA0&t=546s)** — sleeping. You also can develop an increased risk of cancer and cardiovascular incidents,
- **[09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwxOavvgqA0&t=553s)** — and as well as strokes and diabetes. So there are many things you can do for sleep apnea.
- **[09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwxOavvgqA0&t=558s)** — I have those in a lot of different videos, which I will put down below. Just for people
- **[09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwxOavvgqA0&t=562s)** — who don't get enough sleep, the most effective treatment for that right off the bat is taking a
- **[09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwxOavvgqA0&t=568s)** — nap. Okay, just taking a nap or just trying to lay there until you hopefully fall asleep to
- **[09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwxOavvgqA0&t=574s)** — some more sleep. A couple more tips on this topic. You want to keep your room on the cool side
- **[09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwxOavvgqA0&t=580s)** — between 60 and 65 degrees, maybe up to 68 degrees, but keep it cool. If you can keep your
- **[09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwxOavvgqA0&t=587s)** — window open, you'll sleep a little bit better. But having a room that's real stuffy and hot is
- **[09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwxOavvgqA0&t=591s)** — not a good thing. If your humidity in the room is like 50%, you'll find that that will
- **[09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwxOavvgqA0&t=597s)** — be the optimum humidity for the best sleep. Another really important thing is to turn off
- **[10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwxOavvgqA0&t=602s)** — the electronics in your room, especially next to your head when you're sleeping. Why? Because
- **[10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwxOavvgqA0&t=609s)** — this EMF wave stands for electromagnetic fields. Okay. And magnetic fields really affect the brain
- **[10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwxOavvgqA0&t=619s)** — waves in the heart, and that can affect your quality of sleep big time. It did for me. In
- **[10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwxOavvgqA0&t=625s)** — fact, I found the wires in the wall and back of my bed were crossed, and that was creating
- **[10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwxOavvgqA0&t=630s)** — an electromagnetic field that extended eight feet from the wall. So I was being bathed in this
- **[10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwxOavvgqA0&t=637s)** — magnet energy that just was not good for my heart. I started getting heart palpitations,
- **[10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwxOavvgqA0&t=642s)** — and I eventually figured out what it was. And when I had the electrician fix it,
- **[10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwxOavvgqA0&t=646s)** — all of those symptoms just magically disappeared. Another really important thing is the quantity
- **[10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwxOavvgqA0&t=651s)** — of food that you eat, especially in the evening. Okay. If you do too much, you're
- **[10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwxOavvgqA0&t=657s)** — well, because when you're bloated, that affects your sleeping up here. So you don't want to
- **[11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwxOavvgqA0&t=664s)** — overeat, and then you also don't want to under eat. Some people that don't consume enough
- **[11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwxOavvgqA0&t=670s)** — protein or the right amount, they can also have a hard time getting to sleep, staying
- **[11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwxOavvgqA0&t=675s)** — asleep, or waking up and feeling refreshed. So I think the key is to play around with the
- **[11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwxOavvgqA0&t=682s)** — amount of protein that you need. And I would guess that would be anywhere between like three
- **[11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwxOavvgqA0&t=686s)** — and a half to seven ounces of protein for that dinner, depending on a lot of different
- **[11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwxOavvgqA0&t=692s)** — variables. You know, your size, your age, your activity level, your ability to digest that
- **[11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwxOavvgqA0&t=698s)** — protein. And it's best not to eat too late. It's best to eat earlier. Okay. You're going
- **[11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwxOavvgqA0&t=703s)** — to find you're going to sleep better if you can not have a lot of stuff going on with the
- **[11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwxOavvgqA0&t=709s)** — digestive system. And the other thing is as it starts to get darker, and let's say six,
- **[11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwxOavvgqA0&t=714s)** — seven o'clock, start dimming the lights wherever you are at. Try not to sit in front of a computer
- **[12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwxOavvgqA0&t=720s)** — screen because that blue light, especially the artificial lights, can interfere with
- **[12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwxOavvgqA0&t=726s)** — the whole mechanism of the light going into the retina, which then goes to a whole cascade
- **[12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwxOavvgqA0&t=733s)** — of things that increases your melatonin. Darkness triggers melatonin. Light decreases
- **[12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwxOavvgqA0&t=739s)** — melatonin. Melatonin helps you sleep. So it's best that you tone down the light in the evening.
- **[12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwxOavvgqA0&t=745s)** — Now because of the censoring and the suppressing of the algorithms on YouTube,
- **[12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwxOavvgqA0&t=750s)** — it's becoming more difficult to find my content. And there's a lot of content that I cannot
- **[12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwxOavvgqA0&t=755s)** — put on YouTube, unfortunately. So to make sure you have full access of all my information,
