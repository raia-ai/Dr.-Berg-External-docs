- **[00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NdQfUJRY6SQ&t=0s)** — There are four very common ingredients that shorten your life and kill you prematurely.
- **[00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NdQfUJRY6SQ&t=5s)** — When I was in practice for 30 years, I really tried to get people to change their ways.
- **[00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NdQfUJRY6SQ&t=10s)** — I tried to get them to eat healthier. But eating healthy is expensive.
- **[00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NdQfUJRY6SQ&t=13s)** — And I would talk to people until they're blue in the face and not get anywhere.
- **[00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NdQfUJRY6SQ&t=17s)** — And I stumbled on this when I was going to people's homes. And then we would go to the
- **[00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NdQfUJRY6SQ&t=21s)** — grocery store and we would, you know, teach them what to eat. And I personally had an
- **[00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NdQfUJRY6SQ&t=27s)** — An average person does not recognize the four ingredients in 99.999% of all junk foods.
- **[00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NdQfUJRY6SQ&t=40s)** — The whole label on foods is just completely confusing. And no one can make any sense
- **[00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NdQfUJRY6SQ&t=45s)** — out of it. You're never going to understand what the food is unless you understand
- **[00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NdQfUJRY6SQ&t=49s)** — the ingredients in the food. It would be very similar to looking at a label in a different
- **[00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NdQfUJRY6SQ&t=53s)** — I mean, it just does not communicate because every single word in there is just foreign to you.
- **[01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NdQfUJRY6SQ&t=60s)** — Now, I just want to read off some of these ingredients.
- **[01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NdQfUJRY6SQ&t=65s)** — Hydroxypropyl Distarch phosphate, Intra-sterified soybean oil, Hydrolyzed corn oil,
- **[01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NdQfUJRY6SQ&t=72s)** — Maltodextrin, Dextrose, Dextrin. So just ignore those words right now because
- **[01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NdQfUJRY6SQ&t=77s)** — you literally fall asleep if I keep talking about it. I mean, can you imagine if I
- **[01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NdQfUJRY6SQ&t=85s)** — were to describe these words? I'm just going to literally make you unconscious.
- **[01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NdQfUJRY6SQ&t=90s)** — These words are chemical names for junk food ingredients and I really think they're
- **[01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NdQfUJRY6SQ&t=94s)** — purposely put in there just to hide what's really in there. So the junk food industry
- **[01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NdQfUJRY6SQ&t=100s)** — is camouflaging their ingredients. Number one. Number two, these companies have normalized
- **[01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NdQfUJRY6SQ&t=107s)** — junk foods as part of a regular diet. And number three, these companies spend millions of dollars
- **[01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NdQfUJRY6SQ&t=116s)** — to downplay the bad effects of their ingredients. To neutralize these ingredients.
- **[02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NdQfUJRY6SQ&t=123s)** — There is no bad food group, right? I mean, that is completely created by big food. You know,
- **[02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NdQfUJRY6SQ&t=128s)** — as long as you're eating a balanced diet, you'll be fine. What they have done very
- **[02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NdQfUJRY6SQ&t=132s)** — successfully is made their ingredients the same level as other ingredients. Like a calorie
- **[02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NdQfUJRY6SQ&t=141s)** — from the fructose and higher fructose corn syrup is the same calories as fructose and fruit.
- **[02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NdQfUJRY6SQ&t=146s)** — They're identical. This is absolutely, positively, a thousand percent not true.
- **[02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NdQfUJRY6SQ&t=151s)** — Well, I'll tell you right now, there's a huge difference between the starch and vegetables
- **[02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NdQfUJRY6SQ&t=154s)** — and the synthetic starch they get from corn. There's also a big difference between
- **[02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NdQfUJRY6SQ&t=160s)** — cane sugar and then synthetic sugar like glucose syrup. Now, the other thing you need to know is
- **[02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NdQfUJRY6SQ&t=165s)** — that you cannot determine the quality of the food by looking at this part of the label right
- **[02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NdQfUJRY6SQ&t=171s)** — here called the nutritional facts. You have to read this part right here, which is really
- **[02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NdQfUJRY6SQ&t=177s)** — hard to read unless you have magnifying glasses. I can't even read this right here.
- **[03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NdQfUJRY6SQ&t=182s)** — I wonder if that's on purpose or not. So there's a super simple way to identify these
- **[03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NdQfUJRY6SQ&t=189s)** — ingredients that are in 99.99 percent of all junk food. The first one is sugar. And I'm not
- **[03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NdQfUJRY6SQ&t=196s)** — even talking about sugar cane. I'm talking about the synthetic sugars. And there's a lot of
- **[03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NdQfUJRY6SQ&t=200s)** — different chemical names for sugar. Okay. Then you have starches. What's a starch?
- **[03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NdQfUJRY6SQ&t=205s)** — Starch is a sugar. Okay. And I'm not talking about the starches and vegetables. I'm talking
- **[03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NdQfUJRY6SQ&t=209s)** — about the synthetically made, highly processed starches. Then we have seed oils. Very, very
- **[03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NdQfUJRY6SQ&t=214s)** — highly processed. And then the before, we have highly processed, refined proteins.
- **[03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NdQfUJRY6SQ&t=222s)** — Soy protein isolates. And you have casein in different forms. That's like milk protein. And
- **[03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NdQfUJRY6SQ&t=228s)** — by the way, there's a significant amount of casein coming from China. It's not really
- **[03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NdQfUJRY6SQ&t=233s)** — regulated. You have no idea how these cows are treated before they get the milk from them.
- **[04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NdQfUJRY6SQ&t=240s)** — And so many people have allergies to casein. And you have also a type of protein that
- **[04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NdQfUJRY6SQ&t=246s)** — creates more inflammation called A1 beta casein. You don't want that in your body. You want the
- **[04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NdQfUJRY6SQ&t=251s)** — A2. And I'll guarantee all the casein protein that they use in junk foods is A1. So a lot
- **[04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NdQfUJRY6SQ&t=258s)** — of people get bloating when they have this concentrated casein protein. Not to mention
- **[04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NdQfUJRY6SQ&t=262s)** — the soy protein isolates have heavy amounts of hexane, which is a solvent. It's in gasoline.
- **[04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NdQfUJRY6SQ&t=269s)** — And there's really no regulation or monitoring how much of that hexane is in that product.
- **[04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NdQfUJRY6SQ&t=276s)** — And then you also have wheat gluten. I created a little card cut out. You download it, you cut
- **[04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NdQfUJRY6SQ&t=282s)** — it out and you put it in your wallet. And then you match it up with this card. And that way,
- **[04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NdQfUJRY6SQ&t=286s)** — I list all the different chemical names. And that way you don't have to memorize any of
- **[04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NdQfUJRY6SQ&t=291s)** — the names. So out of all the things that you can change to make your health better,
- **[04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NdQfUJRY6SQ&t=296s)** — this is the most important. So click the link down below to download the
- **[05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NdQfUJRY6SQ&t=300s)** — little card so you can cut it out and put it in your wallet immediately.

- **[00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QftLonhnuk&t=0s)** — You want to drink one cup of turmeric water every single night or morning for amazing benefits.
- **[00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QftLonhnuk&t=7s)** — The active compound in turmeric is called curcumin. And there's some serious research
- **[00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QftLonhnuk&t=13s)** — on this one compound that you need to know about. But before you follow any of the advice
- **[00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QftLonhnuk&t=17s)** — I'm going to share with you, obviously check with your doctor to get, you know, an okay.
- **[00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QftLonhnuk&t=22s)** — Especially if you're on medications because you can't always come off certain medications,
- **[00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QftLonhnuk&t=25s)** — you know, cold turkey. The first thing I want to talk about is NSAIDs. Like ibuprofen
- **[00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QftLonhnuk&t=29s)** — and aspirin. In one study, curcumin was just as effective as ibuprofen in reducing pain from
- **[00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QftLonhnuk&t=38s)** — arthritis. But without the side effects, curcumin also showed some similar benefits to aspirin,
- **[00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QftLonhnuk&t=44s)** — which is quite amazing because the problem with aspirin is it can burn a hole in your stomach.
- **[00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QftLonhnuk&t=48s)** — Let's get to number two. Cortical steroids like prednisone. I used to take this for
- **[00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QftLonhnuk&t=54s)** — every single year until it eventually stopped working. Curcumin in one study showed comparable
- **[01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QftLonhnuk&t=60s)** — results to prednisone in reducing inflammation for rheumatoid arthritis, asthma, and irritable
- **[01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QftLonhnuk&t=67s)** — bowel disease. Number three, curcumin showed anti-depressant effects similar to Prozac and
- **[01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QftLonhnuk&t=74s)** — Zoloft in reducing symptoms of depression. Apparently the theory is that it increases
- **[01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QftLonhnuk&t=79s)** — serotonin and dopamine very similar to the SSRIs. Number four, curcumin has anti-diabetic
- **[01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QftLonhnuk&t=86s)** — properties. Some studies show that curcumin can have similar effects to metformin in supporting
- **[01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QftLonhnuk&t=93s)** — blood sugar control in type 2 diabetes. As you may or may not know, there's a black warning
- **[01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QftLonhnuk&t=98s)** — label on metformin because one of the dangerous side effects is called lactic acidosis. So
- **[01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QftLonhnuk&t=109s)** — we get to number five, anticoagulants. These are the things that thin the blood. The anticoagulation
- **[01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QftLonhnuk&t=114s)** — or anti-clotting factors in curcumin are similar to warfarin and aspirin. This could be used as
- **[02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QftLonhnuk&t=121s)** — a substitute, especially if for some reason they can't take certain medications. Number six,
- **[02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QftLonhnuk&t=126s)** — statins. In certain studies, which I'll list down below in the description,
- **[02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QftLonhnuk&t=130s)** — curcumin showed a decrease in LDL cholesterol and triglycerides, as well as creating a
- **[02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QftLonhnuk&t=138s)** — endothelial layer of the inside of the artery, which is given more of a protective effect.
- **[02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QftLonhnuk&t=143s)** — Because the way that statins work is they just basically block cholesterol. Curcumin instead
- **[02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QftLonhnuk&t=147s)** — works a different way. It basically helps you optimize your lipids. Number seven, chemotherapy.
- **[02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QftLonhnuk&t=153s)** — So there's a drug called 5-flouryuracil, and this is a chemotherapy drug. There was a
- **[02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QftLonhnuk&t=158s)** — study comparing curcumin to this drug. So apparently curcumin has some effects of slowing
- **[02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QftLonhnuk&t=164s)** — down or inhibiting the growth of certain cancer cells, while at the same time protecting the
- **[02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QftLonhnuk&t=169s)** — normal cells. Number eight, anti-inflammatory drugs, especially for irritable bowel disease.
- **[02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QftLonhnuk&t=176s)** — Curcumin was shown to decrease the side effects from both Crohn's and ulcerative
- **[03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QftLonhnuk&t=181s)** — colitis in a comparable fashion to a drug called mesalamine. Number nine,
- **[03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QftLonhnuk&t=188s)** — hypertensive drugs. Curcumin has pretty potent effects on the endothelial layer on the
- **[03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QftLonhnuk&t=193s)** — side of the artery, creating a significant decrease in stiffness in the artery, as well
- **[03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QftLonhnuk&t=198s)** — as lowering the blood pressure. And number ten, curcumin has a pretty potent antifungal effect.
- **[03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QftLonhnuk&t=202s)** — Collectively, that's an antimicrobial effect. It can inhibit certain pathogens, especially
- **[03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QftLonhnuk&t=208s)** — fungi. While the effect of curcumin is not an actual substitute, it can actually potentially
- **[03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QftLonhnuk&t=214s)** — help or enhance the effects of other drugs with lessening the side effects, especially when
- **[03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QftLonhnuk&t=219s)** — you get into someone taking antifungals or antibiotics that then create resistance.
- **[03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QftLonhnuk&t=225s)** — Now these microbes become superbugs and they're almost impossible to destroy. Now the question
- **[03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QftLonhnuk&t=230s)** — is when would you want to take your curcumin? In the morning or at night or before a meal?
- **[03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QftLonhnuk&t=236s)** — Well, it depends what kind of problems you have. If you have more arthritis, I would
- **[04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QftLonhnuk&t=240s)** — recommend taking this drink in the morning. If you have more digestive problems, I recommend
- **[04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QftLonhnuk&t=247s)** — this right before you eat. If you have more problems with other issues like anxiety or
- **[04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QftLonhnuk&t=253s)** — sleep-related, then take it right before you go to bed. So if you want to increase the
- **[04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QftLonhnuk&t=257s)** — bioavailability, take it with some fat or with a meal or you can take it with black pepper.
- **[04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QftLonhnuk&t=263s)** — And this is because curcumin has poor bioavailability. When you take turmeric,
- **[04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QftLonhnuk&t=268s)** — you only get very very tiny amounts of this curcumin. Because if you take a look at nature
- **[04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QftLonhnuk&t=273s)** — what curcumin really is, it is a pesticide and it also has other properties to protect the plant
- **[04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QftLonhnuk&t=279s)** — from UV radiation. So when we take it ourselves, we could piggyback on all of the different
- **[04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QftLonhnuk&t=285s)** — effects. And the effectiveness is going to start on your digestive track, okay? And then
- **[04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QftLonhnuk&t=290s)** — you're going to absorb some of it. The microbes even consume some of it and then they
- **[04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QftLonhnuk&t=296s)** — create additional compounds that help you in many different ways. One being reducing inflammation.
- **[05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QftLonhnuk&t=302s)** — This is why it's so good for inflammation in your gut. Another thing it'll do, it'll increase
- **[05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QftLonhnuk&t=308s)** — several strains of the beneficial bacteria while also inhibiting some of the pathogenic
- **[05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QftLonhnuk&t=315s)** — bacteria, which is pretty wild. Some of the mistakes that people make, taking way too much.
- **[05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QftLonhnuk&t=319s)** — Or they might take it but without the black pepper. Black pepper helps absorption by 2000%.
- **[05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QftLonhnuk&t=325s)** — What you want to do is you want to take a glass of water, warm water, okay? And you
- **[05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QftLonhnuk&t=332s)** — want to take your black pepper, take a little pinch of it, put that in the water,
- **[05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QftLonhnuk&t=337s)** — mix it into it with a half of a lemon. You just drink it down. It's slightly warm. It's not
- **[05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QftLonhnuk&t=342s)** — boiled. And then experience the benefits. Another way to take it is through making this,
- **[05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QftLonhnuk&t=347s)** — what's called golden milk. So you're going to mix a half of a teaspoon of
- **[05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QftLonhnuk&t=351s)** — turmeric in either milk or coconut milk. I would recommend coconut milk. That seems to be
- **[05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QftLonhnuk&t=357s)** — pretty delicious. Then you're going to add a fourth of a teaspoon of cinnamon,
- **[06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QftLonhnuk&t=362s)** — a little pinch of pepper, and you're going to heat this up, not to a boil,
- **[06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QftLonhnuk&t=366s)** — but just before a boil. And you're going to sip it. It makes a wonderful drink.
- **[06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QftLonhnuk&t=369s)** — And this is the one that I probably would recommend before bed. Now another way you can
- **[06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QftLonhnuk&t=373s)** — take this is with a smoothie. A half of a teaspoon of turmeric with a cup of kefir. I'd
- **[06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QftLonhnuk&t=380s)** — recommend like sheep kefir if you can find it or even goat's milk kefir, grass fed. And
- **[06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QftLonhnuk&t=385s)** — you take a half of a cup of blueberries. You put it in a blender and you blend it. And you have a
- **[06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QftLonhnuk&t=392s)** — wonderful drink. Now another way you can take turmeric, and this is mainly if you have a
- **[06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QftLonhnuk&t=396s)** — sore throat or you have this cough that you just can't get rid of. It's for the immune
- **[06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QftLonhnuk&t=400s)** — system. You take a half of a cup of hot water, okay, because you want to have it hot,
- **[06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QftLonhnuk&t=406s)** — but not to the point where you boil the water. But it just makes it really hot. And
- **[06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QftLonhnuk&t=410s)** — this one you're going to add a level teaspoon of turmeric and then a tablespoon of raw
- **[06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QftLonhnuk&t=416s)** — honey. And you're going to kind of dissolve as much as you can in this hot water. And then
- **[07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QftLonhnuk&t=420s)** — you're going to slug that down once or twice a day. Your throat is going to feel wonderful.
- **[07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QftLonhnuk&t=425s)** — And again, if you have more arthritis inflammation, take it in the morning. So that
- **[07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QftLonhnuk&t=429s)** — way all day you have less inflammation. Or if you have other problems, definitely sleep or
- **[07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QftLonhnuk&t=434s)** — stress, other issues that are not related to inflammation, you can take that before you go
- **[07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QftLonhnuk&t=438s)** — to bed. But also remember if you have digestive issues, take it right before you eat. It will
- **[07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QftLonhnuk&t=444s)** — help prevent bloating as well. Now if you haven't seen my other video on turmeric,
- **[07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QftLonhnuk&t=448s)** — you should check it out. I put it up right here.

- **[00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_zHW-dDl3tM&t=0s)** — Today I'm going to share with you how these are related and the two most powerful things you can eat to prevent a lot of problems with both the liver and the inside of your arteries.
- **[00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_zHW-dDl3tM&t=11s)** — Now take a look at this. We have some type of stressor, whether it's smoking, alcohol, drugs, toxins, viruses, bacteria, junk food, sugar, seed oils, fine carbohydrates.
- **[00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_zHW-dDl3tM&t=21s)** — These are all triggers. These are stressors that can affect the liver or the blood vessel.
- **[00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_zHW-dDl3tM&t=26s)** — Whether you're inhaling some smoke or a toxin, it goes right into the blood supply. Now if you ingest something, it gets absorbed into the gut, it goes into the bloodstream, and the first thing that's hit is the liver.
- **[00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_zHW-dDl3tM&t=38s)** — So the liver gets exposed to a lot of the junk that's in the blood. And one of the things the liver is supposed to do is clean out the toxicity that's in the blood.
- **[00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_zHW-dDl3tM&t=48s)** — It has various enzymes to turn these poisons into harmless particles. And so both of these tissues are working together very, very hard to keep you healthy.
- **[00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_zHW-dDl3tM&t=58s)** — However, since you live on planet Earth, you're exposed to a lot of bad foods, toxicity.
- **[01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_zHW-dDl3tM&t=63s)** — Okay, this is how it works. You first have one of these triggers right here, and that's called oxidation or oxidative stress.
- **[01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_zHW-dDl3tM&t=70s)** — Not enough antioxidants, you get this damage situation, this rusting out. Okay?
- **[01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_zHW-dDl3tM&t=76s)** — And so we start with the stressor, and then the body is going to try to heal itself. And it uses the immune system to do that.
- **[01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_zHW-dDl3tM&t=84s)** — So the way that the body heals itself is through the immune system by triggering inflammation, and then you have scar tissue. That is a scab.
- **[01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_zHW-dDl3tM&t=94s)** — Okay, if this goes on too long, it develops into an advanced fibrosis called cirrhosis. The same thing happens in the artery.
- **[01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_zHW-dDl3tM&t=102s)** — We have inflammation and then fibrosis, which is scar tissue. If it continues more, you get more plucking and it can actually go deep into the artery and create more inflammation as a never ending cycle.
- **[01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_zHW-dDl3tM&t=116s)** — But you have to realize that cholesterol is not just there to plug up an artery, okay? That cholesterol, most of it, is made by your liver.
- **[02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_zHW-dDl3tM&t=125s)** — Because we need cholesterol to build all the membranes of the cells and hormones as well.
- **[02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_zHW-dDl3tM&t=130s)** — Testosterone, progesterone, estrogen, and even a hormone called cortisol, which is a stress hormone. But it also makes cell membranes.
- **[02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_zHW-dDl3tM&t=136s)** — This is a cell membrane. The inside of a cell looks like this. 25% of the cell membranes, you have cholesterol.
- **[02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_zHW-dDl3tM&t=142s)** — And we need the cholesterol to allow this membrane to really work, which lie in the nervous system, your brain.
- **[02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_zHW-dDl3tM&t=148s)** — And cholesterol is not just floating through there. It's transported with a certain shuttle. It's a protein.
- **[02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_zHW-dDl3tM&t=154s)** — But if we just step back and look at this whole process, what's really happening is our immune cells are trying to heal or create a scar or a bandaid and in the arteries.
- **[02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_zHW-dDl3tM&t=164s)** — The problem is, when the bandaid is too big, it creates a blockage and then you get a heart attack or you might get something broken off that goes into a stroke.
- **[02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_zHW-dDl3tM&t=174s)** — And also you get damage within the organ itself. So you get damage in the blood vessel. So now we don't get the right, it's called nitric oxide, to allow it to vasodilate or relax.
- **[03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_zHW-dDl3tM&t=185s)** — So now we just get constriction. That's called high blood pressure. We get abnormal lipids. So that's the cholesterol thing. And then we get a higher risk of cardiovascular disease.
- **[03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_zHW-dDl3tM&t=194s)** — With the liver, we get a diminished ability to get rid of poisons. So now we can't detoxify. The liver can't make antioxidants to protect against this anymore.
- **[03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_zHW-dDl3tM&t=206s)** — One of the ways that the body gets rid of excess cholesterol is through the bile ducts. So if you're not able to make enough bile,
- **[03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_zHW-dDl3tM&t=213s)** — then the cholesterol kind of backs up through the blood. Also you get a lack of digestion. You might get gallstones. And then we get to another common problem, which is insulin resistance.
- **[03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_zHW-dDl3tM&t=224s)** — Insulin resistance starts in your liver. And insulin resistance comes before prediabetes and then you get diabetes.
- **[03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_zHW-dDl3tM&t=232s)** — So the problem with insulin resistance is now you can't really regulate blood sugars that well anymore. And also the lining of that artery also has insulin resistance as well.
- **[04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_zHW-dDl3tM&t=242s)** — And then something else happens. Your liver starts to make sugar itself. So it's really a situation where your blood sugars are high because the liver is creating that situation. Not good.
- **[04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_zHW-dDl3tM&t=253s)** — So I just wanted to give you the foundation of these two problems right here. Now let's get into what garlic and onion can do for both of these.
- **[04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_zHW-dDl3tM&t=262s)** — Well, the two foods that can counter that and prevent that whole process are these two right here that can help decrease oxidative stress through dealing with free radical damage.
- **[04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_zHW-dDl3tM&t=273s)** — And so by consuming these antioxidants from these two foods, you're basically borrowing electrons from something else to help get rid of these free radicals.
- **[04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_zHW-dDl3tM&t=282s)** — That's the oxidation, inflammation, fibrosis, calcification. Now these two foods are very high in sulfur. Now what's so significant about sulfur?
- **[04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_zHW-dDl3tM&t=293s)** — Well, sulfur is involved in this amazing phase one, phase two detoxification enzyme system. Each enzyme has the capacity to break down and eliminate safely chemicals. That's quite magical.
- **[05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_zHW-dDl3tM&t=308s)** — So whether you're being exposed to nicotine, caffeine, a drug, this system allows you to deal with all this exposure, whether it's coming in from your lungs or coming in through the digestion.
- **[05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_zHW-dDl3tM&t=324s)** — It's going to end up in the liver and then you need this system to deal with it. The problem is if you have a bad liver and it's damaged, then this doesn't work.
- **[05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_zHW-dDl3tM&t=333s)** — But these two foods can give you these enzymes to allow this detoxification to happen. Also, sulfur is needed to get rid of inflammation.
- **[05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_zHW-dDl3tM&t=343s)** — In fact, if you look at a lot of the other remedies that you can buy at the store for inflammation, they usually have sulfur in there. I wonder why.
- **[05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_zHW-dDl3tM&t=351s)** — Also, garlic and onion are natural antimicrobial. So if you were to get sick, for example, with a virus or bacterial infection, you'd want to take garlic and onion because it's going to help you.
- **[06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_zHW-dDl3tM&t=363s)** — They're both natural antibiotics, but without the side effects. They don't harm the good bacteria. They only harm the pathogens.
- **[06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_zHW-dDl3tM&t=372s)** — There are actually different defense mechanisms and medicines to heal the plant and protect the plant. And we can piggyback off that by consuming the actual plant itself.
- **[06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_zHW-dDl3tM&t=383s)** — Now, also, if you consume both of these, you're going to find another benefit of blood thinning.
- **[06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_zHW-dDl3tM&t=387s)** — I'm not talking about making your blood abnormally thin, where you're going to have excess bleeding. But if you do happen to have this problem where you're clotting more than usual, which is not a good thing, it can bring you back to that normal.
- **[06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_zHW-dDl3tM&t=401s)** — But it's a mild version of that without the side effects. So that's really cool.
- **[06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_zHW-dDl3tM&t=405s)** — Also, the ability for both of these foods to help you make insulin more sensitive is also another benefit, since so many people have insulin resistance.
- **[06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_zHW-dDl3tM&t=415s)** — So even though when you cook an onion and it becomes sweet and there's carbohydrates, you do not have to worry about that onion messing with your blood sugars or creating any type of diabetes.
- **[07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_zHW-dDl3tM&t=427s)** — It's not going to do that because it's actually low on the glycemic index. And also it has so many different things that can protect against this insulin problem and the diabetes issue.
- **[07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_zHW-dDl3tM&t=438s)** — So by getting rid of the oxidative damage and the inflammation, you can then decrease the fibrosis that's going on. You're also going to get a nice balance of all your lipids. You're going to optimize your lipids.
- **[07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_zHW-dDl3tM&t=449s)** — Garlic has the ability to help your liver make more bile for excess cholesterol coming through there and also to prevent sludge in this area that sometimes can back up and cause pain in your right shoulder through here.
- **[07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_zHW-dDl3tM&t=462s)** — Garlic and onion has the ability to increase something called nitric oxide and decrease your blood pressure. So this is what both of these foods will do for the liver and the artery.
- **[07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_zHW-dDl3tM&t=473s)** — Now let's give you some ideas on how you can include this in your diet.
- **[07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_zHW-dDl3tM&t=477s)** — What I want to give you right now is just a creative list of all the different ways that you can consume garlic and onion.
- **[08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_zHW-dDl3tM&t=484s)** — You can actually mix it with a stir fry with vegetables and some meat, whether it's chicken or beef. You can put it in hummus. Hummus normally comes with garlic, but just add some onion in there.
- **[08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_zHW-dDl3tM&t=496s)** — Also, anytime you make soup, add the garlic and onion to the soup.
- **[08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_zHW-dDl3tM&t=499s)** — Now one point about garlic and onion, you're going to have the most potent effect if it's fresh, crushing the garlic or chopping the onions.
- **[08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_zHW-dDl3tM&t=507s)** — I like to always cook my omelets, my egg omelets, with onions and then I sprinkle garlic on top.
- **[08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_zHW-dDl3tM&t=512s)** — Now another idea that I use with making omelets is I'll put olives on the omelets. I'll put fermented garlic cloves and I will slice up and saute onions.
- **[08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_zHW-dDl3tM&t=523s)** — I'm probably making you hungry right now. I also like to put garlic and onion on my mashed cauliflower with a little sea salt and pepper. It's awesome.
- **[08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_zHW-dDl3tM&t=532s)** — You can also infuse garlic and onion in your dressings with the olive oil. If you're making beef stew, always put plenty of garlic and onions in that.
- **[09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_zHW-dDl3tM&t=541s)** — Anytime I fry a steak, I will also saute garlic and onion and put that on there.
- **[09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_zHW-dDl3tM&t=545s)** — Garlic and onion with steak will act as a natural antibacterial. You can also use rosemary, oregano, all of those will help.
- **[09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_zHW-dDl3tM&t=553s)** — When I make salsa or guacamole, I always put onion and garlic in there. And of course, if you haven't seen my pizza recipe, you could put plenty of onions and garlic on that because you're using the cauliflower crust.
- **[09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_zHW-dDl3tM&t=565s)** — It's totally amazing. And since we're on the topic of pizza, if you haven't seen this recipe and how I make this pizza, you should check it out. I put it up right here.

- **[00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZx0KMCOSs4&t=0s)** — Today I'm going to show you the magic formula for being calm under pressure or being relaxed
- **[00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZx0KMCOSs4&t=7s)** — in stressful situations. You know, sometimes we can't control our environments, but we can
- **[00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZx0KMCOSs4&t=12s)** — definitely control our attitude towards stress. And I have some very important information to
- **[00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZx0KMCOSs4&t=18s)** — share with you based on this book right here called Relax and Win. This is by an author,
- **[00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZx0KMCOSs4&t=22s)** — Bud Winters, who was a coach for 30 years and guided athletes to over 37 world records.
- **[00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZx0KMCOSs4&t=29s)** — And there's some great data I want to share with you in this book. Some things you can do to train
- **[00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZx0KMCOSs4&t=34s)** — yourself to be calm in stressful situations. Now before I start, go ahead and comment down below
- **[00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZx0KMCOSs4&t=40s)** — how you cope with stress. Is it good? Is it bad? Do you use medication, drugs, junk food,
- **[00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZx0KMCOSs4&t=47s)** — sugar, smoking, alcohol? Just make a note in the comment section. I'm just very curious.
- **[00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZx0KMCOSs4&t=54s)** — I mean, the significance of how stress affects our body is massive. Have you ever heard
- **[00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZx0KMCOSs4&t=58s)** — of stress-induced ulcers? Or what about stress-induced diabetes? How could that possibly occur?
- **[01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZx0KMCOSs4&t=65s)** — Especially if you're not eating a lot of sugar or junk foods. Well, stress activates two
- **[01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZx0KMCOSs4&t=71s)** — hormones. One is called cortisol and the other one is adrenaline. And both of those actually
- **[01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZx0KMCOSs4&t=76s)** — switch the fuel that you run on. It basically switches the body to run on glucose, even
- **[01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZx0KMCOSs4&t=82s)** — you're not consuming sugar or carbs. The body takes your protein and turns it into
- **[01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZx0KMCOSs4&t=89s)** — glucose. And that's called gluconeogenesis. And so going through chronic stress can actually
- **[01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZx0KMCOSs4&t=95s)** — cause you to have diabetes and of course lose your muscles. That's called atrophy.
- **[01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZx0KMCOSs4&t=100s)** — You can actually get fat from stress. You can even develop cancer from stress from different
- **[01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZx0KMCOSs4&t=106s)** — ways. It suppresses the white blood cells. It inhibits the immune system from working
- **[01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZx0KMCOSs4&t=111s)** — and it causes viruses to come out of remission and be active as an Epstein-Barr virus and the
- **[01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZx0KMCOSs4&t=117s)** — herpes viruses as well as developing autoimmune diseases like MS, Hashimoto's, lupus,
- **[02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZx0KMCOSs4&t=125s)** — rheumatoid arthritis. Nearly every person in practice that I've talked to that developed an
- **[02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZx0KMCOSs4&t=129s)** — autoimmune disease always had some stress event that occurred right before it. And it's
- **[02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZx0KMCOSs4&t=134s)** — usually chronic stress or some major loss. There's also a thing called stress-induced
- **[02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZx0KMCOSs4&t=140s)** — stroke or stress-induced heart attack. Stress can cause infertility, definitely insomnia,
- **[02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZx0KMCOSs4&t=147s)** — lack of oxygen throughout the body, muscle tension, and this other thing called cortisol
- **[02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZx0KMCOSs4&t=152s)** — resistance where you just get a lot more inflammation. So even now stress kicks in
- **[02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZx0KMCOSs4&t=157s)** — cortisol which is an anti-inflammatory. Over a period of time you develop this resistance to
- **[02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZx0KMCOSs4&t=163s)** — cortisol and now you're inflamed because you're lacking cortisol inside the cells. And this is
- **[02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZx0KMCOSs4&t=169s)** — where they give people prednisone. And prednisone is a synthetic type of cortisol just like they
- **[02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZx0KMCOSs4&t=174s)** — might give insulin to a diabetic type too to override this resistance to insulin or even
- **[03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZx0KMCOSs4&t=182s)** — the prednisone overrides the resistance to cortisol. And look at all the side effects
- **[03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZx0KMCOSs4&t=185s)** — that occur with prednisone. Diabetes, complete destruction of the joints. So I think
- **[03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZx0KMCOSs4&t=191s)** — it's really important to understand this stress component. You know, when you're under stress,
- **[03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZx0KMCOSs4&t=196s)** — your ability to solve problems, your ability to be creative is going to be greatly inhibited.
- **[03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZx0KMCOSs4&t=202s)** — Why? Because you're stuck in your head. Pictures and your memories of stressful events, your
- **[03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZx0KMCOSs4&t=209s)** — ability to be creative and solve problems occur when you're in more of the present,
- **[03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZx0KMCOSs4&t=213s)** — when you're calm, when you have a better state of mind, when you have more space. This is why
- **[03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZx0KMCOSs4&t=218s)** — I always recommend going for a walk. So this book is interesting because after World War II,
- **[03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZx0KMCOSs4&t=225s)** — this author took the same techniques which taught people who flew planes to relax under
- **[03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZx0KMCOSs4&t=231s)** — pressure of combat and applied them to sports. And the results were not only good, they were
- **[03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZx0KMCOSs4&t=237s)** — amazing. 37 world records. Incredible. He also talks about like Joe Lewis, the great boxer,
- **[04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZx0KMCOSs4&t=245s)** — Joe DiMaggio, a great baseball player, and noted they all had sleepy relaxed looks on their
- **[04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZx0KMCOSs4&t=252s)** — arms were kind of dangled. What's more important is they let nothing bother them, whether it was
- **[04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZx0KMCOSs4&t=260s)** — hot or cold, whether the stadium was full or empty, whether the competition proved vicious or
- **[04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZx0KMCOSs4&t=265s)** — gentle. So one of the things you have to do is you have to really train yourself to have
- **[04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZx0KMCOSs4&t=270s)** — a relaxed attitude. One of the things that the author talks about is working on relaxing
- **[04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZx0KMCOSs4&t=276s)** — the antagonistic muscle. If you're just sitting there right now, right, if you just kind of scan
- **[04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZx0KMCOSs4&t=283s)** — your body where you're holding your tension, with me, it's in the upper back, the neck,
- **[04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZx0KMCOSs4&t=289s)** — and lower back. So if you can just let those areas go and just focusing on relaxing those
- **[04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZx0KMCOSs4&t=297s)** — areas, that would be one thing you can do. He talks about also relaxing the wrinkles. You
- **[05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZx0KMCOSs4&t=306s)** — start relaxing them, relaxing your jaw muscles and your tongue. Okay, because so many people
- **[05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZx0KMCOSs4&t=311s)** — hold tension in their jaws. A lot of people hold tension in their gut, especially when they
- **[05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZx0KMCOSs4&t=318s)** — eat. So when you eat, you should slow your eating, chew more, and really relax your whole
- **[05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZx0KMCOSs4&t=324s)** — digestive system. That'll help not just digestion, but it'll actually help you sleep
- **[05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZx0KMCOSs4&t=329s)** — at night. Because I think the number one reason why people don't sleep is they have certain
- **[05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZx0KMCOSs4&t=334s)** — parts of their body that are under tension. And so you have to actively kind of let those muscles
- **[05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZx0KMCOSs4&t=340s)** — go. So these are little exercises that you can do on a regular basis. And these are meant
- **[05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZx0KMCOSs4&t=345s)** — mainly for athletes, but I would apply this to anyone. When I was in wrestling in high school
- **[05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZx0KMCOSs4&t=350s)** — and college, before a match, I would literally be so nervous. I would have the adrenaline
- **[05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZx0KMCOSs4&t=356s)** — pumping through my heart. I would just feel this pounding, just incredibly loud. And I was
- **[06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZx0KMCOSs4&t=362s)** — so freaked out. The last thing I was is relaxed. In fact, when I went to state, I started getting
- **[06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZx0KMCOSs4&t=367s)** — more nervous. And of course, that did not lead to a good performance. But the person that did
- **[06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZx0KMCOSs4&t=372s)** — take first place in state at 185 pounds, I remember watching him. He was basically almost like
- **[06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZx0KMCOSs4&t=381s)** — bored before doing the final match. He was just sitting there just completely and utterly
- **[06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZx0KMCOSs4&t=386s)** — relaxed. And that's a good state to be because the more stress you have, the more
- **[06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZx0KMCOSs4&t=390s)** — nervous tension, the more muscular tension, the less good performance you're going to have in
- **[06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZx0KMCOSs4&t=395s)** — that competition because you're going to choke. You're not going to be able to think clearly.
- **[06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZx0KMCOSs4&t=399s)** — I remember another incident in college. In order to graduate, I had to give this speech and I had
- **[06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZx0KMCOSs4&t=406s)** — a terror of public speaking. I had to go up in front of my peers and do this presentation.
- **[06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZx0KMCOSs4&t=412s)** — I was this close to dropping out of college. And I don't know how I got through it, but it
- **[06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZx0KMCOSs4&t=416s)** — very, very nerve wracking. And so public speaking is another fear that a lot of people have.
- **[07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZx0KMCOSs4&t=421s)** — And the way that I overcame it is I basically just forced myself to do a lot of presentations.
- **[07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZx0KMCOSs4&t=427s)** — I think I did 4,900 presentations over a period of time to get rid of that fear of public
- **[07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZx0KMCOSs4&t=432s)** — speaking. I think the goal should be really have the viewpoint of being carefree and calm
- **[07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZx0KMCOSs4&t=440s)** — under stressful situations. No matter how stressful things are, you have to just change your
- **[07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZx0KMCOSs4&t=446s)** — mind and have a relaxed viewpoint. And that also includes controlling your breathing,
- **[07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZx0KMCOSs4&t=453s)** — breathing through your nose. I remember I went out to dinner with a patient of mine and
- **[07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZx0KMCOSs4&t=459s)** — as we were talking, she started to choke on her food. She couldn't breathe. And here I am
- **[07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZx0KMCOSs4&t=465s)** — in this restaurant and I have to give someone the Heimlich maneuver and I have to remember
- **[07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZx0KMCOSs4&t=469s)** — to do it. So I started to do it and it didn't work. And I can see her eyes were bloodshot
- **[07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZx0KMCOSs4&t=475s)** — and she's turning blue. And thank God I just said, sit down and just totally relax,
- **[08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZx0KMCOSs4&t=482s)** — calm down. And that's when things started to open up in her throat. So anytime someone's in
- **[08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZx0KMCOSs4&t=488s)** — a panic mood, you want them just to calm down and you want them to breathe normally if
- **[08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZx0KMCOSs4&t=493s)** — they can breathe, especially through their nose. Or else they're going to basically be
- **[08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZx0KMCOSs4&t=498s)** — starving for oxygen in this panic attack. So a lot of times when people are stressed out
- **[08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZx0KMCOSs4&t=502s)** — and they're stuck in the past and not in the present. And so this is so important to connect
- **[08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZx0KMCOSs4&t=507s)** — with your environment, to go for a walk in nature, to do something physical. Whether it's
- **[08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZx0KMCOSs4&t=512s)** — something like bird watching or playing with your animal or playing some sport or being active
- **[08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZx0KMCOSs4&t=517s)** — in your environment that kind of pulls you out of that stress. So you have more control
- **[08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZx0KMCOSs4&t=522s)** — your thoughts. And as a side note to that, B1, natural B1 can really help those excessive
- **[08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZx0KMCOSs4&t=529s)** — thoughts that randomly just go through your mind at night and through the day as well.
- **[08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZx0KMCOSs4&t=534s)** — So if you're deficient in B1 because you're doing too many carbs, that can actually create
- **[08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZx0KMCOSs4&t=538s)** — a bad effect. But taking some natural B1 will put you in a state where within minutes
- **[09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZx0KMCOSs4&t=543s)** — you just feel like, oh, I feel calm more myself. Now the other thing that I recommend
- **[09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZx0KMCOSs4&t=548s)** — is when you exercise, you should maintain a relaxed body. You're going to have less injuries,
- **[09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZx0KMCOSs4&t=557s)** — you're going to have better performance. Even when you walk or hike, relax every part of
- **[09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZx0KMCOSs4&t=562s)** — your body. Find out where you hold tension, is it in your ankles? Find out if you're kind
- **[09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZx0KMCOSs4&t=567s)** — of limping to one side because of an old injury and start to walk and relax every part
- **[09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZx0KMCOSs4&t=572s)** — of your body, including your upper back and your muscle and your jaw and try to breathe
- **[09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZx0KMCOSs4&t=576s)** — Okay, so here's some other things out of the book. To get rid of all your tensions in your
- **[09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZx0KMCOSs4&t=580s)** — head and your neck, drop your shoulders as low as they'll go. Get them down there and then lower
- **[09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZx0KMCOSs4&t=586s)** — them even more. When you breathe out, let the tensions go out of your body. Remember to breathe
- **[09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZx0KMCOSs4&t=591s)** — slowly and regularly. As you exhale, drop your tensions. Talk to your right bicep. Tell it to
- **[09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZx0KMCOSs4&t=598s)** — let go. Then to your left bicep. Then the muscles on the front part of your body. Then
- **[10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZx0KMCOSs4&t=603s)** — muscles on the back part of your body. Then the right leg and then the left leg.
- **[10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZx0KMCOSs4&t=607s)** — Imagine your body like a jellyfish. You have no bones in your left arm.
- **[10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZx0KMCOSs4&t=610s)** — It just sags. Just let it go. Let the tensions go. If you have any trouble relaxing your arms,
- **[10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZx0KMCOSs4&t=616s)** — clench your fist tightly and then let it go and see the difference. I think one of the
- **[10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZx0KMCOSs4&t=621s)** — things that people run into is that when they kind of scan their body for tensions,
- **[10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZx0KMCOSs4&t=626s)** — they might not be able to identify where these tensions are. So I notice another thing
- **[10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZx0KMCOSs4&t=632s)** — you can do. I bought this. It's called the mobility stick. There's a whole series of
- **[10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZx0KMCOSs4&t=637s)** — stretches that you can do that are very different and they create a lot of very cool
- **[10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZx0KMCOSs4&t=643s)** — stretches in certain positions that you don't normally get into. So when you put your body
- **[10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZx0KMCOSs4&t=647s)** — through these range of motions, I'm laterally flexing this way and rotating as I'm stretching.
- **[10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZx0KMCOSs4&t=652s)** — I'm finding tension in my body that I never knew that I had. I would never find those
- **[10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZx0KMCOSs4&t=657s)** — unless I put my body in those really strange positions because going the other way,
- **[11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZx0KMCOSs4&t=664s)** — it's totally fine. But going to the left, it's really restricted. And I noticed when I worked
- **[11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZx0KMCOSs4&t=669s)** — out those areas of tension, I had the best night's sleep. So sometimes you have to go
- **[11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZx0KMCOSs4&t=674s)** — through a range of motion and stretching to find out where your tensions are. So you can
- **[11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZx0KMCOSs4&t=678s)** — start working on relaxing those tensions either with letting them go or just stretching your
- **[11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZx0KMCOSs4&t=684s)** — muscles. And then we have also this hormone called oxytocin. I talked about this in other
- **[11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZx0KMCOSs4&t=689s)** — videos. Oxytocin is that hormone that assist in the bonding of a mother to their child after
- **[11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZx0KMCOSs4&t=698s)** — birth. They call it the love hormone. But there's some other things about oxytocin that
- **[11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZx0KMCOSs4&t=703s)** — can help directly lower cortisol and stress. And some of the things that can increase
- **[11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZx0KMCOSs4&t=712s)** — oxytocin is bonding with a pet or an animal or even donating or contributing to something,
- **[11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZx0KMCOSs4&t=719s)** — which is really helping another. I don't know of anyone who's helping a lot of people
- **[12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZx0KMCOSs4&t=725s)** — who are always in a stress state. This video might be a simple video, but I think it's
- **[12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZx0KMCOSs4&t=729s)** — really important. If you have not seen my video on doing like a stress extraction technique
- **[12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZx0KMCOSs4&t=738s)** — using manual therapy, this is another thing that I think if you add to what I talked about,
- **[12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZx0KMCOSs4&t=744s)** — it can greatly reduce your stress and help you sleep. I put that video up right here. Check it out.

- **[00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CozZ1Rcm55E&t=0s)** — What would happen if you were to stop using your cell phone before bed for just 14 days?
- **[00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CozZ1Rcm55E&t=6s)** — This is going to be very interesting. The majority of the population uses their cell phone before bed.
- **[00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CozZ1Rcm55E&t=10s)** — And there's two big reasons why they should not do that. But if they do use a cell phone,
- **[00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CozZ1Rcm55E&t=15s)** — there are several things you can do to minimize the problem with this.
- **[00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CozZ1Rcm55E&t=18s)** — The first problem with your cell phone and other mobile devices is this thing called blue light.
- **[00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CozZ1Rcm55E&t=24s)** — In the spectrum of visible light, the first band of light is the blue light.
- **[00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CozZ1Rcm55E&t=29s)** — Blue light powerfully suppresses melatonin. Melatonin is the hormone that helps you go to
- **[00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CozZ1Rcm55E&t=37s)** — sleep at night. If your melatonin is too low, you're going to have a hard time going to sleep
- **[00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CozZ1Rcm55E&t=41s)** — and the quality of sleep is not going to be that great. And this is going to lead to a
- **[00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CozZ1Rcm55E&t=44s)** — whole bunch of problems the next day. Now you're probably asking yourself like why out of all
- **[00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CozZ1Rcm55E&t=48s)** — the different types of color, why is blue the one that messes with your melatonin? Now in order
- **[00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CozZ1Rcm55E&t=54s)** — bodies to have adapted to the awake and sleep cycles, certain triggers were necessary.
- **[01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CozZ1Rcm55E&t=61s)** — You have light and darkness, right? And during the day, what is the color of the sky? Blue.
- **[01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CozZ1Rcm55E&t=67s)** — Blue is the most powerful color that suppresses melatonin because during the day you need to be
- **[01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CozZ1Rcm55E&t=73s)** — alert. And then when it starts to become nighttime and the sun starts setting,
- **[01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CozZ1Rcm55E&t=77s)** — maybe the reddish sunset type colors, those actually don't suppress melatonin. This is why
- **[01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CozZ1Rcm55E&t=82s)** — you should not be exposed to blue light before you go to bed. But in the LED lighting system,
- **[01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CozZ1Rcm55E&t=88s)** — in your cell phone and the digital devices, you have a more intense version of this blue
- **[01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CozZ1Rcm55E&t=95s)** — light. Then even where the sun is at peak at 12 o'clock noon, only 1.5 minutes of exposure
- **[01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CozZ1Rcm55E&t=103s)** — to this blue light before bed can start to reduce your melatonin. Especially since it's
- **[01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CozZ1Rcm55E&t=107s)** — more intense and it's closer to your eyes. Now with the TV screen, it's giving out blue
- **[01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CozZ1Rcm55E&t=112s)** — light but it's further away. It's not as intense. But there's also a blue light therapy to help
- **[01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CozZ1Rcm55E&t=117s)** — people with seasonal affective disorder during the winter time. Now the first thing that comes
- **[02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CozZ1Rcm55E&t=122s)** — to mind is, well, why don't I just use a blue light blockers and wear that before I go
- **[02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CozZ1Rcm55E&t=127s)** — to bed so I can keep using the cell phone or a mobile device? Well, there's some fascinating
- **[02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CozZ1Rcm55E&t=132s)** — information about blue light blockers. And for that, I'm going to give you a little
- **[02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CozZ1Rcm55E&t=137s)** — demonstration right now. Sunglasses do not filter out blue light. And the problem with
- **[02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CozZ1Rcm55E&t=142s)** — sunglasses is they lower all of the spectral light to a certain degree equally, but they
- **[02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CozZ1Rcm55E&t=148s)** — don't filter the blue. This is a very specific laser that gives just the blue light that we
- **[02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CozZ1Rcm55E&t=154s)** — want to filter. And I want to show you something before we get into the blue light blockers.
- **[02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CozZ1Rcm55E&t=159s)** — We're going to show you what happens with just regular sunglasses, right? So I'm just going
- **[02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CozZ1Rcm55E&t=164s)** — to put this right here and then show you. We go through the sunglasses. Let's test another
- **[02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CozZ1Rcm55E&t=171s)** — pair of sunglasses right here. Doesn't really do much, does it? Here's another pair
- **[02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CozZ1Rcm55E&t=174s)** — of sunglasses. Does not filter it worth a darn. I will say that some of these
- **[03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CozZ1Rcm55E&t=180s)** — sunglasses do help you against the UV. So at least it does something. So here's the
- **[03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CozZ1Rcm55E&t=184s)** — first one right here. This is a blue blocker. I think it's like $30, $32.95. So let's see
- **[03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CozZ1Rcm55E&t=191s)** — what happens with this one. It does not work at all. That would be a waste of money. Let's
- **[03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CozZ1Rcm55E&t=197s)** — look at this one right here. This is a blue light blocker. Okay, this one's better, but not
- **[03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CozZ1Rcm55E&t=201s)** — 100%. Let's check this glasses. So we just bought a bunch of different blue blockers and
- **[03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CozZ1Rcm55E&t=206s)** — you can see this one does not block the blue out. Waste of money. Let's try this one right
- **[03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CozZ1Rcm55E&t=212s)** — here. This one works great. This one completely blocks everything out. All right, now let's
- **[03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CozZ1Rcm55E&t=218s)** — look at the one that costs $2.95. It's this one right here. The cool looking one.
- **[03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CozZ1Rcm55E&t=227s)** — Wow, that blocks it really nicely. See that? For three bucks. So I think this is the winner
- **[03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CozZ1Rcm55E&t=232s)** — right here and it looks cool. So I'm going to put this link down below. Okay, there's one
- **[03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CozZ1Rcm55E&t=237s)** — more test we can do with a spectroscope. This is $10. This is going to just show you
- **[04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CozZ1Rcm55E&t=242s)** — what happens when you look at your cell phone. Okay, if you want to just hold this
- **[04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CozZ1Rcm55E&t=245s)** — right here. So when I look into this, you're going to see there's blue light coming off
- **[04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CozZ1Rcm55E&t=250s)** — this cell phone and this is the problem. It's very intense. It's very close to your face
- **[04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CozZ1Rcm55E&t=255s)** — when you're scrolling along. So if you actually were to add something like this,
- **[04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CozZ1Rcm55E&t=261s)** — if you wanted to use your cell phone at night and put this in front and look through
- **[04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CozZ1Rcm55E&t=267s)** — there, you could see the blue light disappears. So in other words, if you want to sleep at
- **[04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CozZ1Rcm55E&t=272s)** — night, you want to wear some type of blue blocking device that really works so you
- **[04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CozZ1Rcm55E&t=277s)** — cannot suppress melatonin. Blue light also increases cortisol to a certain degree
- **[04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CozZ1Rcm55E&t=283s)** — and blue light can actually damage the eye if you have too much exposure to that spectrum,
- **[04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CozZ1Rcm55E&t=289s)** — especially if you're sitting in front of a computer all day long and then
- **[04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CozZ1Rcm55E&t=292s)** — watching your cell phone at night. Then we get into the topic of the next problem
- **[04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CozZ1Rcm55E&t=296s)** — with this cell phone and that is something called EMF. Electromagnetic fields, an invisible
- **[05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CozZ1Rcm55E&t=304s)** — radiation that affects our whole body. It creates damage within the communication
- **[05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CozZ1Rcm55E&t=310s)** — signals in the cell. It also can increase the risk of certain types of cancer in tumor growth
- **[05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CozZ1Rcm55E&t=316s)** — because it damages part of the cell. Now of course I use a cell phone. A lot of people
- **[05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CozZ1Rcm55E&t=322s)** — It's just a matter of understanding what you can do to reduce that exposure to the EMF.
- **[05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CozZ1Rcm55E&t=328s)** — The one that I like is called the tri-field because it's very simple to use and it doesn't
- **[05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CozZ1Rcm55E&t=332s)** — just measure the electrical fields and the magnetic fields but also the radio frequency,
- **[05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CozZ1Rcm55E&t=338s)** — as in cell tower frequencies, frequencies from routers. And so it's very very accurate,
- **[05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CozZ1Rcm55E&t=344s)** — very very simple to use and I've been using this for several years. So I think it'd be a
- **[05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CozZ1Rcm55E&t=352s)** — good idea to start measuring the places in your environment that you spend a lot of time,
- **[05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CozZ1Rcm55E&t=356s)** — whether it's in front of the computer or it's next to a cell phone. And then you can actually
- **[06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CozZ1Rcm55E&t=360s)** — visualize this hidden radiation that's coming off these devices and know how much is being
- **[06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CozZ1Rcm55E&t=368s)** — emitted. Like for example when I first got this I went through my entire house and I found
- **[06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CozZ1Rcm55E&t=373s)** — there was a tremendous amount of magnetic fields around my bed. I noticed that I had
- **[06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CozZ1Rcm55E&t=378s)** — heart palpitations when I slept and I felt really really tired waking up like more than usual
- **[06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CozZ1Rcm55E&t=384s)** — and that's because I was being bathed in this huge magnetic field. So it's going to affect
- **[06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CozZ1Rcm55E&t=389s)** — the quality of sleep, how deep you sleep, and it's going to affect how you feel the next day.
- **[06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CozZ1Rcm55E&t=394s)** — In fact every minute that you use this before you go to bed there could be a delayed sleep
- **[06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CozZ1Rcm55E&t=400s)** — onset by 3.5 minutes. The other thing I want to talk about is REM sleep. So when you go
- **[06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CozZ1Rcm55E&t=405s)** — sleep you go through deep sleep okay and then you go to a superficial wave sleep which is
- **[06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CozZ1Rcm55E&t=411s)** — called REM sleep. And so it kind of cycles through every 90 minutes up and down up and down
- **[06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CozZ1Rcm55E&t=415s)** — versus deep delta wave sleep has a lot to do with repairing the physical body more than
- **[07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CozZ1Rcm55E&t=421s)** — the mental repair. Let's demo out what happens when your cell phone is close to your skull.
- **[07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CozZ1Rcm55E&t=428s)** — What we're trying to do is we're trying to have you take this cell phone and keep it
- **[07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CozZ1Rcm55E&t=432s)** — as far away from your head as possible under speaker mode so you will not affect melatonin
- **[07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CozZ1Rcm55E&t=439s)** — and you can actually sleep like a baby. Now there's a lot of other things that affect
- **[07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CozZ1Rcm55E&t=443s)** — melatonin, alcohol, caffeine, nicotine, stress before bed, and of course we also have
- **[07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CozZ1Rcm55E&t=451s)** — temperature. If the temperature is higher like 75 degrees Fahrenheit your sleep quality is
- **[07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CozZ1Rcm55E&t=457s)** — going to be very poor. But there's a range between 60 degrees and like 69 degrees that
- **[07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CozZ1Rcm55E&t=462s)** — you're going to find that you're going to have much better sleep because when you go to sleep
- **[07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CozZ1Rcm55E&t=465s)** — your core temperature does drop by one to two points. People that have insomnia have a higher
- **[07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CozZ1Rcm55E&t=473s)** — core temperature. Now what's the problem with crappy sleep? It's the next day. Okay, how you
- **[07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CozZ1Rcm55E&t=479s)** — feel? It's your energy level. It's your ability to be productive, your ability to have
- **[08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CozZ1Rcm55E&t=483s)** — cognitive function and have focus and concentration and creativity. I had a problem with sleep for
- **[08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CozZ1Rcm55E&t=490s)** — I'd say 12 to 15 years. At one time I had restless leg syndrome. The other portion of
- **[08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CozZ1Rcm55E&t=495s)** — the time I just would wake up at two o'clock in the morning and it was my cortisol that was
- **[08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CozZ1Rcm55E&t=498s)** — just way too high. Of course I never really looked at my diet but that was really behind
- **[08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CozZ1Rcm55E&t=504s)** — this whole thing. I didn't even use a cell phone before bed and I used to then try to
- **[08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CozZ1Rcm55E&t=508s)** — do a sugar coma by consuming a pint of Ben and Jerry's before bed so I could sleep. But that
- **[08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CozZ1Rcm55E&t=513s)** — is a very stupid solution because you wake up feeling groggy. So what happens when your sleep
- **[08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CozZ1Rcm55E&t=519s)** — is crappy? You're gonna feel like crap the next day. But also you have a higher risk of
- **[08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CozZ1Rcm55E&t=523s)** — having blood sugar problems. The risk of type 2 diabetes goes up by 48%. There's a risk of
- **[08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CozZ1Rcm55E&t=530s)** — dementia by 33% and a 30% risk of developing a depression probably because you're just exhausted.
- **[08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CozZ1Rcm55E&t=536s)** — So there's many simple things you can do to reduce this effect of blue light and EMF.
- **[09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CozZ1Rcm55E&t=543s)** — Let's say you have to use your cell phone then just wear blue light blockers that actually work.
- **[09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CozZ1Rcm55E&t=549s)** — When you use your cell phone use the speaker phone. Don't hold this thing close to your
- **[09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CozZ1Rcm55E&t=554s)** — brain okay? And just by eliminating that certain blue light that's going to make a
- **[09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CozZ1Rcm55E&t=559s)** — huge difference in your melatonin. And also if you're around a campfire or you have candles
- **[09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CozZ1Rcm55E&t=565s)** — or you have a fireplace all of that gives off infrared which can also increase melatonin.
- **[09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CozZ1Rcm55E&t=573s)** — So there are huge benefits of not using that cell phone before you go to bed. And I gave
- **[09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CozZ1Rcm55E&t=577s)** — you a little introduction to the EMF. There's more to know about that and for that I put
- **[09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CozZ1Rcm55E&t=583s)** — up this video right here. Check it out.
