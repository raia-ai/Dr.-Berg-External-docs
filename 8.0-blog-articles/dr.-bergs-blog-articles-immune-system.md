## 4 Ways to Lower Your Risk of Cataracts Cataracts are a widespread eye disease characterized by clouding of the eye’s lens, which can impair vision and even lead to loss of sight if left untreated. Discover how to lower your risk of cataracts and learn why a low-carb diet is one of the best strategies to promote healthy eyes and vision. ![Man with eye strain](https://www.drberg.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/image-photo-senior-man-eyestrain-after-long-stretches-239.jpg?w=800) ## **What are cataracts?** Cataracts are one of the most common age-related eye diseases, marked by the clouding of the lens inside the eye. This condition occurs when proteins in the lens break down and clump together, impairing the eye’s ability to focus light properly onto the retina. While age-related cataracts are the most frequent type, other forms, such as congenital cataracts, can occur in newborns due to genetic factors or maternal infections during pregnancy. Another type, the posterior subcapsular cataract, forms at the back of the lens and often progresses rapidly, affecting near vision and causing glare. Cataracts can impair vision significantly and are one of the most common causes of vision loss. Currently, cataract surgery is the only effective treatment that involves removing the clouded lens and replacing it with a clear artificial intraocular lens. While surgery is highly effective, [research](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9646653/) published in _Medicine_ found that this procedure carries risks and may increase the risk of age-related macular degeneration, another serious eye condition that damages the retina and central vision. Therefore, taking preventative measures by making beneficial dietary and lifestyle changes in combination with regular eye exams is crucial to preserve vision and reduce the risk of developing cataracts.

## Dental Plaque Secret: #1 Remedy Beats Brushing Are you looking for an effective dental plaque remedy? You’re not alone. A sticky film of bacteria that builds up on teeth, known as dental plaque, is the primary cause of tooth decay and gum disease. Learn about dental plaque, its causes, and what remedies you can implement to improve your dental hygiene. ## **Understanding Dental Plaque and Its Impact on Oral Health** The dental plaque that forms a sticky film on your teeth is not just an unpleasant sight but also poses serious threats to oral health. This persistent biofilm becomes a breeding ground for bacteria thriving on leftover food particles in the mouth. ### **The Role of Biofilms in Tartar Formation** Biofilms are microorganisms living together as communities, adhering to each other and surfaces they come into contact with. These structures form the primary component of what we know as dental plaque or tartar. About 95% of bacteria existing in nature reside within these intricate microbial ecosystems – highlighting their importance beyond just oral health. In our mouths, biofilms can develop anywhere – from teeth and gums to tongues, wherever there’s space for growth. Consuming foods rich in sugars and starches, like fruits or bread, nourishes specific bacteria within these oral biofilm communities. This leads to rapid bacterial proliferation, subsequently increasing the volume of this sticky film enveloping our teeth – often called plaque build-up. If not removed through regular brushing and flossing, over time, this soft layer hardens into tartar. – significantly more challenging to remove than its predecessor due to its rough surface providing an ideal environment for further bacterial growth, potentially leading toward tooth decay or gum disease if left unchecked. An excessive presence of biofilms contributes to unsightly aesthetics. It may result in lousy breath due mainly to the production of foul-smelling compounds such as hydrogen sulfide during the

## How to Get Rid of BV Naturally: What Really Works Bacterial vaginosis (BV) is a vaginal infection triggered by the overgrowth of potentially harmful bacteria within the female reproductive tract. BV is a widespread condition that can lead to several unpleasant side effects, including a strong odor, itching, and burning sensations while urinating. Learn more about the common causes of this microbial infection and discover how to get rid of BV naturally. ## **What is BV (bacterial vaginosis)?** Bacterial vaginosis, widely known as BV, is a vaginal infection characterized by the overgrowth of certain bacterial species, most commonly _Gardnerella vaginalis_. An estimated 30 to 35 percent of women in the U.S. will develop bacterial vaginosis at some point in their lives. It’s the most common vaginal infection among girls and women aged 15 to 44, particularly in those who are sexually active. However, bacterial vaginosis isn’t considered a sexually transmitted infection (STI), as it involves an overgrowth of bacteria that are naturally present in the vaginal microbiota. In contrast, STIs are infections originating from external bacteria, viruses, fungi, or parasites introduced through sexual intercourse. Watch the video below to learn about effective home remedies for bacterial vaginosis.## **Signs of bacterial vaginosis** Bacterial vaginosis occurs when the natural balance of vaginal microflora is disrupted, leading to a shift in the microbial environment. This imbalance often alters the vaginal pH, resulting in noticeable changes in odor, appearance, and overall sensations. Common bacterial vaginosis symptoms include: \* Thin green, white, or gray vaginal discharge \* A fishlike odor \* Vaginal itching or irritation \* Burning while urinating \* Discomfort during or after sex Symptoms of bacterial vaginosis can vary widely, ranging from mild to severe, and some women may
