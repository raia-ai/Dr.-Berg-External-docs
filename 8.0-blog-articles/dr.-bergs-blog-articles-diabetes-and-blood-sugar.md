## Prostate Enlargement: Understanding the Root Cause It’s estimated that around 40 percent of men over 50 and up to 90 percent of men over 80 develop an enlarged prostate gland. Although most cases are benign and accompanied by only mild symptoms affecting urine flow, prostate enlargement can progress into bladder stones and kidney disease if left unmanaged. Discover the early warning signs of an enlarged prostate and discover how making beneficial dietary changes can help support prostate gland health. ## **What is an enlarged prostate?** The prostate gland is a small, walnut-sized organ located beneath the bladder that surrounds the urethra, which is the tube that carries urine from the bladder out of the body. This gland plays a crucial role in male reproductive health as it produces prostatic fluid, a key component of semen that nourishes and protects sperm. An enlarged prostate, also called benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), occurs when the prostate gland grows in size due to an overgrowth of prostate tissue. This enlargement can compress the bladder neck, partially blocking urine flow and making it difficult to fully empty the bladder. As the prostate enlarges, it can squeeze the urethra, leading to various urinary symptoms. One of the first signs often noticed is a frequent need to urinate at night, a condition known as nocturia. According to a report published by the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK), prostate enlargement doesn’t increase the risk of prostate cancer, although both conditions can occur simultaneously in some men.1 This highlights the importance of regular screenings to differentiate between prostate tissue enlargement and prostate cancer, ensuring timely and appropriate treatment. Watch the video below to learn about the most common cause of prostate enlargement.

## Best Alternative Sweeteners for a Healthy Diet These days it seems everyone is searching for the perfect sugar substitute. We all know excess sugar harms our health, but completely ditching sweetness can feel impossible. That’s where this in-depth sugar substitutes comparison comes in handy. I’ll guide you through the pros and cons of popular options so you can make informed choices aligned with your health goals. ## **Sugar Substitutes Comparison: Navigating the Sweetener Maze** For years I used sugar liberally, unaware of the havoc it wreaked on my body. It wasn’t until I began experiencing persistent energy crashes and stubborn weight gain that I realized something had to change. This is a journey many people face. Thankfully, there’s a whole world of sugar substitutes available using natural sweeteners and even some artificial sweeteners. However, not all sweeteners are created equal. Let’s analyze common choices, weighing benefits against potential drawbacks. ### **Stevia: Natural Sweetness from a Leaf** [Stevia](https://www.drberg.com/blog/stevia-vs-sucralose) sugar substitutes are derived from the stevia plant, native to South America. This natural sweetener contains no carbohydrates or calories. One benefit of stevia is its negligible impact on [blood sugar regulation](https://www.drberg.com/blog/solve-diabetes-overnight-understanding-this-simple). This makes it suitable for individuals managing their acceptable daily intake of sugar and those with health concerns like diabetes, seeking more than just a sugar swap. However, some people find stevia’s aftertaste slightly bitter. This can vary depending on the brand and how the stevia is processed. Experimentation is key. ![Erythritol spelled with alcohol sugar](https://www.drberg.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/inscription-erythritol-on-sweetener-close-blue.jpg?w=800) ### **Erythritol: A Popular Sugar Alcohol with Caveats** [Erythritol](https://www.drberg.com/blog/what-is-erythritol) is a sugar alcohol

## Why You Feel Tired and Fatigued After Eating You’ve been rocking the OMAD life, enjoying the simplicity and benefits of eating just once a day. But then it hits you – that dreaded post-meal fatigue. Suddenly, you’re ready for a nap before you’ve even finished digesting. Sound familiar? You’re not alone. OMAD fatigue after eating is a common challenge for many one-meal-a-day enthusiasts. But let’s pause for a second – why does this even happen, and what steps can you take to deal with it? Ever wonder about the magic behind staying peppy post-meal? Stick around as we uncover it along with foolproof ways to make sure dipping energy won’t bother you anymore, no matter when food is on the table. ## Understanding OMAD Fatigue: The Role of Insulin Resistance If you’ve been following the [OMAD (one meal a day)](https://www.drberg.com/blog/23-benefits-of-one-meal-a-day) diet and experiencing fatigue after your meal, [insulin resistance](https://www.drberg.com/blog/how-to-test-for-insulin-resistance) might be the culprit. Insulin resistance is a condition that often precedes diabetes and can lead to a host of health issues, including fatigue after eating. When you have insulin resistance, your body’s cells don’t respond appropriately to insulin, a hormone that helps regulate blood sugar levels. As a result, your body needs to produce more insulin to keep your blood sugar in check, which can lead to high insulin levels and, eventually, insulin resistance. ![Fatigue at the workplace](https://www.drberg.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/exhausted-male-employee-feeling-fatigue-lying.jpg?w=800) ### Identifying Symptoms of Insulin Resistance Some common signs of insulin resistance include: \* Fatigue, especially after eating \* Brain fog and difficulty concentrating \* Cravings for sugary or high-carb foods \* Weight gain, particularly around the waist \* High blood pressure If you’re experiencing these symptoms, particularly fatigue after your OMAD meal, it’s essential to recognize and

## What Is Cortisol? Simple Guide to Stress Hormones While many have herd of the hormone cortisol, and may even understand that it has something to do with stress, it is important to gain a full understanding on one of the most important functions your body conducts. Learn about cortisol, what role it plays in the body, and how you can support healthy levels of this hormone. Cortisol is a steroid hormone produced by the adrenal glands in response to stress. Its primary function is to mobilize energy stores by increasing blood sugar levels, which provides the body with immediate energy to cope with stressors. ### **The Adrenal Glands and Cortisol Production** The adrenal glands, comprised of the adrenal cortex and adrenal medulla, play a crucial role in cortisol production. The adrenal cortex, the outer layer of the adrenal glands, synthesizes cortisol in response to signals from the hypothalamus and pituitary gland. This allows cortisol levels to fluctuate in response to changing stress levels and other physiological needs. ## **The Link Between Stress and Cortisol Levels** When we’re stressed, our bodies respond by producing cortisol. This hormone helps us handle stress, but what happens when stress is constant? ![](https://www.drberg.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/1f59f222-9c1b-4501-8d03-6c5907943854.jpg?w=800) ### **Stress Triggers for Cortisol Production** Your body reacts to different types of stressors – physical or mental trauma, poor eating habits, and even hormonal changes. All these can cause a spike in your cortisol levels. [Studies show](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3079864) that chronic stress leads to high cortisol production, which remains elevated over time. ### **The Accumulation of Stress Over Time** We all face stressful life events like college exams, parenting struggles, or dealing with divorce. These accumulate over time, causing consistent elevation in our cortisol levels. This long-term exposure to high-stress environments has

## What Causes Gastritis? Causes, Symptoms, and Remedies Gastritis can significantly impact digestive health and overall well-being, and understanding what causes gastritis is crucial for effective management and prevention. Explore common gastritis symptoms and discover natural ways to support digestive comfort and promote a healthy stomach lining. ## **What is gastritis?** Gastritis occurs when the stomach’s mucosal lining, which is a specialized layer that protects the stomach from being broken down by its own acidity, becomes inflamed. When this lining becomes damaged or irritated, it can expose the stomach wall to stomach acid and digestive enzymes, leading to pain, nausea, and indigestion. Over time, this inflammation can lead to erosive gastritis, where the protective lining wears away, increasing the risk of intestinal bleeding and ulcers. The National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK) reports that gastritis is a common condition impacting up to 35 percent of people at some point in their lives.1 Gastritis can present as either acute or chronic. Acute gastritis occurs suddenly, often triggered by irritants such as excessive alcohol consumption or certain medications. In contrast, chronic gastritis develops gradually due to long-term factors such as diet, stress, and bacterial infections. Watch the video below to learn more about common gastritis triggers.## **Gastritis symptoms** Gastritis symptoms can vary in severity but often include noticeable digestive discomfort. Common symptoms of gastritis include: \* Indigestion \* Vomiting, especially yellow or green fluid \* Nausea \* Low appetite \* Abdominal pain, especially in the upper portion \* A sensation of burning, especially at night and in between meals These symptoms can significantly disrupt daily life and increase the risk of further

## Hormone Imbalance: Signs, Causes, and Solutions Hormone imbalance can be detrimental to your physical and mental health. It can happen when glands produce too much or too little of any hormone–often caused by lifestyle changes, unhealthy diets, stress, and aging. Learn about the telltale signs of irregular hormones and how you can balance them naturally. ![What causes hormone imbalances?](https://www.drberg.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/hormones-word-wooden-cubes-on-white.jpg?w=800) ## **What are hormones?** Hormones are chemical messages sent through your bloodstream from your endocrine glands to your cells. Cells have receptors that receive hormones–triggering certain functions within the cell. Imagine yourself speaking into a microphone to a crowd of people. You are doing the job of an endocrine gland–your voice is transmitting information (hormones), and the audience members (receptors) are listening to and receiving the information, which they can act on. Your body has eight primary endocrine glands that produce hormones and regulate your body functions. Insulin and glucagon are hormones secreted by the pancreas, which instruct your body to regulate its blood sugar level. Insulin lowers your sugar level when it’s too high, and glucagon increases it when it’s too low. If either or both of these hormones don’t function properly, you risk having diabetes. ![Endocrine system](https://www.drberg.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/human-endocrine-system-glands-their-location.png?w=800) ### **Hormone cheat sheet** In the same way insulin deficiency causes diabetes, other hormone-related conditions can also cause health complications. Learn more about your key hormones, their secreting glands, and their functions. **Adrenaline** Secreting gland: Adrenals Functions: Increases heart rate, blood flow and pressure, and metabolism in response to stress **Cortisol** Secreting gland: Adrenals Function: Helps the body adapt to stressors **Aldosterone** Secreting gland: Adrenals

## Sweeteners for Diabetics: Top Natural Picks To maintain balanced blood glucose levels, many diabetics are using sugar substitutes to sweeten foods and beverages. However, not all alternative sweeteners are created equal, as some may have harmful effects on health and could even disrupt blood sugar control and metabolic functions. Let’s look at the best and worst alternative sweeteners for diabetics and learn why it’s crucial to avoid artificial sugar substitutes. ## **What are alternative sweeteners?** Alternative sweeteners are sugar substitutes that offer sweetness without the same calorie content or glycemic impact as regular sugar. These low-calorie sweeteners, also called non-nutritive sweeteners, are popular among individuals looking to reduce calorie intake, manage blood sugar levels, and minimize the health risks linked to sugar toxicity. Depending on how these sugar substitutes are produced, they’re broadly grouped into three categories: \* Artificial sweeteners \* Alternative sweeteners \* Sugar alcohols Let’s look at the differences between these different types of sugar substitutes. ### **Artificial sweeteners** Artificial sweeteners are a group of synthetically manufactured sugar substitutes that mimic the sweetness of table sugar without containing any calories. These sweeteners are commonly found in various processed foods and beverages, such as diet sodas, sugar-free fruit juices, packaged snacks, and low-calorie desserts. The most widely used artificial sweeteners include sucralose, aspartame, saccharin, acesulfame potassium, and neotame. Despite their widespread use, there is evidence that these synthetic sugar substitutes are linked to various health risks and may, in fact, counteract the intended benefits for blood sugar control and weight management. Research published in _Obesity_ investigated the effects of artificial low-calorie sweeteners and found that sucralose, the primary sweetener in Splenda products, has been linked to poor metabolic

## Green Mediterranean Diet: Is It as Healthy as It Seems? The green Mediterranean diet is a variation of the traditional Mediterranean diet, which integrates polyphenol-rich foods while reducing the intake of red and processed meats. Research suggests this eating plan can promote weight loss, but is it a healthy diet that supports long-term well-being? Discover why its high-carb approach outweighs the benefits of the green Mediterranean diet, and discover how a nutritious low-carb diet may be a better choice to promote a healthy body. ## **What is the green Mediterranean diet?** The traditional Mediterranean diet is an eating pattern that emphasizes fresh, seasonal foods, including vegetables, fruits, legumes, whole grains, olive oil, nuts, and animal proteins. The green Mediterranean diet builds on this traditional framework by focusing on specific polyphenol-rich, plant-based foods and reducing meat consumption, especially red meat. This approach aims to reduce inflammation and promote weight loss by prioritizing dietary fiber, plant-based proteins, and nutritious produce. Key components of the green Mediterranean diet include: \* Plant-based proteins \* Leafy green vegetables \* 3 to 4 cups of green tea daily \* Walnuts and other nuts \* Duckweed, also called Mankai \* Minimal red meat \* Whole grains \* Extra virgin olive oil According to research published in _Heart,_ the green Mediterranean diet demonstrated a greater reduction in inflammatory markers than the traditional Mediterranean diet.1 Participants also experienced more significant decreases in waist circumference, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, blood pressure, and insulin resistance.

## The Best Mounjaro Alternatives – Natural Options to Consider Mounjaro is a diabetes treatment that has been shown to help diabetic patients improve their blood sugar control and achieve weight loss. However, potential side effects, such as severe abdominal pain and thyroid cancer, have sparked concerns, and many individuals are turning to natural remedies to support metabolic health. Discover the best Mounjaro alternatives and learn practical tips for achieving a healthy weight without pharmaceutical drugs. ## **What is Mounjaro?** Mounjaro, also known as tirzepatide, is a prescription medication approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to control blood sugar levels in type 2 diabetics. The dose depends on body weight and is administered weekly via an injection pen. Mounjaro belongs to the glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) agonists drug class. These medications artificially mimic the effects of GLP-1 and glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP), hormones naturally produced in the intestines. This drug works by activating the GLP-1 and GIP hormone receptors, which stimulates insulin release and lowers blood glucose levels. GLP-1 and GIP receptor binding also play a crucial role in satiation and hunger suppression, which explains why Mounjaro can promote weight loss. In addition to weight loss, Monjaro has also been found to have the potential to reduce heart disease risk factors such as high blood pressure. Although Mounjaro isn’t FDA-approved as a weight loss medication, its active ingredient, tirzepatide, is approved for use in treating obesity under the brand name Zepbound. This clarifies why Mounjaro is often prescribed as a weight loss drug. Watch the video below to learn more about the best alternatives to Mounjaro.## **Downsides to Mounjaro** Mounjaro can improve blood sugar control and decrease food intake, which can promote weight loss

## Maltodextrin: The Hidden Poison in Your Food Maltodextrin is a seemingly innocuous additive that often goes unnoticed on ingredient lists, but it’s essential to understand its role and potential impact on our health. Look at familiar foods high in maltodextrin and learn how this high glycemic sweetener can substantially affect blood sugar levels. ## **What’s the Glycemic Index?** The glycemic index (GI) measures how quickly carbs are absorbed into our bloodstream and spike blood sugar levels. Foods with high GI values, like white bread or potatoes, cause significant fluctuations in blood sugar levels and trigger excessive insulin secretion that can cause adverse health impacts. It’s essential to understand this principle to comprehend why maltodextrin, despite not being classified as a sugar, can harm our bodies. ### **Glycemic Index Explained** The glycemic index ranks carbohydrate-containing foods based on how they affect blood glucose levels when eaten alone. The scale ranges from 0 to 100, with pure glucose having the highest score of 100. \* Foods with low GI (55 or less): Whole grains, beans, lentils, etc., digest slowly, leading to a gradual rise in blood sugar levels. \* Foods with medium GI (56-69): White rice or raisins cause moderate rises. \* Foods with high GI (70+): Bagels or popcorn cause sharp spikes. Check out this [article](https://www.drberg.com/blog/glycemic-index-versus-fat-storing-hormone-index) for further elaboration on understanding and using the glycemic index effectively. ![](https://www.drberg.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/blog-maltodextrin-one-of-the-worst-hidden-sugars-1.jpg?w=800) ### **Maltodextrin’s High Glycemic Index Value** Maltodextrin stands out because it has one of the highest possible scores on the glycemic index – even higher than table sugar. This means that consuming maltodextrin causes an almost immediate increase in blood glucose level – similar to what happens after eating simple sugars like candy bars or sugary sodas.

## How to Clean Your Arteries with Effective Foods Clogged arteries, also known as atherosclerosis, are mainly caused by poor diet, smoking, stress, obesity, and lack of physical exercise. Atherosclerosis can significantly increase your risk of heart disease and stroke. Fortunately, there are plenty of ways you can support healthy blood vessels and unclog your arteries. Discover the top foods that support cardiovascular health and learn how to clean your arteries naturally by following a healthy low-carb diet, practicing regular exercise, and incorporating stress-reduction techniques. ## **What causes blocked arteries?** Atherosclerosis is characterized by the formation of plaque inside arterial walls. This arterial plaque is typically caused by a buildup of calcium, cholesterol, and proteins which impairs the normal function of the endothelium–the innermost layer of cells that line the walls of blood vessels. Plaque stiffens and narrows artery walls, which reduces blood flow and interferes with the oxygen supply to vital organs and tissues. If left untreated, atherosclerosis can lead to coronary artery disease, significantly increasing the risk of cardiovascular events, including heart attacks and strokes. Several risk factors are linked to developing arterial plaque, including: \* High blood pressure \* Imbalanced cholesterol levels \* Smoking and vaping \* [Diabetes](https://www.drberg.com/blog/can-diabetes-be-reversed) \* Insulin resistance \* Obesity \* Family history of heart disease. Watch the video below to learn how to support arterial health naturally.### **At what age should I be worried about blocked arteries?** While the risk of blocked arteries increases with age, it’s essential to understand that [heart disease](https://www.drberg.com/blog/best-diet-for-heart-disease-or-heart-attack) can start when you are a child.

## The Best Anti-inflammatory Diet - Dr. Berg Chronic inflammation plays a primary role in the development of serious health issues and increases the risk of heart disease, cancer, diabetes, and neurodegenerative disorders. Dietary and lifestyle choices significantly impact your body’s inflammatory responses, and following an anti-inflammatory diet can help improve overall health and reduce the risk of chronic diseases. Discover the best anti-inflammatory foods and learn why [highly processed foods](https://www.drberg.com/blog/1-most-addictive-food) are a well-known risk factor for chronic inflammation and poor health. ![Sign with chronic inflammation](https://www.drberg.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/chronic-inflammation-longterm-lasting-prolonged-periods-21.jpg?w=800) ## **What is inflammation?** Inflammation is a critical component of the body’s immune response. Injury, infection, or exposure to potentially harmful substances triggers the release of pro-inflammatory mediators that activate immune cells to initiate defense and repair mechanisms. The body relies on a complex interplay between pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory compounds to promote and resolve inflammation. This balance ensures that inflammation is appropriately controlled, preventing excessive damage while protecting the body from threats. While acute inflammation is crucial in promoting healing, it can contribute to significant tissue damage if the release of pro-inflammatory messengers is persistent or dysregulated. Dietary and lifestyle habits and exposure to environmental toxins can disrupt this balance, triggering unresolved and ongoing inflammation. [Chronic inflammation](https://www.drberg.com/blog/the-big-problems-with-chronic-inflammation) impairs normal physiological processes and contributes to the development of cardiovascular disease, high blood pressure, diabetes, cancer, and Alzheimer’s disease. Additionally, persistent and systemic inflammation can dysregulate the immune system,

## Cure Toenail Fungus Overnight With This $2 Trick Toenail fungus can be a troublesome condition to deal with, turning healthy nails into thick, discolored versions of their former selves. Learn more about toenail fungus, what causes it, and how you can rid yourself of fungal infections without breaking the bank. ## **Causes and Risk Factors of Toenail Fungus** The causes behind toenail fungal infections are multifaceted. Dermatophytes, the main culprits behind toenail fungus, thrive in warm and moist environments, like the inside of a shoe. Several risk factors increase the likelihood of developing toenail fungus. Age plays a vital role since our nails become drier and more brittle with time, making them susceptible targets for fungi invasion. A weak [immune system](https://www.drberg.com/blog/stress-and-your-immune-system) also contributes significantly to susceptibility to these [pesky pathogens](https://www.drberg.com/blog/the-9-natural-ways-to-kill-pathogens). People suffering from conditions like diabetes or circulatory problems have been observed to be at higher risk, too. ### **Fungal Nail Infection: More Than Just An Aesthetic Problem** A fungal nail infection might seem like an aesthetic issue, but its implications go deeper than causing embarrassment during beach trips. Neglecting treatment could let the dermatophyte settle comfortably under your nails, leading to discoloration and pain when pressure is applied on affected toes. ### **Beware Of Shared Spaces** Public spaces such as gyms or swimming pools are prime breeding grounds for various kinds of fungi, including those responsible for giving you thickened yellow nails. If you visit these kinds of places frequently, be sure to wear shoes that offer protection. So, the next time you notice your toenail turning yellow or becoming brittle, don’t dismiss it as an aesthetic problem. It might be toenail fungus; early treatment can help prevent more severe complications. ### \*\*Prevention Is Better Than

## Tinea Versicolor Natural Remedies That Work Tinea versicolor is a fungal infection that affects the appearance of the skin, resulting in discolored patches that typically develop on the chest, shoulders, and back. Learn about the root cause of this skin condition and discover effective tinea versicolor natural remedies to help manage and reduce skin discoloration. ## **What is tinea versicolor?** Tinea versicolor, also known as pityriasis versicolor, is a skin condition caused by an overgrowth of _Malassezia_ yeast, a type of fungus that’s normally present on the skin’s surface. _Malassezia_ is typically harmless. However, when allowed to grow and proliferate, this yeast can disrupt the skin’s pigmentation, leading to the development of discolored patches that may appear lighter or darker than the surrounding skin. Though this common fungal infection can spread if left untreated, tinea versicolor isn’t contagious and can’t be transmitted from person to person. Factors such as sun exposure, heat, and humidity can exacerbate tinea versicolor, making the discolored patches more noticeable and potentially causing itchiness, dryness, or discomfort in more severe cases. Watch the video below to learn more about tinea versicolor.## **What causes tinea versicolor?** Tinea versicolor is caused by the uncontrolled growth of _Malassezia_ yeast on the skin. Hormonal fluctuations and a weakened immune system can contribute to the development of this infection. These factors create ideal conditions for yeast overgrowth and diminish the body’s ability to regulate microbial growth effectively. There are several risk factors for developing tinea versicolor, including: \* Pregnancy \* Humid climates \* Excessive sweating \* Antibiotic treatment \* Corticosteroid usage \* Cushing Disease \* [Diabetes](https://www.drberg.com/blog/what-to-eat-to-correct-diabetes) \* Malnutrition Gut

Despite your arsenal of remedies and serenades for those furious spots, you’re seriously pondering if embracing the life of a perpetual scratcher might be your calling. Itchy skin could be playing messenger and telling tales of things happening under the hood – from silent battles with unseen allergens to your body whispering (or yelling) about its internal struggles. Sure, dry air might be the culprit, or perhaps that new detergent is singing siren songs for sensitive skin. But what if I told you there were worlds beyond these familiar foes? Worlds where unexpected guests make themselves home under your epidermis or deep within where blood flows and organs reside. ## **Uncommon Causes of Itching Explored** You know that feeling when your skin won’t stop itching?

## Why Does My Poop Smell Like Burnt Hair? Poop that smells of burnt hair, rubber, iron, or chemicals can indicate potential issues with your digestive system. While an unpleasant odor often is harmless and may be linked to the foods you’re eating, smelly poop can also be caused by bacterial infection, celiac disease, internal bleeding, and inflammatory bowel disease. Discover some common reasons for foul-smelling stools and why it’s a good idea to monitor your poop. ## **What the smell of your poop says about your health** The color, consistency, and smell of your stools can provide important information about the health of your digestive tract. Poop contains a range of volatile organic compounds (VOC), which are metabolic and microbial by-products such as methane, benzaldehyde, acetone, and sulfur gas that emit pungent smells, giving stool its distinct odor. The composition and concentrations of VOCs can provide valuable insight into your metabolic and digestive health. Different levels of VOCs have been found to indicate potential health issues, including [irritable bowel syndrome](https://www.drberg.com/blog/irritable-bowel-syndrome-tips), Crohn’s disease, or intestinal infection. In fact, research published in the _World Journal of Gastroenterology_ suggests, _“Patterns of fecal VOCs, and thus patterns of smell, can be used to identify disease states.”_&#x31; Here are six common poop smells and their potential causes. ### **1. Burnt hair** Stool with a foul odor reminiscent of burnt hair is typically linked to sulfur-containing VOCs. Consuming sulfur-containing foods such as garlic, onions, and cruciferous vegetables can raise concentrations of sulfur gas in the digestive tract, causing burnt hair poop smell. Burnt-match fecal odors are also common after consuming large amounts of sulfur-rich foods or may be caused by prescription drugs, including antibiotics, diuretics, and diabetes medications. There also is evidence that
