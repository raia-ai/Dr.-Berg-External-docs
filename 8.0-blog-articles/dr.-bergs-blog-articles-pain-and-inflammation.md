## Lower Uric Acid: How to Reduce It Naturally If _you_ have high levels of uric acid in your blood, you’re probably experiencing some pretty **painful** symptoms–may be even gout. You may be reading this in search of _much-needed_ relief that you haven’t been able to find. It’s time to do something about it, and **I can help.** It’s time to follow my tips on how to lower uric acid. **In this article:** 1. **Uric Acid: What is it and What Causes It?** 2. **My Tips to Lower Uric Acid** 3. **The Ultimate Remedy** ![Man getting out of bed and holding foot in pain. | 7 Tips to Lower Uric Acid](https://www.drberg.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/blog-7-tips-to-lower-uric-acid-1.jpg?w=800) \* \* \* ## **Uric Acid: What is it and What Causes It?** Uric acid is a byproduct of proteins, and it can leak into the joints **causing a lot of pain** or can lead to conditions like gout or kidney stones. Let’s break this down a little further. Uric acid is produced during the digestion process when the body breaks down _purines_. Purines are nitrogen-containing compounds that are made inside your cells or come from foods that contain purines–like meat and foods with high fructose corn syrup. Excess purines can cause increased levels of uric acid. If your body’s natural process is working _properly_, most uric acid will dissolve in the blood. Then, it will pass through the kidneys and leave the body through your urine. But, if too much uric acid stays in the body, this can cause **excruciating arthritis-like symptoms**, especially in the big toe, and in the lower part of the feet. If nothing is done to lower the uric acid levels, you may develop a condition called _hyperuricemia_. Hyperuricemia can then lead to serious and painful conditions like gout or kidney stones. Gout is a form of arthritis caused by high uric acid levels. Gout is known to be a very painful condition that typically affects the joint in the base of the big toe. Hyperuricemia
