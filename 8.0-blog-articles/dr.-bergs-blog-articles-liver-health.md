## Living Without a Gallbladder: Key Health Tips [Supporting digestive functions](https://www.drberg.com/blog/speed-up-digestion) is crucial to maintaining optimal health, particularly for those who have undergone [gallbladder removal](https://www.drberg.com/blog/what-they-dont-tell-you-when-they-remove-the-gallbladder) or are experiencing issues with their biliary tract. Discover the [importance of gallbladder function](https://www.drberg.com/blog/you-and-your-gallbladder) for digestion, hormone balance, and toxin elimination, and explore the impacts of gallbladder removal on cholesterol levels, thyroid health, and liver health. Also, learn some practical tips for adjusting your diet to promote healthy fat absorption while minimizing complications related to gallbladder removal. ## **Understanding Gallbladder Function** The gallbladder is a crucial digestive organ that assists in fat digestion, maintains cholesterol equilibrium, keeps hormones stable, lubricates the colon, and expels toxins from the body. A healthy gallbladder ensures optimal digestive health and regular bowel movements. It aids in maintaining the right cholesterol balance, essential for producing hormones such as estrogen, progesterone, and testosterone. ## **Gallbladder: Toxin Eliminator** \* **Toxin elimination:** The gallbladder concentrates bile, making it more effective at removing harmful substances from the body. \* **Colon lubrication:** Bile is a natural laxative that keeps the colon well-lubricated and prevents constipation. Understanding the gallbladder’s functions is crucial for maintaining overall health, especially if you experience issues like cholesterol stones, acute cholecystitis, or biliary tree problems. Seek medical advice immediately if you have concerns about your digestive health. ![Gallbladder illustration](https://www.drberg.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/human-gallbladder-anatomy-3d.jpg?w=800) ## **Consequences of Gallbladder Removal** When your gallbladder is removed due

## Thyroid Body Type: How to Balance It If you’ve tried to lose weight without any success, you may need to change your method! Focusing on the method that works for your specific body type is key. Find out how to get healthy and lose weight if you have a thyroid body type. ![Thyroid body types](https://www.drberg.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/thyroid-gland-inside-human-body-3d.jpg?w=800) ## **The five body types explained** There are five body types: adrenal, ovary, thyroid, liver, and pancreas. Each of these body types can be identified by your body shape, the location on your body where you gain weight, and your symptoms. You can also try my Body Type Quiz to identify your [specific body type](https://www.drberg.com/body-type-quiz)! ### **1. The thyroid body type** Proper thyroid function is critical for the function of every cell in your body. Thyroid body types can be identified by low levels of the thyroid hormones T4 and T3. If you have a thyroid body type, you may experience weight gain all over and not just in one specific area. A thyroid body type diet should be a little lower in protein because of a slower metabolism. Iodine is essential because it’s required for thyroid hormone production. Avoid cruciferous vegetables because they deplete iodine. Thyroid issues are often secondary issues resulting from [high levels of estrogen](https://www.drberg.com/blog/consequences-of-high-estrogen-in-men) or a poorly functioning liver. Eighty percent of thyroid hormone conversion occurs in the liver, so poor liver function greatly affects thyroid health. ### **2. The adrenal body type** The [adrenal body type](https://www.drberg.com/blog/adrenal-body-type-fix) involves an imbalance of the adrenal hormones and high levels of cortisol. If you notice that you’re gaining weight in the lower abdomen or have a sagging belly, then you’re likely an adrenal body type. The adrenal glands are stress glands–they react and adapt the body to stress. If you have the adrenal body

## Puffy Under Eyes Kidneys: What You Should Know Today, I will talk about how to get rid of those eye bags naturally and the connection of puffy eyes to your kidneys and blood sugar. **RELATED:** [**Is Potassium Good or Bad For Your Kidneys**](https://www.drberg.com/blog/is-potassium-good-or-bad-for-your-kidneys) In this article: 1. Kidney Problems 2. Blood Sugar ## **Knowing the Causes of Eye Bags** ### **1. Kidney Problems** I just want to let you know that cucumber slices don’t really work long term. Eye bags or under-eye circles are all about internal problems, specifically kidney problem. I see people on the streets, and they have baggy eyes. Anytime you have a kidney issue, you also have a liver problem. They are similar problems. You can’t have a really sick kidney and a healthy liver at the same time because they both work together. To know why you may develop kidney problems, here are several causes: ### Excessive Cooked Protein One contributor to kidney problem is when you consume too much cooked protein. Your kidney is a detoxifier, and it basically takes all your blood, like an oil filter, and filters it. So, here’s what happens with your kidneys. When you consume too much cooked protein, it will turn into excessive waste because your body cannot process any excess amount of protein. It primarily strains the kidneys and the liver. You only need 3-6 ounces of protein each meal. ### Lack of Vegetable Intake ![Vegetables washing, splashing water, fresh salad preparation | What Really Causes Puffy Eyes and Bags?](https://www.drberg.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/blog-what-really-causes-puffy-eyes-1.jpg?w=800) People with puffy eyes or bags under eyes usually eat too few vegetables. You might want to eat more veggies because they affect the level of potassium in the body. So, when you have just a normal amount of potassium in your body, that will flush out the sodium excess and get rid of fluid retention. We need four times as much

## Ascites vs Belly Fat: How to Tell the Difference A large and distended belly isn’t always caused by excessive fat deposits. Ascites is the accumulation of excess fluid in the abdominal cavity, and belly fat is caused by visceral and subcutaneous fat around abdominal organs and the abdominal wall. While both conditions lead to extended waistlines and weight gain, causes and treatment of excess abdominal fluid and visceral belly fat are distinctly different. Let’s look at the difference between ascites and belly fat and how to get rid of fluid in the abdomen. ![Male distended belly](https://www.drberg.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/fat-man-has-excess-he-dieting.jpg?w=800) ## **Ascites vs. belly fat** Ascites and belly fat are two different conditions that cause an enlarged and distended abdomen and increased body weight. Ascites can indicate serious liver disease, and it’s important to know how to spot the difference between abdominal fat and fluid accumulation. ### **What is ascites?** Ascites is a medical condition that typically develops due to liver disease and is characterized by excessive fluid accumulations in the peritoneal cavity, the space surrounding digestive organs and the liver. Chronic alcohol intake, liver infections, and hepatitis can cause cirrhosis and scarring of liver tissue. Because liver cells filter blood, liver scarring can lead to elevated blood pressure in abdominal blood vessels, which causes fluid to leak from the portal vein, the liver’s main blood supply, into the abdominal cavity. When fluid leaks from blood vessels, blood volume drops and signals a state of dehydration to the kidneys, causing water retention and more fluid accumulations, which worsens ascites. ### **What is belly fat?** Belly fat develops due to excessive fat deposits of two different types of fats within the abdomen. Visceral fat is linked to central obesity and accumulates around organs. Subcutaneous fat is the layer of fat between your skin and the abdominal wall.

## Dry Sauna Benefits: Heart, Detox & Stress Relief Dry saunas use heat, typically generated by electricity or wood burning, to create a dry and hot environment that promotes intense sweating. This form of heat therapy has been found to provide several potential health benefits, including increased circulation, better toxin elimination, and decreased inflammation and pain. Discover six incredible dry sauna benefits and learn how to safely and effectively integrate heat therapy into your routine. ## **What is a dry sauna?** Dry saunas, also known as Finnish-style saunas, generate dry heat, reaching temperatures between 180 and 195 degrees F (89 to 90 degrees C) while maintaining minimal humidity. Traditional saunas use a wood-burning stove to heat the room, which typically is wooden clad. However, modern versions include electric and infrared saunas, which generate heat using electricity and infrared light. Dry saunas are often confused with steam rooms, but they differ significantly. Steam rooms, or steam saunas, are heated to lower temperatures, typically around 100 to 120 degrees F (37 to 48 degrees C), and generate high humidity, unlike the dry heat found in saunas. Watch the video below to learn more about the health benefits of using a dry sauna.When combined with a healthy lifestyle, regular sauna use is associated with various impressive advantages for physical, mental, and emotional health. Here are six benefits of dry sauna bathing. ### **1. Supports detoxification** The body has various detoxification pathways, including the liver, lungs, kidneys, digestive tract, lymphatic system, and skin. Sauna-induced sweating stimulates lymphatic flow and supports the detoxification of toxins, pathogens, metabolic by-products, excess fluid, carbon dioxide, and other impurities. ### **2.

## Top Health Benefits of Baking Soda Revealed The Dangers and Benefits of Baking Soda It was a blistering summer day when I first discovered the surprising versatility of baking soda. With only its humble white grains, I found relief from a sunburn that left me squirming like an ant under a magnifying glass. But that’s just scratching the surface… Baking soda is more than just your kitchen helper or skin soother. It has quite a reputation in our bodies, aiding digestion and even playing roles we still uncover today!

This got me thinking: what if there are benefits to this common household item we’ve yet to discover? And conversely, could overuse lead us down dangerous paths? Join me as we dive deep into the intriguing world of baking soda. Let’s explore this together. ## **Understanding Baking Soda’s Role in Digestion** [Baking soda](https://www.drberg.com/blog/7-unexpected-benefits-of-baking-soda) , known scientifically as sodium bicarbonate, is crucial to digestion. Your body naturally produces it, which is vital for proper digestive function. ### **The Production and Function of Baking Soda in the Body** Your pancreas works overtime to produce baking soda, which gets delivered into the small intestine through bile ducts. This isn’t just an exercise; it has a crucial purpose. Sodium bicarbonate neutralizes stomach acid, allowing for smooth digestion. Recent studies have confirmed this essential role. ### **The Impact of Baking Soda on Enzyme Activation** Did you know that [enzymes](https://www.drberg.com/blog/what-are-enzymes) are like workers at a construction site?

## LDL Cholesterol Explained: The Good and the Bad A while ago I realized that so-called bad cholesterol, LDL, is neither cholesterol nor bad for you. I can almost hear you thinking: _“Dr. Berg, are you nuts? Everyone says LDL cholesterol is bad!”_ Allow me to explain. LDL (low density lipoprotein) isn’t actually cholesterol. Rather, it’s a transport mechanism for shuttling cholesterol to the places in your body that need sufficient cholesterol levels to be healthy. The reason cholesterol needs to be transported is because it’s what’s called hydrophobic – on its own it doesn’t mix well with the watery environment in your body. But it’s got to get to your cells intact somehow, right? That’s where lipoprotein comes in. Though LDL is characterized as “bad”, in truth it’s an essential carrier of cholesterol from the liver through your vascular system to your cells. Besides LDL, you also have the so-called good cholesterol HDL (high density lipoprotein). HDL cholesterol, too, is a carrier of cholesterol. It’s journey is the reverse of LDL; that is, it carries cholesterol from your vascular system to your liver. In addition to cholesterol, lipoproteins also carry triglycerides, which are blood fats. [Understanding your body](https://www.drberg.com/body-type-quiz) is important. You can see how LDL and HDL are simply exchangers: they shuttle fats, including cholesterol, back and forth in your body. Nothing inherently good or bad about them. **In this article:** 1. **Your Body Needs A Lot Of Cholesterol** 2. **The Most Important Information About LDL To Know** 3. **The Simplest Way To Gauge How Much Of Each Type Of LDL You Have** 4. **How Did Your Type B LDL Level Get High In The First Place?** 5. **You Can Help Yourself By Understanding LDL Cholesterol** ## **Your Body Needs A Lot Of Cholesterol** !\[a drawing of a doctor in a white coat holding a sign saying

## Pale Colored Stool: Critical Health Clues to Know ## **Pale-Colored Stool Causes: Dietary Solutions and Prevention** When understanding pale-colored stool causes, one must delve into the intricate workings of our digestive system. The color of your stool is a crucial indicator of your overall digestive health and can signal potential issues within your gastrointestinal tract. Learn about conditions such as liver disease or celiac disease that might disrupt this chain reaction, leading to pale stools. This disruption often results in high bilirubin levels, which can cause clay-colored stools and dark urine. Discuss symptoms like yellow skin or abdominal pain that could indicate possible liver damage or blockage in bile ducts, causing light-colored stools. Understand dietary solutions and how they deal with pale-colored stool causes and can improve digestive health. ## **Breaking Down Hemoglobin: A Colorful Process** Hemoglobin breakdown is a complex process involving multiple organs and stages. Blood cells break down, and iron and heme separate. Heme then travels to the liver, transforming into biliverdin, giving our stools a distinct green color. ![Blood cell cluster](https://www.drberg.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/abstract-red-blood-cells-clot-shape.jpg?w=800) ### **The Role of Heme in Blood Cell Breakdown** Heme is crucial in maintaining normal body functions, including digestion and waste elimination. In the liver, enzymes help heme transform into biliverdin, an essential step. ### **Transformation of Heme to Biliverdin** [Liver enzymes](https://www.drberg.com/blog/high-liver-enzymes-what-do-they-mean) help heme transform into biliverdin, which is crucial for maintaining normal body functions. ### **Excretion Process Involving Bile** Bilirubin gets excreted from the liver into the small intestine with bile’s assistance for eventual elimination through stool. Stool color can indicate whether your digestive system is functioning optimally or not. A \[healthy

## Energy, Weight Loss, and More If you drink coffee regularly, you’re likely familiar with its energizing effects, but the benefits of black coffee go far beyond a morning boost. Benefits of black coffee are numerous. Coffee is a rich source of health-promoting polyphenols and antioxidants, and drinking organic black coffee in moderation may even prolong your life. Discover the health benefits of drinking black coffee, how much you should consume, and how to choose the highest-quality brew for your well-being. ## **Is coffee healthy?** Coffee beans are actually the seeds of _Coffea_ plant berries. Like other seeds, coffee beans are incredibly nutritious and rich in health-promoting polyphenols, including ferulic acid and chlorogenic acid. 1Research published in _The_ _BMJ_ found that drinking as much as three to four cups of coffee per day may be linked to a lower risk of all-cause mortality, cardiovascular disease, several cancers, and metabolic and liver conditions. Coffee also contains caffeic acid and [caffeine](https://www.drberg.com/blog/tags/caffeine), two unrelated bioactive plant compounds that support brain function and a healthy central nervous system. While black coffee appears safe and potentially beneficial for most adults, choosing organically grown coffee is critical. Non-organic coffee is one of the most chemically treated crops and often contains synthetic pesticide residues that can end up in your daily cup of joe. Pesticide ingestion can lead to adverse health implications, including hormonal imbalances, impaired liver health, and increased cancer risk. Organically grown coffee is rich in health-promoting polyphenols and is free of harmful contaminants and pesticide residues.

## Can Probiotics Affect Your Menstrual Cycle? Probiotics promote a healthy intestinal microflora, which is crucial in female health, but can probiotics affect your menstrual cycle? Yes, probiotics can impact the menstrual cycle. Intestinal microbes help support microbial diversity, which plays a role in regulating hormonal balance and menstrual wellness. Learn how maintaining a healthy microbiome with probiotics can help support hormonal balance and promote healthy menstrual cycles. ## **The connection between gut health and menstrual health** The composition of your intestinal microbiota can profoundly influence the regulation and metabolism of sex hormones involved in menstrual health, such as estrogen, progesterone, and testosterone. Estrogen is a crucial hormone that regulates menstrual cycles, [reproductive health](https://www.drberg.com/blog/turmeric-and-ginger-benefits-sexually), and bone metabolism. The ovaries produce most of the body’s estrogen, which circulates through the bloodstream before eventually being inactivated and detoxified by the liver and released into the large intestines for excretion. Certain gut bacteria influence hormonal balance by producing beta-glucuronidase, an enzyme that converts inactive estrogen into its active form, which is readily reabsorbed into the body. Research published in _Gut Microbes_ explored the relationship between gut bacteria and estrogen metabolism, suggesting that gut microbiota composition may influence how estrogen is processed in the body.1 Changes in normal estrogen levels can influence menstrual patterns, weight, and mood, emphasizing the importance of hormone balance for supporting overall health and well-being. In addition, beneficial gut bacteria produce compounds that interact with the nervous system and may support mood balance and stress resilience throughout the menstrual cycle. Watch the video below to learn how hormonal changes can affect female health.

## What Is the Best Heavy Metal Detox? Heavy metal accumulation in the body can lead to heavy metal toxicity, associated with cellular damage, inflammation, impaired nervous system function, and cardiovascular disease. Discover the best heavy metal detox diet and learn what steps you can take to minimize heavy metal exposure. ![Toxic metals blood test](https://www.drberg.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/toxic-metals-test.jpg?w=800) ## **What are heavy metals?** While certain heavy metals, such as iron, zinc, and copper, are essential for a wide range of physiological functions, others can have detrimental health consequences. Here are common environmental metals linked to adverse health effects: \* Lead \* Mercury \* Cadmium \* Arsenic Excessive or long-term exposure to these toxic metals can lead to a buildup of [heavy metals](https://www.drberg.com/blog/4-skin-signs-that-reveal-heavy-metal-toxicity) in the body, a process known as bioaccumulation. _“While a healthy liver can detoxify some environmental pollutants and metals, its natural capacity to eliminate heavy metals is limited,”_ explains Dr. Berg. _“This can lead to a gradual increase in cellular heavy metal concentrations and may cause toxicity in some cases.”_ In addition, individuals with impaired liver function due to [fatty liver disease](https://www.drberg.com/blog/always-use-probiotics-for-a-fatty-liver), poor dietary habits, or regular alcohol consumption are at increased risk of heavy metal buildup. Agricultural and industrial processes, chemical and electronic manufacturing, waste incineration, and engine combustion are significant contributors to heavy-metal-contaminated air, water, and soil, which exposes the general population to these harmful metals.

## The Best Natural Alternatives to Ozempic Ozempic is a popular weight-loss medication that helps curb appetite and induces various metabolic changes linked to improved weight management. However, this injectable medication is costly, and its long-term use may lead to serious health issues, including thyroid cancer, muscle mass loss, and kidney damage. Discover natural alternatives to Ozempic and learn how to make beneficial dietary changes to achieve and maintain a healthy body weight without needing pharmaceutical drugs. ## **What is Ozempic?** Ozempic is an injectable semaglutide drug that has been developed to manage blood sugar levels and improve insulin sensitivity in individuals with type 2 diabetes and insulin resistance. Semaglutide works primarily by acting as a glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonist, meaning it mimics the effects of GLP-1 in the body. GLP-1 is a crucial hormone that regulates various digestive and metabolic processes linked to a healthy body weight, which explains why Ozempic can have profound weight loss benefits. Ozempic can enhance insulin secretion, help regulate blood sugar levels, suppress appetite, slow digestion, and inhibit the release of glucose from the liver. In combination, these effects support overall blood sugar management, which is crucial for treating diabetes, achieving weight loss, and promoting metabolic balance. Due to effective marketing campaigns and increasing awareness of Ozempic’s weight management benefits, it has become a popular weight loss drug in recent years. According to data published by UCLA Health, the use of semaglutide drugs such as Ozempic has risen 40-fold over the last five years.1 Ozempic may seem like a miracle drug to end the obesity epidemic and associated health issues. However, both its short-term and long-term use have been linked to serious side effects and potential health concerns. Watch the video below to discover natural Ozempic

They have been found to promote healthy blood vessels, and evidence suggests that drinking hibiscus tea may help lower blood pressure naturally. Discover the health benefits of hibiscus and learn how to make hibiscus tea for high blood pressure. ## **What is hibiscus tea?** Hibiscus tea is typically made from dried flowers of the hibiscus plant, also known as _Hibiscus sabdariffa_. Hibiscus plants are native to tropical and subtropical climates, and their trumpet-shaped flowers are used for culinary and medicinal purposes in many parts of the world. Hibiscus tea is known for its vibrant red color and refreshing taste. It has long been known to promote cardiovascular health and improve liver function.

Hibiscus tea is a rich source of flavonoids and anthocyanins. These potent antioxidants are believed to stimulate the production of nitric oxide, a gaseous compound that helps relax and widen blood vessels. _“Relaxed blood vessels improve blood flow and lower resistance in the arteries,”_ explains Dr. Berg. _“This ultimately lowers blood pressure and promotes cardiovascular health.”_ In fact, research published in the _Journal of Nutrition_ found that mildly hypertensive adults who drank eight ounces (240 ml) of hibiscus tea three times per day for six weeks significantly lowered systolic and diastolic blood pressure.1 While further research is needed

## Pregnenolone Benefits for Brain and Hormones You’re probably here because you’ve heard of pregnenolone and its potential to boost energy and hormone health naturally. Perhaps you’re feeling the effects of aging, stress, or hormonal imbalances. Maybe you’re even seeking more natural ways to regain your vitality. In this comprehensive guide, we’ll explore pregnenolone and its multifaceted roles within the body. We’ll provide you with practical, actionable steps to naturally enhance its production. Let’s reclaim your hormonal harmony. ## **What is Pregnenolone?** Pregnenolone, often referred to as the “mother hormone,” is a naturally occurring steroid hormone. It’s primarily produced in the adrenal glands, with smaller amounts synthesized in the brain, liver, and skin. It serves as the crucial precursor to vital hormones. These hormones play a role in several body systems, including progesterone levels, DHEA, [testosterone](https://www.drberg.com/blog/7-ways-to-boost-testosterone), [estrogen](https://www.drberg.com/blog/estrogen-the-good-the-bad-and-the-ugly), and [cortisol](https://www.drberg.com/blog/cortisol-extremely-simplified-by-dr-berg) levels. ## **The Significance of Pregnenolone** Pregnenolone plays a pivotal role in maintaining overall well-being. It influences various bodily functions. This hormone precursor impacts everything from your mental health to your libido. \* Hormone Balance \* Energy Production \* Stress Response \* Cognitive Function \* Mood Regulation \* Immune Health \* Libido ![Human brain illustration](https://www.drberg.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/concept-human-intelligence-brain-on-blue-0.jpg?w=800) ## **Signs and Symptoms of Low Pregnenolone** Recognizing the signs of low pregnenolone is the first step toward addressing potential imbalances.

## Lemon Water for Fatty Liver Detox & Health Boost A fatty liver causes metabolic imbalances and inflammation and can develop into chronic liver disease, cirrhosis, or liver cancer. Taking apple cider vinegar (ACV) and lemon water may help reduce liver fat, protect liver cells from oxidative damage, and improve liver function. Discover how a daily glass of fresh lemon juice mixed with ACV and water can support your liver health. ## **What is fatty liver disease?** Fatty liver disease is characterized by excessive fat accumulation in the liver, which impairs normal liver function and can cause serious metabolic and hormonal imbalances, weight gain, and inflammation. If left untreated, fatty liver can result in liver cirrhosis and hepatic steatosis, a serious liver disease linked to liver failure. Alcoholic fatty liver disease is caused by chronic alcohol abuse, leading to liver cell damage, inflammation, and excessive liver fat accumulation. Alcohol-induced fatty liver disease greatly increases the risk of liver cancer and cirrhosis. Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is linked to dietary and lifestyle factors, and having a metabolic disorder, including obesity, [insulin resistance](https://www.drberg.com/blog/insulin-resistance), and type 2 diabetes, greatly increases the risk of developing fatty liver disease. Although it may sound counterintuitive, a fatty liver isn’t caused by dietary fats. Research published in _HepatoBiliary Surgery and Nutrition_ suggests that a high-carb diet causes metabolic imbalances that stimulate the accumulation of liver fat.1 The authors of another study published in _HepatoBiliary Surgery and Nutrition_ conclude, _“Ingested carbohydrates are a major stimulus for hepatic de novo lipogenesis and are more likely to directly contribute to NAFLD than dietary fat.”_&#x32; Regular carb and sugar intake can cause your cells to become less sensitive to insulin,

## No Sugar for 2 Weeks Weight Loss Results Have you ever wondered what happens when you stop eating sugar completely for two weeks? Let me discuss that here so you have a better idea of what that process does to your body. Read on to find out more. **RELATED:** [**How High Blood Glucose Levels Destroy 4 Organs**](https://www.drberg.com/blog/how-high-blood-glucose-levels-destroy-4-organs) In this article: 1. Loss of Appetite for Sugar 2. Decreased Hunger 3. Less Fatigue 4. Loss of Excess Water and Fat 5. Mood Boost 6. Improved Skin Health 7. Less Body Stiffness 8. Promotion of Brain Cell Growth 9. Liver Cleansing 10. Better Kidney Function ## **What Happens When You Stop Eating Sugar: Things to Know** ### **1. Loss of Appetite for Sugar** The first thing that will happen is you’re going to lose your appetite for sugar when you completely stop taking sugar for two weeks. Why? This is because every time there is sugar consumption, a hormone activates and pushes your blood sugar down, causing a low blood sugar situation ([hypoglycemia](https://www.drberg.com/blog/food-that-fixes-hypoglycemia) to some degree). This causes you to crave sugar, but by getting rid of sugar from your diet, you get rid of the sugar cravings, too. **Hypoglycemia Definition:** A condition caused by very low levels of blood glucose or sugar, which is common in diabetic people. ### **2. Decreased Hunger** You are going to be less hungry when you stop eating sugar. Until you complete two weeks without sugar, you won’t really know that sugar keeps you hungry all the time. When you give up on sugar, you become a lot less hungry. Why? It’s because you stabilize your blood sugar levels. When you are living off of sugar, the body starts rejecting it because sugar is toxic to the body. That’s called Fat Storing Hormone resistance. Your body is blocking Fat Storing Hormone because that controls sugar, and
