They can, however, cause you pain and discomfort if left untreated. Many women have ovarian cysts at some time in their lives. The majority disappears without treatment within a few months. But if [ovarian cysts rupture](https://www.urmc.rochester.edu/encyclopedia/content.aspx?contenttypeid=135\&contentid=346), they can cause serious symptoms such as: \* Sudden, severe abdominal or pelvic pain \* Pain with fever or vomiting If you have these signs and symptoms, or those of shock – cold, clammy skin; rapid breathing; and lightheadedness or weakness – immediately seek medical help. ![diagram of ovaries with cysts](https://www.drberg.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/blog-fix-ovarian-cysts-and-fibrocystic-breast-with-one-mineral-1.jpg?w=800) \* \* \* As for [fibrocystic breasts](https://www.medicinenet.com/fibrocystic_breast_condition/article.htm#what_are_fibrocystic_breasts), they aren’t cancerous, but they can cause your breasts to be lumpy, tender, and painful.

## Gallbladder Symptoms: What You Need to Know Every year, 20 million people are diagnosed with gallbladder problems. Of those 20 million, about half will have their gallbladder removed as a part of their treatment plan. Given some of the symptoms of gallbladder trouble, it’s understandable why people would be moved to extreme measures in an attempt to correct the problem, but often, removal of the gallbladder won’t fix the problem. Changes in diet may provide relief for many people with gallbladder symptoms, including problems that won’t be corrected by removal. \* \* \* ## **But what does the gallbladder do?** The gallbladder, unlike other parts of the digestive system, does not produce or digest anything. The gallbladder serves as a holding tank for bile made by the liver. Bile breaks fats down into fatty acids and fat-soluble vitamins A, E, D, and K, and is dispensed into the intestines by bile ducts on the side of the gallbladder. Because bile is made in one place (the liver) and used in another (the intestines), it is routed through the gallbladder. Bile serves many purposes in the body, but the major ones to remember are the digestion of fat, and the regulation of cholesterol. \* \* \* ## **What are the most common problems with the gallbladder?** Most people have heard of gallstones, and understand them to be painful, potentially dangerous, and extremely disruptive to one’s digestion. Gallstones are certainly one of the better known gallbladder ailments, and they are generally caused by a lack of bile. A gallstone can obstruct the bile duct and prevent bile from reaching the intestines, causing difficulty digesting fat and fat-soluble vitamins, as well as the possibility of infections in the blocked gallbladder. The gallbladder’s bile duct can become irritated by gallstones or fat buildup, and this can in turn irritate the phrenic nerve. Phrenic nerve irritation most often causes pain in the right shoulder and right side of the neck, but the severity and reach of

## Causes of Hair Loss: Why You’re Losing Hair Unraveling the mystery of hair thinning uncovers a tangled web of causes, ranging from hormonal fluctuations to nutritional impacts. It’s not just about what’s happening in your head but also what’s happening inside your body. Embarking on this exploration of hair diminishment, we’ll delve into the roles thyroid malfunctions and elevated estrogen quantities contribute to the scenario. But that’s only scratching the surface. Your plate matters, too–sugar spikes and soy proteins could be culprits in disguise. Stress isn’t just an emotional burden; it physically manifests by disrupting hormone levels, leading to noticeable hair changes. And if you thought all was lost when genetics or autoimmune conditions entered the fray. We’re diving deep into lifestyle shifts and nutritional tweaks that can turn the tide against alopecia. Ready for a transformative look at tackling hair loss? Let’s get started. ## **Understanding the Roots of Hair Loss** [Hair loss](https://www.drberg.com/blog/the-most-common-cause-of-hair-loss) can feel like a mystery wrapped in an enigma, but when you break it down, hormones and diet often play leading roles. This doesn’t just affect your scalp; it’s about what’s happening inside your body. ### **Thyroid Problems and Hair Thinning** If your hair gets thinner by the day, your thyroid might throw a wrench into things. [Thyroid](https://www.drberg.com/blog/important-thyroid-tips) issues can make your hair brittle and weak–think of it as if it is on a hunger strike because it’s not getting the nutrients it needs from blood flow affected by poor thyroid function. Improving liver health boosts bile production, which helps normalize thyroid functions, offering hope for those locks. Exploring dietary adjustments to enhance liver wellness presents an alternative avenue for bolstering the management of thyroid-related complications. ### **The Impact of High Estrogen Levels** You might not think about estrogen

## Can You Use Apple Cider Vinegar for Acid Reflux? Many people reach for acid blockers to alleviate heartburn symptoms. However, this approach may not target the root cause and could worsen the issue. Contrary to popular belief, acid reflux is often linked to low stomach acid rather than too much. Insufficient stomach acid slows digestion and can cause digestive fluids to back up into the esophagus, causing an uncomfortable burning sensation. Explore the potential benefits of apple cider vinegar for acid reflux and explore natural ways to relieve heartburn and support better digestion. ## **What is apple cider vinegar?** Raw apple cider vinegar is an unfiltered vinegar made from fermented apples, where natural yeasts and bacteria transform the apples’ sugars into acetic acid. This process results in a living vinegar that contains enzymes and beneficial bacteria, often referred to as the mother. These components may help support digestion and contribute to a healthy stomach environment. Watch the video below to discover the causes of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD).## **Should you try apple cider vinegar?** Vinegar has been used for centuries, with records dating back to ancient Greece. Hippocrates, known as the father of modern medicine, reportedly used vinegar to support general wellness and digestive comfort. Today, research continues to investigate the potential of [apple cider vinegar](https://www.drberg.com/blog/use-apple-cider-vinegar-for-muscle-cramps) to support healthy digestion, nutrient absorption, metabolic balance, and gut health. Here are five potential health benefits of taking raw apple cider vinegar. ### **1. Supports stomach acidity** A low stomach pH is crucial for effective digestion and digestive comfort. When stomach acid becomes weak or too alkaline, it may not signal the lower esophageal sphincter, a valve separating the esophagus

## Diabetic Stomach: Signs, Causes, and Solutions Diabetic stomach symptoms, such as abdominal pain, acid reflux, and bloating, are common complications of diabetes, often related to nerve damage caused by chronically elevated blood glucose levels. Find out what triggers diabetic digestive problems and learn how to manage gastrointestinal discomfort effectively with beneficial dietary and lifestyle changes. ## **Can diabetes affect the gut?** Diabetes mellitus, widely known as type 2 diabetes, profoundly affects gut health and may contribute to a wide range of intestinal issues. Diabetes causes chronically elevated blood sugar levels that can damage the vagus nerve, which is key to regulating the function and motility of the gastrointestinal tract. This damage, known as diabetic autonomic neuropathy, disrupts the normal coordination of stomach muscles. As a result, the stomach empties far more slowly than it should, which is a condition called delayed gastric emptying, or gastroparesis. This dysfunction leads to various uncomfortable symptoms, such as persistent nausea, [bloating](https://www.drberg.com/blog/abdominal-gas-and-bloating-do-this-now), and vomiting, as well as erratic blood sugar levels, as food absorption becomes unpredictable. Diabetes-related gut issues can affect the entire gastrointestinal tract, including the stomach, small intestines, and large bowel, causing various digestive problems. These issues can significantly impact quality of life and complicate blood sugar management, as impaired digestion interferes with nutrient absorption and blood glucose regulation. Data published by the American Diabetes Association (ADA) reveals that gastroparesis is a relatively common complication of diabetes, particularly among individuals who have been living with the condition for over a decade.1 Watch the video below to learn how to manage diabetes-related digestive symptoms.

## Eye Twitching: Causes, Solutions, and Prevention Eye twitching refers to the involuntary muscle spasms of your eyelid muscles in the absence of eye irritation or any type of eye injury. An eyelid spasm typically occurs for no clear reason and doesn’t cause pain, but it can be a nuisance. Find out about the common causes of eye twitching and learn how to stop and prevent twitching naturally. ## **What causes eyelid twitching?** Eyelid twitches or eyelid spasms, also known as tetany, usually occur in your left upper eyelid but can also develop in your right eye. Occasionally, tetany occurs on the arm, nose, or even the lip. According to research published in _Case Reports_, harmless eye twitching that typically affects the lower eyelid is known as eyelid myokymia.1 Eye twitching is often caused by a mineral deficiency affecting the facial nerve. Hypocalcemia, or low calcium, is one of the most common causes of eye twitching. [Calcium deficiency](https://www.drberg.com/blog/best-sources-of-calcium) is typically linked to poor dietary habits, high phosphorus levels, or low parathyroid hormone production. Alkalosis can also cause hypocalcemia. Normal blood pH should be between 7.35 and 7.45. When your blood pH rises higher than this, it’s known as alkalosis. In a state of alkalosis, the calcium in your blood is no longer free and binds with the proteins in your blood called albumin. This essentially blocks calcium from being absorbed. Several factors can contribute to alkalosis, including: \* Diuretic use \* Excessive antacid consumption \* Vomiting or diarrhea \* [Chronic stress](https://www.drberg.com/blog/how-to-lower-cortisol) \* Low potassium levels \* Low stomach acid Lastly, hypomagnesemia or low magnesium levels may also cause eye twitching, as magnesium plays a crucial role in nerve function and muscle contractions. !\[ACV for eyelid

## What Is Creatine and Should You Take It? You’ve likely heard of creatine, especially within the health and wellness community, but what is creatine? Creatine is a popular supplement among athletes and fitness enthusiasts as it can help build muscle mass and improve endurance. However, its benefits extend beyond the gym. Let’s look at the health benefits of creatine and understand important considerations for its use. ## **What is creatine?** Creatine is a naturally occurring compound that is found in small amounts in certain foods and can be synthesized by the human body. It’s composed of three amino acids: arginine, glycine, and methionine. The majority of creatine is stored in skeletal muscle cells, with smaller amounts found in the brain and other body tissues. _“Creatine is essential for energy metabolism, particularly in muscle cells, especially during high-intensity, short-duration activities. It’s a key component of the phosphocreatine system, allowing you to recycle or recover adenosine triphosphate (ATP), the body’s main energy currency,”_ Dr. Berg explains. Watch the video below to learn more about creatine and how it can benefit your health.## **How does creatine affect muscle growth?** Creatine enhances muscle growth primarily through its role in ATP regeneration. During intense exercise, ATP is broken down into adenosine diphosphate (ADP) and inorganic phosphate (Pi), releasing energy necessary for muscle contractions. As ATP levels drop, muscle performance and endurance diminish. Stored in muscle cells as creatine phosphate, creatine donates its phosphate group to ADP, rapidly regenerating ATP. This quick replenishment of ATP promotes a steady energy supply, allowing muscles to sustain high-intensity exercise for longer periods. Creatine can help increase training intensity and volume by maintaining higher energy levels during workouts, which is

## Vitamin D3: Health Benefits, Sources, Dosage, & Risks Vitamin D deficiency affects almost half of all U.S. adults, and vitamin D supplementation is a convenient and safe way to promote healthy vitamin D status. Vitamin D3, also known as cholecalciferol, is a potent form of vitamin D that’s easily absorbed, highly effective at raising vitamin D levels, and linked to minimal side effects. Let’s look at the incredible health benefits of vitamin D3 and learn why supplemental vitamin D should always be combined with vitamin K2. ![Hand holding a vitamin D capsule](https://www.drberg.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/young-woman-holding-vitamin-d-capsule-13.jpg?w=800) ## **What is vitamin D3?** Vitamin D is produced when the skin is exposed to sunlight, which explains why it’s commonly referred to as the sunshine vitamin. Sunlight contains ultraviolet B (UVB) radiation that can penetrate the skin and trigger biochemical reactions that convert previtamin D into active vitamin D3. How much vitamin D is produced in response to sun exposure depends on many factors. Older individuals and those with darker skin pigmentation may not generate enough vitamin D even if exposed to adequate sunlight, leaving the elderly and people with darker skin tones at risk of [vitamin D deficiency](https://www.drberg.com/blog/the-real-reason-for-a-vitamin-d-deficiency). _“Vitamin D3 is a fat-soluble vitamin that’s primarily stored in fat cells and the liver,”_ explains Dr. Berg. _“While the body tends to store enough vitamin D to compensate for short periods without UVB radiation, limited sun exposure for prolonged time will lead to vitamin D insufficiency.”_ Watch the video below to learn how much vitamin D you need to maintain a healthy body. ## **How is vitamin D3 different from vitamin D2?** Vitamin D naturally occurs as vitamin D2, also known as ergocalciferol, and vitamin D3, or cholecalciferol. While vitamin D3 is produced in response to sunlight and can be found in a few food sources,

## Sodium Potassium Ratio Explained & Optimized Today we’re going to talk about potassium and your sodium-to-potassium ratio. I don’t know if you knew this, but the prehistoric diet was very high in potassium and low in sodium. This is actually much healthier for the human body than the average current sodium-to-potassium ratios. Here’s what you need to know. In this article: – \* **Our Current Potassium Intake Is Low** \* **Ratios: More Important Than Quantity** \* **Understanding Potassium Deficiency** \* **Why Isn’t Potassium Deficiency Often Diagnosed?** \* **How Do You Become Potassium Deficient?** ## **Our Current Potassium Intake Is Low** ![raise potassium levels with 7-10 cups of veggies and salad](https://www.drberg.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/blog-your-potassium-sodium-ratio-should-be-4-to-1-1.jpg?w=800) \* \* \* Currently, an average male consumes about 3026 milligrams of potassium per day, while an average female consumes about 2290 milligrams. This is lower than current standards: the recommended amount is 4700 milligrams – so our potassium intake is at least 1000 milligrams lower than it should be. Now, there’s limited data on this, but some data shows that prehistoric levels of potassium – in the Paleolithic era – ranged between 7000 and 15000 milligrams per day. They were getting their potassium through greens, tubers, and roots. That’s a lot of potassium, and it was probably a good thing that they were getting so much. Why? Our bodies need a lot of potassium for many reasons. First, each cell has a sodium-potassium pump. It uses a lot of those minerals to create energy and move things around in the body. Also, potassium can help: \* Manage [how much water](https://www.drberg.com/blog/the-drink-8-glasses-of-water-per-day-lie) you have in your body and help maintain your body’s electrical system \* Move nutrients into your cells and remove waste \* Counter the effects of sodium, which can help blood

## Orange Egg Yolk Meaning and Nutrition Facts Yellow vs. orange egg yolk–which is better? Egg yolk colors can range from a pale yellow to a deep reddish-orange, and darker yolks can indicate a richer nutrient profile. However, yolk color can be deceptive, as many conventional farmers use dyes to appeal to consumer preferences. Discover what influences egg yolk color and how to choose high-quality eggs with the best nutritional value. ## **Yellow vs. orange egg yolks** Like eggshells, egg yolks naturally occur in various colors, including pale yellow, golden, or red-hued orange. But what do egg yolk colors mean, and what factors determine the color of an egg yolk? Here’s a comparison of yellow and orange egg yolks. ### **Yellow egg yolk** Egg yolk color is determined by the food a hen consumes. Pale yellow egg yolks are typically found in eggs laid by chickens primarily fed wheat, while yellow yolks come from hens fed corn and soy. [Eggs](https://www.drberg.com/blog/eat-steak-and-eggs-to-boost-testosterone) with yellow yolks are more likely to be factory-farmed, referring to chickens raised in cages or overcrowded barns with minimal or no exposure to sunlight or the outdoors. ### **Orange egg yolk** Golden, orange, or reddish-orange egg yolks are usually produced by hens feeding on forage containing carotenoids, natural pigments responsible for the yolks’ vibrant color. These natural dyes give plants a dark green, yellow, or orange hue and can be found in various grasses, weeds, and seeds. Carotenoids are also present in insects such as leafhoppers, beetles, and wax worms. Yolks with a deeper color are typically synonymous with healthier eggs laid by free-range hens or those with access to outdoor spaces and a natural diet. For this reason, consumers often demand darker-colored yolks. This has caused many commercial farmers to add artificial or natural dyes, such as paprika or marigolds, to their hens’ feed to drive sales. Watch the video below to learn more about

## Sodium Myth: The Truth About Salt and Health Salt – the ultimate flavor enhancer or a silent killer? It’s a question that’s been debated for decades. I used to be convinced that sodium was the enemy, the villain lurking in every shaker and processed snack. And yet, there I was, taking a closer look and starting to doubt the usual beliefs everyone clung onto. What I discovered shocked me. Turns out, the story of sodium isn’t as simple as we’ve been led to believe. It’s not all doom and gloom, and cutting salt out completely might do more harm than good. Ready to have your mind blown? Breaking it down – here’s what you need to know about sodium and staying healthy. ## **Debunking Sodium Myths** When it comes to sodium intake and its impact on health, there’s a lot of misinformation out there. It’s time to set the record straight and explore the essential role sodium plays in our bodies. Sodium has gotten a bad rap over the years, but the truth is, it’s crucial for maintaining optimal health. Let’s dive into the misconceptions surrounding this misunderstood mineral. ### **The Essential Role of Sodium** [Sodium is a vital electrolyte](https://www.drberg.com/blog/what-does-an-electrolyte-do) that our bodies need to function properly. It helps regulate fluid balance, transmit nerve impulses, and plays a key role in muscle contractions, including the beating of our hearts. Without enough sodium, our bodies would struggle to maintain healthy blood pressure levels and keep our organs functioning optimally. So, while it’s important not to overdo it on the salt shaker, cutting out sodium entirely is not the answer. ### **The Misinterpreted Dash Sodium Study** You may have heard about the famous Dash Sodium Study, which suggested a link between high sodium intake and increased blood pressure. However, what often gets overlooked is that participants in the study also significantly reduced their sugar consumption. This means that the lower blood pressure observed in the study

## Vitamin C: What Works Best and What to Avoid Vitamin C is one of the three primary antioxidant nutrients, along with vitamins A and E. This essential water-soluble vitamin is abundant in many fruits and vegetables and is linked to improved cardiovascular outcomes, strong immune defenses, and more effective wound healing. Discover the essentials of vitamin C, from its functions and deficiency signs to its richest natural sources, and learn how to maintain optimal vitamin C levels. Ascorbic acid, widely known as vitamin C, is an essential water-soluble vitamin. This means it must be obtained from dietary sources, as the body cannot produce or store it in significant amounts. Vitamin C is a critical nutrient needed to support several biological functions, including immune system functions and tissue repair, which explains why meeting the recommended dietary intake is vital. Watch the video below to explore the importance of vitamin C for immune functions.## **Vitamin C functions** Vitamin C is a potent antioxidant vitamin that strengthens the immune system, protects against disease, and helps defend cells from damage. [Antioxidants](https://www.drberg.com/blog/what-is-an-antioxidant) are compounds that help neutralize free radicals. These harmful metabolic by-products can cause inflammation and oxidative stress and are linked to the development of chronic diseases, such as cancer and cardiometabolic conditions. Additionally, Vitamin C plays a vital role in antioxidant regeneration. During this process, vitamin C donates an electron to oxidized antioxidants, converting them back into their active form. This process prevents oxidized antioxidants from becoming free radicals themselves, allowing them to continue protecting against oxidative stress. Vitamin C is also essential for regulating regenerative pathways, including wound healing and tissue repair, helping

## Zinc Toxicity: Essential Facts You Should Know Zinc is an essential mineral needed for various bodily functions, including immune system regulation, hormonal balance, and inflammatory responses. While zinc deficiency is more common than toxicity, understanding the potential risks of taking too much zinc is crucial for maintaining optimal health. Uncover the symptoms of zinc toxicity, explore safe intake levels, and learn when it’s crucial to seek medical care. ## **What is zinc toxicity?** Zinc toxicity occurs when the body is exposed to more zinc than it can effectively process, whether through ingestion, absorption, or inhalation. While the body can eliminate small amounts of zinc through urine and feces, excessive zinc exposure can cause a build-up in tissues and organs. This can disrupt normal cellular functions and lead to potentially severe health problems. Watch the video below to learn how much zinc is toxic.## **Signs of zinc toxicity** Zinc toxicity, also known as zinc poisoning, can result from various types of exposure, each presenting with distinct symptoms. Understanding how you may be exposed to high zinc levels is essential, as chronic exposure can result in serious long-term health problems. Research published in _StatPearls_ indicates that excessive zinc exposure may increase the risk of certain cancers, affect the bone marrow, cause anemia, and lead to nerve damage.1 Here are four of the most common types of zinc exposure ### **1. Gastrointestinal** Prolonged overuse of zinc supplements is a common cause of gastrointestinal exposure. This can lead to nausea, vomiting, loss of appetite, stomach cramps, diarrhea, headaches, poor hair growth, hair loss, and premature graying. ### **2. Dermal** Dermal exposure can occur through extended use of zinc-containing creams, lotions, and medical ointments.

## Parasite Cleanse: Best Home Remedies That Work Parasitic infections are more common than you might think and can lead to a range of health problems, including gastrointestinal issues, nutrient deficiencies, and weakened immune function. A parasite cleanse aims to eliminate these unwanted organisms using natural compounds, dietary modifications, and lifestyle changes. Discover natural remedies to help manage parasitic infections and learn when you should seek medical attention. ## **What are parasites?** Parasites are organisms that inhabit or feed on a host organism, relying on it for nutrients at the host’s expense. While some parasites can live symbiotically within the body, others can cause significant health issues, such as nutritional deficiencies and chronic diarrhea, which can lead to long-term complications if left untreated. While most parasites reside in the gastrointestinal tract, they can also migrate to other body parts, such as the liver, lungs, muscle tissue, and even the brain. Parasites are classified into three main categories: protozoa, helminths, and ectoparasites. ### **1. Protozoa** Protozoa are single-celled microscopic organisms that can thrive in a variety of environments. Some protozoa are free-living, while others are parasitic and require a host organism to survive. A parasitic protozoa infection can be particularly concerning as these organisms can rapidly multiply within a host through cell division, quickly leading to widespread infection and disease. Protozoa can be transmitted through exposure to an infected host’s blood, tissue, or excrement and can spread through contaminated water or food. ### **2. Helminths** Helminths are multicellular parasitic worms. Depending on the species, they can survive for years in the host and reproduce by laying eggs that are either excreted or remain in the body. ### **3. Ectoparasites** Ectoparasites are insect-like parasites that live on the surface of a host. They usually feed on the host’s

## High-Dose Vitamin D Benefits and Risks: What Research Reveals Vitamin D intake recommendations vary widely, with some healthcare providers suggesting that 600 IU of vitamin D per day is adequate, while others advocate for 5000 IU or more. So, what does this mean for individuals trying to determine their optimal vitamin D intake, and is high-dose vitamin D supplementation safe? Discover who may benefit from taking high doses of vitamin D and learn why vitamin D testing is crucial to identify safe and effective vitamin D intake levels. ## **What is high-dose vitamin D?** High-dose vitamin D supplementation refers to intake levels significantly exceeding the National Institutes of Health (NIH) recommendations of 600 to 800 IU per day. Higher doses of vitamin D supplements, generally defined as exceeding 4000 IU daily, are typically used to address vitamin D deficiencies or specific health conditions. Taking larger doses of vitamin D may be especially important for individuals with limited sun exposure, older adults, or those with certain medical issues such as osteoporosis or autoimmune disorders. However, vitamin D is a fat-soluble vitamin, meaning it can accumulate in fat cells, increasing the risk of toxicity if vitamin D is taken in excess. Vitamin D’s potential for accumulation and toxicity has contributed to the conflicting recommendations about appropriate vitamin D dosages. This highlights the importance of considering individual factors such as vitamin D status and overall health when evaluating effective and safe vitamin D intake levels. Watch the video below to discover why skin tone can significantly impact vitamin D levels.## **What is vitamin D deficiency?** Vitamin D deficiency is characterized by insufficient vitamin D levels, which increases the risk of health issues, including weakened bones, osteoporosis, and compromised immune functions.

Like most seaweeds, bladderwrack is highly nutritious and an incredibly rich source of iodine; unsurprisingly, bladderwrack supplements are becoming increasingly popular. Let’s look at the many health benefits of bladderwrack! ![Bladderwrack seaweed](https://www.drberg.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/bladderwrack-fucus-vesiculosus.jpg?w=800) ## **What is bladderwrack?** Bladderwrack, also known as rockweed, is a [type of seaweed](https://www.drberg.com/blog/the-benefits-of-roasted-seaweed) commonly found in the intertidal zones of rocky ocean shores. Like other seaweeds, bladderwrack is edible and remains a popular food source for many Asian coastal communities. It’s typically consumed in dried or powdered form and often used as a seasoning added to various dishes. Bladderwrack seaweed has been used for centuries in traditional medicine, particularly as an herbal remedy for thyroid issues, including goiter and hypothyroidism. Because bladderwrack benefits health, it’s readily available as an herbal supplement in various forms, such as capsules, tablets, tinctures, and dried powder. ![Dried bladderwrack](https://www.drberg.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/bladder-wrack-seaweed-leaves-on-white.jpg?w=800) ## **Bladderwrack health benefits** Bladderwrack ranks amongst the most nutritious seaweeds.

## How to Beat Hypertension Without Medication Ninety percent of people with high blood pressure are told they have essential hypertension. That’s a fancy way of saying the medical community doesn’t know what’s causing it. But, they still treat it – usually with medications that can have side effects. This makes some people want to look into natural ways to lower blood pressure. You have about 100,000 miles of blood vessels in your body. And, those blood vessels go everywhere, making sure each of your organs receives the blood and oxygen it needs. When you have chronically high blood pressure, it affects more than just your vascular system and your heart. [High blood pressure](https://www.drberg.com/blog/what-really-causes-high-blood-pressure-or-hypertension) can also create problems with your brain, eyesight, and kidneys. High blood pressure increases your risk of heart attacks and makes you three times more likely to experience a stroke. Plus, high blood pressure is a common risk factor – if you’re over 60, you have a 50% chance of being diagnosed with it. It is important to understand your body never does anything “just because.” If you have hypertension, there’s a reason, and you’ll want to investigate the root cause before taking medication. Many times, high blood pressure is actually compensating for another imbalance. ![](https://www.drberg.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/0ed173b6-6563-4097-9604-2f88d0d31222.jpg?w=800) ## **What Causes High Blood Pressure?** Some of the most common reasons for blood pressure elevation include [low levels of potassium](https://www.drberg.com/blog/top-symptoms-of-having-low-potassium), [magnesium](https://www.drberg.com/blog/1st-sign-of-a-magnesium-deficiency), and [vitamin D](https://www.drberg.com/blog/23-weird-vitamin-d-deficiency-symptoms). Your sodium intake, being overweight, and alcohol consumption are also factors that can raise blood pressure. But, before exploring some natural remedies for these deficiencies, let’s take

## Bile Salts After Gallbladder Removal Guide Promoting healthy digestion is crucial for individuals who have undergone gallbladder surgery. Gallbladder removal can significantly change the digestive process, particularly when breaking down and absorbing fats. We’ll discuss bile deficiency following gallbladder surgery, its impact on fat digestion and vitamin absorption, and explain common digestive symptoms resulting from low bile production. Explore the complexities of [digestion after gallbladder removal](https://www.drberg.com/blog/what-to-eat-after-removing-the-gallbladder) and discover practical ways to support optimal health. Post-gallbladder removal, a lack of bile can cause difficulties in fat digestion and lead to [vitamin deficiencies](https://www.drberg.com/blog/vitamin-deficiencies-cause-serious-diseases) or other digestive problems. Bile emulsifies dietary fats, making them easier to absorb. However, fat digestion becomes less efficient without sufficient bile production or release. ![Vitamin K deficiency, Doctor writing on transparent screen](https://www.drberg.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/deficiency-doctor-writing-on-transparent-screen.jpg?w=800) ### **Consequences of Bile Deficiency on Vitamin Absorption** Aside from aiding in fat digestion, bile is also crucial for absorbing fat-soluble vitamins, and a lack of concentrated bile due to gallbladder removal can quickly lead to nutrient deficiencies. \* **Vitamin A:** Essential for vision and immune function; deficiency symptoms include night blindness and dry skin. \* **Vitamin D:** Important for bone health; inadequate levels can result in weak bones or rickets in children. \* **Vitamin E:** Acts as an antioxidant, protecting cells from damage; low levels may contribute to neurological problems. \* **Vitamin K:** Necessary for blood clotting; insufficiency can cause excessive bleeding or bruising quickly after minor injuries. Insufficient bile output can impede the absorption of these vital fat-soluble

## Bile Deficiency Symptoms You Shouldn’t Ignore Bile deficiency symptoms can often be overlooked, yet they may indicate impaired digestion, which can impact overall health. Discover how bile assists in breaking down fats, extracting vital nutrients such as fat-soluble vitamins, and maintaining a healthy gut microbiome. Learn to identify common bile deficiency symptoms, such as low levels of fat-soluble vitamins, jaundice, and constipation. ## **Functions of Bile** Bile breaks down fats, extracts fat-soluble vitamins, maintains microbial balance, prevents fat buildup in the liver, removes toxic waste, eliminates excess cholesterol, and lubricates the colon for easier digestion. Bile breaks down dietary fats into micelles for efficient absorption and utilization of vital nutrients and aids in absorbing fat-soluble vitamins (A, D, E, and K) necessary for vision, bone health, antioxidant protection, and blood clotting processes. Bile also maintains a balanced gut microbiome by inhibiting harmful pathogens and [promoting beneficial gut flora](https://www.drberg.com/blog/increase-gut-bacteria-diversity-heres-how), which is essential for optimal digestive functioning. Recognizing symptoms of bile deficiency can help address potential health issues early on, preventing more severe health consequences. Signs of bile deficiency can include reduced vision in dim light, aches and pains in bones, mood swings, dry skin or weak muscles, yellowing of the eyes, constipation, fatty liver formation, feeling heavy after eating, and changes in the color or consistency of stool. ![Vitamin K deficiency, Doctor writing on transparent screen](https://www.drberg.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/deficiency-doctor-writing-on-transparent-screen.jpg?w=800) ### **Fat-soluble vitamin deficiencies** A lack of bile can lead to deficiencies in fat-soluble vitamins like A, D, E, and K, which play crucial roles in maintaining overall health. \* Vitamin A is essential for vision and immune function. \*

## How to Bulletproof Your Immune System From Danger Anyone looking to improve their overall health should first look to support their immune system. If you are trying to bolster you immune system, it is important to understand the things that affect it and how you can change them. Learn about the immune system, how nutrition affects it, and what steps you can take to support your health. ## **The Historical Link Between Nutrition and Immunity** Think back to the 1918 Spanish flu pandemic, a grim reminder of how vital nutrition is for our immune defenses. People were grappling with nutritional deficiencies at that time because World War I had wreaked havoc on food supplies. The result? A compromised immunity across vast populations and an estimated 50 to 100 million lives lost. ### **The Impact of Nutritional Deficiencies on Immune Health** Our body’s fortress against illness–the immune system–relies heavily on nutrients. Your immune cells can’t defend you properly without enough nutrients. When nations struggled to feed their citizens adequately during the war, it wasn’t just hunger they battled but also increased vulnerability to infections like influenza. ## **Essential Nutrients for a Robust Immune System** Your immune system is responsible for warding off [viruses and bacteria](https://www.drberg.com/blog/tags/body-conditions). Without proper nutrition, the immune system struggles to complete this task. ### **The Protective Role of Essential Fatty Acids** Fats often get a bad rap, but they are crucial for your immune health. Without enough essential [fatty acids](https://www.drberg.com/blog/15-signs-of-an-omega-3-fatty-acid-deficiency), our cellular walls are unable to form barriers against infection. This means that without enough fats, our immune system will struggle to function. ![Doctor holding vitamin C supplement container](https://www.drberg.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/vitamin-c-supplements-human-health-doctor-02.jpg?w=800) ### \*\*Vitamins That

## Surprising TUDCA Benefits for Gut, Liver & Brain Tauroursodeoxycholic acid (TUDCA) is a type of bile acid that has been found to support cellular health and promote optimal digestive system function. Discover five impressive TUDCA benefits and learn how to use this health-promoting bile acid to enhance health and overall well-being. ![Chemical structure of a molecule](https://www.drberg.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/tauroursodeoxycholic-acid-tudca-molecule-conjugate-taurine.jpg?w=1024) ## **What is TUDCA?** TUDCA is a water-soluble bile acid that plays a vital role in supporting liver and digestive health and has been linked to various benefits for cellular function and neurological integrity. The body produces small amounts of TUDCA naturally through a microbial process where gut bacteria convert the bile acid chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA) into ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA), which is then conjugated with taurine to form TUDCA. Along with other bile salts, TUDCA is stored in the gallbladder as part of the body’s bile acid pool, which is secreted into the small intestine to aid in fat digestion and nutrient absorption. TUDCA has been used for centuries in traditional Chinese medicine to promote liver function, maintain healthy bile flow, and support the health and function of liver cells. Traditionally derived from bear bile, which is exceptionally high in TUDCA, modern dietary supplements are synthesized in laboratories. Watch the video below to learn about the impressive health benefits of TUDCA.## **TUDCA benefits and how it works** Because of TUDCA’s unique chemical structure, it has a high affinity for interacting with liver cells and bile components, which explains its powerful benefits for liver function and digestive health. Here are five potential health benefits of TUDCA. ### **1. Supports healthy bile flow** TUDCA is highly water-soluble and helps

## How to Increase Bile Production Effectively Maintaining optimal bile flow plays a critical role in digestion as it aids in breaking down fats and absorbing key nutrients your body needs to function effectively. If you’re experiencing bloating, indigestion, or sluggish digestion, you may benefit from learning how to increase bile naturally. Explore five effective strategies to naturally support bile production through simple dietary and lifestyle changes. ## **What is bile?** Bile is a yellow-green fluid produced by the liver and stored in the gallbladder. It’s composed of bile salts, [cholesterol](https://www.drberg.com/blog/how-to-read-and-understand-cholesterol-numbers), and waste products, such as bilirubin–a pigment derived from the breakdown of old red blood cells that gives bile its characteristic yellow-green color. Bile plays a vital role in the digestive tract by breaking down fats into smaller components called fatty acids, which your body can absorb and use for energy. In addition, bile is critical for the absorption of fat-soluble nutrients. The gallbladder stores and concentrates bile, then releases it through the bile ducts into the small intestine in response to dietary fat intake, where it facilitates the emulsification and absorption of lipids. This process is essential not only for optimal nutrient absorption but also for overall digestive health. Bile flow helps lubricate the colon, supports the elimination of toxins, inhibits the growth of harmful bacteria in the gut, and prevents the accumulation of excess fat in the liver and digestive tract. Adequate bile production and flow are crucial for efficient digestion and can help reduce symptoms such as bloating, indigestion, and greasy or floating stools. Watch the video below to learn effective ways to increase bile salts naturally.## **What causes low bile production?** Low bile production is

Cruciferous vegetables such as arugula, bok choy, and cauliflower are rich sources of plant compounds that have been found to support the body’s natural detoxification processes. These compounds support liver function by promoting biotransformation, a process in which fat-soluble toxins are converted into water-soluble forms, allowing for easier elimination from the body. ### **Arugula nutrition facts** According to data released by the US Department of Agriculture (USDA), 100 grams (3.5 ounces) of arugula contains:1 \* 31 calories \* 0.3 g total fat \* 1.7 g protein \* 5 g total carbohydrate \* 2.3 g dietary fiber \* 7.2 g net carbs In addition, arugula is an excellent source of various nutrients, including vitamin K, [vitamin C](https://www.drberg.com/blog/the-best-and-worst-vitamin-c), folate, calcium, potassium, and antioxidants that support overall health.

## Is Cod Liver Oil Healthy? Discover Its Benefits Cod liver oil is a popular dietary supplement used worldwide to promote health and well-being. Cod liver oil is a rich source of fat-soluble vitamins and essential fats required for a healthy body.

## Lactose Intolerance Signs and Management Tips Many people don’t produce enough of the enzyme lactase needed to digest lactose, a type of sugar found in dairy products such as milk, yogurt, and certain cheeses. This common disorder, known as lactose intolerance, can cause significant digestive symptoms, including gas, bloating, gut discomfort, and persistent diarrhea if not managed properly. Discover the causes of lactose intolerance and learn how to improve symptoms by making dietary adjustments and opting for lactose-free alternatives. ## **What is lactose intolerance?** Lactose intolerance is a digestive condition characterized by the inability or reduced capacity to break down and digest lactose, a natural sugar found in milk products, including yogurt, cream, ice cream, and soft or unripened cheeses. When lactose isn’t fully broken down, it passes into the colon undigested, where it’s fermented by gut microbes. This fermentation creates gas and by-products, which can trigger a range of gastrointestinal symptoms. While lactose malabsorption isn’t inherently harmful, it can contribute to intestinal irritation and inflammation, thereby increasing the risk of poor gut health, impaired nutrient absorption, and chronic immune responses. According to research published in _StatPearls,_ it’s estimated that around 65 percent of the world’s population has some degree of lactose intolerance, with prevalence varying widely across different regions.1 While up to 90 percent of East Asian adults are believed to be lactose intolerant, only around 15 percent of Northern Europeans appear to be affected, highlighting the strong genetic component of lactose intolerance. Although there isn’t a known cure for lactose intolerance, making dietary adjustments by avoiding [dairy foods](https://www.drberg.com/blog/best-and-worst-dairy-milk-products) can help limit symptoms and maintain a healthy digestive system.

## Stomach Growling Meaning Clearly Explained Here Is that rumbling sound coming from your stomach? Most people just call it “hunger pangs.” But what if you’re not actually hungry? Stomach growling causes are a little more complex than you might think. It turns out, that rumbling is your [digestive system hard at work](https://www.drberg.com/blog/your-digestive-system-and-how-it-works), even if you’re not about to eat. It all comes down to something called the migrating motor complex (MMC). Think of it as your gut’s very own cleaning crew. This essential process happens when your stomach is mostly empty, typically a few hours after your last meal. ## **Stomach Growling Causes: Unveiling the Migrating Motor Complex (MMC)** The MMC is characterized by waves of muscle contractions that sweep through your digestive tract. This rhythmic motion, called peristalsis, serves a vital purpose. It pushes leftover food particles, digestive fluids, and bacteria through your small intestine and into the large intestine. But there’s another critical reason why a healthy MMC is so crucial: it helps prevent a condition known as [small intestinal bacterial overgrowth, or SIBO](https://www.drberg.com/blog/how-not-to-get-small-intestinal-bacteria-overgrowth-or-sibo). Now, SIBO might sound a little intimidating, but let me explain why this matters for you and your gut health. This is because bowel sounds are indicative of a healthy gut. ![SIBO illustration](https://www.drberg.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/woman-holds-card-sibo-small-intestinal-22.jpg?w=800) ### **What is SIBO and How Does it Relate to Stomach Growling?** In a nutshell, SIBO is when an excessive amount of bacteria takes up residence in your small intestine, sometimes leading to weight loss. This is problematic because your large intestine, not the small intestine, is meant to be the primary home for the majority of your gut bacteria. When bacteria set up shop in your small intestine, they can interfere with \[nutrient

## Use Bile Salts for SIBO (Small Intestinal Bacterial Overgrowth) Dealing with [Small Intestinal Bacterial Overgrowth (SIBO)](https://www.drberg.com/blog/how-not-to-get-small-intestinal-bacteria-overgrowth-or-sibo) can make everyday life difficult to cope with. Understanding this condition is an important first step in managing it. Learn about small intestinal bacterial overgrowth, what causes it, and what steps you can take to manage it. ## **Understanding SIBO and Its Impact on Digestion** Bacteria overgrowth in the small intestine, termed SIBO, is a condition that can interfere with digestion. This disrupts digestion, leading to discomforting symptoms like [bloating](https://www.drberg.com/blog/how-to-stop-bloating-instantly-fixing-the-root-cause), diarrhea, and abdominal pain. ### **The Role of the Small Intestine in Digestion** Your small intestine plays an essential role in nutrient absorption. After food gets broken down in your stomach, it travels into this organ, where vital nutrients are extracted. This finely tuned process can get disrupted by SIBO. Excessive bacteria compete with your body for these nutrients, resulting in malnutrition despite eating well. [Research shows](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3099351) that individuals with SIBO often suffer from vitamin deficiencies due to poor absorption. ### **Bacteria Regulation: The Balance We Need** Maintaining a healthy balance of gut flora is critical for optimal digestive health. When there’s an imbalance – too many harmful bacteria or not enough beneficial ones – issues such as SIBO can occur. In most cases, our bodies keep things balanced naturally through various mechanisms like bile secretion, which has antimicrobial properties that help control bacterial growth within our intestines. ![](https://www.drberg.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/53a5bd67-b47a-4b4b-a302-56f53cbef8bd.jpg?w=800) ## **The Role of Bile in Digestion and Bacterial Regulation**

## Carnivore Diet Vegetables: What’s Allowed? The carnivore diet has gained popularity recently, but many people wonder about the role of vegetables in this meat-focused eating plan. As someone who’s researched and experimented with various diets, including the carnivore diet, I’ve found that the topic of carnivore diet vegetables is more nuanced than you might expect. While the strictest interpretation excludes all plant foods, there are variations that allow for some strategic inclusion of vegetables. Let’s explore this controversial aspect of the carnivore diet and see how it might impact your health and wellness goals. The [carnivore diet](https://www.drberg.com/blog/my-opinion-on-the-carnivore-diet) is essentially an extreme version of low-carb eating. It emphasizes animal products and typically eliminates all plant-based foods. But the question of vegetables on this diet isn’t always black and white. Some followers include small amounts of low-carb vegetables, while others stick to strictly animal-sourced foods. ## **Understanding the Carnivore Diet Basics** Before we discuss vegetables, let’s review the fundamentals of the carnivore diet. This diet involves consuming only animal products, primarily meat, poultry, fish, eggs, and sometimes dairy. The idea is to eliminate all plant foods, including fruits, vegetables, grains, and legumes. Proponents claim this diet can lead to weight loss, improved mental clarity, and reduced inflammation. They argue that humans are adapted to eat mostly meat and that plant foods may contain antinutrients that can cause health issues for some people. ### **The Role of Insulin on the Carnivore Diet** One of the main benefits touted by carnivore diet advocates is the significant drop in insulin levels. By eliminating carbohydrates, the diet can lead to improved insulin sensitivity. This can be particularly beneficial for people with conditions related to insulin resistance, such as \[type 2

## Vitamin D: Benefits, Sources, Dosage, and Deficiency Signs Vitamin D plays a crucial role in bone health, muscle movement, brain function, and immune defenses. Unfortunately, vitamin D deficiency is common and can increase the risk of musculoskeletal problems, autoimmune diseases, mood disorders, and certain cancers. Let’s look at common symptoms of vitamin D insufficiency and discover why most people benefit from taking vitamin D. ![Vitamin D capsules](https://www.drberg.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/yellow-capsules-round-glass-bowl-word.jpg?w=800) ## **What is vitamin D?** Vitamin D is a fat-soluble vitamin that regulates various physiological functions, including bone mineralization, muscle function, calcium balance, nerve transmissions, and immune defenses. Also known as the sunshine vitamin, the body produces vitamin D when the skin is exposed to ultraviolet B (UVB) radiation in sunlight. UVB rays trigger a cascade of biochemical reactions that convert previtamin D3 into vitamin D3, which is converted into its active form in the liver and kidneys. The rate of vitamin D production depends on several factors, including average UVB light exposure, age, skin tone, body weight, health status, and geographical location. Because vitamin D is fat-soluble, it can be stored in fat cells and the liver for extended periods. However, lack of adequate sunlight exposure can deplete vitamin D levels and lead to deficiency. Watch the video below to learn how vitamin D affects every organ and tissue in the body. ## **Benefits of vitamin D** _“Almost every cell in the human body has a vitamin D receptor,”_ explains Dr. Berg. _“This indicates that vitamin D is crucial for the regulation of normal cellular function.”_ [Research](https://ajcn.nutrition.org/article/S0002-9165\(22\)03766-2/fulltext) published by _The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition_ supports the importance of a healthy vitamin D status for overall health.

Discover six critical nutrients for a healthy nervous system and learn how prioritizing nutritious whole foods may play a role in relieving sciatica symptoms. ## **What is sciatica?** Sciatica is characterized by pain that radiates along the path of the sciatic nerve, which runs from the lower back, through the hips, and down each leg. This condition occurs when the sciatic nerve is compressed, irritated, or inflamed, which can be linked to herniated discs, spinal issues, or nerve degeneration. Sciatic pain typically affects only one side of the body and can vary in intensity, ranging from mild discomfort to sharp, shooting pain. This painful and debilitating condition is common, and research published in _Spine_ suggests that more than 40 percent of the population suffers from sciatica at some point in their lives.1 Individuals with sciatic pain caused by nerve inflammation or degeneration are often also at increased risk of other nerve-related conditions, such as carpal tunnel syndrome or tarsal tunnel syndrome. Watch the video below to discover common vitamin deficiencies linked to sciatica.## **Symptoms of sciatica** The sciatic nerve comprises thousands of nerve fibers and millions of nerve cells that carry sensory and motor information between the brain and the legs. When these nerve cells or fibers are inflamed or compressed, normal nerve function is disrupted, which can lead to various symptoms. Common sciatica symptoms include: \* Sharp, sudden pain that radiates down the leg \* Muscle weakness in the affected leg \* Muscle spasms in the lower back \* Difficulty

## Fulvic Acid Benefits: Essential Health Boost Fulvic acid is released during the decomposition of plant and animal matter, enriching the soil and supporting plant growth. In addition, this organic compound offers potential health advantages due to its ability to bind to toxins, support skin health, and enhance immune functions. Discover six impressive fulvic acid benefits and learn how to incorporate this novel supplement into your wellness routine. ## **What is fulvic acid?** Fulvic acid is a complex organic compound that occurs naturally in soil, water, compost, and sewage. It’s generated through the microbial breakdown of decomposing plant and animal matter, contributing to soil fertility and supporting plant growth. It belongs to a group of compounds known as humic acids, which also include humic acid and humin. Each humic acid varies in solubility and molecular weight, with fulvic acid being the smallest and most soluble of the group. This high solubility allows fulvic acid to effectively penetrate plant cells and facilitate the transport of nutrients such as amino acids, minerals and vitamins. Humic substances are vital for maintaining fertile, nutrient-rich soil by participating in the nutrient cycle and improving soil structure. They’re also essential for supporting healthy plant growth and are widely used in agricultural settings to boost soil fertility. Additionally, fulvic and humic acids stabilize soil pH, enhance water retention, and supply energy to soil microorganisms. These microbes, in turn, break down decaying matter, releasing fulvic acids and enhancing the soil’s nutrient content. Because of its unique chemical and biological properties, fulvic acid offers potential health benefits for humans and has been used in Ayurvedic medicine for its rejuvenating and anti-aging effects. Watch the video below to discover the impressive health benefits of fulvic acid.

## Vitamin Brands to Avoid – What to Watch Out For Not all vitamin supplements are created equal. While some vitamin and mineral supplements use natural ingredients, others are made with synthetic nutrients that are poorly absorbed and may increase the risk of adverse health effects. Here are the red flags to look for when choosing a dietary supplement and the vitamin brands to avoid. ## **Synthetic vs. natural** Natural vitamin and supplement brands contain essential vitamins, minerals, antioxidants, or other nutrients naturally occurring in whole foods. They’re typically extracted from food sources such as plants or herbs by grinding or juicing, followed by dehydration to form a powdered substance that can be incorporated into pills or capsules. In contrast, synthetic nutrients are created in laboratories using chemical processes to produce artificial compounds that mimic the chemical composition of naturally occurring nutrients. Not only are synthetic vitamins less potent, but they may also pose potential health risks if taken for prolonged periods. _“Although synthetic vitamins are structurally similar to natural ones, they typically lack the cofactors and co-nutrients present in natural sources, which are important for optimal absorption and utilization,”_ explains Dr. Berg. Artificial nutrients are cheap to produce, and almost all multivitamin and mineral supplements available in drug stores and supermarkets are made with synthetic ingredients. In contrast, extracting vitamins from natural food sources is a laborious and expensive process, which is why supplement brands containing natural ingredients are often considerably more expensive. Watch the video below to discover why you should avoid multivitamin brands containing synthetic nutrients.## **8 vitamin brand red flags** According to a study published in the _Journal of the American Geriatrics Society_,

## Vitamin D3 – 5000 IU: Benefits of High-Dose D3 Supplementation While vitamin D supplements are among the most popular dietary supplements, many people don’t take high enough vitamin D3 doses to prevent deficiency and maintain healthy levels. Discover the health benefits of taking 5,000 IU of vitamin D3 daily and find out why you should always combine vitamin D3 with vitamin K2. ![Vitamin D capsules](https://www.drberg.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/yellow-oil-capsules-vitamin-d-poured-0.jpg?w=800) ## **What is vitamin D3?** Vitamin D3, also known as the sunshine vitamin, is produced when the skin is exposed to ultraviolet B (UVB) rays in sunlight. UVB light exposure triggers a chain of complex biochemical reactions that convert previtamin D into active [vitamin D3](https://www.drberg.com/blog/vitamin-d3-benefits-sources-risks). _“The body stores vitamin D3 in the liver and fat cells, which serve as a reservoir that the body can draw upon to compensate for short periods without sunlight exposure,”_ explains Dr. Berg. _“However, prolonged lack of UVB radiation can deplete body stores and result in vitamin D insufficiency.”_ The rate of vitamin D3 production can vary significantly from person to person and depends on many factors. Older people and individuals with darker skin pigmentation may not generate adequate amounts of vitamin D3 despite plenty of sun exposure, which explains why older adults and those with [darker skin tones are at risk of vitamin D deficiency](https://www.drberg.com/blog/vitamin-d-and-your-skin-color). Very few foods naturally contain vitamin D3, and dietary sources, including fatty fish, cod liver oil, egg yolks, beef liver, and fortified dairy products, typically don’t offer enough vitamin D3 to maintain a healthy vitamin D status.

## 5 Benefits of Broccoli Sprouts and Sulforaphane It’s clear that broccoli is a nutrient-rich and healthy vegetable. But you may not be aware that broccoli sprouts are significantly more nutritious than regular broccoli. Broccoli sprouts contain high levels of sulforaphane, a powerful compound with antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties that support brain health, defend against oxidative stress, and promote healthy digestion. Let’s look at the health benefits of broccoli sprouts and find out why you should regularly add these nutritious microgreens to your diet. ## **What are broccoli sprouts?** Broccoli sprouts are delicate young microgreens that grow from germinated broccoli seeds. They’re the first step in the growth cycle of mature broccoli plants. Broccoli sprouts are typically 3 to 5 days old and look similar to alfalfa sprouts, with their tiny green leaves and white stems still attached to the seed. Because of their distinct earthy and somewhat peppery taste, raw sprouts are an excellent addition to salads, soups, and dressings, and work great in your favorite green smoothie recipe. Watch the video below to learn why broccoli sprouts are the best form of broccoli.## **Broccoli vs. broccoli sprouts: which is healthier?** While both broccoli and broccoli sprouts are nutrient-rich cruciferous vegetables that you should frequently consume to promote well-being, broccoli sprouts are significantly healthier than broccoli. Compared to all other cruciferous veggies, broccoli sprouts contain the highest amounts of sulforaphane, a potent plant chemical that protects delicate broccoli sprout plants from damage. _“Broccoli sprouts contain 10 to 100 times more sulforaphane than mature broccoli,”_ explains Dr. Berg. _“What makes sulforaphane stand out among phytonutrients is its ability to support the body’s anti-inflammatory and detoxification pathways.”_

## How Much Vitamin D3 Should I Take? How much vitamin D3 should I take? The ideal vitamin D dosage varies depending on age, lifestyle, sun exposure, and individual health status. Vitamin D3 plays a crucial role in supporting bone health and immune function, yet many people fail to get sufficient amounts of this essential nutrient. Let’s take a closer look at the key factors that influence vitamin D3 status and learn how to maintain optimal levels to promote a healthy body. ![Vitamin D supplements](https://www.drberg.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/pills-vitamin-d3-shape-sun.jpg?w=1024) ## **What is vitamin D3?** Vitamin D3, or cholecalciferol, is a form of vitamin D that the body naturally produces when the skin is exposed to sunlight. It aids the body in absorbing calcium, which helps maintain healthy bones and teeth, while also contributing to proper muscle function and balanced immune system responses. While vitamin D is naturally present in only very few foods, such as fatty fish, egg yolks, and liver, many dairy products are fortified with vitamin D3 to help boost intake. For individuals with low vitamin D levels or those seeking more effective sources, vitamin D supplementation may be recommended. Vitamin D is available in two primary forms: vitamin D2 and vitamin D3. Vitamin D2 is mainly sourced from plants, whereas vitamin D3 is naturally synthesized in the skin through exposure to sunlight and is found in a small number of animal products. Although vitamin D2 and vitamin D3 have similar structures, they differ in how effectively the body absorbs and utilizes them. A study published in the _Qatar Medical Journal_ examined over 15,000 adults and found that vitamin D3 was significantly more effective at raising blood vitamin D levels over 12 weeks than vitamin D2 supplementation.1 Due to its ability to raise and maintain vitamin D levels more efficiently, vitamin D3 is often the preferred form commonly used in dietary

## Natural vs. Synthetic Vitamins – Why It Matters Natural vitamins are extracted from natural food sources such as plants, herbs, and animal products. In contrast, synthetic vitamins are manufactured in laboratories and designed to structurally mimic natural vitamins, minerals, and other nutrients such as amino acids and antioxidants. More than 98 percent of dietary supplements are made from synthetic nutrients. Not only are these products less effective, but they may also increase the risk of side effects and nutrient deficiencies. Let’s take a look at the difference between natural and synthetic vitamins and what to look for when choosing a vitamin supplement. ## **What are natural and synthetic nutrients?** Natural nutrients are [essential vitamins](https://www.drberg.com/blog/7-vitamins-for-stress-and-anxiety-relief) or minerals, antioxidants, and other health-promoting compounds that occur naturally in whole foods. They’re typically extracted by grinding or juicing a food source, followed by dehydrating, which leaves a powdered form that can be incorporated into a pill or capsule. In contrast, a synthetic nutrient is produced in a laboratory via chemical reactions to manufacture artificial compounds that mimic the chemical structure of naturally occurring nutrients. Watch the video below to learn which synthetic vitamin supplements you should avoid.## **How are natural and synthetic vitamins different?** Synthetic nutrients are generally poorly absorbed and less effective than their natural counterparts. They also may pose health concerns and can have side effects if taken for prolonged periods. _“Many people think synthetic vitamins are the same as natural ones,”_ says Dr. Berg. _“That’s incorrect. There are many key differences, and natural supplements have far superior health advantages than synthetic ones.”_ Over half of all U.S. adults take one or more

## Is Saturated Fat Bad? Rethink What You Know Fats play a vital role in energy metabolism, hormone production, satiety regulation, nutrient absorption, and many other critical functions. But is saturated fat bad? No, saturated fats aren’t unhealthy and should regularly be consumed as part of a balanced diet. Let’s address the myths surrounding saturated fats and learn how these fatty acids help promote healthy skin, cognitive functions, and immune defenses. Saturated fat is primarily found in animal products and tropical oils and is one of the three types of naturally occurring fats, alongside monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fats. Unlike unsaturated fats, which are liquid, saturated fats remain solid at room temperature. This is because its carbon molecules contain single bonds instead of double bonds, meaning they’re fully saturated with hydrogen. Saturated fats aren’t a single nutrient but comprise a group of different types of saturated fatty acids, including short-, long-, medium-, and very long-chain fatty acid varieties. These fatty acids include: \* Capric acid \* Caprylic acid \* Caproic acid \* Lauric acid \* Myristic acid \* Palmitic acid \* Stearic acid Stearic, palmitic, and lauric acids are the most commonly consumed saturated fatty acids found in animal fats, meat, and dairy products.

## Does Lemon Juice Have Vitamin C? Find Out Here You’ve probably heard that lemons are packed with vitamin C. But what about lemon juice? Does it really contain a significant amount of this essential nutrient? As someone who’s spent years researching nutrition, I’ve dug deep into the science behind lemon juice vitamin C content. What I’ve discovered might surprise you. The truth is, while fresh lemons are indeed a good source of vitamin C, the story changes when we talk about bottled lemon juice. Let’s explore why that is and what it means for your health. ## **The Vitamin C Content in Lemon Juice: What You Need to Know** When you grab a bottle of lemon juice off the shelf, you might assume you’re getting a hefty dose of [vitamin C](https://www.drberg.com/blog/vitamin-c-s-immune-benefits). But take a closer look at the label. You’ll find that a typical one-ounce serving contains only about 8% of your daily vitamin C needs, roughly 4.8 milligrams per ounce. To put this in perspective, the recommended daily allowance (RDA) for vitamin C is around 70 milligrams for adults. This means you’d need to drink about 9 ounces of bottled lemon juice to meet your daily requirement. That’s a lot of lemon juice. ### **Why Is There So Little Vitamin C in Bottled Lemon Juice?** The low vitamin C content in bottled lemon juice isn’t because lemons themselves are lacking. Fresh lemons are actually quite rich in this nutrient. The issue lies in how bottled lemon juice is processed and stored. Vitamin C is incredibly sensitive to heat and oxygen. When manufacturers pasteurize bottled lemon juice (heating it to kill bacteria), they inadvertently destroy much of its vitamin C content. Exposure to oxygen during bottling and storage further degrades this nutrient over time. ## **The Historical Significance of Lemon Juice Vitamin C** To understand why lemon juice vitamin C was once so prized, we need to take a quick trip back in time.

## Olive Oil vs Soybean Oil: Which Is Healthier? Olive oil vs. soybean oil–which option is the healthier oil? While both are popular cooking oils, olive oil stands out as a much healthier option due to its rich content of monounsaturated fatty acids and antioxidants that help support various critical bodily functions. Let’s look at the key differences between olive oil and soybean oil and discover why you should always choose extra virgin olive oil to support a healthy body. ## **Olive oil** Olive oil is one of humanity’s oldest and most revered culinary ingredients, with its recorded use dating as far back as the Bronze Age. [Extra virgin olive oil (EVOO)](https://www.drberg.com/blog/real-extra-virgin-olive-oil-best-way-to-know-it-s-real) is traditionally cold-pressed and is considered the healthiest variety. This process helps preserve the health-promoting compounds in fresh olives without contaminating the oil with chemicals or causing oxidation due to high temperatures. EVOO is a rich source of antioxidants, polyphenols, vitamin E, hydroxytyrosol, [omega-3 fatty acids](https://www.drberg.com/blog/the-best-source-of-omega-3-fatty-acids), and healthy monounsaturated fats, all of which contribute to olive oil’s potent anti-inflammatory properties. In addition, EVOO contains oleocanthal, a unique phenolic compound that, according to research published in _Nature_, exhibits anti-inflammatory properties similar to those of the nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) ibuprofen.1 Although olive oil can be used for a wide range of culinary applications, it isn’t recommended for high-temperature cooking. While it’s widely believed that olive oil has a smoke point ranging from 325°F (163°C) to 400°F (204°C), recent studies have found a significant degradation of EVOO at much lower temperatures. Research published in _Antioxidants_ indicates that heating EVOO to 248°F (120°C) can reduce its polyphenol concentrations by up to 40

## Butter vs Coconut Oil: Shocking Truth Revealed Butter vs. coconut oil–which one is healthier? While both butter and coconut oil are rich sources of health-promoting fatty acids, grass-fed butter can be considered the more nutritious choice. Discover the key differences between butter and coconut oil and learn why you should choose grass-fed butter whenever possible. Butter and coconut oil are rich sources of healthy saturated fats, which are more heat-stable than unsaturated fats, meaning they can be heated to higher temperatures than other oils, such as flaxseed, walnut, or [olive oil](https://www.drberg.com/blog/fascinating-benefits-of-ozonated-olive-oil). Both have high smoke points, which makes them excellent fats for cooking and baking. However, butter and coconut oil have distinct flavors, fatty acid composition, and nutritional values. Here are some key differences between butter and coconut oil. ### **Butter** Butter is made from the fat of cow’s milk and contains saturated fats, monounsaturated fats, and small amounts of polyunsaturated fats. Butter also contains water, milk solids, and 400 different fatty acids, including butyric acid, a potent anti-inflammatory fatty acid with several potential health benefits. Grass-fed butter is an excellent source of fat-soluble vitamins, including vitamins A, D, E, and K2. Grass-fed cattle have access to pastures and forage on a natural diet of grasses and herbs, resulting in more nutrient-rich butter compared to conventional grain-fed butter. ### **Coconut oil** Coconut oil is extracted from fresh coconut meat. It’s predominantly composed of saturated fats and an exceptional source of medium-chain fatty acids such as caprylic acid and lauric acid. While coconut oil doesn’t contain significant amounts of vitamins, more than half of its fat content is composed of medium-chain triglycerides (MCTs), a unique group of fatty acids that profoundly benefit metabolic and digestive health.

## Is Textured Vegetable Protein Healthy? Is textured vegetable protein healthy? No, it’s an ultra-processed meat substitute made from defatted soy flour, offering limited nutritional value and often containing added sodium and preservatives. Discover the nutritional drawbacks of textured vegetable protein and explore more nutritious whole-food alternatives suitable for a health-focused diet. ## **What is textured vegetable protein (TVP)?** Textured vegetable protein (TVP) is an extensively processed [soy product](https://www.drberg.com/blog/the-myth-of-soy-as-a-health-food) made from defatted soy flour, a byproduct of soybean oil production. The defatted soy flour is pressure-cooked and dried into various forms, such as granules, flakes, chunks, and nuggets, which are later rehydrated to mimic the texture of meat. Originally developed in the 1960s as a cost-effective meat filler, TVP has since become a common ingredient in a wide range of processed foods, especially those marketed toward a plant-based diet. Often labeled as textured soy protein, soy meat, or soya chunks, it’s commonly found in health food stores and hidden in processed soy products, such as vegan sausages, soy burgers, soy ground meat, and vegan tacos. While TVP provides a concentrated source of protein and functions as a meat substitute, it falls short of the nutritional benefits of whole foods. It lacks the fiber, phytonutrients, and various beneficial nutrients naturally present in less processed plant proteins. To enhance its otherwise bland taste and spongy texture, manufacturers often add artificial flavorings to mimic the taste of beef or bacon, which only adds to its ultra-processed nature. Watch the video below to discover the worst protein in the world.## **Is textured vegetable protein healthy?** No, TVP isn’t considered a healthy choice as it’s a heavily processed soy product with

## Are Protein Bars Good for You? Truth Revealed Protein bars are popular among athletes or those looking for a quick energy boost during the day. But are protein bars good for you? No, many protein bars are ultra-processed foods packed with harmful ingredients, such as sugar, seed oils, and modified starches, which can contribute to blood sugar fluctuations and inflammation. Learn about the potentially dangerous ingredients in many protein bars and discover natural, whole-food sources of high-quality protein. ## **Are protein bars good for you?** Protein bars are marketed as a healthy way to boost protein intake and promote steady energy levels after a workout or whenever you’re on the go. However, these bars are typically high in sugar and carbohydrates and shouldn’t be used as meal replacements or substitutes for nutritious whole foods. Diets high in sugar and carbs can lead to frequent blood glucose fluctuations linked to poor metabolic health, erratic energy levels, and an increased risk of heart disease and diabetes. _“Most protein bars are worse than candy, containing as much as 50 grams of sugar per serving,”_ explains Dr. Berg. _“They’re also produced with modified food starches, which act like sugars as they quickly raise blood glucose levels and contribute to weight gain.”_ Additionally, intake of concentrated amounts of protein in combination with carbohydrates triggers the excessive release of insulin compared to consuming these macronutrients separately. Chronically elevated insulin levels can diminish cellular responses to insulin signaling, a condition known as [insulin resistance](https://www.drberg.com/blog/insulin-resistance). Insulin resistance is a widespread metabolic imbalance that leads to loss of blood sugar control, which increases the risk of type 2 diabetes, hypertension, obesity, non-alcoholic [fatty liver](https://www.drberg.com/blog/how-to-reverse-a-fatty-liver) disease (NAFLD), and polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS).

Magnesium is an essential mineral needed for energy production, blood sugar control, blood pressure regulation, and maintaining healthy muscle and nerve function. Many people struggle to meet their recommended daily magnesium intake, and poor metabolic health and impaired kidney function may trigger excess magnesium excretion, which can deplete magnesium levels within 24 hours. Recognize the signs of magnesium deficiency and learn how the right dietary strategy can help you get enough magnesium. ## **What is magnesium?** Magnesium is needed for more than 600 biochemical pathways and cellular functions. It’s the fourth most abundant mineral in the human body, and most magnesium is stored in bones and muscles. Only around one percent of magnesium is found circulating in the blood, which explains why it can be challenging to accurately measure magnesium levels and diagnose potential magnesium deficiency with standard blood tests. Unfortunately, most people don’t consume enough dietary magnesium to maintain healthy levels, greatly increasing the risk of becoming magnesium deficient. Research published in _Open Heart_ found that _“Approximately 50 percent of Americans consume less than the Estimated Average Requirement (EAR) for magnesium, and some age groups consume substantially less.”_ 1 Watch the video below to learn how long magnesium stays in the body.## **What does magnesium do for your body?** Magnesium plays a crucial role in maintaining a wide range of physiological functions.

## Why Take Magnesium with Vitamin D? Benefits Explained Magnesium and vitamin D metabolism are closely linked, and inadequate magnesium levels could negatively impact vitamin D levels despite plenty of sunlight exposure and vitamin D supplementation. Discover why it’s best to take magnesium with vitamin D and how to combine these two essential nutrients properly. ## **What is vitamin D?** Vitamin D, also known as the sunshine vitamin, is produced when the skin is exposed to sunlight. Ultraviolet B (UVB) radiation in sunlight can penetrate the skin and trigger a biochemical chain reaction that converts a cholesterol-containing compound into vitamin D3, which undergoes enzymatic activation in the liver and kidneys. The amount of [vitamin D](https://www.drberg.com/blog/can-i-overdose-on-vitamin-d) the body produces depends on several factors, including average UVB light exposure, skin tone, body weight, health status, and geographical location. Vitamin D is a fat-soluble vitamin that can be stored in the liver and fat cells for extended periods. However, prolonged lack of sun exposure can deplete body stores and lead to vitamin D deficiency. ### **Benefits of vitamin D** Vitamin D is involved in many physiological processes and plays a role in supporting skeletal strength, [immune system functions](https://www.drberg.com/blog/make-your-immune-system-bulletproof-now), blood pressure regulation, and heart health. _“Most cells in the body have vitamin D receptors, which indicates that vitamin D influences a wide range of cellular and biochemical pathways,”_ explains Dr. Berg. Vitamin D helps support the intestinal absorption of calcium from foods and supplements, which is critical for maintaining strong bones and overall skeletal health. This fat-soluble vitamin also plays a role in supporting the activity of immune cells, helping promote a healthy immune system, balanced inflammatory responses, and overall defense functions. In addition, vitamin D helps support healthy

## Celtic Salt: Benefits You Can’t Ignore Celtic salt is a mineral-rich sea salt that offers numerous health benefits. Compared to table salt, this naturally harvested salt is minimally processed and less likely to be contaminated with microplastics. Here are four Celtic salt benefits and practical tips on incorporating this nutritious sea salt into your routine. ## **What is Celtic salt?** Celtic salt is a type of sea salt harvested from certain coastal regions of France. This type of natural salt is produced by evaporating seawater in carefully controlled salt pans, leaving behind crystallized salt. Like many other sea salts, Celtic salt retains various minerals that are present in the ocean, resulting in a mineral-rich salt product. Celtic salt contains trace amounts of essential minerals such as magnesium, calcium, potassium, copper, zinc, and iron. This mineral composition is responsible for its slightly dark color, which explains why it’s also called Celtic gray salt. Compared to regular or rock salt, Celtic salt retains some moisture, giving it a unique texture and flavor profile. However, its moisture content also increases the risk of clumping, so it’s essential to store Celtic salt in a sealed container. Watch the video below to discover the difference between pink Himalayan salt and Celtic salt.## **Does the type of salt you consume matter?** Yes, the type of salt you consume matters. Regular table salt is typically bleached and heavily processed, resulting in a salt product without significant mineral content. In addition, table salts are often combined with sodium aluminum silicate, an anti-caking compound that prevents clumping. According to a study published in _Emergency Medicine International,_ chronic exposure to aluminum compounds can have neurotoxic effects and may increase the risk of Alzheimer’s

## The Truth About Vitamin D and Shingles Relief Shingles is a widespread viral infection caused by the varicella-zoster virus, and an acute shingles outbreak often leads to a painful rash accompanied by irritating blisters or lesions. Vitamin D plays a role in supporting overall immune function, and exploring its relationship with the varicella-zoster virus may offer insight into approaches for managing or preventing shingles. Discover the link between vitamin D and shingles and learn how to maintain optimal vitamin D levels through sun exposure and diet to reduce the risk of viral infections. ## **What is shingles?** Shingles, also known as herpes zoster, is a painful viral infection triggered by the reactivation of the varicella-zoster virus, the same viral species responsible for chickenpox. While most people recover from chickenpox, the varicella-zoster virus typically remains in the body, staying dormant in nerve cells. Under certain conditions, such as aging, stress, injury, or weakened immune defenses, the virus can reactivate and trigger shingles. A shingles outbreak is characterized by a painful, blistering rash that typically appears on one side of the body along major nerve pathways. The pain, often severe, may persist even after the rash heals, a condition called postherpetic neuralgia. Common symptoms of shingles include: \* Sharp or burning pain \* Aching or throbbing discomfort \* Tingling or prickling sensations \* Itching \* Localized numbness \* Hypersensitivity to touch \* Fluid-filled blisters \* Open sores \* Discolored patches of skin \* Brown or maroon plaque-like lesions Shingles isn’t contagious, but the varicella-zoster virus can infect those who haven’t had chickenpox through contact with fluid from shingles blisters or inhaling airborne virus particles. While chickenpox is usually mild in childhood, adults who contract the virus are at a higher risk for more severe complications. As age increases, so does the potential for serious health issues.

Lucky for you, we’re diving deep into the world of melasma and its culprits – from sun-soaked days that were a bit too much fun to stress that sticks around longer than necessary. By sticking with me, you’ll discover how hormones play their part and why adrenal health is more connected to your complexion than you might think. Get ready because I’ll give you the scoop on eating right and tweaking your lifestyle choices to help curb those dark spots. ## **Understanding Melasma and Its Impact on Skin** [Melasma](https://www.drberg.com/blog/categories/health-concerns/skin-health) , where dark spots appear on the skin, can be more than a cosmetic annoyance. It often signals something deeper at play beneath the surface of your skin–specifically with melanocytes. These pigment-producing cells are like your skin’s personal color artists. When they go into overdrive, you end up with melasma. Think of it as an unwelcome art project on your face; instead of pretty pastels or vibrant hues, you get patches that range from light brown to deep tan. Sure, some might consider them natural beauty marks, but knowing why they pop up is vital in showing them the door if they’re not your style. This excess pigmentation isn’t random–it has its roots in factors such as genetics and sun exposure. It also dives into hormonal territories like estrogen imbalances and stress levels, making melanocytes work overtime. ![](https://www.drberg.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/blog-the-missing-nutrient-in-hair-nails-and-skin-4.jpg?w=800) ## **The Main Causes Behind Dark Spots on Skin** Wondering why your skin is playing connect-the-dots?

## The Supplements That ACTUALLY WORK The Supplements That ACTUALLY WORK Finding the best supplements for health conditions can feel overwhelming.

This post reflects observations from working with many people, noting what truly makes a difference. It also leverages insight from fact sheets on dietary supplements.

## The #1 Vitamin Deficiency Behind Vertigo The #1 Vitamin Deficiency Behind Vertigo Imagine feeling the world spin with every tilt of your head. That’s what life is like for someone grappling with benign paroxysmal positional vertigo, commonly known as BPPV. It turns out that a lack of vitamin D might be partly to blame. Recent studies have spotlighted how this deficiency can mess with inner ear health and potentially trigger dizzy spells. I’ve seen firsthand the difference that proper diagnosis and treatment can make. Through specific maneuvers and nutritional tweaks, there’s hope for stability in more ways than one.

## Is Beef Hard to Digest? Why Fatty Meats Digest Easier If you are having trouble digesting lean cuts of beef, you’re not alone. The higher the fat content of meat, the easier it is to digest. Fatty foods slow down the digestive process, which allows more time to break down and absorb proteins. Discover why eating high-fat meats is easier on your digestive system and learn how you can naturally speed up digestion and enhance nutrient absorption. ## **Is beef hard to digest?** How easy it is to digest beef depends on how it’s prepared and how much fat it contains. _“The big reason why it’s easier to digest fattier meats like hamburger steak is because of the fat,”_ explains Dr. Berg. _“The more fat in the protein, the more delayed the digestion is. This means it sits in your small intestine longer, and the enzymes can do their work to help with fat and protein digestion.”_ Eating lean cuts of beef can overwhelm the digestive system due to their high protein and low-fat content. Because fat digestion takes time, high-fat meats remain longer in your digestive tract, which helps the body to digest protein-rich foods, particularly red meat. When saturated fat and long-chain fatty acids enter the small intestines, they trigger the release of cholecystokinin (CCK). CCK is a digestive hormone that stimulates the gallbladder to release bile, which is crucial for breaking down and absorbing dietary fats. CCK also stimulates the release of digestive enzymes from the pancreas, which are responsible for the chemical digestion of meat, and slow down the movement of food through the digestive tract, which allows more time for digestive processes. Watch the video below to learn why fatty meat is easier to digest.### **Lean beef vs. fatty beef** Lean beef such as tenderloin, sirloin, round, and flank steak typically contain less than 10 percent of fat. In contrast, fatty beef such

## How Much Krill Oil Should You Take Per Day? Krill oil is packed with essential fatty acids that offer profound health benefits, and taking krill oil supplements can promote cardiovascular health, support brain function, and help lower inflammation. Discover how much krill oil per day you should be taking to promote a healthy body. ![Krill oil capsules](https://www.drberg.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/krill-oil-capsules-on-table-closeup.jpg?w=800) ## **What is krill oil?** Krill oil is extracted from krill, which are small, shrimp-like crustaceans found in oceans worldwide. The majority of krill oil supplements are derived from antarctic krill, which is an incredibly rich source of eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), two essential omega-3 fatty acids with various potential health benefits. Krill oil has become a popular alternative to fish oil supplements as it contains the antioxidant astaxanthin, which helps prevent fatty acid oxidation, making krill oil more stable and less prone to turning rancid. In contrast to [marine omega-3 fish oils](https://www.drberg.com/blog/what-happens-if-you-consumed-omega-3-fish-oils-for-30-days) extracted from fatty fish, krill oil contains EPA and DHA in a phospholipid form, which is more bioavailable and significantly better absorbed than fish oil. A [study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4559234/) published in _Vascular Health and Risk Management_ found that individuals taking a krill oil supplement had higher omega-3 fatty acid blood concentrations than those taking fish oil despite both dietary supplements providing the same DHA and EPA dosage. Watch the video below to discover the best natural source of omega-3 fatty acids. The Best Natural Sources of Omega-3 Fatty Acids ## **How much krill oil should you take per day?** The best krill oil dosage depends on your specific health needs, your overall omega-3 fat intake, and the EPA and DHA content of the krill oil supplement you plan to

## Magnesium Citrate vs. Glycinate: What’s the Difference? Magnesium citrate vs. glycinate-what’s the difference? Magnesium deficiency is common among Americans, and many individuals turn to magnesium supplementation. However, selecting the right one can be challenging as many different magnesium forms are available. Let’s explore the potential health benefits of magnesium citrate and glycinate and learn which form may be the best option for your needs. ## **What is magnesium citrate?** Magnesium citrate is made by combining magnesium salt with citric acid. This results in a highly absorbable form of magnesium that can be found in many multivitamins and mineral supplements. Magnesium citrate can support digestive health by working as a mild laxative. When consumed, it can relieve constipation by drawing water into the intestines to help soften stools and stimulate bowel movements. It can also help prevent muscle cramps, improve blood pressure, and support bone health by regulating calcium levels. ### **Benefits of magnesium citrate** Magnesium citrate may be beneficial to support: \* High blood pressure \* Constipation \* Digestive issues \* Nocturnal leg cramps \* Headaches and migraines Watch the video below to learn more about magnesium’s amazing benefits.## **What is magnesium glycinate?** Magnesium glycinate is a popular dietary supplement that combines magnesium and the amino acid glycine. This elemental form of magnesium is known for its calming properties and excellent absorption rate. Magnesium glycinate is typically more gentle on the stomach and doesn’t have the same laxative effects associated with other types of magnesium. Unlike most mineral supplements, magnesium glycinate doesn’t require an acidic environment for absorption, which makes it suitable for a wide range of individuals. Magnesium glycinate can help improve digestion by promoting bile
