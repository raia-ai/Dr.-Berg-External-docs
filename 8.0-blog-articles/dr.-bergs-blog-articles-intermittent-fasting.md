## Hyperthyroidism Warning Signs: What to Watch For Dietary and lifestyle changes can be a game-changer for individuals with an overactive thyroid. Learn about the various aspects of hyperthyroidism and diet’s role in managing this condition. First, discover the causes and [symptoms of hyperthyroidism](https://www.drberg.com/blog/use-vitamin-b1-for-hyperthyroidism-symptoms) to help you better comprehend your body’s needs. Then, explore the [significance of iodine in thyroid](https://www.drberg.com/blog/iodine-beyond-the-thyroid) activity and why it’s critical to watch your overall intake when diagnosed with this ailment. Examine why certain foods like [sea kelp](https://www.drberg.com/blog/kelp-vs-seaweed-whats-the-difference) should be avoided due to their high iodine content while offering alternative nutrient sources safer for those with hyperthyroid conditions. ## **Understanding Hyperthyroidism** Hyperthyroidism is when the thyroid gland produces excessive amounts of thyroid hormones, leading to an overactive metabolism. This can cause various symptoms, such as weight loss, increased heart rate, and anxiety. To correctly manage hyperthyroidism, it is crucial to understand its causes and effects. ![](https://www.drberg.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/25b651d3-1504-4b75-8fd1-569dc3c6b741.jpg?w=800) ## **Causes of Hyperthyroidism** The most common cause of hyperthyroidism is [Graves’ disease](https://www.drberg.com/blog/hyperthyroid-conditions-and-graves-best-tips), an autoimmune disorder that stimulates the [production of thyroid hormones](https://www.drberg.com/blog/why-fasting-lowers-your-thyroid-hormone-t3-a-little-bit).

## Gallstones Self-Care: Natural Gallbladder Support If you have a history of gallstones or gallbladder attacks, you may be searching for answers to what dissolves gallbladder stones fast. The development of gallstones is typically linked to inadequate bile flow, and supporting optimal gallbladder function is one of the best strategies for preventing and managing gallbladder stones. Let’s explore the common causes of gallstone formation and uncover how dietary changes and natural remedies can help dissolve gallstones and support long-term gallbladder health. ## **What are gallbladder stones?** Gallbladder stones, also known as gallstones, are hardened deposits that form in the gallbladder, a small organ located beneath the liver. The gallbladder stores bile, a critical digestive fluid that helps break down and digest dietary fats and fat-soluble vitamins. In addition to bile salts, bile fluid also contains cholesterol and bilirubin, a pigment produced during the breakdown of red blood cells. Bile acid is released in response to fat intake, which stimulates the gallbladder to contract. This propels bile through the common bile duct into the small intestines, where it aids in the digestion of fats and helps eliminate metabolic waste products. However, sluggish gallbladder function or bile fluid that becomes overly saturated with cholesterol or bilirubin can lead to bile sludge, significantly increasing the risk of gallstone formation. Cholesterol gallstones consist primarily of cholesterol, while pigment gallstones are formed from excess bilirubin and are typically linked to conditions such as hemolytic anemia or liver disease. Gallstones can vary in size, ranging from tiny grains to large, golf ball-sized stones, which can block bile flow, leading to excruciating abdominal pain, gallbladder inflammation, and digestive problems. Watch the video below to learn about the common causes of gallstones.

## Fiber Myth: Why Fiber Isn’t What You Think ## **Exploding the Fiber Myth: What You Might Not Know That Could Be Hurting You**_By Dr. Eric Berg_ There are a lot of myths surrounding fiber, especially about how much fiber we need daily, how good fiber is for us, how much fiber we need to cleanse the colon, and where we should get our fiber. These myths have been pretty pervasive for a long time now. ## **Exploding the Myths about Fiber** ![Whole grains](https://www.drberg.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/fiber-myth-whole-grains.jpg?w=800) Do you know those people who have those very distended, swollen, basketball-looking bellies? One of the main causes of this kind of big belly is not always necessarily fat. In fact, it could merely be bloating in the intestines because they’re consuming too much fiber. This fiber myth has been around 30 years now–this myth that the more fiber you eat, the more you will decrease your likelihood of developing colon cancer. This is a myth because eating too much fiber might actually _increase_ your risk of developing colon cancer. When you are constipated, sometimes the doctor will tell you to eat more fiber or to take Metamucil or other synthetic forms of fiber, and you might experience some relief in constipation, but that is because of the negative things this extra fiber is doing to your colon, not the positives. See, what all this fiber really does is irritate and stimulate the colon, making it dump waste faster. Fiber isn’t even necessarily forming the bulk of your stool. **Here’s What Happens in the Body when We Take/Eat Too Much Fiber** Here’s what really happens from this fiber, especially when we get our fiber from whole grains, bran, Metamucil, and other over-the-counter fibers people take. These forms of fiber create a lot of inflammation in the colon and cause a lot of mechanical damage as the fiber passes through the intestines as well. See, one myth that people have about fiber is that it improves digestion because it

## Hot Flashes Menopause: Causes and Relief Tips Every woman is going to go through [menopause](https://www.drberg.com/blog/menopause-making-you-look-masculine). At this point, it’s kind of become a running joke (or terror, really) that this transition is going to be a terrible time marked by menopause hot flashes, fast heart rate, and a myriad of other troubling symptoms. But it doesn’t have to be that way. In fact, it’s not supposed to be that way if your body is healthy and running, as it should. These symptoms only occur if there is a disconnect in your normal circuitry and if **your adrenal glands are not running as they should** as you enter menopause. Here, we’ll explain and dive into how you can avoid those pesky symptoms for good.

They’re released from one ovary one month, and the other ovary the next. At the end of that 400th egg, which is roughly at about age 52, there is a transitional phase commonly known as menopause. During this transition, your ovaries essentially go into retirement. They stop releasing eggs and they stop producing **estrogen** and **progesterone,** the two hormones that control [menstruation](https://www.drberg.com/blog/understanding-the-menstrual-cycle-and-estrogen) and ovulation. Normally, this takes place over three phases: \* **Perimenopause:** This takes place over several years before menopause. During this phase, the ovaries

## How to Reduce Floaters in Eyes Naturally Floaters are tiny threads of collagen fibers that appear as floating dots or specks in your field of vision. While floaters tend to be harmless, they can be annoying and distracting. Discover how to reduce floaters in eyes naturally with intermittent fasting. ## **What are eye floaters?** Eye floaters, or vitreous floaters, are tiny pieces of collagen fiber in the vitreous, the jelly-like substance within the eye. These collagen clumps cast a shadow on the retina and appear as small loops, cobwebs, or worms in your field of vision. They tend to drift with eye movement and are more noticeable in bright light. Floaters are incredibly common. A study published in _The Journal of Ophthalmology_ found that over 70 percent of adults report having specks in their vision.1 While most eye floaters are harmless, severe cases can cause visual impairment and may require eye medications or laser treatment. Laser therapy aims to break up clumps of collagen and can treat eye floaters. However, this procedure can have considerable side effects and increases the risk of [glaucoma](https://www.drberg.com/blog/how-to-improve-glaucoma), retinal tears, and cataracts. Watch the video below to learn how to help reduce eye floaters naturally.## **What causes eye floaters?** Floaters are caused by damaged collagen fibers within the vitreous fluid, which is generally linked to the natural aging process but can also be triggered by injury, eye diseases, and inflammation. Common factors linked to floaters include: \* Age \* Eye surgery \* Posterior eye inflammation \* Eye bleeding \* Eye disease \* Retinal tear \* [High blood pressure](https://www.drberg.com/blog/the-end-of-hypertension-high-blood-pressure) \* Cataract surgery Poor metabolic health has also been linked to floaters, and individuals with diabetes,

## Apple Cider Vinegar and Cranberry Juice Benefits Both apple cider vinegar and cranberry juice have incredible health benefits and can help lower blood sugar levels, a crucial aspect of weight loss. Discover how drinking apple cider vinegar and cranberry juice can shrink belly fat and benefit your cardiovascular health. ## **Can apple cider vinegar and cranberry juice boost weight loss?** Yes, [apple cider vinegar](https://www.drberg.com/blog/will-apple-cider-vinegar-break-your-fast) and cranberry juice can help you lose weight and improve your metabolic health, significantly reducing your risk of diabetes and insulin resistance. ### **How does it work?** Apple cider vinegar is a rich source of acetic acid, which is an organic acid that supports healthy blood sugar levels and lowers the risk of insulin resistance, a primary risk factor for weight gain and fatty liver disease. Research published in _Clinical Nutrition_ found that acetic acid slows gastric emptying and buffers the rise of blood sugar levels after a meal. This avoids spikes in insulin, a crucial metabolic hormone that regulates blood sugar levels and promotes fat storage.1 Cranberry juice benefits weight-loss efforts by enhancing your cells’ sensitivity to insulin, which promotes healthy blood sugar control and helps avoid elevated insulin levels, the main culprit for [belly fat](https://www.drberg.com/blog/do-you-have-toxic-belly-fat). In addition, apple cider vinegar and cranberry juice are rich sources of polyphenols with potent antioxidant properties that help protect the liver from harmful by-products of detoxification processes. _“Impaired liver function due to lack of adequate antioxidants can lead to fatty liver, weight gain, and stubborn belly fat,”_ says Dr. Berg. _“Regularly drinking cranberry juice mixed with apple cider vinegar promotes liver health, crucial for weight loss and long-term weight management.”_ Watch the video below to learn how to

## Why Are My Upper Arms So Fat? Here’s What to Know Loose arm fat is more common in women than in men and is typically caused by hormonal changes or imbalances. Supporting estrogen balance by avoiding foods with estrogenic properties and boosting your body’s growth hormone production with intermittent fasting and high-intensity exercise helps eliminate stubborn fat in the upper arm region. Learn about the causes of upper arm fat and discover what steps you can take to help get rid of flabby arms. ## **What causes upper arm fat?** Flabby arms, known as bat wings, are excessive fat accumulations in the upper arm region. There is a significantly higher prevalence of excess arm fat in women than in men, and hormonal changes, age, and weight fluctuations are thought to play a significant role in the development of stubborn upper arm fat. ### **Age** As you age, the skin loses elasticity, and muscle mass typically decreases, which, combined with excess fat accumulation due to age-related weight gain, can cause sagging and flabby upper arms. ### **Genetics** Some individuals are genetically predisposed to have more fat, which increases the likelihood of developing saggy upper arms. ### **Weight fluctuations** While excess weight can contribute to fat depositions, rapid weight loss can also lead to loose and flabby arm skin. ### **Hormonal changes** Human growth hormone (HGH), estrogen, and testosterone levels regulate where and how you gain weight, which greatly influences your body composition and [metabolic body type](https://www.drberg.com/blog/what-is-your-body-type). Factors such as age, stress, dietary factors, and lifestyle habits can trigger hormonal imbalances and may cause fat accumulation in your upper arms. ### **Poor diet** A diet high in processed foods, sugars, carbs, and excessive calorie intake can contribute to weight gain and overall body fat accumulation, including in the upper arms. Watch the video below to learn how to lose fat in the upper arms fast.

Learn what may trigger abdominal distension and how to get rid of bloating while fasting. ## **What is bloating?** Bloating is a digestive condition characterized by air or gas buildup in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract. Abdominal bloating can be caused by various factors, including: \* Sensitivities to certain foods \* Carbonated beverages \* Hormonal changes \* Imbalanced gut microflora \* [Stress](https://www.drberg.com/blog/7-vitamins-for-stress-and-anxiety-relief) \* Dehydration \* Eating too fast \* Swallowing too much air Bloating can lead to abdominal discomfort, a feeling of fullness, and belly swelling. A bloated abdomen can also be associated with other symptoms, including flatulence and intestinal rumbling. Approximately 25 percent of people experience occasional bloating, which is typically linked to excessive food intake or the consumption of gas-producing foods. Bloating also affects up to 90 percent of those with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) and [inflammatory bowel disease (IBD)](https://www.drberg.com/blog/the-most-common-nutrient-deficiency-in-ibd-inflammatory-bowel-disease), as well as an estimated 75 percent of women during their menstrual cycles.

## Does Ginger Break a Fast? Get the Facts Does ginger break a fast? No, ginger won’t break a fast when consumed in small amounts, such as added to green tea or water infusions. Ginger contains minimal calories and won’t trigger an insulin response, making it a suitable choice for most fasting protocols. Discover how ginger benefits digestive health and metabolic processes, and learn how to incorporate this aromatic root into your fasting routine. ## **What is ginger?** Ginger is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia, prized for its root, known as the rhizome, which is the most commonly used part. This aromatic root contains high concentrations of bioactive compounds, including gingerol, shogaol, paradol, and zingerone. These natural compounds not only give ginger its distinct flavor but also promote gut comfort and may help maintain digestive balance. Ginger is unique because it’s used in both fresh and dried forms, allowing it to fit into a wide range of dishes, from stir-fries and soups to teas and baked goods. While gingerol is most abundant in fresh ginger, drying the root increases shogaol levels, enhancing its warming properties. Zingerone and paradol also develop during processing, adding subtle sweetness and complexity to ginger’s flavor. Watch the video below to learn how ginger lemon water can help you extend your intermittent fasting window.## **Does ginger break a fast?** No, ginger doesn’t break a fast–and it may actually enhance the benefits of fasting. Used for centuries in traditional medicine, ginger supports digestion and helps reduce inflammation, both of which can be especially helpful during fasting. While ginger is low in carbohydrates and contains less than one gram of net carbs per teaspoon, consuming large amounts could cause digestive discomfort for some people. For best results, enjoy ginger in moderation during a fast and pay

## Fasting and Lupus: Benefits You Should Know If you’re living with lupus, you know it’s not a walk in the park. This chronic autoimmune disease can manifest in many ways, making conventional treatment yield different results for different individuals. But there’s good news.

It can affect the joints, skin, kidneys, blood cells, heart, and lungs. Each case presents differently. Certain things can trigger lupus flare-ups, such as UV light, some medications (including birth control with estrogen), [low vitamin D](https://www.drberg.com/blog/the-first-sign-of-low-vitamin-d-is), and even significant stress.

## What Is a Normal Blood Sugar Level Explained Have you been wondering what a normal blood sugar level is and how to maintain a healthy level of it? Read on and allow me to explain to you what it is and what you can do to keep it normal. **RELATED:** [**The Myth About Blood Sugars and Diabetes**](https://www.drberg.com/blog/the-myth-about-blood-sugars-and-diabetes) In this article: 1. What Is the Normal Blood Sugar Count? 2. Most of the American Population Are Becoming Prediabetic and Diabetic 3. What Is Prediabetes? 4. What Causes Prediabetes? 5. Prediabetic Symptoms 6. Risk Factors That Increase the Development of Prediabetes 7. How to Avoid Prediabetes and Normalize Blood Sugar ## **How to Keep a Normal Blood Sugar Level** ### **What Is the Normal Blood Sugar Count?** The normal blood sugar level is typically between 80 and 100 mg/dL. Sometimes, it can go down to 70 mg/dL or lower if you completely give up on sugar. That is a totally normal situation. But, what does 80-100 mg/dL of blood sugar mean? It means the ratio of how much sugar you have in your blood. For example, an average person of 165 pounds has 1 and 1/3 gallons of blood in their body. This means there is about 5 g (a little bit more of 1 teaspoon) of sugar in the blood for the normal ratio. If you dilute that amount of sugar in the blood, that would be 90 mg/dL. ### **Most of the American Population Are Becoming Prediabetic and Diabetic** ### ![Young african woman enjoying a fresh fruit juice | What Is A Normal Blood Sugar Level And How To Keep It Normal | fasting blood sugar level](https://www.drberg.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/blog-normal-blood-sugar-level-1.jpg?w=800) You can actually convert protein and even fat into sugar.

## Immediate Gout Pain Relief Baking soda: Fast Fix! Drinking baking soda water is an effective and safe remedy for gout pain. Baking soda can help alleviate swollen and inflamed joints caused by gout attacks. Prescription medications that lower uric acid levels are typically used to treat gout flare-ups. However, these drugs can have side effects, making baking soda a safe and convenient alternative. Let’s look at the causes of gout and how you can use baking soda to relieve gout pain. ![Gout symptom](https://www.drberg.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/man-on-bed-pillow-embrace-foot-1.jpg?w=800) ## **How to use baking soda for immediate gout pain relief** Baking soda, also known as sodium bicarbonate, is an effective natural remedy for gout pain relief and avoids the common side effects of prescription medications. Excessive uric acid, in combination with an acidic environment, stimulates the formation of uric acid crystals which trigger gout attacks. Baking soda is highly alkaline, counteracting acidic pH levels and [neutralizing uric acid in the body](https://www.drberg.com/blog/4-ways-to-neutralize-uric-acid). This helps to prevent uric acid crystals and relieves pain and inflammation associated with gout. ### **Here’s how you can use a baking soda treatment for gout relief** Mix 1/8 of a teaspoon of baking soda with eight ounces of water and stir until completely dissolved. Drink baking soda water immediately. For immediate gout attack pain relief, consume baking soda water up to four times daily, taking one hour break in between. It’s best to avoid taking baking soda water at mealtimes as baking soda can weaken stomach acid. If you tolerate ingesting baking soda, slowly increase the amount of baking soda to around half a teaspoon. Some individuals are sensitive to baking soda and experience gastrointestinal issues. In this case, a topical baking soda application can be an effective alternative. Simply dissolve three tablespoons of baking soda in warm water and

## Why Oatmeal Isn’t Good for You If you’re wondering why oatmeal isn’t good for you, the answer lies in its high carbohydrate content, which can quickly spike blood sugar levels. Despite being a source of fiber, many types of oatmeal are highly processed and can interfere with weight loss and negatively impact metabolic balance. Here’s why oatmeal isn’t a good option for those seeking to achieve weight loss and improve metabolic health, and discover nutritious breakfast alternatives. ## **What is oatmeal?** Oatmeal is a warm, porridge-like dish made from oats, a type of whole grain known for its dense texture and mild flavor. It’s a popular breakfast choice, often prepared with water or low-fat milk and topped with fruit, nuts, or spices. Oatmeal can be prepared using different types of oats, including rolled oats, which are steamed and flattened, or instant oats, which are pre-cooked and finely chopped to reduce cooking time. Another popular variety is overnight oats, which are made by soaking raw oats in liquid overnight to soften them without cooking. For a heartier texture and slower digestion, some prefer steel-cut oats, which are less processed and take longer to cook. Some oatmeal products also include oat bran, the outer layer of the grain, which adds extra fiber and may enhance the cereal’s nutritional profile. However, many people add sweeteners, such as maple syrup or use oat milk as a base, which can increase sugar intake, especially in flavored oatmeal or traditional cooked oatmeal options. Although many believe that eating oats offers heart health benefits, the high carbohydrate content of oats, especially in instant or processed forms, can cause rapid spikes in blood sugar and insulin levels. Over time, this may contribute to inflammation, weight gain, and metabolic imbalances, potentially undermining their perceived health advantages. Watch this video to discover why oatmeal might not be as healthy as you think.

## What Is Halotherapy? Uses, Benefits, and Risks Halotherapy, also known as salt therapy, originated in Eastern Europe and has been utilized in traditional medicine for centuries. It continues to be a popular holistic remedy to help promote respiratory health, improve skin conditions, enhance relaxation, and support overall well-being. Explore the numerous advantages of halo salt therapy and discover whether it’s the right choice for you. ## **What is halotherapy?** Halotherapy involves exposing the body to mineral-rich salts in controlled environments to support health and well-being. Halotherapy salt therapy typically utilizes pharmaceutical-grade sodium chloride or Himalayan sea salt, which offers other essential minerals such as calcium, iron, magnesium, copper, manganese, zinc, and potassium. Salt therapy environments are designed to create a calming and serene atmosphere, where the soothing ambiance, in combination with salt exposure, encourages relaxation and stress reduction. Depending on the type of halotherapy, salt particles are either inhaled or absorbed through the skin, which may help clear airways, reduce inflammation, improve skin condition, and promote relaxation. Additionally, the exposure to negatively charged ions during halotherapy sessions may also help counteract the physiological effects of stress, thereby supporting improved mood and overall mental clarity. Watch the video below to understand the critical difference between sea salt and table salt.## **Halotherapy methods** Halotherapy can be practiced as either dry or wet salt therapy, each offering distinct health and wellness benefits. ### **Dry salt therapy** The therapeutic benefits of dry salt therapy have been acknowledged since the 19th century, as salt miners showed faster healing rates and better respiratory health after spending extended time in salt mines.

## Endomorph Diet: Metabolism Optimization and Weight Loss Tips Following a nutritious endomorph diet is key to achieving a healthy body weight for those who naturally store more body fat and struggle with a slower metabolism. Find out if you have an endomorph body type and discover why a high-fat meal plan is the ideal diet for sustainable weight loss tailored to the unique metabolic needs of endomorphs. ## **What is the endomorph body type?** Endomorph body types are characterized by a larger, rounder frame and a predisposition to being overweight due to a naturally slower metabolism. Compared to [mesomorphs](https://www.drberg.com/blog/mesomorph-body-type), who can easily gain muscle mass, endomorphs struggle to achieve muscle growth, gain weight quickly, and find losing weight challenging. Endomorph body types are prone to excess body fat around the lower abdomen and typically have a round body frame, thick arms, and medium to large joints. Because of their body composition and higher body fat percentage, endomorphs often develop [insulin resistance](https://www.drberg.com/blog/insulin-resistance). This serious metabolic imbalance causes poor blood sugar regulation, further contributing to weight gain and creating a vicious cycle of excess body fat and difficulty losing weight. Research published in _Diabetes, Metabolic Syndrome, and Obesity_ found that endomorph body types are at greater risk of excessive weight and obesity-related health issues than ectomorphs, who have a slender body frame and generally a faster metabolism.1 While genetics plays a crucial role in determining whether an individual develops an endomorphic body type, diet and exercise also influence body composition and metabolic health. This highlights the importance of targeted dietary and lifestyle interventions to counteract the metabolic challenges, such as excess fat storage and insulin resistance, associated with an endomorph body type. !\[Different

## Mesomorph Body Type Characteristics & Diet Explained The mesomorph body type typically has a medium-sized body shape, strong leg muscles, and moderate body fat. Their metabolism works efficiently, and mesomorphs find it easy to build muscle. Find out if you have a mesomorphic body type and how to take your health and fitness to the next level. ## **What are the three metabolic body types?** According to research published in _PLOS ONE_, most people fall into one of these three metabolic body type categories:1 \* Mesomorph \* Endomorph \* Ectomorph Let’s take a look at the common characteristics of each metabolic body type. **Mesomorph** The mesomorph body type is characterized by a medium skeletal frame with broad shoulders and an upright, rectangular stature. Mesomorphs are generally described as naturally muscular, have moderate body fat, and gain muscle mass quickly. This body type indicates an effective metabolism that helps mesomorphs lose weight fast. **Ectomorph** The [ectomorph body type](https://www.drberg.com/blog/ectomorph-body-type) has a thin and slender body shape with a small waist and narrow shoulders and hips. Those with this body type are often taller than average and have lower muscle mass compared to mesomorphs. Ectomorphs are prone to a fast metabolism and have less body fat than other metabolic types. They have higher calorie needs and require plenty of energy, which is why ectomorphs find it difficult to gain weight. **Endomorph** [Endomorphs](https://www.drberg.com/blog/endomorph-diet) typically have a larger, round skeletal frame with a tendency for excess body fat. This body type generally has less muscle mass and a weaker upper body than mesomorphs. The endomorph body type has a slow metabolism. Weight gain and difficulties building lean muscle are typical amongst this metabolic type. !\[DNA

## When Does Autophagy Start? The Ultimate Answer Autophagy can be triggered by prolonged fasting and is a survival mechanism that recycles old and damaged cell components. But when does autophagy start? Though autophagy constantly occurs, the process is magnified within 16 to 48 hours of starting a fast. Discover the profound health benefits of autophagy and how to induce cellular renewal and recycling processes. ## **What is autophagy?** Autophagy, which translates from Greek into “self-eating,” refers to the body’s ability to remove and recycle damaged proteins and cellular organelles. Damaged and misfolded proteins can lead to compromised cell function and death. These toxic proteins can form due to genetic mutations, environmental toxins, oxidative stress, or age-related changes in cellular processes. Healthy cells are required for the body to produce energy, regenerate itself, and obtain nutrients from food. Impaired cell function and cell death can lead to chronic diseases, including neurodegenerative disorders and heart diseases, and can trigger tumor growth. Autophagy also helps destroy and remove potentially harmful pathogens such as bacteria, fungi, mold, and viruses. These microbes can cause various infectious diseases, allergies, and breathing difficulties. Additionally, autophagy is a survival mechanism designed to sustain periods of starvation by allowing the body to use damaged cellular components as a fuel source. ### **How autophagy works** Autophagy is triggered when cells enter survival mode through extended fasting. Reduced calorie intake deprives the body of fuel sources and nutrients needed to function. This forces cells to break down and recycle damaged or unnecessary components to generate energy. Sequestration is the first step in autophagy, characterized by the formation of a structure surrounding defective cell parts known as an autophagosome. When an autophagosome encloses a damaged cell, an organelle called a lysosome releases enzymes to

## How to Cleanse Your Liver: The Ultimate Natural Liver Detox A natural liver cleanse can help eliminate liver fat and promote the regeneration of liver cells, which enhances the liver’s natural ability to eliminate toxins from the body. Learn how to cleanse your liver to support healthy liver function and discover how poor dietary habits can increase the risk of chronic liver disease. ![Human liver illustration](https://www.drberg.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/xray-anterior-front-view-human-liver-0.jpg?w=800) ## **What does the liver do?** The liver is the body’s main detoxification organ, responsible for converting toxins, including drugs, alcohol, and heavy metals, into less harmful compounds that can be easily eliminated. The liver also regulates your metabolism and energy-making processes, stores nutrients, synthesizes proteins, controls energy storage, and helps [balance cholesterol levels](https://www.drberg.com/blog/always-fast-12-hours-before-your-cholesterol-test). In addition, liver cells produce bile salts, which are stored in the gallbladder and play a crucial role in digestive health and facilitating the absorption of dietary fats and fat-soluble vitamins. Because the liver helps maintain hormonal and metabolic balance, poor liver function can impair essential physiological processes and increase the risk of serious health consequences. While it’s well known that regular alcohol intake can lead to [liver inflammation](https://www.drberg.com/blog/seven-remedies-for-an-inflamed-liver) and cirrhosis, poor dietary habits can also significantly impact liver health.

## Bulgarian Yogurt: A Powerful Probiotic Superfood Bulgarian yogurt has a centuries-long history and is revered as one of the most authentic forms of yogurt in the world. It’s a nutrient-rich probiotic powerhouse that helps promote digestive health, strengthen immune functions, and support weight management. Discover five impressive health benefits of Bulgarian yogurt and learn how to choose the best yogurt for optimal health. ## **What is Bulgarian yogurt?** Bulgarian yogurt’s probiotic properties have been recognized as early as the 16th century, according to research published in _Biotechnology & Biotechnological Equipment._&#x31; Historical accounts suggest that French King François I found relief from chronic [diarrhea](https://www.drberg.com/blog/stop-diarrhea-fast) after consuming a diet centered around what would become known as Bulgarian yogurt, highlighting its early reputation for supporting digestive health. However, Bulgarian yogurt didn’t gain significant scientific and international recognition until the early 1900s. At that time, it became celebrated as an exclusive invention intricately tied to Bulgaria’s cultural heritage. This was mainly due to the groundbreaking work of Bulgarian microbiologist Stamen Grigorov, who first identified _Lactobacillus bulgaricus_, the key bacteria linked to Bulgarian yogurt’s potent probiotic qualities and health benefits. Unlike other yogurt varieties, such as Greek yogurt, authentic Bulgarian yogurt isn’t strained. As a result, Bulgarian yogurt is thick with a creamy consistency and tangy flavor and is often regarded as one of the finest yogurts available. This method also preserves its composition of active cultures and nutrients, which have been shown to support gut health, boost immune function, and enhance digestion. Watch the video below to learn about a high-quality Bulgarian yogurt option.

## How to Starve Herpes Using Autophagy & Fasting Herpes simplex virus infections are highly contagious and cause various symptoms, including oral and genital herpes, cold sores, and inflamed skin lesions. Learn how to starve herpes with intermittent fasting and discover the best natural remedies for managing and preventing herpes infections. ## **What is herpes?** Herpes is a viral infection caused by the herpes simplex virus and manifests as sores or lesions on the skin and mucous membranes. There are several different types of herpes virus responsible for various symptoms: \* Herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV 1) primarily causes oral herpes, characterized by blisters around the mouth \* Herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV 2) is linked to genital herpes and the development of anal or genital sores \* Varicella zoster virus causes chickenpox in children and is responsible for shingles in older adults \* Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) causes infectious mononucleosis, characterized by fever, swollen lymph nodes, and fatigue This group of viruses is highly contagious and can spread easily through direct contact with infected skin or mucous membranes. Close personal proximity, including kissing and sexual contact with an infected individual, is the primary mode of herpes transmission. All herpes viruses target cells of the sensory nervous system, where they establish latency after initial infection. The ability to remain dormant within host cells explains why a herpes simplex infection is lifelong with the potential of periodic herpes flare-ups. According to data published by the _Centers for Disease Control_, more than 50 percent of U.S. adults are believed to have contracted a herpes simplex virus infection.1 In many cases, herpes triggers little to no symptoms. However, in individuals with weak immune system function, herpes infections can lead to complications, including neurological issues and increased susceptibility to other viral

## Surprising #1 Cause & How to Heal Do you suffer from constant phlegm in the throat and a stuffy nose that’s hard to clear? Postnasal drip and frequent throat clearing can indicate imbalanced digestive function. While throat and nasal mucus can be a sign of bacterial infection, persistent and chronic phlegm caused by too much mucus production can result from low stomach acid. Let’s look at the link between low stomach acid and excessive mucus production and the steps you can take to get rid of phlegm fast. ## **What is phlegm?** Mucus glands in the lungs, nasal passages, and throat produce mucus to lubricate and moisten the upper airways and protect the lungs and sinuses from irritants and allergens by trapping debris and bacteria. However, excessive mucus production results in phlegm build-up, which can cause frequent throat clearing, postnasal drip, difficulty swallowing, chronic sinus congestion, and a persistent cough. Excess mucus in your throat can indicate various health issues, including chronic lung disease, [bacterial infections](https://www.drberg.com/blog/sinus-infection-sinusitis-2-natural-remedies), and food allergies. It’s typically treated with over-the-counter medication to loosen mucus and nasal sprays to clear congestion. However, many people suffer from constant phlegm unrelated to an infection or allergic reaction and don’t improve with medications, inhalants, sinus rinse, or other treatments. It has been suggested that imbalanced digestive function is one of the most common undiagnosed causes of treatment-resistant, chronic phlegm. Watch the video below to discover the real cause of constant phlegm.## **The most common cause of constant phlegm in your throat** Stomach acid plays a vital role in the breakdown and digestion of foods and is the body’s first-line defense against invading microbes. Low stomach acid, or hypochlorhydria, is a common

## Types of Collagen Explained: Complete Guide Many people are unaware of the different types of unique roles collagen plays in our bodies. Learning more about the basic functions of collagen in the body will be helpful to those looking to improve their overall health. ## **Understanding Collagen and Its Importance** Collagen is the protein powerhouse that holds everything together in your body. Like a matrix of strands, collagen keeps things in place. ### **The Role in Scar Tissue Formation:** Injuries happen, and when they do, collagen steps in to form scar tissues. ### **Tendons and Ligaments: The Strength Within** Tendons and ligaments, those fibrous bands connecting muscles to bones, rely on Type-1 Collagen for their strength. ### **Bones And Teeth – A Solid Foundation** About 90% of bone mass is made up of type-1 collagen. It’s the secret ingredient for a strong foundation. Collagen isn’t just one thing. There are different types with specific roles in our bodies. Let’s dive into the five fundamental types – from types 1 through 4. Each type has its unique function, whether it’s for skin health or joint flexibility. So stick around as we explore how each type contributes to our well-being. ## **The Four Key Types of Collagen** Let’s dive into the world of collagen, explicitly focusing on five main types – types 1 through 4. ### **Type 1 Collagen** **Type-1 collagen,** [the most abundant form in our bodies,](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6891674) is crucial in maintaining skin elasticity and health.

## Hormonal Acne Diet: Best Foods for Clear Skin Acne breakouts can have a detrimental impact on self-esteem and are commonly seen in adolescents. However, for some, acne can persist into adulthood. Various dietary and lifestyle habits can trigger or exacerbate hormonal acne, including stress, regular consumption of processed foods, and a high-carb diet. Discover the best hormonal acne diet to address the root cause of breakouts and learn about natural solutions to support healthy-looking skin. ## **What is hormonal acne?** [Acne](https://www.drberg.com/blog/heal-your-acne-fast), or acne vulgaris, is a skin condition that occurs when hormonal imbalances trigger an overproduction of sebum, which is an oily substance produced by the sebaceous glands in the skin. In combination with dead skin cells, excess sebum can lead to clogged pores, often resulting in blackheads, whiteheads, and inflamed cysts. Acne can develop whenever hormonal fluctuations or surges occur, such as during puberty, the menstrual cycle, pregnancy, or menopause. In most cases, acne lesions appear on the face. However, acne can also develop on the shoulders, back, neck, or chest. While puberty-related acne most commonly affects the forehead, nose, and chin, adult hormonal acne primarily manifests on the jawline, neck, and chin. Untreated acne vulgaris can lead to persistent and severe skin issues, including deep cysts, scarring, and long-term skin damage. Managing acne early on is important to prevent these complications and maintain healthy, clear skin. Watch the video below to learn about some of the best remedies for hormonal cystic acne.## **What causes hormonal acne?** Hormonal acne often results from imbalances between androgen and estrogen levels, with various factors contributing to these hormonal shifts and triggering acne flare-ups.

## Top Remedies for Dandruff You Can Try at Home If you’ve made hats a new essential part of your wardrobe to cover up the fact that you have _dandruff_, there is a better way. It turns out dandruff affects almost half of the population, so you’re not alone. But, instead of wearing a hat, using harmful dandruff shampoo, or searching out tea tree oil-let me share with you a few natural dandruff remedies that really do work. In this article: 1. **What is Dandruff?** 2. **Why Does Dandruff Happen?** 3. **Best Remedies for Dandruff** ![A woman with dandruff looking into a mirror. | Best Remedies for Dandruff](https://www.drberg.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/blog-best-remedies-for-dandruff-1.jpg?w=800) \* \* \* ## **What is Dandruff?** Dandruff can be a frustrating condition to deal with. It can be embarrassing and challenging to get rid of. Not to mention, the itchiness and discomfort that goes along with it get old pretty fast. But, what exactly is dandruff? Dandruff looks like little scaly or flaky white specks on your scalp. Your scalp could also be inflamed and reddened, causing the flakes to be a little red as well. Essentially, **dandruff is the shedding of excessive amounts of dead skin cells** that have accumulated on the scalp. A small amount of this flaking is normal, it often happens after you wash your hair. But, some people experience a more than normal amount of flaking. Sometimes this is a chronic issue, or sometimes it’s the result of certain triggers. But, contrary to popular belief, dandruff may actually improve when you wash your hair more often. It doesn’t need to be a special anti-dandruff shampoo though. A **simple mild shampoo should work just fine**. But, if you have chronic issues with dandruff, you may want to make sure your shampoo is sulfate-free and doesn’t contain parabens or sodium laureth ingredients commonly found in brand-name \[products like

## Herpes Diet Food List: Essential Foods to Know Herpes outbreaks can be a real pain, literally and figuratively. But here’s a little secret: your diet plays a big role in keeping those flare-ups under control. Eating the right foods can help keep the virus in check, while chowing down on the wrong stuff can trigger an outbreak faster than you can say “pass the chips.” Listen, I’ve been in your shoes, and I want to let you in on a little secret: what you eat can make a huge difference in managing herpes symptoms. It’s not a magic bullet, but making smart food choices can help you feel more in control and less at the mercy of outbreaks. So, if you’re ready to take charge of your health and show herpes who’s boss, keep reading for my top tips! ## **Understanding Herpes and Diet** When it comes to managing herpes outbreaks, your diet plays a crucial role. [Certain foods can trigger outbreaks](https://www.drberg.com/blog/avoid-these-foods-if-you-have-herpes), while others may help suppress the virus and keep it dormant. It all comes down to the amino acids in the foods you eat–specifically, the balance between two amino acids: arginine and lysine. ### **The Role of Amino Acids in Herpes Management** Arginine and lysine are both essential [amino acids](https://www.drberg.com/blog/what-is-an-amino-acid), meaning your body can’t produce them on its own, so you need to get them from your diet. But when it comes to herpes, these two amino acids have very different effects. Arginine can actually fuel the growth and replication of the herpes simplex virus. When you consume foods high in arginine, it can kick-start the virus and trigger an outbreak. On the flip side, lysine can help suppress the virus and keep it in check. Lysine competes with arginine for absorption in the body, so when you have more lysine in your system, it can help block arginine’s effects and reduce the risk of an outbreak. !\[Mixed

## Does Fasting Help With Acne? See What Works Home remedies for acne have become a popular topic of discussion among skincare enthusiasts. With various natural treatments available, maintaining healthy skin is easier than ever. Learn more about what can cause acne breakouts and what remedies you should adopt to heal your acne as quickly as possible. ## **Unraveling the Causes of Acne** It is important to understand the many factors that can cause acne. Among these, food allergies and hormonal imbalances emerge as significant contributors. ### **The Role of Food Allergies in Acne Development** A striking connection exists between your diet and the health of your skin. Specifically, food allergies and acne are closely linked. Consuming foods that trigger an allergic response can result in symptoms such as redness, dryness, or scaliness on your skin. These inflammatory reactions can lead to blocked pores and bacterial growth, which are common causes of acne. In addition to the visible effects on your skin, food sensitivities can disrupt gut health, leading to poor nutrient absorption. This silent yet significant factor can contribute to various dermatological issues, including acne. ### **Hormonal Imbalance as a Key Contributor to Acne** Hormonal imbalance should be taken into account when considering the etiology of acne, particularly regarding androgens’ involvement with adult female hormonal acne. In particular, male hormones, or ‘androgens,’ are closely associated with this prevalent skin condition among women. For those struggling with persistent adult female hormonal acne, it is crucial to not only consider their diets but also consult healthcare professionals to investigate potential underlying endocrine disorders. ![Healthy natural lips](https://www.drberg.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/woman-lips-nose-nature-skin.jpg?w=800) ## **Harnessing the Power of Intermittent Fasting for Clear Skin** \[Intermittent

## Proven Ways to Remove HPV Skin Tags Fast How to Rid Skin Tags and Warts Overnight – Dr. Berg Explains Imagine waking up to a skin tag or wart that just vanished overnight, like some blemish fairy waving her magic wand. Sounds too good to be true? Believe it or not, this may be more achievable than you think. You’ve probably spotted these pesky little growths before–stubborn tenants on your body’s prime real estate–and wondered why they picked you. I get it; they’re unwelcome, uninvited, and downright annoying. But hold tight because we’re about to dive deep into the nitty-gritty of what makes these bumps tick and how you can send them packing by sunrise. So buckle up; this isn’t your average bedtime story–it’s one where you could wake up with smoother skin! ## **Understanding Skin Tags and Warts** Skin tags are like those uninvited guests who pop up out of nowhere at a party. They’re small, hang by a thin stalk on your skin, and are mostly harmless. Then you’ve got warts, the rough-textured intruders that can march in clusters or stand-alone anywhere they please on your body. But why do these pesky tag-alongs decide to appear? Our DNA plays host to the human papillomavirus (HPV), which gets cozy in our skin cells and often throws these little growth parties. Surprisingly common among adults–with two out of three carrying HPV without even knowing–it’s no wonder many folks find themselves seeking ways to show these unwelcome visitors the door. ### **The Connection Between HPV and Skin Growths** You might not realize this, but having certain types of HPV is like holding an open house for skin growth. Studies have shown that four out of seven people will experience some wart during their lifetime because of this virus. [This research](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1764803) dives into how specific strains invite both benign pals–like noncancerous warts–and more ominous ones that could potentially lead to cancer if left unchecked. ### \*\*Identifying Common

## Psoriasis Relief: Avoid These Painful Triggers Psoriasis Relief: The Best Remedy For Your Skin Imagine a key quietly unlocking the shackles of discomfort psoriasis brings. That’s what some folks are saying N-acetylglucosamine (NAG) does for them. It’s not just another supplement; it might be missing in your battle against flaky, inflamed skin. You’re probably aware that psoriasis can feel like an enemy you know all too well–itchy, painful, and stubbornly persistent. But here comes NAG: with its roots in repairing gut health and its potential to soothe irritated skin, it’s stepping into the spotlight as a beacon of hope. By diving into this read, you’ll get why healing from within could mean clearer skin on the outside. And hey, we’ll even touch on how this compound goes beyond skin deep by offering joint relief–an unexpected ally hidden within those little capsules. ## **Understanding Psoriasis and Its Connection to Gut Health** [Psoriasis](https://www.drberg.com/blog/a-great-psoriasis-remedy) often brings images of red, scaly skin to mind, but it’s more than just a surface issue. It’s an autoimmune disorder that can wreak havoc beneath the skin, too–sometimes where you’d least expect it: in your gut. Imagine cells on a sprint, growing ten times faster than usual; that’s psoriasis for you. The gut-skin axis is like an underground network linking your intestines with your epidermis. And here’s something eye-opening: many folks battling psoriasis also face irritable bowel syndrome or inflammatory bowel disease–a clue hinting at this deep-rooted connection. Because let’s not forget numerous autoimmune diseases have their origins lurking in the gut. So while we chew over these facts, remember there might be more to those pesky patches than meets the eye–they could very well be signs of deeper turmoil. ## **The Role of Glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) in Skin Health** Examine how GAGs contribute to skin integrity and what their breakdown means for psoriasis sufferers.

## 14 Hour Fast Benefits Clearly Explained for You Fasting is becoming an increasingly popular topic of discussion in health communities, and many people have begun to wonder about its benefits. Learn about 14-hour fasts and the benefits they can provide for your health. ## Understanding 14-Hour Fasting and Its Health Benefits A 14-hour fast may seem simple: eat less time and consume fewer calories. But this isn’t the only benefit; it also nudges your metabolism into fat-burning mode. [Harvard researchers say so](https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/intermittent-fasting-surprising-update-2018062914156). The beauty is in its simplicity–there is no need to count every almond or berry you eat. ![Three different faces of a woman](https://www.drberg.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/woman-distress-anxiety-stress-depression-inner.jpg?w=800) ### Cognitive and Mood Enhancements Do you know how you feel sharp after cleaning up your desk? Imagine clearing out [brain fog](https://www.drberg.com/blog/brain-fog-tip) instead. Shorter fasting periods have been linked to some pretty nifty neurological perks–like mental decluttering. ## The Gradual Approach to Extending Fasting Hours Fasting can give your digestive system a much-needed break. Starting with a 14-hour fast is the perfect first step for those looking to dip their toes into intermittent fasting. So you’ve mastered the 14-hour fast and are ready for more benefits? Great. Let’s extend that window bit by bit. The trick here is not to shock your system, do it gradually and at a comfortable pace. Extending fasting times slowly allows your body time to adapt, making longer fasts feel easy. By increasing in small increments, say an hour each week, you’ll be upping your fasting game without feeling overwhelmed. ## Autophagy and Longer Fasting Durations When you think of fasting, weight loss might jump to mind.

## Dry Fasting vs. Water Fasting: Risks and Benefits Dry fasting vs. water fasting–what are the risks, and which is the better fasting routine? While dry fasting involves avoiding both food and water, water fasting allows the consumption of water only during the fasting period. Here’s how you can maximize the benefits of fasting while minimizing potential side effects. ## **Benefits of fasting** Fasting does more than just promote weight loss, as it initiates a powerful cascade of healing processes that support cellular repair, energy production, brain function, and metabolic health. Whether you choose intermittent fasting or extended fasts, allowing your body time without processing and metabolizing food can unlock a wide range of health benefits. Here are some of the top health benefits of fasting: \* Promotes brain cell regeneration \* Enhances cellular energy production \* Triggers natural repair and detoxification processes \* Stimulates stem cell production \* Reduces inflammation \* Supports normal cellular functions \* Enhances the body’s antioxidant capacity \* Improves stress resilience \* Stimulates [body fat loss](https://www.drberg.com/blog/the-7-symptoms-that-prove-you-are-in-fat-burning) \* Strengthens immune system defenses One of the most powerful benefits of fasting is autophagy, also referred to as the body’s internal housekeeping system. During autophagy, the body clears out malfunctioning proteins and regenerates new, healthy ones, which can help improve various physiological functions, including metabolic processes, enzyme activity, and nerve signal transmission. Many people fear that fasting leads to muscle loss. However, the opposite is true. Fasting triggers the release of human growth hormone (HGH), which helps preserve muscle mass and promotes fat burning instead of protein breakdown. Watch the video below to learn more about dry fasting and its potential health risks.

## Does Herbal Tea Break a Fast? Get Clarity Now Various herbal teas are commonly used to promote weight loss, boost metabolism, and improve health. But does herbal tea break a fast? No, drinking tea won’t break a fast. In fact, certain herbal teas may enhance the impressive health benefits of fasting as long as they don’t contain high-carb ingredients such as fruits, sugar, or honey. Learn more about drinking herbal tea while fasting and discover how to choose the best options to maximize your fasting success. ## **What is herbal tea?** Though some distinctions exist, tea and herbal teas are typically lumped into the same category. Traditional tea is made by steeping the leaves of the _Camellia sinensis_ plant in hot water. Only four types of tea are derived from this tea plant: black, green, oolong, and white tea. Though herbal teas are called teas, they’re actually infusions, as they’re made by steeping plants in hot water. Herbal teas don’t originate from the tea plant but are typically made from various other plants, herbs, and spices. In addition, some varieties may contain dried fruits or flowers, such as raspberries, oranges, chamomile, roses, or hibiscus. Popular fasting tea options include: \* Black tea \* Ginger tea \* Green tea \* Hibiscus tea \* Peppermint tea \* White tea Most teas are packaged in tea bags for effortless steeping, though they’re also available as loose tea leaves that undergo less processing, giving them a fresher and more aromatic flavor.

## Teeth Whitening at Home - Dr. Berg Teeth Whitening at Home A bright smile can boost your confidence. Professional whitening can be expensive, though. That’s why many people explore teeth whitening at home. Many products and methods exist. How do you know what works and is safe? This guide breaks down safe and effective at-home whitening without breaking the bank. ## **Simple Teeth Whitening at Home** Many at-home teeth whitening methods are available. One simple method uses [baking soda](https://www.drberg.com/blog/7-unexpected-benefits-of-baking-soda) and hydrogen peroxide. These are inexpensive and easy to find at a drugstore. ### **Baking Soda and Hydrogen Peroxide** Baking soda gently scrubs away surface stains and plaque. [Hydrogen peroxide](https://www.drberg.com/blog/9-unexpected-benefits-of-hydrogen-peroxide) is the active ingredient in many whitening products. For this DIY recipe, use a 3% hydrogen peroxide solution. To make the paste, mix one teaspoon of baking soda with three drops of 3% hydrogen peroxide. Then, add eight drops of water. Gently brush your teeth with the mixture for one to two minutes. Use this method two to three times per week. You should notice gradual whitening over several weeks.

## Which Nuts Have the Highest Phytic Acid? Phytic acid, also known as inositol hexakisphosphate, is a naturally occurring chemical found in nuts, seeds, and whole-grain cereals. While phytic acid offers various health benefits, it can also lead to reduced absorption of important minerals. Let’s take a detailed look at phytic acid, its role in health and mineral absorption, and what you can do to get the maximum nutritional benefit from eating nuts. ## **What is phytic acid?** Phytic acid, or phytate, is found in most edible seeds, such as nuts, whole grains, and legumes. Its primary roles are to protect the seed from damage and store large amounts of phosphorus for later use. Once the seed germinates, phytic acid releases phosphorus, which acts as a natural fertilizer, helping the seed to grow into a young plant. It’s not uncommon to find phytic acid added to commercial food products. It’s a potent antioxidant and preservative that extends the shelf life of foods. Watch the video below to learn more about phytic acid in nuts.## **Phytic acid side effects** Dietary phytates can cause digestive issues and impair the intestinal absorption of nutrients, reducing the mineral bioavailability of foods and leading to potential abdominal discomfort. Phytic acid can inhibit the activity of digestive enzymes, resulting in sluggish digestion, [bloating](https://www.drberg.com/blog/intermittent-fasting-bigger-meals-and-avoiding-excessive-bloating), and discomfort. Whether phytic acid causes symptoms depends on your digestive health, enzyme levels, and overall diet, which explains why some people react to phytate-rich foods and others don’t. Additionally, due to its chemical structure, phytic acid is considered an antinutrient. It binds easily to certain minerals and can prevent their absorption in the body, and regularly consuming phytates may result in mineral deficiencies.
