## Sarah Lost 80 Pounds and Gained Her Life Back — “I Feel Like I’ve Gained Back Lost Years!” **Name:** Sarah Evans **Starting Weight:** 239 lbs **Current Weight:** 159 lbs **Weight Lost:** 80 lbs **Inches Lost (Waist):** 13.5 inches **Method:** Keto + Intermittent Fasting **Favorite Exercise:** Mountain biking, hiking with her dog, and HIIT workouts > “**Wild horses could not drag me from scouring the cupboards for food.**“ > — Sarah Evans For years, Sarah felt stuck in an endless cycle — **emotional eating**, **cravings**, and a growing sense of defeat. No matter how hard she tried, maintaining a healthy weight seemed impossible. > “It felt like everyone else had some secret I didn’t. I couldn’t control my eating, and any attempt I made didn’t last. The weight was taking its toll — physically and mentally.” ### The Turning Point Everything changed when her best friend introduced her to **Dr. Berg’s YouTube channel**. Sarah dove into the videos, and what she discovered shocked her. > “Keto broke all the food rules I’d been taught my entire life! But it finally made sense.” For the first time, Sarah **understood the science** behind food, hunger, and weight loss. Keto and intermittent fasting gave her the **structure, knowledge, and empowerment** she had been missing. > “My blood sugar stabilized. I no longer felt driven by fake hunger or blood sugar spikes. I felt satisfied, not deprived. And I wasn’t going to bed with hunger pangs like I had on previous diets.” \* \* \* ### How She Did It Sarah took a **step-by-step approach**: 1. **Focused on staying under 25 net carbs/day** 2. Gradually incorporated other macros and nutrition goals 3. Introduced fasting windows after 7 weeks 4. Began exercising after losing her first 50 pounds > “If I had done all of these things at once, I would’ve been overwhelmed. I had to treat it like a recovery process — much like someone overcoming addiction.” Sarah stayed **completely off sugar and processed carbs for 18 months**, not even

## Brandon Lost 85 Pounds in 11 Months — and Reclaimed His Life #### Quick stats Weight Lost: 85 lbs (39kg) Favorite Exercise Lifting heavy weights Favorite Keto Recipe Mozzarella-stuffed garlic meatballs Brandon Moore’s journey began at rock bottom. He was battling **hypertension, type 2 diabetes, and alcoholism**. He would **regularly pass out**, struggled with basic tasks like **tying his shoes**, and felt like a shell of the man he used to be–physically and emotionally. > “One evening I was looking in the mirror and absolutely hated who was looking back,” said Brandon. > “I was disappointed and disgusted at how far I had driven myself down.” ### The Wake-Up Call The turning point came when he thought about his son. The idea of **not being there for him** was too painful to bear. > “The thought of not being around for my son was something that I would never allow to happen,” he said. > “It was at that moment I said _no more_ — and everything just clicked. I quit everything that day cold turkey!” ### Discovering Dr. Berg and a New Mindset A close friend at work introduced Brandon to **Dr. Berg’s YouTube channel**, which quickly became his go-to source of education and motivation. > “\[The biggest lesson I learned] was focusing on getting healthy to lose weight — not losing weight to get healthy,” Brandon shared. > “Also, using intermittent fasting and eating two meals a day greatly helped with weight loss and just feeling better overall.” Another important shift in mindset? **Trusting the process.** Brandon learned that the body must heal internally before external results show. That realization helped him stay consistent, even through plateaus. ### The Struggles and Surprises Like many others on keto, Brandon hit **several plateaus** during his journey. Breaking through them took patience, experimentation, and determination. The silver lining? Bacon. > “The best part was being able to eat _copious amounts of bacon_,” he laughed. But if he could do it all over

## Mike Lost 52 Pounds in 8 Months — and Gained a New Life **Name:** Mike Woodside **Weight Lost:** 52 lbs (24 kg) **Keto Start Date:** March 4, 2019 When Mike dressed up as Spider-Man for his son’s sixth birthday party, he had a moment of harsh clarity. At **5’3″ and 192 pounds**, the costume didn’t fit quite like he’d hoped. > “I knew after seeing what I looked like that if I was that heavy, I must have been putting my body through a lot of stress by not giving it the nutrition it needed,” he said. > “I knew that if I ate properly and gave my body the fuel it craved, it would do what was necessary.” ### Daily Life Became a Struggle Even simple activities like tying his shoes, mowing the lawn, or playing with his son left Mike winded. His clothes kept getting tighter until he reached a **size 36 waist and XL shirts**. > “I knew I was going down a bad path,” he admitted. ### Discovering Keto — Together Mike’s wife took the lead by researching the keto diet and decided it was worth trying. On **March 4, 2019**, the couple officially began their keto journey — together. > “My wife watched every single YouTube video Dr. Berg put on,” said Mike. > “He’s really where we got most of our understanding and research. I’m so thankful for him because he breaks down the science behind keto in a way that’s easy to understand. Anytime anyone asks about keto, the first thing I say is, ‘Watch Dr. Berg.'” With his wife also on board, Mike had daily support. They exchanged ideas, motivated each other, and even inspired Mike’s parents to join them. Now, **all four family members follow keto** and encourage one another along the way. ### Why This Time Was Different Before Dr. Berg, Mike tried various diets without ever understanding how or why they might work. > “I used to diet just because I heard something might work,” he explained. > “Dr. Berg taught me to understand _why_ keto works — what my body craves and needs. It wasn’t just, ‘Hey, carbs are bad’ or ‘Buy my product.’ It was

## Naomi Lost 45 Pounds and Gained Full Control of Her Health and Happiness **Name:** Naomi Adler **Age:** 37 **Location:** Southern Israel **Weight Lost:** 45 lbs (20 kg) **Keto Start Date:** July 28, 2019 **Favorite Exercises:** HIIT, Tabata, walking, yoga **Favorite Keto Recipe:** Chocolate pudding Naomi Adler, a 37-year-old mother of two, has struggled with obesity since the age of five. Diagnosed with **PCOS at 14**, she spent her early adult years trying every diet she could find — from vegan to raw vegan to Weight Watchers — but nothing ever seemed to bring her body into balance. > “I think the initial eating was emotionally based, and then it became a comfort,” Naomi said. > “I never felt that I had any control over what I put in my mouth.” ### The Motivation: A Third Child Naomi’s turning point came when she realized that if she wanted to have another child, she’d have to prioritize her health. She had gained **80 pounds (36 kg)** during each of her two pregnancies, reaching **286 pounds (130 kg)** by the end of the second one. > “I wanted to be a healthy mom for my kids and to get pregnant again,” she explained. > “I knew my body wouldn’t be able to handle the stress of pregnancy with all the excess weight I was carrying. I decided that having another baby was more important than the food I liked.” ### From Elimination to Education Naomi started small by **eliminating gluten and desserts**, which worked for a while. But after watching _The Pill_ on Netflix, she realized she needed a more profound, lasting change — not just for fertility, but to **prevent future disease**. With zero knowledge of keto beforehand, Naomi dove headfirst into learning. She discovered **Dr. Berg’s videos on YouTube**, took notes, and watched them over and over again. > “I learned how to start keto and intermittent fasting, the importance of healthy fats, how to use blood tests to monitor my health, and most importantly, that keto is not a diet — it’s a **lifestyle**,” she said.

## How to Reverse Fatty Liver Fast and Naturally Both nonalcoholic fatty liver disease and alcoholic fatty liver disease are serious health conditions. They are characterized by excess fat storage in liver cells, which leads to loss of liver function and greatly increases the risk of cirrhosis and liver cancer. Poor diet and lifestyle habits are often the root causes of liver disease and damage. However, improving your diet and lifestyle can potentially stop or reverse the progression of fatty liver disease. Let’s look at seven steps you can take to minimize liver fat buildup. ## **Seven tips to reverse fatty liver disease** According to Dr. Berg, _“While avoiding alcohol and its toxic effects on liver cells is essential to reverse fatty liver disease, making the right dietary choices is equally important.”_ A common misconception is that dietary fats are the leading cause of liver fat buildup. The most significant contributor to liver fat is a high-carbohydrate diet. Eating sugar and carbs causes a rapid spike in blood sugar levels, which triggers the release of insulin, a metabolic hormone that regulates blood sugar and energy production. When insulin is elevated, it signals the liver to convert excess blood sugar into fatty acids, which are stored in liver cells and cause fatty liver. Research published in _Nutrients_ suggests that a high-carb diet and insulin resistance significantly increase the overall risk of fatty liver.1 Here are seven ways to support a healthy liver. ### **1.** **Do Healthy Keto® and intermittent fasting** Healthy Keto® is a low-carb, high-fat diet that incorporates nutrient-rich foods. Following a nutritious low-carb diet is crucial to support balanced insulin levels and avoid blood sugar spikes that cause the deposition of fatty acids in liver cells. In addition, Healthy Keto shifts your metabolism to burn fats instead of sugars as fuel, which stimulates your liver to utilize stored fats to

## Prediabetes Diet: Best Foods to Reverse It Prediabetes is characterized by elevated blood sugar levels and is typically a result of insulin resistance, a severe metabolic imbalance linked to a diet high in sugars and carbohydrates. A prediabetes diagnosis doesn’t necessarily mean you will develop diabetes, especially if you take proactive measures such as following a prediabetes diet plan. Discover how combining a ketogenic diet with intermittent fasting promotes healthy blood sugar levels and may help reverse insulin resistance and prediabetes. ## **What is prediabetes?** Prediabetes is a health condition characterized by chronically elevated blood sugar levels, which usually are a result of a diet high in carbohydrates, added sugars, and processed foods. Foods containing sugars, cereals, refined grains, and starches, such as white rice, bread, flour, and pasta, are quickly digested and absorbed into the bloodstream, which can cause rapid blood sugar spikes. The body perceives elevated blood sugars as toxic and responds by increasing the release of insulin, a critical metabolic hormone needed to maintain normal blood glucose levels. Over time, high concentrations of insulin can make your cells less sensitive to insulin, a condition known as insulin resistance. This impairs the body’s ability to regulate blood sugar levels and is the leading cause of prediabetes. Individuals with prediabetes are at significant risk of developing type 2 diabetes and other serious health issues such as metabolic syndrome, obesity, and cardiovascular disease. Watch the video below to discover how to stop prediabetes from progressing into diabetes.## **Signs of prediabetes** According to research published in _StatPearls, “40 percent of U.S. adults aged 18 to 44 are insulin-resistant.”_&#x31; Unfortunately, there are very few early warning signs of

Our body likes to keep everything constant. This includes things like blood pressure, heart rate, and blood sugar levels. The job of keeping our blood sugar levels within a normal range belongs to the **pancreas.** The pancreas is a small organ under our left rib cage. It produces a hormone called **Fat Storing Hormone.** Fat Storing Hormone is released after we eat when the sugars in our blood go up. It helps to get rid of excess glucose so that things can come back to normal. That is how things work when everything is normal and healthy. However, when we feed our bodies too much sugar for too long, things get messy and out of balance. Here’s what happens: \* We eat a lot of sugary foods and high-carb foods. As a result, [our blood sugar](https://www.drberg.com/blog/the-myth-about-blood-sugars-and-diabetes) levels are constantly elevated. \* In the presence of too much glucose all of the time, the cells start to reject sugar.

## 7 Important Vitamins and Nutrients for Eye Health Vision changes are often considered a natural part of aging, but poor eye health can also be closely linked to inadequate nutrient intake. Eating a balanced diet of whole foods rich in essential vitamins and minerals can help promote eye health and may reduce the risk of developing ocular disease. Discover seven important vitamins for eye health and learn how a nutritious ketogenic diet helps support vision naturally. ## **7 important vitamins and nutrients for eye health** Aging and nutrient deficiencies are linked to poor or worsening eyesight. Maintaining a balanced diet rich in eye-supporting vitamins, minerals, and fatty acids can promote healthy vision and may reduce the risk of ocular issues. Here are seven essential nutrients for supporting eye health. ### **1. Vitamin A** Vitamin A helps produce photopigments in the retina via a process known as phototransduction, which is how the eye captures the light spectrum. This fat-soluble vitamin also assists in lubrication, which may help reduce the risk of dry eye disease and vision loss. _“Vitamin A is one of the most important eye vitamins and may help improve night blindness, dry eye, and reduce the risk of cataracts as you age,”_ explains Dr. Berg. Vitamin A exists in two main forms: retinol and beta carotene. Retinol is the most bioavailable form of vitamin A and is found in animal-based foods, such as beef, chicken, organ meats, oily fish, eggs, and dairy. Beta carotene is a plant-based precursor to retinol found in colorful vegetables such as carrots, butternut squash, and leafy greens. Vitamin A deficiency is often caused by an ultra-processed diet, malabsorption issues due to [intestinal permeability](https://www.drberg.com/blog/intestinal-permeability-or-leaky-gut), or low bile production. Because vitamin A is fat-soluble, it requires the presence of fatty acids and bile to be absorbed. This leaves those with bile deficiency or a \[sluggish

## Keto Diet Food List | 200+ Keto-Approved Foods The keto diet is becoming increasingly popular and for a good reason–it delivers consistent and long-lasting results! If you’re ready to start a nutritious and health-focused low-carb lifestyle, this Keto Food List provides a comprehensive guide to Healthy Keto®-approved foods that keep you in ketosis, promote fat burning, and support overall health and well-being. ## **What is keto?** The ketogenic diet is a high-fat, moderate-protein, and low-carbohydrate eating plan designed to shift your metabolism from relying on glucose to burning fat for fuel. When carbohydrate intake is limited, your body breaks down fat into ketones, an efficient alternative energy source produced by the liver. Once ketones start to enter the bloodstream and begin to fuel the cells, your body enters a metabolic state known as ketosis. Vital organs such as the heart, brain, and muscles actually prefer using [ketones](https://www.drberg.com/blog/doing-keto-but-no-ketones-in-urine-heres-why) over glucose, making ketosis not only effective but also metabolically beneficial. _“Carbohydrates rapidly raise blood sugar levels and stimulate insulin release,”_ explains Dr. Berg. _“Elevated insulin inhibits fat burning and promotes fat storage, which is why high-carb diets are a major contributor to weight gain.”_ To initiate and maintain ketosis, it’s essential to keep blood sugar and insulin levels stable. This is typically achieved by limiting net carbohydrate intake to 20 to 50 grams per day. The longer you remain in ketosis, the more efficiently your body adapts to burning fat as its primary energy source. This metabolic shift supports sustainable weight loss, stable energy levels, enhanced mental clarity, improved mood, and better memory function. In addition, research published in _Signal Transduction and Targeted Therapy_ highlights the potential role of a low-carbohydrate, high-fat diet in managing and preventing various chronic

## Keto Diet for Beginners: Comprehensive Healthy Keto® Guide Starting a ketogenic diet can feel overwhelming, but it doesn’t have to be. This comprehensive keto diet for beginners guide breaks down everything you need to know–from how it works and what to eat to how to avoid common mistakes. Whether you’re aiming to lose weight, improve your energy, or simply eat healthier, this beginner-friendly approach to Healthy Keto® will help you get started on a low-carb lifestyle. ## **What is the keto diet?** The ketogenic diet is a low-carbohydrate, moderate-protein, high-fat diet designed to shift the body’s primary energy source from glucose to fat. This dietary approach significantly reduces carb intake, pushing the body into a metabolic state known as ketosis. In ketosis, the liver converts fats into ketone bodies, a group of organic acids that serve as a highly efficient fuel source when glucose is scarce. In fact, brain cells, muscle tissue, and the heart prefer using ketones for energy, making them a powerful alternative fuel that supports mental clarity, physical endurance, and metabolic efficiency. Reducing carbohydrate intake helps stabilize blood sugar and lower insulin levels, two key factors that allow the body to access stored fat for energy. _“Insulin, a key metabolic hormone, not only regulates blood sugar balance but also promotes fat storage and inhibits fat burning,”_ explains Dr. Berg. _“By keeping insulin levels low, a low-carb diet enables the body to tap into stored body fat, which explains why keto is considered one of the most effective weight loss diets.”_ The classic ketogenic diet was originally developed in the 1920s as a therapeutic treatment for epilepsy, as ketones have a stabilizing effect on brain activity and help reduce seizures. Over time, health professionals began to explore its broader applications, and today, the keto diet is widely adopted for its potential to support weight loss, enhance mental clarity, promote metabolic balance

## Keto Diet Guide: What to Eat, and Benefits The ketogenic diet is a low-carb meal plan that pushes the body into ketosis–a metabolic state of fat-burning. Keto not only supports weight loss but also offers impressive benefits for heart health, brain function, mental well-being, and immune support. Here’s a complete keto guide covering the benefits of following a nutritious Healthy Keto® diet and how to successfully adopt a low-carb lifestyle. ## **What is the keto diet?** The ketogenic diet is a high-fat, moderate-protein, very low-carbohydrate eating plan that encourages the body to burn fat for fuel instead of relying on carbohydrates. By significantly reducing carbohydrate intake, this high-fat diet shifts the body into a metabolic state known as ketosis, where fat becomes the primary energy source. Originally developed in the 1920s, the keto diet was first used as a therapeutic approach to treat epilepsy, particularly in children who didn’t respond well to conventional treatments. As the body burns fat to generate energy, the liver releases ketones, which have a stabilizing effect on brain activity and help reduce the frequency and severity of seizures in epilepsy patients. Today, the keto diet has gained popularity not only for its therapeutic origins but also for its potential benefits in areas such as weight loss, blood sugar regulation, and overall metabolic health. In addition, the ketogenic diet has shown potential to lower the risk of neurological disorders and heart disease, and may serve as an effective dietary strategy to support diabetes management and complement certain cancer treatments.

## How Much Fat Should I Eat on Keto? The ketogenic diet is praised for its potential to promote weight loss, improve metabolic health, and enhance cognitive function. If you recently started a low-carb diet, you may ask yourself, how much fat should I eat on keto? Let’s look at the ideal fat intake on a ketogenic diet and discover how to incorporate enough healthy fats into your meals. ## **What is the keto diet?** The ketogenic diet triggers fat burning by significantly reducing carbohydrate intake and refocusing on increasing consumption of fat, protein, and vegetables. This dietary shift induces a metabolic state known as ketosis, where the body becomes efficient at burning fat to generate energy instead of relying on glucose from carbohydrates as a fuel source. Watch this video to learn how much fat to eat on a keto diet.## **Is fat healthy?** For decades, it was widely believed that consuming fat, especially saturated fats, is the primary cause of heart disease and obesity. However, recent findings have painted a more nuanced picture of dietary fat. Not all fatty acids are the same, and many have been found to be essential for optimal health. For instance, medium-chain triglycerides (MCTs) in coconut oil support weight loss, reduce inflammation, and may help mitigate symptoms of metabolic syndrome. According to research published in _Frontiers in Nutrition_, _“Systematic studies find no significant association between saturated fat intake and coronary artery disease or mortality, and some even suggested a lower risk of stroke with higher consumption of saturated fat.”_&#x31; That said, it’s important to note that while fat is a crucial component of a healthy diet, the source and quality of the fat are important considerations. Trans fats from seed oils, found in many processed and fried foods, have been linked to various

## Keto Flu: Fast Relief Tips and Expert Advice Keto is a low-carb, high-fat diet that promotes weight loss, supports healthy blood sugar levels, and may reduce the risk of cardiovascular and neurodegenerative disease. However, those new to keto can experience side effects similar to the flu virus, including body aches, fatigue, and brain fog. These symptoms are often referred to as keto flu and are a common phenomenon for those adapting to a high-fat diet. Learn what causes the keto flu and discover how to improve symptoms quickly. ## **What is the keto flu?** The average American adult consumes between 225 and 325 grams of carbohydrates daily. However, ketogenic diets require no more than 20 to 50 grams per day. The keto flu, also known as the carb flu, is a common side effect of this dramatic reduction in carbohydrate intake, which can trigger symptoms similar to the flu, though it’s not a virus. This phenomenon typically results from the body adapting to the profound metabolic changes caused by switching from using glucose as a fuel source to burning fat to generate energy. The breakdown of fat releases large amounts of ketones, a group of organic acids that serve as a highly effective energy source. When ketones start to fuel your body, you enter the metabolic state of fat-burning, also known as ketosis. Your cells may have to adapt to using ketones as a primary fuel source instead of relying on carbohydrates, which can lead to temporary side effects. Watch the video below to learn how to overcome the keto flu.## **Causes** B vitamin deficiencies and imbalanced electrolytes, particularly sodium and potassium, are the most common causes of keto flu symptoms. Most people obtain B vitamins from fortified grains, legumes, and fruits and vegetables, including watermelons, apples, and potatoes. Many vitamin B-rich foods aren’t keto-friendly, and keto dieters often

## Keto Rash: Causes and Remedies Explained You recently started keto and now have an itchy rash? You may have developed a keto rash. Keto rash can happen during the early weeks of keto and is nothing to be concerned about–it can actually be a sign that your body is [adapting to ketosis](https://www.drberg.com/blog/what-is-keto-adaptation). Transitioning your body to burn fat instead of carbs for energy requires significant changes in your metabolic state. As your body adapts, keto rash will likely clear up and heal on its own. Let’s talk about what causes keto rash and learn what steps you can take to help your skin clear up quickly. ![Keto rash on torso](https://www.drberg.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/scratching-itchy-skin-sensitive-keto-rash.jpg?w=800) The exact cause for keto rash isn’t very well understood yet. But, we do understand how ketosis changes your metabolism and how this may contribute to developing itchy skin. A skin condition called prurigo pigmentosa has almost identical symptoms and commonly occurs in people who have undergone bariatric surgery, are developing diabetes, or started excessive fasting. [Research](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8903224/) suggests that the keto rash is similar to prurigo pigmentosa and caused by skin inflammation in response to ketosis. Keto rash is rare, and it doesn’t mean keto isn’t right for you. Understanding its causes is the first step to finding solutions for getting rid of keto rash fast. Here are six potential causes of keto rash. ### **Increased fat turnover** As your body enters ketosis, you start to burn fat for energy. This mobilizes your metabolism to release more body fat to provide a steady fuel source. Fat doesn’t just store energy; fat also binds to toxins and metabolic waste products. As your body frees up more fat, your liver has to detoxify increasing amounts of toxins. The skin is one route for your body to excrete toxins, and the greater demand on your liver to detoxify during the

## Is Hummus Keto-Friendly or Too High in Carbs? Hummus is an incredibly healthy and delicious savory dish that’s extremely popular. You won’t have difficulties finding a variety of hummus in health food stores and supermarkets. You may be concerned that hummus is high in carbs and unsuitable for a ketogenic diet. No need to worry! Hummus is low-carb, keto-friendly, and on our Healthy Keto® [food list](https://www.drberg.com/blog/ketogenic-diet-food-list). ## **What is hummus?** Hummus is a staple of Middle Eastern and Mediterranean cuisines and is typically served as a creamy dip, savory spread, or added to various recipes as a condiment. Hummus is made by pureeing chickpeas, tahini, olive oil, [lemon juice](https://www.drberg.com/blog/why-lemons-are-essential-on-a-ketogenic-diet), sea salt, and garlic in a food processor until silky and creamy. Traditional hummus is typically topped with smoked paprika and served with raw or roasted veggies. While traditional hummus remains the most popular choice, there are now many different varieties, including roasted cauliflower hummus, black soybean hummus, and even hummus made from macadamia nuts. ## **Is hummus safe on keto?** There is a common misconception that hummus isn’t a keto-friendly dip. While chickpeas contain some carbs, they also are rich in fiber resulting in an overall low net-carb count. The high amounts of healthy fats in olive oil and tahini also buffer the impact of carbs on your blood sugar and insulin levels. Hummus is a great dip, but it’s best to avoid eating too much in one sitting and measure your serving sizes to keep track of your daily net carbs. A typical portion size of two tablespoons of hummus contains only around four grams of net carbs, which won’t kick you out of ketosis. Check out the video below to learn more about the health benefits of hummus and why you can enjoy hummus as part of your keto diet.

## Does OMAD Slow Metabolism? The Facts You Need ## **Boost Your Metabolism with OMAD for Effective Weight Loss** Regarding optimizing your metabolic health, the concept of One Meal A Day (OMAD) has attracted significant attention in recent years. [Combining the ketogenic diet and OMAD intermittent fasting](https://www.drberg.com/blog/why-you-need-keto-and-intermittent-fasting) can lead to impressive weight loss results while promoting overall well-being. Discover the science behind how intermittent fasting boosts metabolism and explore factors that influence the metabolic rate when doing OMAD. Learn about the difference between low-calorie diets with low-carb diets, examining their respective caloric intake levels and fat-burning potential. ## **Intermittent Fasting and Metabolism** One of the most popular trends in health and nutrition is intermittent fasting, specifically eating only one meal a day (OMAD). This dietary pattern has been linked to various health benefits, such as weight loss, improved well-being, and even increased life expectancy. ### **The Science Behind Intermittent Fasting and Metabolism** When you practice intermittent fasting, your body undergoes several physiological changes that can impact your metabolism. One significant change is a decrease in insulin levels during the fasting period. Lower insulin levels allow your body to access stored fat more efficiently as an energy source instead of relying on glucose from carbohydrates. In addition to improved fat-burning capabilities, studies have also shown that intermittent fasting may increase the metabolic rate by up to 14 percent through enhanced production of norepinephrine – a hormone responsible for stimulating thermogenesis or heat production. This boost in metabolism can help you burn more calories throughout the day while maintaining muscle mass. ## **Factors That Can Influence the Metabolic Rate** **Diet:** Consuming plenty of healthy fats and moderate amounts of protein during one meal

## Keto Cheat Day: What Happens and How to Recover Transitioning to a ketogenic diet requires significant dietary changes, and keto-friendly foods aren’t always readily available. Social events, lack of preparation, and carb cravings can make it challenging to stay on track with a low-carb diet, increasing the likelihood of indulging in a keto cheat day. Discover why you should avoid cheat days on keto and learn how to get back into ketosis after a high-carb meal quickly. In the low-carb community, not tracking your daily net carb count and indulging in high-carb foods is commonly known as a keto cheat day. A cheat meal usually includes foods that are typically off-limits, such as bread, rice, pasta, potatoes, or desserts. While a keto cheat day may not seem like a big deal, it can disrupt your progress by kicking you out of ketosis. This metabolic state shifts your body from fat-burning to using carbohydrates and sugars as fuel sources. This can lead to a setback in achieving your health and wellness goals, including slowing weight loss, and may require extra effort to get back on track. In addition, high-carb meals lead to blood sugar fluctuations that can leave you feeling sluggish and trigger cravings for more carbs. This creates a cycle of fluctuating energy levels and persistent cravings, making it even harder to return to your keto routine and maintain consistency. Watch the video below to learn how to recover from a keto cheat day.## **How long does it take to get back into ketosis after a cheat day?** The time it takes to get back into ketosis after a cheat day largely depends on your metabolic flexibility, age, activity level, and the amount of carbs you consume during your cheat meal. While some individuals can re-enter fat-burning within two days, others may need more than a week \[to get back into ketosis after a cheat

## Intermittent Fasting Fatigue? Here’s What to Do You recently started intermittent fasting and now feel wiped out? Intermittent fasting fatigue is common and nothing to be concerned about–it can actually indicate that your body is adapting to ketosis. Intermittent fasting primes your metabolism to use fat instead of carbs as fuel and changes how your cells utilize energy. As your body adjusts to periodic fasting, fasting-related fatigue will likely disappear on its own. Let’s talk about the common causes of intermittent fasting fatigue and what steps you can take to minimize intermittent fasting side effects. ## **Five causes of intermittent fasting fatigue–and what to do** According to research published in _Behavioral Science_, feeling tired is one of the most common side effects after starting intermittent fasting.1 _“The good news is that intermittent fasting fatigue is temporary, and you can take plenty of steps to overcome this side effect of fasting,”_ says Dr. Berg. Here are five common triggers of fasting-related fatigue. ### **1. Low blood sugar** Low blood sugar is among the top reasons for feeling tired and drained after starting intermittent fasting. During fasting periods, your body relies on ketones for energy. During the early days of intermittent fasting, your brain and muscle cells aren’t very efficient in using this new fuel source, which can quickly cause fatigue, brain fog, and exhaustion. Low blood sugar can also indicate that you are trying to achieve long fasting periods too quickly. Kathy McManus, registered dietitian and director of the Department of Nutrition at Harvard-affiliated Brigham and Women’s Hospital, advises, _“Easing into an intermittent fasting plan can help your body adjust. Slowly reduce the time window for eating over a period of several months.”_ If you feel exhausted, shorten your fasting period and add a meal. If you feel better, slowly prolong fasting periods, listen to your

## Intermittent Fasting Gallstones: What to Know You took the plunge and decided to go keto. Then you learned to [combine keto with intermittent fasting](https://www.drberg.com/blog/keto-and-intermittent-fasting-the-big-overview-for-beginners) to enhance your results of weight loss, more energy, and sharper mental clarity. But a friend mentioned to you that she’d heard fasting causes gallstones. Gallstones? Aren’t they really painful? That’s no good! Maybe you should rethink this whole fasting lifestyle thing. Not so fast… Instead, let’s set the record straight about whether intermittent fasting causes gallstones. In this article: – 1. **What Causes Gallstones** 2. **Gallstones Can Be Serious** 3. **How To Decrease Your Risk Of Gallstones** 4. **Intermittent fasting doesn’t cause gallstones** ![a picture of gallstones in a gallbladder](https://www.drberg.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/blog-will-intermittent-fasting-cause-gallstones-1.jpg?w=800) \* \* \* ## **It’s Important To Understand What Causes Gallstones** The first thing for you to understand is what gallstones are, and what causes them. Gallstones are hardened deposits of a digestive fluid called bile, which is stored in your gallbladder after bile is made in your liver. Your gallbladder is a small organ on the right side of your abdomen, just beneath your liver. The bile is concentrated in your gall bladder, which makes the bile quite powerful. Its role is to break down and extract nutrients from the fat in your diet after it’s released into the small intestine. This is normal; therefore, despite what many people believe, it’s not concentrated bile that results in gallstones. Rather, it’s a lack of bile that causes gallstones. That’s why you need to eat in a way that makes your body produce enough bile to keep you from getting gallstones. One primary trigger for your body to make bile is eating saturated fats. That’s why people who go on a low saturated-fats diet

Learn how to make bulletproof coffee and discover why too much keto coffee may interfere with your weight loss goals. ## **What is bulletproof coffee?** Bulletproof coffee is a delicious beverage that combines black coffee, unsalted butter, and medium-chain triglycerides (MCT). It’s essentially a more nutritious version of butter coffee, a traditional Asian high-fat coffee drink. Bulletproof coffee is carb-free and has no impact on blood sugar and insulin levels, which makes it a popular choice for people on a ketogenic diet and those practicing intermittent fasting. Watch the video below to learn why bulletproof coffee won’t interfere with your intermittent fasting plan.## **Why bulletproof coffee is safe while fasting** Bulletproof coffee is a rich source of high-quality saturated fat and antioxidants. Regularly consuming keto coffee can help maintain energy levels, [curb cravings](https://www.drberg.com/blog/probiotics-for-sugar-cravings), and extend your fasting period. Bulletproof coffee is safe during fasting. It doesn’t contain carbs and won’t raise your blood sugar or insulin levels, keeping your metabolism in a natural fasting state. MCTs are saturated fatty acids that the liver rapidly converts into ketones, a group of organic acids that serve as a readily available energy source.

But hold up – have you thought about how you’re fueling your body during that single, crucial meal? Nutrient supplementation on OMAD isn’t just a fancy phrase; it’s the key to unlocking your full potential on this journey. As an OMAD pro (or aspiring pro), you know that every bite counts. But are you making those bites work hard enough for you? The truth is, even the most well-rounded OMAD meal can benefit from a little extra nutritional love. That’s where strategic supplementation comes in, filling in the gaps and supercharging your success. So, my fellow one-meal-a-day warriors, are you ready to take your OMAD game to the next level? Let’s talk about how to supplement like a boss and give your body the VIP treatment it deserves. Trust me, your cells will thank you. ## **Understanding OMAD and Nutrient Supplementation** The [One Meal a Day (OMAD)](https://www.drberg.com/blog/23-benefits-of-one-meal-a-day) diet has gained popularity as an effective way to lose weight and improve overall health. But how exactly does it work? Let’s dive into the basics of OMAD and explore the importance of nutrient supplementation to maintain your well-being while following this eating pattern. ### **The Science Behind OMAD** OMAD involves fasting for approximately 23 hours and consuming daily calories within a single meal. This approach to intermittent fasting has been shown to offer several potential health benefits, including weight loss and improved blood sugar levels. When you fast for extended periods, your body enters a metabolic state called ketosis, which starts burning stored fat for energy. This process helps shed excess pounds and promotes better insulin sensitivity, which can lower your risk of developing type 2 diabetes. ### **Key Nutrients to Focus On** While OMAD can be an effective tool for weight loss and metabolic

## Feeling Weak While Fasting? Causes & Fixes Intermittent fasting is a practice that has been gaining traction, yet many find it challenging to implement effectively. Understanding the nuances of [intermittent fasting](https://www.drberg.com/blog/tags/intermittent-fasting) is essential to reap its benefits without experiencing discomfort or setbacks. Learn tips for effective intermittent fasting to improve your overall health and well-being. ## **The Concept of Intermittent Fasting** Periodic fasting is a dietary technique that shifts between times of consuming and not eating. This approach can range from skipping meals such as breakfast to more prolonged fasts, lasting up to 24 hours or longer. This method has garnered attention due to its potential benefits for weight loss and overall health enhancement. [Research indicates](https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/intermittent-fasting-surprising-update-2018062914156) intermittent fasting may enhance insulin sensitivity, aid in burning fat stores efficiently, and potentially assist with managing type 2 diabetes. A high-fat diet found within [ketogenic](https://www.drberg.com/blog/tags/ketogenic-diet) meal plans often accompanies this form of fasting. The rationale behind combining these approaches is that consuming healthy fats helps your body transition seamlessly into a state where it uses stored fat for energy during fasting. ### **Potential Challenges Associated With Intermittent Fasting** While many individuals find success through intermittent fasting, some might experience symptoms like weakness or faintness after extended periods without food intake. Recognizing these signs is crucial as they could indicate your current regimen needs adjustment. If you’re starting an alternate-day fasting plan or attempting a weekly 24-hour fast entirely for the first time, be prepared; initial discomfort that usually subsides over time is a common experience when beginning this new lifestyle change. ## \*\*Recognizing Signs of

## Does apple cider vinegar break a fast? Does apple cider vinegar break a fast? No, with zero grams of carbs per tablespoon, apple cider vinegar (ACV) is unlikely to impact your metabolic fasting state. Let’s explore the potential benefits of incorporating ACV into your fasting routine. ## **What is apple cider vinegar (ACV)?** ACV is made by crushing apples and adding yeast to ferment their natural sugars into alcohol. Then, beneficial bacteria are introduced to convert the alcohol into acetic acid, the main compound responsible for vinegar’s sharp flavor and potential health benefits. _“Unfiltered ACV contains the mother, a complex mixture of bacteria, enzymes, and proteins that forms naturally during fermentation,”_ explains Dr. Berg. _“These components are believed to contribute to ACV’s health benefits, including promoting gut health and aiding the body’s natural cleansing processes.”_ Some people also combine ACV with herbal teas to create nourishing drinks that may support digestion and enhance hydration. In the kitchen, ACV is valued for its bright, tangy flavor and is commonly used in salad dressings, marinades, sauces, and even baking. According to data published by the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), one tablespoon of ACV contains:1 \* 1.9 calories \* 0 g fat \* 0 g protein \* 0 g carbohydrates In addition, apple cider vinegar contains around 6 percent acetic acid, placing it among the vinegars with the highest concentrations, alongside white distilled vinegar and some types of balsamic vinegar. Watch the video below to find out if ACV is fasting-friendly.## **Does apple cider vinegar break a fast?** No, ACV won’t break a fast when consumed in small amounts. Just 1 to 2 tablespoons contain virtually no calories or carbohydrates, making it unlikely to interfere with ketosis or the benefits of fasting. In fact,

## 2.5 Months on Keto: A Busy Mom’s Life-Changing Health Turnaround I would like to begin by saying that I’ve only been on the **ketogenic diet for 2.5 months**, and that is what the photos reflect — **I’m not done yet**. I’ve lost **26 lbs** so far and I feel great! I mean, not only with how I’m looking on the outside, but I feel great health-wise. \* \* \* ### Before Keto: Weekly Health Crashes At age **28**, I began to feel sick **every single week**. I would start shaking, and a lot of times my vision would go black and I would lose balance — and I had no idea why. My **blood pressure would spike to the 160s**, I had **migraines every week**, and I had **acid reflux** along with a lot of **stomach pain** — so much that it would keep me up at night. \* \* \* ### How I Found Dr. Berg Then my mom, who is diabetic and was trying to come off **Fat Storing Hormone**, sent me a video of Dr. Berg explaining **Fat Storing Hormone resistance**. As I was trying to help her, I kept hearing him mention this **keto diet**, and I kept thinking, _“What in the world is this diet?”_ So, I became **obsessed with learning from Dr. Berg**, and that’s when I decided I needed to do this for myself. \* \* \* ### Results So Far I no longer have **any of those symptoms** — I mean, they literally went away! I can **fast for long hours** without feeling hungry, and the diet itself made my life easier because I’m a **busy mom**, and I don’t have time to be thinking about eating **six times a day**! I’m as **healthy as I’ve ever been**, my **hormonal levels are changing**, and this even reflects in my **menstrual cycle** — it’s crazy, but a **good kind of crazy**, lol. \* \* \* ### No Going Back I will **never go back** to eating **refined carbs, gluten, sugar**, and all the other junk **ever again**! \* \* \* ### A Funny Bonus By the way, my husband loves to **garden and raise chickens**, which I **HATED with all my being** — and now that I’m educated, I actually **love it** and can \*\*appreciate all he

## Natural Bodybuilding Transformation with Keto: My Journey **Hi Dr. Berg,** First off, I’d like to thank you for all that you do — helping and educating people who want to better themselves in every way possible. I watch your videos every day, and I learn something new every day. I share your videos with family and friends, and they are blown away. I am humbly thankful and wish you were my actual family doctor. God bless you! ### Me and My Success Story (and Ongoing Goal) **Age:** 29 years old **Height:** 6’1″ \* **June 1, 2016** — 255 lbs, 30-40% body fat \* **May 1, 2017** — 200 lbs, 9-11% body fat I am looking to enter a **bodybuilding competition on June 10, 2017**. I am all natural, with no synthetic steroid use. It’s all **ketogenic** and **daily training**. From **June 2016 to September 2016**, I cleaned up my diet by cutting out junk food, avoiding overeating, and quitting alcohol. I heard about the **ketogenic diet** in July 2016 and began studying it. Upon in-depth research, I decided to give it a go in September — and I have been keto ever since. My training and dieting have been entirely self-directed, with guidance from your videos and other great resources such as **Primal Edge Health**. I work in a supplement store where we sell products to support general health, bodybuilders, and athletes. I understand the potential risks of bodybuilding competitions and how they can stress the body. But I want to inspire people and help prove that it’s possible to better yourself when you truly commit — not just for bodybuilding, but for **general health**. Thank you again, Dr. Berg.

## What Is the Most Important Electrolyte? While many physiological functions rely on proper electrolyte balance, studies indicate that over 75 percent of Americans may not be getting enough essential minerals, including potassium. Let’s explore why potassium is the most important electrolyte and learn how to maintain optimal electrolyte levels. ## **What are electrolytes?** Electrolytes are essential minerals that carry an electric charge when dissolved in liquids, such as blood and other body fluids, including lymph and interstitial fluid. The body’s key electrolytes include potassium, sodium, magnesium, calcium, chloride, and phosphate. [Electrolytes](https://www.drberg.com/blog/electrolytes-for-fasting) can be obtained from a wide range of foods and beverages, with fruits and vegetables typically containing the highest concentrations of these minerals. They’re also present in other food sources such as meats, dairy, nuts, and seeds, and the electrolytes sodium and chloride can be obtained through [sea salt](https://www.drberg.com/blog/does-salt-break-a-fast) or table salt. When dietary intake is insufficient, electrolytes can also be taken as supplements. These essential minerals are involved in fluid and electrolyte balance, energy production, muscle contractions, and the transmission of nerve impulses. Electrolytes also help regulate the body’s acid-base balance, maintaining a stable pH needed for enzyme activity, cellular function, and metabolic processes. Imbalanced electrolyte levels can impair various biochemical pathways, affecting overall well-being and leading to symptoms such as tiredness and [muscle soreness](https://www.drberg.com/blog/muscle-twitching-after-starting-keto). Watch the video below to learn why potassium is the most important electrolyte.## **Signs of electrolyte imbalance** Electrolytes work together to support physiological functions,

## Is Cornstarch Keto-Friendly? | Dr. Berg Cornstarch is often used to thicken soups, sauces, desserts, and various other dishes. But is cornstarch keto? No, cornstarch isn’t keto-friendly because it’s ultra-processed and high in carbs, which can quickly derail your keto goals. Fortunately, there are several low-carb alternatives that work well for a ketogenic diet. Find out why you should avoid cornstarch on keto and explore the best low-carb substitutes for your keto recipes. ## **What is cornstarch?** Cornstarch is a thickening agent typically used to thicken soups, gravies, and sauces while also improving the texture and consistency of various baked goods. It’s a fine white powder made from the starchy endosperm of corn kernel seeds, which makes up approximately 82 percent of the kernels’ dry weight. Due to its extensive processing, cornstarch has no nutritional value, meaning it has been stripped of essential vitamins, minerals, and fatty acids. One tablespoon of cornstarch contains: \* 30 calories \* 0 grams fat \* 0 grams protein \* 7 grams total carbs \* 0 grams fiber \* 7 grams net carbs Watch the video below to learn more about the dangers of corn on keto.## **Is cornstarch keto-friendly?** Due to its neutral flavor and versatility, cornstarch is a popular thickening agent used in various cuisines to prevent mixtures from separating, coat fried foods, and thicken liquid-based dishes and desserts. Cornstarch is also naturally gluten-free, making it a widely used ingredient in gluten-free recipes. However, cornstarch isn’t keto-friendly due to its high carb count.

## Keto Fats: Your Guide to the Best and Worst Ketogenic diets limit carbohydrate intake while obtaining most of the daily calorie requirements from fat. However, the quality of the fat matters just as much as quantity. Discover the best keto fats and which ones to avoid, and learn how incorporating healthy fats into your meals promotes overall well-being. ## **Why you need dietary fat for optimal wellness** Fat is one of the three macronutrients essential for human health. Dietary fat is an excellent energy source, providing more than twice the calories per gram compared to carbohydrates and proteins. This makes it an efficient fuel source, especially for those following a low-carb [ketogenic diet](https://www.drberg.com/blog/ketogenic-diet-side-effects), which shifts the body into a fat-burning mode to generate energy. In addition, dietary fat is needed to efficiently absorb fat-soluble vitamins A, D, E, and K, critical for various bodily functions, including immune support, bone health, and vision. Omega-3 fatty acids, a type of polyunsaturated fat, are key components of cell membranes. They help maintain the integrity and fluidity of the membranes required to support the functions of vital tissues and organs, including the brain and heart. Research also highlights the importance of dietary fat in cognitive health and mood regulation. Evidence published in the _Special Journal of the Medical Academy and Other Life Sciences_ shows a strong association between dietary intake of omega-3 fatty acids and improved mood, reduced depression, and enhanced cognitive function.1 Fats also help you feel full and satisfied, reducing overeating and cravings. This satiety effect is critical when following a [Healthy Keto®](https://www.drberg.com/guides-resources/healthy-ketosis-acceptable-foods-list) diet plan, which not only prioritizes high-quality fats but aims to integrate regenerative methods such as intermittent fasting.

## Tasty & Quick Keto Breakfast Ideas to Try Starting your day with a nutritious keto breakfast is a great way to fuel your body with healthy fats and protein. Here are six keto breakfast ideas that’ll support fat-burning, promote weight loss, and provide you with a consistent supply of energy throughout the day. ## **What is keto?** The ketogenic diet, also known as keto, is a low-carb, high-fat diet that puts your body in a state of ketosis. During ketosis, your body shifts its main fuel supply from carbs and sugars to fat, explains. As the liver burns fats to generate energy, it releases large amounts of ketones, which are an efficient fuel source for your cells. The typical macronutrient distribution to achieve and maintain ketosis involves around 70 percent fat, 20 percent protein, 5 percent non-starchy vegetables, and 5 percent other carbs. [Healthy Keto®](https://www.drberg.com/blog/healthy-keto-plan-start-here) focuses on high-quality, low-carb foods that promote metabolic flexibility, healthy body weight, and steady energy levels. Furthermore, research published in _Nutrients_ summarizes, _“Many studies have now demonstrated that the ketogenic diet reduces both blood glucose and insulin levels.”_&#x31; This suggests that keto may help improve insulin sensitivity over time, which is beneficial for individuals with insulin resistance, prediabetes, or type 2 diabetes. Watch the video below to find out if breakfast really is the most important meal of the day.## **6 incredible keto breakfast ideas** Finding keto breakfast recipes can be challenging, but with a little creativity, you can enjoy delicious and satisfying low-carb meals.

## How to Lower Cholesterol on Keto Fast & Safe Whether the keto diet is effective often leads to concerns about its impact on cholesterol levels. There’s a common misconception that a high-fat diet like keto might raise cholesterol levels and that all cholesterol is automatically bad. Learn about how [keto](https://www.drberg.com/blog/does-keto-work) affects cholesterol, what good cholesterol is, and how to avoid bad cholesterol. ### **What is Cholesterol?** Cholesterol, contrary to popular belief, isn’t evil. It’s an essential fat in your cells, making up 25-50% of each cell. Your body uses it for crucial functions such as hormone production and digestion. LDL (low-density lipoprotein) cholesterol is harmful to the body and should be avoided. HDL (high-density lipoprotein) is beneficial for the body, aids in digestive functions, and is the type of cholesterol that is encouraged by the keto diet. ### **The Role of Keto in Regulating Cholesterol** Keto can help regulate cholesterol over time. When you cut carbs drastically (the hallmark of a [ketogenic diet](https://www.drberg.com/blog/the-ketogenic-diet-and-body-type-tips)), your body starts burning fats instead – including those stored in the liver that may be clogging things up. A study showed improved liver function after adapting to keto, resulting from reduced triglyceride accumulation, which could lead to increased bad LDL cholesterol. ![Cholesterol form](https://www.drberg.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/cholesterol-hdl-and-ldl-medical-form-on-a-desk.jpg?w=800) ## **The Importance of Bile in Cholesterol Regulation** Our bodies are incredibly efficient machines, especially when managing cholesterol levels. ### **How Bile Helps Eliminate Excess Cholesterol** Bile, an essential fluid produced by the liver and stored in the [gallbladder](https://www.drberg.com/blog/gallbladder-problems-and-prolonged-fasting), helps eliminate excess cholesterol. Think of bile as your body’s recycling service for excess cholesterol.

## 6 Delicious Keto Broccoli Recipes Broccoli is a versatile, nutrient-packed vegetable and a delicious low-carb addition to any keto diet. Learn about the many health benefits of broccoli and discover six tasty keto broccoli recipes that boost nutrients while keeping you in ketosis. ## **Health benefits of broccoli** Have you noticed that nutritionists and health experts constantly praise broccoli? This low-carb superfood is packed with essential vitamins, minerals, and other nutrients critical for promoting a healthy body and enhancing overall wellness. Let’s take a closer look at some of the top health benefits of broccoli. ### **1. Nutrient-dense superfood** Broccoli is abundant with nutrients, including vitamins C, E, and K, beta-carotene, calcium, potassium, iron, antioxidants, and other health-promoting bioactive compounds. Research published in _Frontiers in Pharmacology_ states that eating more cruciferous vegetables, such as broccoli, may reduce the risk of developing certain diseases, including cardiometabolic, neurological, and musculoskeletal conditions.1 In addition, broccoli’s high fiber and antioxidant content support the body’s natural detoxification processes and help protect against oxidative stress. ### **2. Supports digestive health** Fiber, the non-digestible cell wall found in plant foods, plays a vital role in promoting healthy digestion. Regular fiber intake enhances the protective barrier in the digestive system and helps regulate bowel movements.

## Keto vs. Paleo: Which Is Better for Weight Loss and Health? Keto vs. paleo–which one of these two dietary approaches is better for weight loss and health? Both keto and paleo exclude grains and legumes but differ in their approach to protein and carbohydrate intake, which plays a crucial role in their effects on weight loss and metabolic balance. Let’s explore the differences between paleo and keto diets and discover why a nutritious ketogenic diet is the best choice for sustained weight loss and overall health. ## **What is the keto diet?** The keto diet is a high-fat, moderate-protein, and low-carbohydrate eating plan designed to induce the metabolic state of ketosis, during which the body burns fat for energy instead of carbohydrates. This low-carb diet focuses on healthy fats such as avocados, nuts, and olive oil with moderate amounts of protein from meat, fish, and eggs while limiting carbohydrate intake to less than 50 grams per day. This drastic reduction in carbohydrates encourages the body to produce ketones, which are an alternative fuel source and offer a wide range of health benefits. ### **Pros and cons of keto** The keto diet is often associated with rapid weight loss as the body shifts to burning fat for fuel. This low carbohydrate diet also helps stabilize blood sugar levels and reduce [insulin resistance](https://www.drberg.com/blog/insulin-resistance), making it beneficial for individuals with type 2 diabetes. Additionally, many people report improved mental clarity and increased energy levels while in ketosis. However, a keto diet that only focuses on macronutrient intake without considering food quality can lead to nutritional deficiencies and associated health issues. Moreover, as the low-carb diet gains popularity, an increasing number of highly processed foods are being marketed to keto dieters, often lacking in nutritional value and potentially harming overall health.

## Keto Sweet Snacks: 12 Healthy and Tasty Recipes to Try One of the biggest challenges of following a Healthy Keto® diet is finding treats that won’t interfere with ketosis when sugar cravings strike. However, with a bit of creativity and choosing the right ingredients, you can enjoy delicious sweets while staying in fat-burning mode. Here are 12 nutritious and indulgent keto sweet snacks that you can easily make at home. ## **When and when not to eat low-carb sweet snacks on keto** The Healthy Keto diet emphasizes high-quality ingredients and prioritizes nutrient-dense and low-carb whole foods to trigger ketosis and maintain stable blood sugar levels. This means that most traditional confections, such as cookies, cakes, and candies, are off-limits as they’re typically packed with refined sugars and flour. Fortunately, there are plenty of keto-friendly treats that can satisfy your cravings without raising blood sugar or insulin levels. One indulgent option is sugar-free dark chocolate, which contains at least 70 percent cocoa. Cocoa is rich in flavonoids, a natural antioxidant shown to support cardiovascular health, reduce inflammation, and improve blood flow. Furthermore, research published in _Antioxidants & Redox Signaling_ found that cocoa may enhance satiety, cognitive function, and mood, potentially benefiting mental and physical health.1 It’s best to avoid milk chocolate and other heavily processed varieties, as they usually include added sugar and lower concentrations of cocoa. Keto-friendly sweeteners, including stevia, monk fruit extract, and erythritol, can also be used in moderation to create low-carb desserts. Moreover, incorporating high-fat treats rich in unsaturated fats, such as fat bombs and nuts, can help curb hunger by slowing digestion, stabilizing blood sugar levels, and promoting the release of satiety hormones, such as leptin and cholecystokinin (CCK). Even with low-carb treats, timing matters on a

## Keto vs Carnivore Diet – Which Is Better? Keto vs. carnivore diet–which is better? While both keto and carnivore diets can promote weight loss and blood sugar control, consuming only animal products can lead to nutrient deficiencies and long-term health issues. Discover who may benefit from a carnivore diet and learn how a nutritious low-carb diet like Healthy Keto® can unlock your long-term health goals. ## **What is the ketogenic diet?** The ketogenic diet is a low-carb, high-fat, and moderate-protein diet that primes your metabolism to burn fat instead of carbs for energy. As your liver breaks down stored or dietary fat, it produces large quantities of ketones, a by-product of fat metabolism and a highly efficient energy source. When your cells utilize ketones as fuel, your body enters ketosis. Dietary carbohydrate intake raises blood sugar, which triggers the release of insulin, a crucial metabolic hormone that blocks your liver from converting fats to energy, leading to increased fat storage and weight gain. To maintain fat-burning and benefit from the profound health benefits of ketosis, it’s crucial to consume no more than 20 to 50 grams of net carbs daily and obtain most of your daily calories from healthy fats. Some critics often point out that keto diets increase the risk of nutrient deficiencies due to limiting food groups such as grains, fruits, and starchy vegetables. That’s why it’s crucial to do a Healthy Keto® diet that avoids processed foods and focuses on nutrient-rich, low-carb whole food options to provide all nutritional needs while burning fat. ### **Health benefits of keto** The keto diet has impressive health benefits and has helped many people to achieve a healthy weight and improve their well-being. A study published in _The Journal of Nutrition_ summarizes that a high-fat diet improves blood sugar regulation and metabolic health and is associated with a reduced risk of common lifestyle diseases such as obesity, diabetes, and metabolic

## How Do You Know If You Are in Ketosis or Not? The keto diet is a low-carbohydrate diet that encourages the body to burn fat to generate energy instead of using sugars as a fuel source. This metabolic state is known as ketosis. Ketosis has many health benefits, including weight loss, improved blood sugar control, and enhanced insulin sensitivity. But how do you know if you are in ketosis? Discover natural signs of ketosis, the best ways to test for ketones, and how long it takes to adapt to fat-burning. ## **What is ketosis?** If available, glucose, which is derived from dietary carbohydrates and sugars, is the body’s main fuel source. If the body doesn’t receive enough carbohydrates, the liver is forced to convert fats into energy. The breakdown of fats releases large amounts of ketones, a group of organic acids that serve as a highly efficient fuel source when glucose is limited. When ketones enter your circulation and start to energize your cells, your body enters ketosis. To trigger and maintain ketosis, most ketogenic diets aim to obtain around 70 percent of daily calories from fat, 20 percent from protein, and 10 percent from carbohydrates. Though they’re commonly confused, nutritional ketosis is different from [diabetic ketoacidosis](https://www.drberg.com/blog/what-do-you-do-if-you-get-ketoacidosis), which is a serious medical condition characterized by extremely high levels of ketones and blood sugar. Watch the video below to learn more about the signs of ketosis.## **How do you know if you are in ketosis?** There are various ways to determine if you’re using ketones for energy. One of the most reliable ways to know if your body is in ketosis is by utilizing ketone tests, which evaluate urine, breath, or blood concentrations of ketones. There are various different ketosis test kits, including urine ketone strips that can be purchased over-the-counter

## Keto vs Atkins: Pros, Cons, and Key Differences Keto vs. Atkins–which diet is healthier? While both keto and Atkins diets are popular low-carb meal plans that have helped many people lose weight, Atkins has raised concerns about its sustainability and long-term health effects. Explore the main differences between keto and Atkins, and learn why a nutritious, low-carb Healthy Keto® diet may be the best choice to promote health and well-being. ## **What is the Atkins diet?** The Atkins diet, introduced by Dr. Robert Atkins in the 1970s, challenged the popular low-fat diet trend by promoting a high-fat, high-protein, and low-carb approach to weight loss. The diet is structured in four phases, starting with a low-carb induction phase that limits intake to 20 grams of carbohydrates daily to jumpstart weight loss. It then progresses through weight loss, pre-maintenance, and maintenance phases, gradually reintroducing and adjusting carb intake to help individuals identify their carbohydrate tolerance. The Atkins diet also offers three intensity levels: Atkins 20, Atkins 40, and Atkins 100. Each level corresponds to a specific carb limit designed to meet individual needs and health goals. By reducing carbohydrates, Atkins aims to shift the body into the metabolic fat-burning state of ketosis, where dietary and stored fat is used as the primary fuel source for the body. Carbohydrates trigger blood sugar spikes and the release of insulin, a critical hormone responsible for moving glucose into cells. While insulin is critical for blood sugar control, it directly inhibits fat burning and stimulates fat storage. This explains why low-carb diets are more effective in achieving lasting weight loss than high-carb diets. However, Atkins emphasizes high protein intake and frequent snacking, which can lead to frequent spikes in insulin, making it more difficult to maintain effective fat-burning with this dietary approach. Furthermore, a vital component of the Atkins approach is its

## Vegan Keto Diet: What Nutrient You Must Focus On Can keto be combined with a vegan diet? The answer is yes, they can work together, but not without challenges. Let’s examine what a healthy vegan keto diet plan looks like and what foods are acceptable, and discover the benefits and potential risks of combining these two dietary approaches. ## **Can you do keto if you’re vegan?** A study published in _Nature Medicine_ shows that the transition to either a ketogenic or vegan diet can be advantageous for both the immune system and a diverse microbiome.1 But what about combining the keto and vegan diet? Can it be done? The answer is yes, it’s possible to do keto if you’re vegan. While blending the vegan and ketogenic diet can be challenging, a plant-based ketogenic diet can be effective when carefully planned. Watch this video to learn about the most important nutrient in a vegan keto diet plan.## **Vegan keto diet basics** The vegan keto diet merges veganism with ketogenic principles. Healthy Keto® is a nutritious, high-fat, low-carbohydrate diet emphasizing non-GMO produce, healthy fats, grass-fed meat, wild-caught fish and game meat, organic full-fat dairy, pasture-raised eggs, seeds, and nuts. The focus of a vegan diet is to avoid the use of all animal-sourced products, which can include the broader category of produce created by living creatures, as most vegans will avoid products like honey. Simply put, combining these two diets requires substituting animal-based proteins and fats with plant-based alternatives while maintaining a keto-friendly macronutrient intake. While many keto dieters aim to limit net carbs to between 20 and 50 grams per day, it’s acceptable for the carbohydrate intake of a vegan keto diet to lean towards the maximum allowance of 50 grams in order to obtain daily nutrient and energy requirements.

## Top 5 Keto Hacks for Busy People to Stay on Track The keto diet makes losing weight easy, improves your metabolic health, lowers the risk of insulin resistance and diabetes, and boosts energy and mental clarity. It can take some time to adjust to a low-carb diet, and some people struggle to keep on track with the keto lifestyle. However, with some planning, and a few keto hacks keto can be a sustainable diet that saves you time and money while reaping its health benefits. Let’s look at five easy keto tips and tricks you can implement today. Staying in ketosis is essential for keto success. Consistently limiting carb intake can make the keto diet challenging at times, no matter if you are new to a low-carb lifestyle or a seasoned veteran. However, these simple keto tricks can help make keto easy and sustainable, especially if you are on a busy schedule. Here are five keto hacks that save time and boost results! ### **1. Combine keto with intermittent fasting** Intermittent fasting is a mealtime schedule with set fasting periods followed by an [eating window](https://www.drberg.com/blog/acceptable-snacks-inside-your-eating-window-with-intermittent-fasting). The 16:8 intermittent fast–16 hours of fasting followed by an eight-hour eating window–is one of the most popular types of fast. During fasting, your liver relies on stored fatty acids instead of dietary fats or sugars as a fuel source, which amplifies keto’s fat-burning effects. Most people typically eat two meals on a 16:8 fast or one larger meal on a 20:4 fast, which is a great way to reduce calorie consumption and boost weight loss. Reducing the number of meals eaten per week also lowers the time it takes to plan, shop for, and prepare your meals. Adding intermittent fasting to your keto regimen can increase fat burning and take your health to the next level. It’s particularly helpful for getting past a weight-loss plateau. ### **2. Keep it simple** Keeping it simple helps to stay on track and can be the

## How Keto Electrolytes Prevent Fatigue & Cramps Electrolytes are essential minerals that maintain the body’s fluid balance while regulating nerve and muscle function. Despite the health benefits of a nutritious ketogenic diet, reducing carbohydrate intake can lead to temporary electrolyte imbalances, which can trigger keto flu symptoms such as muscle weakness and exhaustion. Discover five crucial keto electrolytes and learn how to maintain balanced mineral levels and promote optimal hydration. ## **What are electrolytes?** Electrolytes are essential minerals that carry an electric charge when dissolved in fluids, which plays a vital role in facilitating the transmission of electrical impulses between nerve cells. Key electrolytes include calcium, chloride, magnesium, phosphorus, potassium, and sodium, all critical for regulating various physiological functions. One essential electrolyte function is to regulate the movement of sodium and potassium ions in and out of cells through the sodium-potassium pump. This protein, located in cell membranes, helps maintain the balance of these ions inside and outside the cells. The sodium-potassium pump helps regulate cellular fluid volume, supports energy production by maintaining ion gradients, contributes to blood pressure regulation, stabilizes heart rhythm, and facilitates the transport of nutrients and waste across cell membranes. The body cannot produce electrolytes on its own and loses them readily through sweat and urine. Therefore, it’s important to replenish these essential minerals through dietary sources or electrolyte replacement supplements. Watch the video below to learn more about the importance of electrolytes when following keto.## **Why electrolytes are essential on a keto diet** Those following a ketogenic diet may notice symptoms of deficiency, such as fatigue or weakness, if they don’t prioritize

## What Kicks You Out of Ketosis? Top Mistakes Understanding what kicks you out of ketosis is important to maintain fat-burning and maximize the health benefits of a keto lifestyle. There are several factors that can inhibit ketosis and derail your keto diet, including excessive carb intake, too much protein, chronic stress, and even certain artificial sweeteners. Learn how to tell if you’re in ketosis and discover how to prevent getting kicked out of fat-burning mode. ## **What is ketosis?** Glucose, which is derived from dietary carbohydrates and sugars, is the body’s primary fuel source. However, when glucose is limited, the liver starts to burn fat to generate energy. The breakdown of fats generates ketones, a group of organic acids that function as an alternative fuel source. When ketones are released into the bloodstream and begin to fuel cells, the body enters a metabolic state known as ketosis. Ketosis can be achieved by fasting or by following a ketogenic diet, which reduces carbohydrate intake to between 20 and 50 grams of net carbs daily to limit glucose. To maintain ketosis, it’s essential to keep carbohydrate intake consistently low and obtain the majority of daily caloric requirements from healthy fats. Watch the video below to learn about common keto mistakes that can kick you out of ketosis.## **How to tell if you’re in ketosis** Following a strict, low-carb diet can help you achieve ketosis within a few days. However, it can take several weeks to become fully fat-adapted and adjusted to using ketones as the body’s primary fuel source. Here are five ways to tell if you’re in ketosis. ### **1. Ketone tests** Ketone tests, which evaluate ketone levels in the urine, breath, or blood, are reliable methods to determine if you’re in ketosis. Urine ketone strips and breath ketone analyzers can be purchased over-the-counter (OTC) to measure ketone levels

## Keto Ruined My Thyroid? Separating Myth from Fact The keto diet is a widely popular weight loss plan followed by millions worldwide. Over time, it has evolved into many different versions, some of which offer more health benefits than others. Amidst its popularity, some individuals have voiced health concerns, such as the claim that “keto ruined my thyroid.” This has led to questions about the ketogenic diet’s safety and its impact on thyroid function. Let’s debunk common myths about the ketogenic diet and thyroid health and find out how to safely and effectively follow a Healthy Keto® diet with a thyroid condition. ## **What is the keto diet?** The ketogenic diet is a low-carbohydrate diet that prioritizes high fat and moderate protein intake.

## How to do Intermittent Fasting mini course ## **How to Do Intermittent Fasting** Intermittent fasting isn’t a diet–it’s an eating pattern similar to how we humans evolved. Our ancestors didn’t have three full meals and several snacks each day. More commonly, they ate one to two meals and often went a whole day without food. Your body is primed to burn fat for energy, but frequent meals and snacks prevent your metabolism from getting into fat-burning mode–a state called ketosis. Watch this course to learn why intermittent fasting is the perfect eating pattern alongside a Healthy Keto® diet. ## **Why you need to do intermittent fasting** Intermittent fasting allows your body to use fat as fuel instead of burning carbs and sugars for energy. Burning fat keeps insulin levels low, releases growth hormone, and builds muscle mass. Learn why intermittent fasting is the best way to support your body if you: \* Need frequent meals \* Snack constantly \* Have persistent weight and belly fat \* Experience low energy \* Crave sugars Intermittent fasting in combination with keto causes profound changes in your hormonal balance and metabolism. You will find it easy to get rid of belly fat, feel more energetic, and have a more stable mood. You’ll also learn why reducing the frequency of meals triggers a powerful process called autophagy. Autophagy helps your body to get rid of old, damaged cells, lowers your risk of diseases, and has potent anti-aging effects. ## **How to do intermittent fasting** Have you tried to find out how to start intermittent fasting but had more questions than you found answers to? This course provides you with all the basics needed to get started. You will understand that: \* Lowering the frequency of your meals doesn’t mean reducing your calories. \* Intermittent fasting and Healthy Keto provide all your body’s nutrient requirements. \* Once you adjust to intermittent fasting, your body will be efficient in burning fat, leading to less hunger and cravings,

## Why Healthy Eaters Can End Up Unhealthy Mini Course ## **Learn Why Healthy Eaters Develop Nutritional Deficiencies!** ## **Why Healthy Eaters Can End Up Unhealthy** You probably have heard that a healthy diet should include plenty of whole foods, vegetables, and fiber. But you may not be aware that many of these “health foods” can cause nutrient deficiencies, leaving you at risk of developing health issues. After watching this course, you will know what essential vitamins and minerals support your metabolism and what steps you can take to boost your body’s nutrient stores. ## **Why your diet may be high in anti-nutrients** Nutrients support your physiological functioning and overall health. On the other hand, anti-nutrients block the absorption of essential nutrients and are found in foods like nuts and seeds, cruciferous vegetables, and spinach. Trying to eat “healthy” may have unwittingly contributed to lower levels of vitamins and minerals in your body. Perhaps you feel like you are doing all the right things, but nothing seems to be working. You eat healthily but still feel tired and can’t shift that stubborn belly fat… Nutrient deficiencies may be to blame! This course will cover the most common anti-nutrients, and you will learn about: \* The role of phytic acid in preventing mineral absorption \* How to prepare seeds and nuts to reduce anti-nutrients \* Cruciferous vegetables and how they impact your hormonal balance \* Why you may benefit from iodine, and how this can help your weight goals \* How oxalate-rich foods can lower nutrient absorption and increase kidney stone risk \* A simple trick you can use to lower anti-nutrients in foods ## **You can’t get all nutrients from plant foods** Vegetables are an essential part of the Healthy Keto diet. But relying on vegetables alone for balanced nutrition can deplete your nutrient stores. This minicourse will cover the nutrients you can’t obtain from plant foods and explains why a vegan or vegetarian diet may not be

## Fat Storing Hormone Resistance Mini Course ## **What Is Insulin Resistance?** Healthy Keto® combined with intermittent fasting supports healthy weight, blood pressure, and cholesterol levels. You may be wondering why the ketogenic diet, particularly, is so successful in lowering the risk of these common lifestyle diseases. This course explains how the keto diet and intermittent fasting work together to balance blood sugar and insulin levels and how this will improve your health. ## **Are you at risk for insulin resistance?** [Insulin](https://www.drberg.com/blog/tags/insulin)–also known as the “fat-storing hormone”–is a critical metabolic hormone responsible for regulating blood sugar levels and energy metabolism. Every time your blood contains too much sugar, insulin will signal your fat cells to store this unused fuel as fat. This is why too much sugar causes weight gain. High amounts of carbs and sugar over long periods cause your cells to become less reactive to insulin, leading to resistance. Insulin resistance causes metabolic issues, dysfunctional energy production, hormonal imbalances, and, unsurprisingly, health issues. This course is for you if you suffer from any of these symptoms: \* Inability to lose weight and belly fat \* High blood pressure \* High cholesterol \* Need for frequent meals and snacks \* Excessive urination at night \* Feeling tired but not satisfied after meals \* Skin conditions like acne or cystic acne \* Polycystic ovary syndrome/disease You will understand the role of diet in insulin resistance and why sugars, carbs, artificial sweeteners, and monosodium glutamate are the wrong choices for your health. ## **What steps can you take to correct insulin resistance?** This course teaches you the most important steps to take to correct insulin resistance. You may be surprised to learn about the role of healthy fats in weight loss and why snacking is one of the worst factors contributing to insulin resistance. You will understand the surprising

## How to do Healthy Keto® ## **How to Do Healthy Keto®** The ketogenic diet is becoming increasingly popular, and for good reason–it works! If you want to make powerful changes to your lifestyle to improve your health, lose weight, and feel more energetic, you are in the right place. Have you tried to change your diet and lifestyle but didn’t understand what to change or why? This minicourse gives you the foundation to start keto with the proper knowledge and understanding to make your keto diet a long-term success ### What is Healthy Keto? The keto diet is a low-carb, high-fat, moderate-protein diet that shifts your metabolism to burn fat instead of sugar for energy. This simple dietary change causes potent metabolic changes with plenty of benefits to your health. Healthy Keto takes the traditional low-carb, high-fat plan further by focusing on nutrient-dense, high-quality keto-friendly foods. Balanced nutrition and a fat-burning metabolism are the ultimate ways to maintain a healthy body and stay slim. During this course, you will gain insight into how Healthy Keto and intermittent fasting work in synergy, how this benefits your health, and how you can start incorporating Healthy Keto into your life. ### Why does Healthy Keto work for you? Humans are complex, and your health relies on many factors. Healthy Keto integrates fat-burning, nutrition, and intermittent fasting. As you will learn, this is a powerful combination with incredible health benefits: 1. You have more energy and improved cognitive function as a result of an increase in your metabolic rate. 2. As you burn fat, you lose weight fast and maintain a healthy weight long-term. Keto supports blood sugar balance and lowers cravings. 3. Ketones support healthy levels of insulin, the metabolic hormone responsible for fat storage. 4. Your body can fight inflammation and infections more efficiently. Healthy Keto is the antidote to a diet pattern that leaves you tired, overweight, anxious, and at a higher

## Rapid Fat Burning Mini Course ## **Learn an Accelerated Fat Burning Plan** \* Learn advanced Keto and IF strategies \* Boost through any plateau with your weight \* Take your results way beyond anything before ## **Rapid Fat Burning** Are you doing keto, but your metabolism is stubborn, and you aren’t losing weight as fast as you hoped? This course helps you to fine-tune your keto diet to achieve rapid fat-burning results. After watching this course, you will understand how your body responds to different foods, giving you the confidence to make healthy keto-friendly choices. ## **Choose the right low-carb foods to lose weight** Keto is a low-carb, high-fat diet. A general keto recommendation is to limit your carb intake to no more than 50 grams daily. But, depending on your weight, activity levels, and metabolism, 50 grams of carbs may be too high, causing persistent belly fat. Keeping your carb intake to no more than 20 grams daily helps you stay in ketosis and supports rapid weight loss. This course will help you shift your focus from losing weight to get healthy to getting healthy to lose weight–reducing the risk of deficiencies and metabolic damage. This course also explains what foods to include in your daily carb count and which vegetables you can add to each meal. You will be able to choose optimal keto-friendly nuts and berries and learn which vegetables to avoid. ## **How much protein is too much** Adding too much protein can stand in the way of your weight loss success. After you complete this course, you will understand how much protein is too much and how intermittent fasting balances your daily protein intake. Learn which protein sources are keto-friendly and why protein shakes may be the wrong choice to achieve weight loss. ## **Choose healthy fats to lose weight** You may be confused about a high-fat diet helping you to lose weight fast.

## Keto Sesame Shrimp Stir Fry Reimagine Asian cuisine on a low-carb diet with this Keto Sesame Shrimp Stir Fry. This recipe features wild-caught shrimp, sesame seeds, ginger, and brown sugar-style monk fruit for a nutty and tangy lunch or dinner option that won’t kick you out of ketosis. ## **Why you’ll love this keto-friendly recipe** This Keto Sesame Shrimp Stir Fry recipe uses delicious low-carb substitutions to create a healthy keto-friendly recreation of an Asian cuisine staple. Sugar is often used in stir fry to balance out salty, nutty, or acidic flavors. However, sugar is high on the [glycemic index (GI)](https://www.drberg.com/blog/glycemic-index-vs-glycemic-load-in-simple-terms), which means it quickly spikes blood and insulin levels. Not only can blood sugar fluctuations kick you out of ketosis, but also lead to weight gain, cravings, mood swings, and fatigue. This recipe calls for monk fruit sweetener, which has a GI of zero and won’t cause spikes and dips in blood sugar levels. This helps leave you satisfied while preventing carb and sugar cravings. Traditional stir-fries are often made with seed oils such as peanut, canola, or grapeseed oil, which are high in [omega-6 fatty acids](https://www.drberg.com/blog/omega-6-fats-and-inflammation) that promote inflammation. This recipe uses nutrient-dense grass-fed butter that offers healthy fats, vitamins, and minerals. Additionally, coconut aminos are used instead of soy sauce, which contains anti-nutrients that can block the absorption of minerals such as calcium, magnesium, iron, and zinc. Too much soy has also been found to have estrogenic effects. This means soy products may contribute to estrogen dominance, a hormonal imbalance that increases the risk of prostate problems in men and breast and uterine cancer in women. This stir-fry shrimp recipe is versatile and can be paired with your favorite sautéed vegetables or other keto-friendly Asian-inspired dishes. !\[Raw shrimp on a

## Keto Jalapeño Poppers - Dr. Berg Jalapeño poppers are a popular appetizer often served at parties or as a game-day treat. However, traditional poppers can be high in carbs as they are often stuffed with breadcrumbs, making them unsuitable for those following keto. This Keto Jalapeño Poppers recipe eliminates the breading while maintaining all the flavors and crunch of the original version. ## **Why you’ll love this keto-friendly recipe** If you’re a fan of spicy food, then these Keto Jalapeño Poppers are a must-try! They’re packed with flavor and heat while being 100 percent keto-friendly. By using cream cheese stuffing instead of breadcrumbs, this recipe cuts carbs without losing flavor. If you’re short on time, these poppers can be prepared in under 20 minutes using an air fryer or made ahead, then reheated in a toaster oven for a quick lunch. This recipe is also a healthier option as it doesn’t require deep frying, unlike most traditional jalapeño poppers. What’s more, you can customize this recipe to fit your taste preferences, such as making bacon-wrapped jalapeño poppers or adjusting the levels of spiciness. ![Green jalapeno peppers](https://drberg-dam.imgix.net/others/plate-cut-green-jalapeno-peppers.jpg?w=920\&auto=compress,format) ## **Health benefits of jalapeño** Jalapeños belong to the _Capsicum_ genus, which is part of the [nightshade family](https://www.drberg.com/blog/if-i-have-arthritis-should-i-avoid-the-nightshades) referred to as _Solanaceae_. Despite their small size, they pack a punch of health benefits. [Research](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4477151/) published in _Openheart_ found that capsaicin, the compound responsible for peppers’ spiciness, can boost metabolism by activating sensory receptors and neurons in various tissues. This tissue activation raises cellular calcium levels, stimulating the activity of certain antioxidant enzymes, which can \[reduce

## Keto Bacon-Wrapped Asparagus - Dr. Berg Keto Bacon-Wrapped Asparagus Recipe Enjoy a delicious low-carb treat or sophisticated side dish with this Keto Bacon Wrapped Asparagus recipe. In just 30 minutes, you’ll have tender asparagus wrapped in crispy bacon, creating a perfect blend of earthy and savory flavors. Whether you’re hosting a party or looking for an easy, flavorful meal, this recipe will surely impress even the pickiest eaters. ## **Why you’ll love this keto-friendly recipe** Not only is this Bacon-Wrapped Asparagus recipe easy to make, but it’s also 100 percent keto-friendly and deliciously satisfying. [Bacon](https://www.drberg.com/blog/how-to-find-the-right-bacon) is a fantastic source of healthy fats and protein, making it a beloved staple for those following a ketogenic diet. However, opting for organic and uncured bacon is essential to avoid added sugars and preservatives that could disrupt ketosis or negatively impact your health. This dish is seasoned with a generous sprinkle of black pepper, which adds a flavorful kick, provides antioxidants, and supports healthy digestion. Meanwhile, garlic powder infuses the dish with immune-boosting and anti-inflammatory benefits, offering extra protection for your body. Beyond its nutritional benefits, this recipe blends two simple but flavorful ingredients that perfectly complement each other. The crispy bacon pairs beautifully with the earthy flavor of asparagus, creating a delightful contrast in textures and tastes. Another reason to love this recipe is its flexibility for customization, as you can experiment with different herbs, such as chili flakes or smoked paprika, for a spicy kick. If you prefer a slightly sweeter flavor, drizzle [homemade maple syrup](https://www.drberg.com/keto-recipes/keto-maple-syrup) onto these bacon and asparagus bundles before serving. Many traditional bacon and asparagus dishes use brown sugar, but opting for a healthier alternative like sugar-free maple syrup won’t raise

In addition, green beans also provide vitamins C and K and offer plenty of fiber to promote healthy digestion and enhanced immune functions. According to [research](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-021-03557-5) published in _Scientific Reports,_ radishes are rich in glucosinolates, a group of potent plant compounds that have antimicrobial and potential anticancer properties.

This easy-to-make keto waffles recipe uses almond flour and a sugar substitute, creating a low-carb breakfast treat that won’t cause blood sugar spikes. ![Waffle sandwich](https://drberg-dam.imgix.net/others/savory-breakfast-fresh-homemade-belgian-waffle.jpg?w=920\&auto=compress,format) ## **Why you’ll love this crispy keto waffles recipe** Mornings don’t have to be boring on a low-carb diet when you can enjoy mouthwatering waffles that are low in carbs and contain healthy fats.

## Easy Keto Maple Syrup Recipe – Just Two Ingredients! ![Fresh bottle of maple syrup](https://drberg-dam.imgix.net/others/bottle-bowl-tasty-maple-syrup.jpg?w=132px\&auto=compress,format) Are you looking for a keto-friendly alternative to maple syrup? This easy, two-ingredient recipe creates a low-carb, sugar-free syrup that delivers classic maple flavors without the high sugar content of traditional versions. Perfect for low-carb pancakes, waffles, and other breakfast favorites, this keto maple syrup is a game-changer for anyone following a low-carb diet. ## **Is maple syrup keto-friendly?** Pure maple syrup is very high in sugar and carbs and has a glycemic index (GI) of 54. This means that it spikes blood sugar levels nearly as much as table sugar, making it unsuitable for a ketogenic diet. However, homemade keto maple syrup, sweetened with allulose and monk fruit extract, allows you to enjoy classic maple flavors without negatively impacting your blood sugar and insulin levels. ![Glucometer reading healthy blood sugar](https://drberg-dam.imgix.net/others/man-using-glucometer-checking-blood-sugar-4.jpg?w=920\&auto=compress,format) ## **Why you’ll love this keto recipe** The primary ingredient in this keto syrup is a plant-based, low-carb sugar alternative that combines monk fruit sweetener and allulose. When first looking at the nutrition label, you may be shocked to find that a serving size of two tablespoons contains 24 grams of carbohydrates. So, how could it be keto-friendly? Sweeteners that contain allulose can be confusing in terms of their carbohydrate count. Because allulose is a monosaccharide, it’s classified as a carbohydrate and must be listed on the nutrition label. However, allulose is absorbed and excreted without being metabolized. This means it won’t raise blood sugar and insulin levels. As a result, allulose has zero net carbs, making it one of the best sugar-free sweeteners for satisfying your sweet tooth while staying in ketosis.

## Keto-Friendly Nutella and Peanut Butter Sandwich You can’t go wrong with a peanut butter sandwich–and the addition of a delicious homemade chocolate hazelnut Nutella spread takes things to a whole new level. This easy keto-friendly Nutella and peanut butter sandwich recipe is unbelievably delicious, so give it a try! ![Peanut butter Nutella sandwich](https://drberg-dam.imgix.net/food-images/nutella-and-peanut-butter-ketogenic-sandwiche-kid-friendly-01.jpg?w=680\&auto=compress,format) ## **Is peanut butter keto-friendly?** Depending on the brand you use, peanut butter can be a keto-friendly food choice. But you must read the label; many store-bought peanut butter brands are loaded with sugar and unhealthy fats (like soy or cottonseed oil). Keto-friendly peanut butter should be organic and have no more than two ingredients, including peanuts and [sea salt](https://www.drberg.com/blog/dead-sea-salt-vs-sea-salt). ## **Is nutella keto-friendly?** Nutella and other brands of chocolate hazelnut butter are often advertised as a quick, healthy meal/snack, particularly for kids. But, there is a lot of misperception about the nutritional value of many commercially bought nut butters such as Nutella. Nutella is loaded with sugar and unhealthy fat ([like palm oil](https://www.drberg.com/blog/palm-oil-vs-coconut-oil-health-benefits)). A single serving of Nutella has 21 grams of sugar. Some generic chocolate hazelnut butter brands also add high fructose corn syrup and trans fats. If you love Nutella, you can still indulge if you make your own homemade version of the chocolate nut butter that’s 100% keto-friendly. ![Bread slice with chocolate hazelnut butter](https://drberg-dam.imgix.net/food-images/nutella-and-peanut-butter-ketogenic-sandwiche-kid-friendly-02.jpg?w=680\&auto=compress,format) ## **How to make ketogenic Nutella at home** Store-bought Nutella is loaded with sugar and unhealthy fats, but you can make a healthy version of homemade, keto-friendly chocolate hazelnut

## Turmeric Tofu Ketogenic Breakfast - Dr. Berg ![Turmeric tofu](https://drberg-dam.imgix.net/others/recipes-turmeric-tofu-ketogenic-breakfast-142-7.jpg?w=920\&auto=compress,format) If you’re craving scrambled eggs but are following a low-carb vegan diet, this Turmeric Tofu Scramble recipe is the perfect meal. Tofu offers a similar texture to traditional scrambled eggs and provides plenty of plant-based protein. The addition of turmeric gives this vegan scrambled tofu dish a vibrant yellow color while providing powerful anti-inflammatory benefits and a unique flavor profile. ## **Why you’ll love this keto-friendly recipe** Unless you practice intermittent fasting, breakfast is often considered the most important meal of the day, and this Turmeric Tofu Scramble recipe ensures you start your day off right. It’s a delicious vegan alternative to scrambled eggs and provides numerous health benefits. Tofu is an excellent source of plant-based protein and contains essential minerals, including iron, calcium, and magnesium. [Research](https://www.intechopen.com/chapters/86720) published in _Phytochemicals in Agriculture and Food_ found that consuming significant amounts of soy is linked to a lower risk of certain cancers and cardiovascular diseases. The study also indicates that soy-based products, such as soymilk and tofu, contain isoflavones, a group of potent plant-derived phytochemicals linked to overall better health. Incorporating bell peppers and onions into this dish increases its nutritional value by providing a boost of [vitamin C](https://www.drberg.com/blog/the-best-and-worst-vitamin-c) and antioxidants, which strengthen the immune system and help reduce chronic inflammation.

Place a heatproof bowl (glass or metal) over pot, ensuring it doesn’t touch the water. In bowl away from heat, whisk together 3 egg yolks and 1 tablespoon lemon juice until slightly thickened. \* Melt ¼ cup butter and set aside. \* Once water is gently boiling, place bowl with egg yolk mixture over pot. Whisk constantly to prevent curdling. As mixture warms, it will begin to thicken. When it starts to thicken, remove pot from heat but leave bowl on top to maintain gentle warmth. Keep whisking until smooth. \* Slowly add melted butter while whisking continuously. Add 1 pinch salt. \* Once sauce reaches your desired consistency and flavor, transfer it to a warm thermos or coffee tumbler. This helps prevent sauce from breaking, as it’s sensitive to temperature. Keeping it warm also ensures egg yolks stay safe to eat. #### Poached Eggs \* Fill a small sauce pot with water, 1 tablespoon vinegar, and ½ teaspoon salt. Place on medium heat. \* Heat water until it lightly bubbles and steams, but avoid a rolling boil. \* Crack 2 eggs into 2 small bowls to make it easy to slide them into water when ready. \* When water is gently bubbling and steaming, stir it in a circular motion to create a vortex in center. \* Gently slide eggs into center of vortex. Let them swirl and begin to set for about 30 seconds. If water starts to boil, remove pot from heat until temperature drops, then return to burner. \* Using a slotted spoon, gently flip eggs to check yolk’s doneness. Yolk should remain runny, and egg

## Steak and Eggs Recipe – The Perfect Keto Breakfast ![](https://drberg-dam.imgix.net/food-images/recipes-steak-and-eggs-118-2.jpg?w=920\&auto=compress,format) Popularized in the mid-twentieth century as Australia’s national dish, steak and eggs is a perfect breakfast meal combo that will keep you satiated and satisfied. This Steak and Eggs Recipe is a hearty, protein-rich version of the traditional meal, adding nutritious fats and creamy avocado. ## **Health benefits of steak** According to the [U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA)](https://fdc.nal.usda.gov/fdc-app.html#/food-details/168636/nutrients), a three-ounce sirloin steak contains approximately 26 grams of protein. Protein comprises amino acids, widely known as the body’s building blocks. Amino acids are used to help build strong bones, repair and grow muscle, and produce hormones and enzymes. Steak is also a rich source of iron and zinc, essential minerals for boosting immunity, facilitating wound healing, and maintaining oxygen transport. A [study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9696717/) published in _Nutrients_ found that zinc deficiency often coexists with anemia caused by a lack of iron. These nutritional deficiencies can lead to symptoms such as bruising, weak nails, lethargy, and various skin conditions. Red meat contains six B vitamins, including B12, which can’t be obtained from plant sources. B12 is vital for DNA and red blood cell formation. It’s also a crucial nutrient during pregnancy as it’s essential for brain and spinal cord development. [Vitamin B12 deficiency](https://www.drberg.com/blog/6-causes-of-a-vitamin-b12-deficiency-youve-never-heard-before) has been shown to lead to neurological and psychiatric issues, such as muscle weakness, depression, anxiety, fatigue, and pins and needles sensation. A vitamin B12 deficiency may also increase the risk of birth defects in babies.

Mix chopped vegetables with 3 cups lettuce, 1½ tablespoons olive oil, and 1½ tablespoons lemon juice. \* Salting this salad is very important for flavor. Add 1 teaspoon sea salt to salad and top with 2 tablespoons cheese. \* Eat 1 hard-boiled egg on the side or slice and add to salad. Sear some salmon in coconut oil and serve it over a salad for a perfectly balanced keto meal! ![](https://drberg-dam.imgix.net/food-images/recipes-salmon-salad-38-1.png)

## Are Rice Cakes Keto or Not? Find Out Here Are rice cakes keto? No, rice cakes are high in carbohydrates and have a high glycemic index, which can lead to rapid blood sugar spikes. Over time, a high-carb diet may contribute to insulin resistance, increased fat storage, and a greater risk of metabolic issues, such as type 2 diabetes and obesity. Rice cakes are light, airy snacks made by applying high heat and pressure to puffed rice or rice flour. This process causes the grains to expand and bind together into round, crisp discs. They have a low-calorie count and are available in various flavors, from plain and lightly salted to sweet varieties, such as chocolate and caramel rice cakes. Many are made with brown rice, which retains the bran and germ layers, giving them a slightly nuttier taste and a bit more fiber than those made with white rice. Despite this, they’re low in protein and fat, making them nutritionally sparse and not very filling. They’re often promoted as a healthy, low-calorie rice treat, appealing to those seeking simple, processed-free options. However, when considering the macronutrient profile, the health claims about rice cakes can be misleading. A single puffed rice cake has almost no healthy fats or fiber to slow digestion or support sustained energy. Watch the video below to discover if popcorn and rice cakes can be included in a keto diet.## **Are rice cakes keto-friendly?** No, despite being a low-calorie morsel, their high-carb content makes them a poor fit for a low-carb lifestyle. One plain rice cake contains around seven grams of total carbohydrates and roughly 6.9 grams of net carbs. _“Even more concerning is their glycemic index (GI), which ranges from 70 to 90, higher than table sugar and many other treats, causing rapid blood sugar spikes after eating,”_ explains Dr. Berg. \_“This sudden surge in glucose can interfere with

Discover six ox bile benefits and find out if incorporating bile salts into your routine could support your digestive wellness. ## **What is ox bile?** Ox bile is a digestive fluid derived from the gallbladder of cows that contains various bile acids, including cholic, deoxycholic, and chenodeoxycholic acid. The bile acid composition of ox bile is very similar to that of human bile, which is a vitally important digestive fluid produced in the liver and stored in the gallbladder. Bile acids play a crucial role in breaking down fat and supporting the metabolism of certain nutrients, as well as promoting liver and gallbladder functions. Ox bile-derived [bile acids](https://www.drberg.com/blog/side-effects-of-purified-bile-salts) have been used for centuries in traditional wellness practices to support digestive system function and enhance overall health and well-being.

## Best Hypothyroidism Diet Tips for Thyroid Support Hypothyroidism, also known as underactive thyroid function, is an endocrine imbalance characterized by the thyroid gland not producing enough thyroid hormones to meet the body’s needs. Lack of adequate thyroid hormones can impact various physiological processes, and following a hypothyroidism diet can improve thyroid health and help support hormonal balance. Discover why Healthy Keto® is one of the best dietary patterns to promote a healthy thyroid gland and learn which foods negatively affect thyroid function. ## **What is hypothyroidism?** [Hypothyroidism](https://www.drberg.com/blog/hyperthyroid-warning) is a condition in which the thyroid gland, a small butterfly-shaped gland at the top of the neck, doesn’t produce enough thyroid hormones. The primary thyroid hormones thyroxine (T4), triiodothyronine (T3), and calcitonin are critical in regulating metabolic pathways, energy production, immune functions, brain growth, and various other essential processes. Because the effects of these hormones are so widespread, even mild thyroid hormone imbalances can lead to a wide range of health issues, making hypothyroidism a significant concern. While hypothyroidism can be caused by various factors, the most common cause of impaired thyroid function is an autoimmune thyroid disease known as Hashimoto’s thyroiditis. Hashimoto’s is characterized by the immune system mistakenly attacking the thyroid gland and the production of antibodies that damage thyroid tissue over time. This leads to inflammation and cellular damage, which impairs thyroid hormone production and results in hypothyroidism. Common symptoms of hypothyroidism include: \* Fatigue \* Weight gain \* Difficulty losing weight \* Sensitivity to cold \* Dry skin \* [Hair loss](https://www.drberg.com/blog/the-causes-of-hair-loss) \* Muscle weakness \* Depression \* Cognitive impairment \* Constipation \* Thin and brittle fingernails Symptoms of hypothyroidism can vary in

## Potato Bread vs White Bread: Nutrition Explained When it comes to healthy eating, we often find ourselves comparing different foods. We want to make informed choices about what we put into our bodies. Today, let’s discuss a common question that arises in the realm of nutrition: bread vs potatoes glycemic index. This is an especially important topic for individuals monitoring their blood sugar levels, like those following a ketogenic diet. ## **Understanding the Glycemic Index (GI)** Before diving into the bread vs potatoes glycemic index debate, it’s crucial to understand what the [glycemic index (GI)](https://www.drberg.com/blog/glycemic-index-vs-glycemic-load-in-simple-terms) is. The GI measures how quickly a carbohydrate-containing food raises your blood sugar level. Think of it as a ranking system for carbs–the higher the number, the faster and higher your blood sugar spikes after eating. ### **Why Does the Glycemic Index Matter?** You might be wondering why we should even care about these numbers. Well, consistently high blood sugar levels, especially if they remain uncontrolled over time, can lead to a cascade of health problems. Think increased ris k of [type 2 diabetes](https://www.drberg.com/blog/type-2-diabetes-is-an-fat-storing-hormone-disease-more-than-a-glucose-disease), [heart disease](https://www.drberg.com/blog/ignored-causes-of-heart-disease), weight gain, and even certain types of cancer. On the flip side, choosing [low-GI foods](https://www.drberg.com/blog/why-do-carbs-make-you-hungry) can be a game-changer for managing weight and blood sugar levels.

Yes, you can eat sour cream on the keto diet, depending on the type and quality of the sour cream used. Learn how to choose a keto-friendly sour cream and discover the best ways to incorporate this delicious dairy product into your diet. Sour cream is regular dairy cream that’s been soured, or fermented, by lactic acid bacteria. Alternatively, sour creams can be made with acids, such as lemon juice, to sour the cream instead. Traditional sour cream, made by fermenting heavy cream with bacteria, develops its sour flavor and creamy texture as the bacteria grow and convert lactose to lactic acid. This process is similar to how other dairy products such as plain Greek yogurt are cultured and helps preserve the cream. Watch the video below to learn more about eating dairy on keto.## **Is sour cream keto-friendly?** Regular sour cream, or full-fat sour cream, is made with cream containing between 18 and 20 percent milk fat.

## Does Whey Protein Spike Insulin More Than Bread? The Protein That Spikes Insulin More than White Bread Ever wondered how that scoop of whey protein you’re adding to your post-workout shake impacts your insulin levels? Well, let’s dive into the deep end together. You might think it’s just a quick and convenient source of protein, right? But there’s more going on under the hood than meets the eye. This isn’t about scaring you off your beloved whey – quite the contrary. It’s about arming you with knowledge to make informed decisions for yourself. We’ll uncover why this milk byproduct may mess around with our bodies’ sugar control system, possibly affecting weight gain and even ketosis. We’ll also compare its nutritional profile against natural food sources like eggs or fish. Hold on tight, as this thrilling journey is about to begin! ## **The Impact of Whey Protein on Insulin Levels** An in-depth exploration of how whey protein affects insulin levels, including its potential benefits and drawbacks for health and fitness enthusiasts. ### **The Insulin Response to Whey Protein** Did you realize that taking whey protein can result in a considerable rise in your insulin levels? Studies have shown that whey protein powder increases insulin by 139%. That’s more than the effect of white bread, which spikes insulin by only 87%. But don’t panic just yet. Unlike many foods that raise insulin, whey protein doesn’t spike [blood sugar](https://www.drberg.com/blog/tags/blood-sugar). This unique attribute could benefit people trying to manage their glucose levels. ### **The Role of Glucagon** You might ask: “Isn’t high insulin bad?” Well, it’s not as simple as that because another player enters the game – glucagon. Some studies suggest this hormone is stimulated by whey and may counteract some effects of raised insulin. In other words, even though your body produces more insulin after drinking a shake made from whey protein powder, it also creates glucagon, which helps balance

## Tips and Tricks to Increase Ketone Levels Keto is a low-carbohydrate diet that shifts the body into ketosis. This metabolic state of fat-burning is associated with health benefits such as weight loss, improved mental clarity, enhanced insulin sensitivity, and better blood sugar control. However, reaching ketosis can be challenging, especially for those who are just starting their keto journey. Find out how to increase your ketone levels naturally and discover the key signs indicating your body has entered ketosis. ## **What are ketones?** Ketones, or ketone bodies, are organic acids produced by the liver during ketosis, a metabolic state in which the body burns fat for energy instead of relying on glucose as a fuel source. The breakdown of dietary and stored body fat releases large amounts of ketones, which serve as a highly effective fuel source when carbohydrates and sugars are unavailable. Nutritional ketosis can be achieved through fasting or by following a low-carb diet plan such as [Healthy Keto®](https://www.drberg.com/blog/the-keto-diet-for-beginners) and is characterized by elevated concentrations of ketones in your blood. Ketosis is safe and associated with a wide range of health benefits, including better energy levels, hormonal balance, and a lower risk of diabetes and metabolic syndrome. In addition, ketones have appetite-suppressing properties, which explains why many people find it easy to lose weight when following a low-carb diet. Watch the video below to discover common causes that can disrupt ketone production.## **How do you know if you’re in ketosis?** There are a few ways to determine if you’re in ketosis. The most common methods involve urine tests, breath meters, or blood tests to analyze ketone concentrations. Though a blood test is invasive and requires a doctor’s visit, it’s more accurate than a breath or urine ketone test, which may

## Keto Constipation: Causes, Solutions, and Prevention Keto constipation is common and can occur due to poor fat digestion, dairy sensitivities, or electrolyte imbalances. Hard stool that’s difficult to pass may also be linked to gut microbes adapting to higher intakes of dietary fiber and fat on the ketogenic diet. Discover the causes of keto diet constipation, eight effective remedies, and how to prevent future problems. ## **What is keto constipation?** Keto constipation is a common side effect of transitioning from a carb-based diet to a high-fat diet. Though keto constipation isn’t a serious issue and typically resolves itself, persistent constipation can cause fecal impaction. Fecal impaction occurs when you can’t pass stool, causing a build-up in the large intestine. This can lead to abdominal pain, loss of appetite, and lethargy. Untreated fecal impaction can also cause more serious problems, including: \* Ulcers \* Colitis \* Colon obstruction Constipation is considered three or fewer bowel movements per week and is associated with discomfort, straining, bloating, and gas. However, if you started keto and poop less without experiencing other symptoms, you may not be constipated. Watch the video below to learn more about constipation on keto.## **What causes keto constipation?** While keto has profound health benefits, including weight loss and better energy levels, transitioning into a high-fat diet triggers various metabolic and digestive changes, which can lead to temporary constipation in some individuals. Here are five causes of constipation on keto. ### **1. Lack of beneficial gut bacteria** [Healthy Keto®](https://www.drberg.com/blog/another-reason-why-you-should-do-healthy-keto) advocates the consumption of between 7 and 10 ten cups of vegetables daily.

Discover the downsides of soy sauce and explore the best alternatives to enjoy the umami flavor without the risk of adverse health effects. ## **What is soy sauce?** Soy sauce is a condiment made from fermented soybeans and wheat. It originated in China over 2,000 years ago and was later introduced to Southeast Asia, Korea, and Japan. There are two types of traditional soy sauce: light and dark. Light soy sauce is the original version with a light brown color, thin consistency, and pleasant, salty flavor. Dark soy sauce undergoes longer fermentation, resulting in a thicker, darker texture and bolder soy taste. Some brands will add molasses or sugar to balance savory and sweet flavors. As the use of soy sauce spread across Asia, numerous varieties developed, culminating in dozens of options that can be broadly categorized into five main types. These include: \* Koikuchi (dark) \* Usukuchi (light) \* Tamari (thicker sauce) \* Shiro shoyu (white or light-colored) \* Saishikomi (sweet) Watch the video below to learn more about the myth of soy products as health foods.## **Is soy sauce keto-friendly?** Regular soy sauce is generally considered keto-friendly because it’s low in carbohydrates and contains minimal amounts of sugar.

## Is Ham Keto-Friendly? | Dr. Berg Deli meats such as ham are a convenient protein source on the go, but is ham keto? While some types of ham are keto-friendly, many lunch meats can be loaded with preservatives, hidden carbs, and sugars that can knock your body out of ketosis. Learn how to choose the best quality low-carb ham that won’t interfere with fat-burning. ## **How many carbs are in ham?** Both cured and uncured hams are nearly carb-free and contain around one gram of carbohydrates per three-ounce (85-gram) serving.

## Is Cottage Cheese Keto? Cottage Cheese vs. Plain Yogurt Everyone wants to know, is cottage cheese keto? Many kinds of cheese are low in net carbs and high in fat, making them a great choice on Healthy Keto–but not all cheeses are equally keto-friendly. One cheese that many people have questions about is cottage cheese. Cottage cheese is incredibly versatile. The soft and creamy texture makes it perfect for salads, vegetable dips, and desserts. Add a pinch of organic sea salt to a serving of cottage cheese, and it works as an excellent side to any meal. ### **But is cottage cheese keto-friendly?** The short answer is **yes**, cottage cheese is keto–but it depends on the type and brand. Full-fat, plain cottage cheese is safe on a ketogenic diet in moderate amounts. But low-fat cottage cheese with added ingredients, like sugar, can quickly push your daily net carbs too high and kick your body out of ketosis. See how cottage cheese compares to plain yogurt on keto.### **What makes cottage cheese keto-friendly?** Keto is a high-fat, low-carb, and moderate-protein diet. The most important factor is keeping your carbs below 30 grams per day. Consuming too many carbohydrates on keto causes a spike in insulin, which can instantly stop ketosis. This is why the type of cottage cheese you consume matters. One serving of cottage cheese can contain anywhere between 3 and 13 grams of net carbs, according to Food Data Central US Dept of Agriculture. The 10-gram gap between the lowest and highest carb count makes all the difference when you have to stay under 30 grams per day.1 Full-fat, plain cottage cheese contains plenty of fat and relatively low carbohydrates, while low-fat cottage cheese can contain far too many carbs to be considered keto. But carbohydrates are not the only factor. If you’re not careful, protein can also trigger

## Are Peas Keto-Friendly? | Dr. Berg Peas are a popular vegetable with a starchy flavor that can be used in sweet and savory recipes. But are peas keto-approved? The answer depends on the exact pea variety and their carbohydrate content. Green peas, for example, aren’t keto-approved, while sugar snap peas can be enjoyed in moderation. Let’s examine the different types of peas and their nutrition facts to determine whether they’re suitable for a Healthy Keto® diet. ## **How many carbs are in peas?** Green peas are the most common type of peas found in most grocery stores. They’re usually sold fresh, canned, or frozen and can be added to soups, salads, stir-fries, and even desserts. However, they’re high in carbs, which can impact blood sugar and insulin levels, making them unsuitable for a ketogenic diet. According to the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), 100 grams of raw green peas contain 14.4 grams of total carbs, which can quickly push you out of ketosis.1 Let’s look at the nutritional value of other pea varieties, measured per 100 grams: Sugar snap peas: \* 41 calories \* 2.3 g protein \* 0 g fat \* 7 g total carbs \* 2.4 g fiber \* 4.6 net carbs Snow peas: \* 42 calories \* 2.8 g protein \* 0.2 g fat \* 7.5 g total carbs \* 2.6 g fiber \* 4.9 g net carbs Split peas: \* 118 calories \* 8.4 g protein \* 0.4 g fat \* 21.1 g total carbs \* 8.3 g fiber \* 12.8 g net carbs ![Hand with fork forming a heart with peas](https://www.drberg.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/healthy-eating-dieting-vegetarian-food-people-26.jpg?w=800) ## **Are peas keto-friendly?** Depending on the exact variety, peas can be keto-approved when consumed in moderation. For instance, sugar snap peas and snow peas contain fewer than five grams of net carbs per 100 grams, making them suitable for a low-carb meal plan. On the other hand, green and split peas should be avoided by those following a ketogenic diet due to their high content of digestible carbs. Digestible

Discover the top seven fermented foods you can enjoy on a ketogenic diet and learn how regularly consuming them can improve your digestive health and overall well-being. ## **What are fermented foods?** Fermentation is a natural process involving the metabolic action of microorganisms, including bacteria and certain yeasts. During fermentation, these microbes convert sugars and starches into various substances, including alcohol, carbon dioxide, and organic acids. Fermentation is a form of food preservation fundamental for producing a wide range of foods and beverages, including sourdough bread, fermented vegetables, cheese, yogurt, kombucha, beer, and wine.

Discover the benefits of vitamin K2 for pregnant and lactating women and know the signs and symptoms of vitamin K deficiency. ![Pregnant woman](https://www.drberg.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/close-pregnant-woman-hands-on-her.jpg?w=800) ## **What is vitamin K2?** Vitamin K belongs to the group of fat-soluble vitamins and naturally occurs in two main forms: [vitamin K1 and vitamin K2](https://www.drberg.com/blog/vitamin-k1-vs-k2-what-s-the-difference). While vitamin K1 is predominantly found in plant foods, vitamin K2 can be obtained from certain animal products and [fermented foods](https://www.drberg.com/blog/fermented-foods-on-keto) and is generally considered the more effective form of vitamin K. Vitamins K1 and K2 regulate the production and activation of blood clotting proteins, also known as coagulation factors, which are critical for wound healing and preventing excessive bleeding. In addition to its role in blood clotting, vitamin K2 is crucial for calcium balance and redirects calcium from the blood into bones and teeth. This supports bone metabolism and lowers the risk of calcium accumulation in soft tissues such as blood vessels, joints, and tendons. Maintaining a healthy vitamin K status is vital for human health, and deficiency can significantly increase the risk of brittle bones, osteoporosis, and [vascular calcification](https://www.drberg.com/blog/what-is-vascular-calcification), a primary risk factor for heart disease. Watch the video below to learn how nutrient deficiencies can impact fetal growth and development. Nutrients during pregnancy ## **Is it safe to take vitamin K2 while pregnant?** Taking vitamin K2 is considered safe during pregnancy, and most prenatal supplements contain vitamin K.

## Is Coke Zero Keto Approved? Explained Clearly Is Diet Coke or Coke Zero keto-friendly? While diet sodas don’t contain carbs, certain ingredients in Diet Coke and Coke Zero are bad for your health and may spike insulin levels. Let’s compare these two popular diet sodas to see how they differ and whether Coke Zero or Diet Coke truly fits within a keto-friendly lifestyle. ## **Is diet soda keto-friendly?** Diet soda can fit into a keto lifestyle, but its compatibility largely depends on the ingredients used. Both Diet Coke and Coke Zero contain carbonated water, caffeine, caramel color, phosphoric acid, aspartame, potassium benzoate, and citric acid. Coke Zero also includes potassium citrate, acesulfame potassium, and natural flavors. While these sodas have zero net carbohydrates, certain [artificial sweeteners](https://www.drberg.com/blog/understanding-alternative-sweeteners), such as aspartame, may influence the body’s insulin response in certain individuals. This can interfere with ketosis and hinder fat-burning. For those following a stricter low-carb approach, choosing diet sodas made without artificial sweeteners or potentially concerning additives may be a more suitable option. Watch the video below to discover why Diet Coke isn’t a good option for a keto-friendly lifestyle.## **Should you drink Diet Coke or Coke Zero on Healthy Keto®?** Diet Coke and Coke Zero contain several ingredients that may not align well with the principles of a nutritious low-carb diet, such as Healthy Keto®. One concern is caramel coloring, which is typically produced by heating sugar, often derived from genetically modified (GMO) corn, with ammonia compounds. This process can result in the formation of advanced glycation end-products (AGEs), which are sticky proteins that may accumulate in organs such as the brain, liver, kidneys, and pancreas. AGEs have been linked to inflammation

## Keto and Hypothyroidism: What You Need to Know The connection between keto and hypothyroidism offers a promising avenue for those seeking to support their thyroid health. While concerns exist regarding low-carb diets disrupting thyroid function, a carefully planned Healthy Keto® approach can support a healthy thyroid gland and improve overall well-being. Learn how Healthy Keto helps support thyroid function and discover practical tips for safely incorporating keto into your lifestyle. [Hypothyroidism](https://www.drberg.com/blog/hyperthyroid-warning) is a common endocrine disorder characterized by the thyroid gland’s inability to produce enough thyroid hormones to regulate the body’s metabolism. The thyroid, a butterfly-shaped gland located in the neck, is responsible for producing and releasing essential thyroid hormones, including triiodothyronine (T3), thyroxine (T4), and calcitonin. These hormones help control and regulate vital physiological functions, including energy metabolism, body temperature, and mood regulation. Because thyroid hormones play a critical role in various biochemical processes and metabolic pathways, hypothyroidism can lead to a wide range of health issues. Common symptoms of hypothyroidism include: \* Low energy \* Weight gain \* Difficulties losing weight \* Intolerance to cold temperatures \* Dry, flaky skin \* Hair loss \* Weak muscles \* Depression \* Brain fog \* Constipation If left untreated, hypothyroidism can progressively worsen, disrupting critical bodily functions and increasing the risk of severe health complications. Hypothyroidism has been linked to an increased risk of various serious health problems, such as: \* Heart disease \* [High cholesterol](https://www.drberg.com/blog/how-to-read-and-understand-cholesterol-numbers) \* Heart failure \* Insulin resistance \* Infertility \* Pregnancy complications \* Nerve damage \* Cognitive decline \* Goiter While iodine deficiency and environmental factors such as radiation exposure can trigger

## Is Butter Good for Weight Loss? Surprising Facts Is butter good for weight loss? Yes! When combined with a nutrient-dense diet plan such as Healthy Keto®, butter can help with weight loss by increasing satiety and promoting hormonal balance. Uncover the remarkable health benefits of grass-fed butter and learn how to choose the highest-quality option for maximum nutritional value and purity. ## **What is butter?** Butter is a dairy product made by churning cream or milk to separate milk solids from the liquid, known as buttermilk. The result is a smooth, creamy spread packed with essential fatty acids and fat-soluble vitamins. Butter is a staple ingredient in kitchens worldwide. Both salted and unsalted butter enhance the sweet and savory flavors of many dishes and add delightful textures to sauces, dips, and pastries. While butter’s rich flavor lends versatility to many dishes, its relatively low smoke point makes it best suited for low to moderate-heat cooking, such as sautéing, baking, and light pan-frying. ### **Butter nutrition facts** One tablespoon (14 grams) of salted, grass-fed butter contains: \* 100 calories \* 12 g fat \* 0 g protein \* 0 g carbohydrates In addition, grass-fed butter is an impressive source of health-promoting nutrients, including: \* Vitamin A \* [Vitamin E](https://www.drberg.com/blog/what-is-vitamin-e) \* Vitamin K2 \* Butyric acid \* Omega-fatty acids \* Conjugated linoleic acid (CLA) Watch the video below to learn how butter can help you achieve a healthy body weight.## **Is butter good for weight loss?** When paired with a whole-food-based, low-carb diet such as Healthy Keto, butter can support weight loss and help promote weight management.

## Solve the Fluid Retention Problem Dietary changes can lead to rapid fluctuations in your body weight, and some people notice the scale going up after starting keto. Gaining weight on keto is often the result of water retention, not body fat gain. If you’re retaining water, it usually signals an imbalance in your diet or lifestyle that requires adjustment. Let’s explore the potential causes of weight gain and water retention on keto and learn natural ways to help reduce fluid retention while following a low-carb diet. ## **What is water weight?** Water weight, also known as fluid retention, refers to excess fluid that accumulates in your body’s tissues, organs, and cellular spaces. Unlike stored body fat, which develops gradually through dietary and lifestyle habits, water weight can fluctuate dramatically within hours or days. Several factors, including nutrient balance, hormonal changes, dietary influences, medications, and lifestyle habits, can influence water retention. Maintaining a healthy lifestyle that emphasizes [proper hydration](https://www.drberg.com/blog/powerade-vs-gatorade), nutrient-rich food, physical activity, and stress reduction is key to supporting optimal fluid balance. Watch the video below to learn common causes of water retention while on keto.## **Causes of fluid retention on keto** When following low-carb diets such as the ketogenic diet, your body undergoes metabolic shifts that directly impact how water is retained and eliminated. During ketosis, carbohydrate intake is drastically reduced. This depletes glycogen, the body’s stored form of glucose, which is tightly bound to water. Approximately three grams of water are bound to every gram of glycogen. In the early stages of keto, glycogen stores are depleted, and the associated water is released, which is why many people experience rapid initial \[weight

## Not Losing Weight on Keto? Key Mistakes to Avoid When you are trying to lose weight on keto, it can be easy to get frustrated when you see that your number on the scale hasn’t changed. Sometimes people are confused, because they find that their weight is not dropping while they are losing inches. Learn about weight loss on keto, what stagnating numbers can mean, and what steps you should take to support your journey best. ## **The Paradox of Losing Inches But Not Weight on Keto** Have you ever noticed your jeans feeling looser, but the scale stubbornly won’t budge? Welcome to the perplexing world of keto, where you can indeed shrink in size without seeing a weight shift. It’s like stuffing a suitcase – it may weigh the same, but rearranging creates more space. This phenomenon is all about body composition changes. ### **Understanding Body Composition Changes** When you’re burning fat and beefing up muscle on keto, your body transforms into a denser version. As you burn fat, you are putting on muscle, which means your weight stays the same while you burn fat, [as confirmed by science](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4386197). ## **Insulin Resistance and Its Impact on Metabolism** Insulin resistance can seriously slow weight loss down inside your body. ![Intermittent fasting concept](https://www.drberg.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/1_intermittent-fasting-healthy-breakfast-diet-food.jpg?w=800) ### **How Keto and Intermittent Fasting Can Help** Keto helps by lowering blood sugar levels, which helps repair cells. [Intermittent fasting](https://www.drberg.com/blog/categories/diet/fasting) has been shown by studies as another way to improve sensitivity, so cells respond better when insulin comes knocking. The result is more than just losing inches around your waist–it’s about getting healthier overall because, remember, a [slow metabolism](https://www.drberg.com/blog/slow-metabolism-is-a-myth-not-kidding) often goes hand-in-hand with insulin resistance.

## What Is Erythritol, and Is It Healthy for You? What is erythritol, and is it safe? Erythritol is a type of sugar alcohol and a popular table sugar alternative widely used in diet and low-calorie foods and beverages. Because erythritol doesn’t impact blood glucose levels, it’s suitable for individuals following a low-carb ketogenic diet, diabetics, and those seeking to support metabolic health. Discover the surprising health benefits of erythritol and learn why it’s crucial to choose the right type to support blood sugar balance while minimizing the risk of adverse effects. ## **What is erythritol?** Erythritol is a type of sugar alcohol found naturally in certain fermented foods and beverages, including cheese, soy sauce, and specific wine varieties. Commercially, erythritol is typically produced by fermenting corn-derived glucose, resulting in a calorie-free sweetener that offers around 70 percent of the sweetness of sugar without significantly impacting blood sugar levels. Despite it being classified as a sugar alcohol, erythritol doesn’t contain alcohol and has no intoxicating properties, making it a suitable sugar substitute for all ages. Unlike traditional sugars, erythritol isn’t absorbed or metabolized and largely passes through the digestive system unchanged. This characteristic allows erythritol to activate sweet taste receptors and deliver a similar sweetness to sugar without spiking blood glucose levels. As a result, erythritol is suitable for people with diabetes who need to limit sugar intake and those following a ketogenic diet. Watch the video below to learn more about erythritol.## **Is erythritol safe?** Compared to other sugar alcohols such as sorbitol and mannitol, erythritol is well-tolerated and associated with fewer digestive issues such as bloating or abdominal pain. However, a study published in _Nature Medicine_ reported that individuals

## The Best Ways to Cook Eggs for Maximum Benefits Eggs are nutritional powerhouses rich in essential nutrients needed to maintain eye, brain, and skin health and a versatile ingredient that complements a variety of dishes. However, over- or undercooking may destroy nutrients or expose you to potentially harmful bacteria, and using the wrong type of fat to cook eggs may contribute to inflammation and heart disease. Discover the healthiest ways to cook eggs and unlock their full nutritional benefits with ten delicious, keto-friendly egg recipes. ## **The healthiest ways to cook eggs** There are dozens of ways to cook an egg, but using the right methods helps preserve nutritional value and enhance nutrient absorption while minimizing the risk of exposure to harmful bacteria. One of the key considerations when preparing eggs is to avoid overcooking the yolk, as this can destroy or reduce the availability of many of its essential nutrients. Here are four of the best ways to cook eggs. ### **1. Poached eggs** A poached egg is prepared by cracking an egg into a pot of water heated to between 160 and 180°F (70 to 80°C) and cooking for approximately 2.5 minutes. This results in a tender egg white and a perfectly runny yolk. Poached eggs are a popular addition to dishes such as eggs Benedict and ratatouille, a classic French vegetable stew. They’re also commonly paired with avocado toast or served alongside tender asparagus for a flavorful and nutritious meal. ### **2. Fried eggs** Fried eggs, widely known as sunny-side-up eggs, are typically cooked in a pan using butter, coconut, olive, or avocado oil. Fried eggs can be prepared in several ways, including: \* Over-easy \* Over-medium \* Over-hard Over-easy eggs are cooked for 3 minutes on one side, flipped, and then cooked for 30 seconds, creating a perfectly runny yolk. Over-medium eggs are fried for 3 minutes, flipped, and cooked for another minute, leaving a slightly set yolk with a creamy center. Over-hard eggs are cooked

## Coconut Oil vs Olive Oil: Which is Better? Coconut oil and olive oil have received much attention for their health benefits in recent years and are two of the most popular cooking oils on the market. Let’s talk about why coconut and olive oils are heart-healthy, keto-friendly fats that deserve a spot in your kitchen. ## **Benefits of coconut oil** Coconut oil is derived from the meat of mature coconuts, offering a light, delicate flavor and excellent heat stability, making it ideal for cooking, baking, and pan-frying–plus, it’s keto-friendly. As for [coconut milk](https://www.drberg.com/blog/is-coconut-milk-or-water-keto-friendly), yes, it’s also keto-friendly. Both coconut milk and coconut oil are excellent additions to keto, providing healthy fats while being low in carbs. Here are four impressive health benefits of coconut oil. ### **1. Promotes heart health** You may have heard that coconut oil is high in saturated fat and not heart-healthy, but this is a common misconception. In fact, research published in _Nutrients_ indicates that coconut oil can help increase levels of high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, widely regarded as the good cholesterol, as it plays a key role in protecting your arteries and supporting heart health.1 ### **2. Help strengthen the immune system** Coconut oil is a rich source of lauric acid, a fatty acid with profound health benefits, especially in relation to supporting the body’s immune defenses. Lauric acid helps boost immune function and possesses antimicrobial properties that help protect against harmful microorganisms, including _Escherichia coli_ and [_Helicobacter pylori_](https://www.drberg.com/blog/6-natural-alternatives-for-helicobacter-pylori) as well as common stomach viruses. ### **3.

## Best Dairy Products: Top Picks & Healthy Choices The best dairy products for keto are high in healthy fats, low in carbs, and free of added sugar–helping you stay in ketosis while enjoying rich, satisfying flavors. From grass-fed butter to full-fat yogurts, these choices provide essential nutrients, including vitamin D and calcium. Let’s explore which dairy options best suit your keto goals that offer both nutritional value and versatility for your everyday meals. Whole milk and full-fat dairy products are rich sources of essential nutrients such as calcium, phosphorus, and protein, which are vital for maintaining strong bone density and reducing the risk of [osteoporosis](https://www.drberg.com/blog/the-truth-about-osteoporosis-and-osteopenia). Other dairy foods, especially fermented types, such as Greek yogurt and kefir, can promote digestive health and may contribute to optimal heart function. This has been confirmed by a study published in _Nutrition Reviews_, which highlights that yogurt consumption positively impacts cardiovascular outcomes, such as improved cholesterol and lower blood pressure.1 However, consuming large amounts of processed dairy or those high in added sugars and saturated fat has been associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease and metabolic issues. In addition, for individuals with lactose intolerance or milk allergies, dairy can cause gastrointestinal discomfort or allergic reactions. The nutritional role of milk and dairy products varies depending on the type, quality, and personal dietary needs, including those of children, older adults, and pregnant women. Watch the video below to learn about the best and worst dairy products.## **Benefits of consuming dairy products** Incorporating high-quality dairy foods into a nutritious diet can offer a range of health benefits.

## Frozen Yogurt vs Ice Cream: Which Is Better? Frozen yogurt vs. ice cream-which one is healthier? Both desserts can provide nutritional benefits. However, depending on how they’re made, they can have potential drawbacks. Understanding their differences can help you make a more informed decision when choosing a sweet treat. Explore the similarities and differences between frozen yogurt and ice cream and learn how to select the highest-quality option that supports your health and wellness goals. ## **Frozen yogurt vs. ice cream: what’s the difference?** While frozen yogurt and ice cream share a creamy texture and indulgent taste, they differ considerably in their ingredients and production methods. These variations play a key role in shaping their nutritional profiles and overall health effects. Here are key differences between frozen yogurt and ice cream. ### **How they’re made** Frozen yogurt consists primarily of milk or cream fermented with live bacteria such as _Lactobacillus bulgaricus_ or _Streptococcus thermophilus._ Usually, this mixture is left to ferment for 6 to 8 hours at low temperatures of around 100 to 110 degrees F (38 to 43 degrees C). After fermentation, the [yogurt](https://www.drberg.com/blog/can-i-eat-yogurt-on-the-ketogenic-diet) base is typically churned to introduce air and achieve a light and creamy texture. During this stage, sweeteners, stabilizers, and flavors are typically added before the mixture is frozen. In contrast, ice cream is made from a base of cream, milk, sugar, salt, and eggs. The ingredients are simmered at around 170 degrees F (77 degrees C) to create a custard-like base, which is then chilled and churned. To create soft-serve ice cream, the churning process is faster, and the mixture is typically served at a slightly warmer temperature, resulting in a smoother, softer texture. Watch the video below to learn whether frozen yogurt or ice cream is the better choice.

## Italian Pasta vs American Pasta: Explained Recently I received a question from someone who asked me why they eat pasta and pizza without noticeable issues while they’re in Europe but have unpleasant after-effects eating grain-based meals when they’re in the US. The answer may surprise you. First, let’s take a look at what happens when you consume grain-based meals in the US instead of Europe. **In this article:** 1. **The unpleasant difference** 2. **Why fortified grains are a problem** 3. **Healthy pasta alternatives** 4. **Healthy pizza alternatives** 5. **Refrain from grains** ## **The Unpleasant Difference** People who’ve eaten meals of pasta and pizza in Europe often notice an unpleasant difference when they eat the same foods here in the US. They feel bloated and heavy after eating a pasta or pizza meal in the US; whereas, in Europe, they don’t suffer the same effects. Though you may believe this means eating grains in Europe is healthy, there’s a catch. Ideally you wouldn’t be consuming bread, pasta, cereal, pizza and the like – no matter where you are. Especially if you’re on the keto diet because eating these high carbohydrate foods will bump you out of [ketosis](https://www.drberg.com/guides-resources/beginners-guide-to-healthy-keto-intermittent-fasting), the normal process that happens when your body doesn’t have enough carbs to burn for energy. Instead, it burns fat and makes substances called ketones, which it can use for fuel. Ketosis is the basis for a ketogenic diet. When your body adapts to burning fat and ketones for fuel, you’ll lose weight, increase your energy, and experience heightened mental clarity. Thus, when you eat grain-based foods that are high in carbohydrates, you deprive yourself of the benefits of ketosis. But if you do decide to eat grain products, the reason you have problems immediately after eating them in the US (or in Canada or Great Britain, for that matter) is that

## Fries vs Chips: Which Is Worse for Your Health? Potato chips vs. French fries–which one is worse? While both French fries and potato chips are popular options, they aren’t a healthy choice due to their high carbohydrate, refined fat, and sodium content. Here’s why potato chips and French fries don’t align with a health-focused diet, and what suitable alternatives you can choose to curb potato cravings on a ketogenic diet. The glycemic index (GI) measures how much a food affects blood sugar levels. For potato-based foods, the GI can vary significantly depending on the cooking methods used. While raw potatoes have a GI close to zero, meaning they have no impact on blood sugar levels, fried potato products typically have a much higher glycemic index and can cause a more significant [spike in blood sugar levels](https://www.drberg.com/blog/normal-blood-sugar-level). This is due to the cooking process, which alters the starch structure and makes it easier for the body to digest and absorb, leading to faster increases in blood glucose concentrations. ### **French fries nutrition facts** Here are the nutrition facts for a medium order of McDonald’s French fries: \* 365 calories \* 18 g fat \* 5 g protein \* 43 g carbohydrates French fries have a glycemic index of 75, which classifies them as a high-GI food, meaning they have a significant impact on blood sugar balance. When paired with ketchup, which typically contains added sugars, the glycemic impact can rise even further. Unless you’re preparing French fries at home, it can be difficult to know exactly what ingredients are used. Fast food chains often incorporate chemical preservatives, additives, [dextrose](https://www.drberg.com/blog/9-bad-keto-ingredients-to-avoid), and artificial flavorings, which can further detract from their nutritional value. ### **Potato chips nutrition facts** Here are the nutrition facts of a small bag of Lay’s chips: \* 160 calories \* 10 g fat \* 2 g protein \* 15 g carbohydrates Potato chips are

## Postural Orthostatic Tachycardia Syndrome: Hidden Causes Have you heard of Postural Orthostatic Tachycardia Syndrome (POTS)? This condition makes it challenging to tolerate positional changes, like standing up quickly. What if there was a surprising nutritional link? This article explores the potential connection between POTS and [vitamin B1 deficiency](https://www.drberg.com/blog/vitamin-b1-thiamine-deficiency-the-great-imitator-of-other-illnesses) and how this vitamin could be a game-changer for those seeking answers. ## **POTS: A Closer Look** Imagine lying down, feeling relaxed. You decide to stand up, and suddenly, your heart starts racing. Dizziness washes over you, your vision blurs, and you feel faint. This is a glimpse into the daily reality of many individuals with POTS. Often misdiagnosed, POTS can significantly impact a person’s quality of life. ### **Symptoms and Misunderstandings** Beyond the hallmark symptom of lightheadedness upon standing, POTS often presents other debilitating symptoms. These symptoms are similar to those experienced by individuals with tachycardia syndrome. Many POTS patients experience tachycardia syndrome-like symptoms such as fatigue and brain fog. \* [Fatigue](https://www.drberg.com/blog/fatigued-on-keto-and-when-fasting) \* [Brain fog](https://www.drberg.com/blog/brain-fog-tip) \* [Anxiety](https://www.drberg.com/success-stories/anxiety-panic-attacks) \* Gastrointestinal Issues \* Temperature sensitivity Because the symptoms are so varied, pinpointing POTS can be tricky, even for experienced medical professionals. This is where understanding potential underlying factors, like a possible POTS vitamin B1 deficiency, becomes essential. ## **Vitamin B1: An Unsung Hero?** Let’s talk about [vitamin B1, also known as thiamine](https://www.drberg.com/blog/vitamin-b1-thiamine-deficiency-signs-symptoms-and-treatment-benefits). You may know it plays a role in energy production. However, were you aware of its connection to nerve function?

## 8 Natural Beta-blockers - The Best Alternative Sources Beta-blockers are drugs that reduce stress on your heart by reducing the effects of stress hormones. Natural beta blockers–including nutritional and herbal supplements–can provide similar benefits without the potential side effects of prescription medications. ![Natural beta\_blockers](https://www.drberg.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/heart-shape-ketogenic-low-carbs-diet.jpg?w=800) ## **What are beta-blockers?** Beta-blockers (also known as a beta-adrenergic blockade) are substances that lower your heart rate and blood pressure. They do this by blocking your beta cell receptors from receiving stress hormones–especially norepinephrine (also known as noradrenaline or adrenaline). As a result, this stops the effects of stress hormones on your cardiovascular system. ## **Autonomic nervous system and stress explained** The autonomic nervous system is made up of three distinct components: sympathetic, parasympathetic, and enteric. These control involuntary bodily functions, including blood pressure, heart rate, digestion, respiration, and arousal. We’re going to focus on the sympathetic nervous system and the parasympathetic nervous system. The sympathetic nervous system (SNS) is responsible for the involuntary responses your body has to stressful and dangerous situations–perceived or real. This is often referred to as the fight-or-flight response. When activated, your SNS triggers the production and release of stress hormones, including adrenaline and cortisol. This natural response to stress increases your blood pressure and heart rate, so more oxygen reaches your muscles and your body is ready to respond to a potential threat. A flood of stress hormones can happen instantaneously while in a fight-or-flight state–often before you’ve realized it has occurred. If you’ve ever had to quickly jump out of the way of a moving object or dodge a stray frisbee, you’ve experienced this firsthand. The parasympathetic nervous

## Vaccine Induced Autoimmunity - Dr. Berg Can vaccines trigger autoimmune conditions? Here’s what you need to know. Timestamps: 0:00 Vaccine-induced autoimmunity 0:53 What is ASIA? 2:18 Side effects of vaccines 6:09 Molecular mimicry 7:49 Aluminum adjuvants 9:29 Need keto consulting? In this video, we’re going to talk about ASIA. ASIA is an autoimmune/inflammatory syndrome induced by adjuvants. What does this mean? We’ll ASIA is essentially when a vaccine triggers an autoimmune situation. This information comes straight from a textbook called Vaccines and Autoimmunity. This book is written using decades of experience in vaccinology, immunology, and autoimmunity. Aluminum hydroxide is one of the adjuvants found in vaccines–in fact, it’s the only approved adjuvant in the United States. This word “adjuvant” means to help–or to make the immune response strong. Macrophages actually eat the aluminum, carry it through the lymphatic system across the blood-brain barrier, where the aluminum gets stuck. In Vaccines and Autoimmunity, the author talks about how vaccines can cause autoimmunity in susceptible individuals. For instance, the vaccine for Lyme disease is capable of triggering arthritis in animal studies. Many of these effects can be delayed up to 10 months or even longer. In susceptible people, vaccines can even trigger possibly fatal autoimmune conditions. Without being screened, children receive around 19 vaccines during infancy. This could be a huge problem when it comes to autoimmunity. The toxicity from these types of metals accumulate over time, and the reactions are often delayed between weeks up to years. How to lower aluminum toxicity: 1. Silica 2. Taurine 3. Vitamin E (tocotrienals) 4. Selenium 5.

Eating sunflower seeds supports cardiovascular health, promotes a robust immune system, and may reduce blood pressure. Find out how you can incorporate sunflower seeds into your keto lifestyle! ## **What is keto?** The ketogenic diet is a low-carb, high-fat diet that helps your body to enter a state of ketosis. During ketosis, the body burns fat for fuel instead of carbs. To maintain ketosis, consume no more than 20 to 50 grams of net carbs daily and get most of your calories from healthy fats. Keto can lead to rapid weight loss and has other potential health benefits, including improved blood sugar control, increased energy, and reduced risk of type-2 diabetes. Healthy Keto® is a nutritious diet focusing on high-quality, nutrient-rich foods that help you to maintain ketosis and support your health. Watch the video below to learn which [keto-friendly seeds and nuts](https://www.drberg.com/blog/best-nuts-on-a-ketogenic-diet-surprising) you should eat to support your health and well-being.## **Are sunflower seeds low-carb?** You’ll find sunflower seeds on our [Keto Food List](https://www.drberg.com/blog/ketogenic-diet-food-list) because they’re rich in healthy fat and dietary fiber and low in net carbs.

## Best Nuts for Keto: What to Eat on Low-Carb While nuts are a natural, whole food that can be an excellent addition to a nutritious, low-carb diet such as Healthy Keto®, not all types of nuts are suitable for a ketogenic diet. Discover the best nuts for keto and learn how to incorporate these nutritional powerhouses into your low-carb lifestyle without disrupting ketosis or fat-burning. ## **Six reasons to eat nuts on the keto diet** Excluding nuts from your keto lifestyle means missing out on a powerhouse of health benefits. Packed with healthy fats, fiber, and essential nutrients, nuts support heart and brain health, enhance memory, and help your body combat inflammation and infections. Here are six reasons why nuts are an excellent choice for keto. ### **1. Rich sources of healthy fats** To maintain ketosis and benefit from fat-burning, it’s crucial to focus on high-fat, low-carb foods. Keto-friendly nuts deliver high-quality fats essential for energy production, hormone balance, and the absorption of fat-soluble vitamins. They’re an ideal, nutrient-rich source of fat that fully supports the metabolic state of ketosis. ### **2. Low in carbs** To trigger and maintain ketosis, it’s essential to keep your net carb intake under 50 grams per day. Choosing the right nuts can help you achieve this as they deliver healthy fats and essential nutrients without the carb overload. ### **3. Support satiety** Due to their high fat and fiber content, nuts slow digestion and promote a lasting feeling of fullness. This increased satiety can help curb cravings and reduce the need to snack between meals, making nuts a powerful ally in your weight loss journey. ### **4. Nutritional powerhouses** Tree nuts boast an impressive nutrient profile, as they’re packed with essential vitamins, minerals, antioxidants, and phytosterols, which are plant compounds known to support healthy cholesterol levels and overall heart health. According to research published in _Nutrients_, regular

## Is Maltodextrin Keto-Friendly? Sweeteners on Keto Is maltodextrin keto? No, maltodextrin is not keto-friendly. This synthetic carbohydrate causes blood sugar and insulin spikes, and even small amounts of maltodextrin can quickly push you out of ketosis. Unfortunately, maltodextrin is found in many processed foods and isn’t required to be listed as an added sugar on food labels. This can make it hard for consumers to avoid maltodextrin and its adverse effects on blood glucose regulation and metabolic health. Learn why maltodextrin is the worst hidden sugar and which sweeteners you can safely use on a keto diet. ## **What is maltodextrin?** Maltodextrin is a synthetic and highly processed carbohydrate with a slightly sweet taste. Because of its chemical structure, maltodextrin isn’t classified as a sugar, despite it being high on the glycemic index, which measures how fast a carbohydrate is absorbed and how rapidly it spikes your blood sugar levels. The higher the glycemic index, the more impact a carb has on your blood sugar and insulin levels, which increases the risk of insulin resistance, obesity, and metabolic syndrome. Maltodextrin isn’t as sweet as sugar but has a considerably higher glycemic index than most other carbohydrates and scores 110 on the glycemic index. In comparison, regular table sugar and brown sugar have a glycemic index of 65. Watch the video below to find out why maltodextrin isn’t keto-friendly.## **How is maltodextrin made?** Maltodextrin is produced by hydrolyzing starch derived from corn, potato, wheat, or rice, which results in an odorless white powder with a slightly sweet taste. A process called partial hydrolysis breaks chemical bonds and shortens long chains of glucose by using heat, enzymes, or, more commonly, sulphuric acid. Sulphuric acid is a harsh chemical that is also used to produce corn syrup and can cause gastrointestinal

## Keto Cycling: Smart Strategy or Setback? Keto cycling promises flexibility within the ketogenic diet, but does it help you reach your goals, or could it hinder your progress? Let’s examine the pros and cons of keto cycling to determine if it’s the right choice for you and learn how to maximize the health benefits of a low-carb diet. ## **Keto basics** The standard keto diet is a low-carbohydrate, high-fat eating plan that typically limits carbohydrate intake to 50 grams or less per day while emphasizing healthy fats and moderate amounts of protein. The primary goal of this diet is to transition the body from using glucose as a fuel source to burning fat to generate energy in the form of ketones. This highly efficient metabolic process, referred to as ketosis, has been linked to several potential benefits, including weight loss, improved mental clarity, reduced inflammation, and more stable energy levels. _“The most effective way to follow a ketogenic diet is by focusing on nutrient-dense foods, avoiding inflammatory ingredients, and steering clear of processed foods,”_ explains Dr. Berg. This method is known as [Healthy Keto®](https://www.drberg.com/blog/healthy-keto-plan-start-here), which, in addition to low-carb intake, prioritizes a balanced diet of nutritious and healthy foods to promote optimal nutrient intake and overall metabolic health. Healthy Keto focuses on quality foods such as pasture-raised meat and eggs, grass-fed dairy, and healthy fats, including avocado, olive oil, and coconut oil. It also includes wild-caught fish, organic, non-genetically modified (GMO) vegetables, nuts, and seeds. These whole foods promote fat-burning while providing essential nutrients without the harmful additives or inflammatory compounds found in most processed foods. Watch the video below to learn if carb cycling is healthy while following a ketogenic diet.## \*\*What is

## Is Kimchi Keto-Friendly? – Carbs in Kimchi Kimchi is a traditional Korean side dish made from fermented vegetables. It’s a potent probiotic food with many health benefits–but is kimchi keto-friendly? Yes, traditional kimchi is keto-friendly and an excellent addition to a nutritious ketogenic diet plan. Discover six reasons why you should eat kimchi regularly on a low-carb diet. ## **What is kimchi?** Kimchi is a traditional Korean dish comprising fermented vegetables such as Napa cabbage, onions, and radish. While many kimchi recipes use different seasoning blends, most kimchi products include fish sauce, minced garlic, ginger root, and red pepper flakes. During the fermentation process, lactic acid bacteria that are naturally present on the vegetables convert carbohydrates into lactic acid, which is responsible for kimchi’s tangy and slightly sharp flavor. Fermentation has been used for centuries to preserve various foods, including vegetables, fruits, meat, soybean sprouts, and dairy products. _“Lactic acid has potent antimicrobial properties that inhibit the growth of microorganisms that cause foods to rot and become moldy,”_ explains Dr. Berg. _“That’s why fermented vegetables can last several months without spoiling.”_ Kimchi is typically topped with green onions and served as a condiment or side dish, or it can be used as an ingredient to make kimchi jjigae, a popular Korean cabbage stew. Watch the video below to learn why you should regularly incorporate kimchi into your keto diet plan.## **How many carbs are in kimchi?** The exact carbohydrate content of kimchi depends on the fermentation period and the specific recipe of the kimchi brand you plan to use. According to data published by the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA)_,_ one cup (150 grams) of kimchi typically contains:1 \* 15 calories \* 0 g total fat \* 1 g

## Is 5-Hour Energy Bad for You? Energy Drinks on Keto 5-Hour Energy is a popular, sugar-free energy shot that claims to contain important vitamins and minerals and provide you with five hours of energy without a crash. With such positive claims, you may be wondering, is 5-Hour energy bad for you? The answer is yes. Energy shots and energy drinks provide the body with artificial energy. Energy drinks claim to improve energy levels, cognitive function, and exercise performance, but they can actually do the opposite! Find out about the dangers of 5-Hour Energy shots and how to choose a healthier alternative. ## **What’s in 5-Hour Energy?** The 5-Hour Energy blend is composed of high levels of caffeine, synthetic vitamins, and amino acids to stimulate your nervous system. Here are some of the ingredients found in a 2-ounce serving of 5-Hour Energy: \* Splenda \* Synthetic B vitamins \* Tyrosine \* Phenylalanine \* Taurine \* Enzymes \* Caffeine The caffeine content of 5-Hour Energy shots ranges from 215 milligrams to 242 milligrams, depending on whether it’s the extra strength version or the regular version. This is more than double the caffeine in a cup of coffee.## **Is 5-Hour Energy bad for you?** In short, yes. “Caffeine is not a fuel; it’s a stimulant,” explains Dr. Berg. It gives an artificial sense of energy but is really just revving up your adrenal glands and stimulating your nervous system. Artificial stimulation will eventually lead to burnout. 5-Hour Energy has been cited for 11 deaths, meaning 11 people had 5-Hour Energy in their system when they died. While it’s difficult to pinpoint 5-Hour Energy as the exact cause of death, it’s considered a potential cause. If you have any known health conditions, consult with a healthcare professional to determine if energy drinks and supplements are safe for you. !\[dangerous side

## Low Oxalate Nuts: Best Picks for Kidney Health Dealing with [kidney stones](https://www.drberg.com/blog/kidney-stones-101-comprehensive-guide) can be painful. If you’ve had them, you’re likely seeking ways to prevent future ones. Dietary changes, like understanding oxalates and reducing oxalate intake, often help. Many people enjoy nuts, but could some nuts contribute to kidney stone issues? This leads us to low oxalate nuts. Let’s explore what you need to know about oxalates and which nuts are your best choices for maintaining healthy oxalate levels. ## **Understanding Oxalates and Kidney Stones** Kidney stones are hard deposits that form in your kidneys. The most common type is calcium oxalate stones. Limiting oxalate fruits and other [high-oxalate foods](https://www.drberg.com/blog/high-oxalate-foods) can be important if you’re prone to these stones. Keep in mind that not everyone reacts to oxalates the same way. Individual oxalate levels can vary. However, not everyone processes oxalates the same way. Genetics, hydration levels, and overall diet can affect how the body handles oxalates. While some people can tolerate moderate oxalate levels, others may need to adhere strictly to a low-oxalate diet to prevent stones. Understanding which foods are high in oxalates–including certain nuts–is a vital first step toward dietary management. ### **Why Are Some Nuts High in Oxalates?** Almonds, for example, have various health benefits. However, they are a higher oxalate food and could cause issues for someone on a low-oxalate diet. Cashews, peanuts, and [sunflower seeds](https://www.drberg.com/blog/nuts-and-seeds-on-a-ketogenic-diet) also tend to have higher oxalate levels, especially when eaten in larger amounts. Those on oxalate diets will want to limit these. ## **Navigating the World of Low Oxalate Nuts** So, what are the best low-oxalate nuts?

## Are Mushrooms Keto-Friendly? Benefits of Mushrooms on Keto Mushrooms offer unique textures and flavors and have been used for culinary and medicinal purposes for centuries. But are mushrooms keto-friendly? Yes, mushrooms are keto-friendly and have impressive health benefits, which makes them an excellent choice for a nutritious ketogenic diet. Discover five reasons why you should eat more mushrooms on a low-carb diet. ## **How many carbs are in mushrooms?** While the exact carbohydrate content of mushrooms depends on the specific variety, mushrooms are generally low in carbs and on the keto food list. Not only are mushrooms a low-carb food, but they also contain dietary fiber, which explains why most mushrooms have an impressively low net carb count. Here is the net carb count of common types of raw mushrooms per one cup (100 grams) serving: \* **White mushrooms (button mushrooms):** 1 gram \* **Portobello mushrooms:** 2 grams \* **Cremini mushrooms:** 2 grams \* **Chanterelle mushrooms:** 2 grams \* **Oyster mushrooms:** 3 grams \* **Shiitake mushrooms:** 4 grams \* **Morel mushrooms:** 4 grams \* **King oyster mushrooms:** 5 grams Watch the video below to learn why you should eat more mushrooms on keto.## **Are mushrooms keto-friendly?** Yes, mushrooms are keto-friendly! Because mushrooms have a naturally low net carb count, they’re on the [keto food list](https://www.drberg.com/blog/ketogenic-diet-food-list) and should feature regularly on your keto meal plan. Most mushroom varieties contain two to four grams of carbs per one-cup serving, which is unlikely to exceed your daily net carb limit or interfere with fat burning. However, it’s important to check the nutrition labels of pre-packaged mushroom products, such as cream of mushroom soup or stuffed mushrooms, as they may contain wheat flour and other high-carb ingredients that can quickly disrupt ketosis. !\[Handful

## Best Sources of Protein on Keto Optimal protein intake is vital for maintaining various biological functions, including muscle building, immune function, tissue repair, and hormone synthesis. Protein is a vital macronutrient, but choosing the right types and consuming the proper amounts is crucial for maintaining health and achieving optimal results while in ketosis. Discover the best sources of protein on keto, find out how much protein you need, and learn to select high-quality options for maximum benefits. ## **What is protein?** Protein is one of the three essential macronutrients, alongside carbohydrates and fats. It’s composed of amino acids and found in a wide range of animal- and plant-based foods. Also known as the body’s building blocks, amino acids are crucial for making new proteins involved in physiological functions such as tissue and bone repair, muscle building, growth and development, and hormone synthesis. The body can naturally produce 11 nonessential amino acids, but it cannot make the nine essential amino acids, which must be obtained from food sources. Watch the video below to learn more about the best protein sources.## **The importance of protein on a keto diet** Protein is a vital part of any healthy diet, but it becomes especially important on a keto diet, where carbohydrate intake is limited to just five to ten percent of daily calories. Reducing carbohydrate intake triggers ketosis, a metabolic state that uses stored body fat and dietary fats to generate energy for the cells instead of relying on blood sugar as a fuel source. If your macronutrients aren’t properly balanced, a protein deficiency could occur, causing the body to break down muscle for energy. On the other hand, excessive protein intake on keto can disrupt ketosis and halt fat burning. Consuming the right amount of protein is crucial for maintaining lean muscle mass while

## Protein Basics: Benefits, Sources, and Daily Intake Protein provides amino acids needed for critical physiological functions such as tissue repair, muscle growth, hormone balance, cellular structure and integrity, and metabolic processes. While various animal and plant-based foods offer protein, the quality and bioavailability can vary, making some sources more effective at delivering this essential macronutrient than others. Discover the most nutritious protein-rich foods and find out how much protein you really need to maintain a healthy body. ## **What is protein?** Protein is an essential macronutrient made up of amino acids, which are also referred to as the building blocks of life. Amino acids play a critical role in repairing and building tissues, maintaining muscle mass, promoting [hormonal balance](https://www.drberg.com/blog/use-ketogenic-diet-to-balance-your-hormone), and supporting healthy bodily functions. In addition, amino acids are needed to produce enzymes, which are protein structures that facilitate all chemical reactions in the body. This makes protein an indispensable nutrient for overall health. There are nine essential amino acids that the body cannot produce on its own, and must be obtained from dietary sources. Foods that offer all of these essential amino acids are called complete proteins, with most sources coming from animal products. Although there are plenty of plant-based protein sources, very few contain all nine essential amino acids, leaving those following a vegetarian or vegan diet at risk of amino acid deficiency and associated health issues. Compared to carbohydrates, both protein and healthy fats must be consumed daily as part of a nutritious diet to maintain critical bodily functions. _“A healthy diet must feature adequate amounts of protein from high-quality whole food sources,”_ explains Dr. Berg. \_“Lack of protein can lead to significant health issues, including infertility, muscle loss, weakened immune function, and poor

## Best Time to Drink Apple Cider Vinegar Daily The best time to drink apple cider vinegar is in the morning or before meals to support digestion, promote satiety, and help manage blood sugar levels throughout the day. Discover the optimal timing for apple cider vinegar consumption and learn how to incorporate this natural remedy into your daily routine. ## **What is apple cider vinegar?** Apple cider vinegar is a fermented liquid made from apple juice that undergoes a two-step process involving yeast and beneficial bacteria. First, the sugars are converted into alcohol and then into acetic acid, which is the compound responsible for apple cider vinegar’s sharp flavor and functional properties. _“Raw, unfiltered varieties often contain the mother, a cloudy substance formed during the fermentation process that consists of proteins, enzymes, and healthy bacteria,”_ explains Dr. Berg. The presence of the mother is what distinguishes raw apple cider vinegar and may contribute to its role in supporting gut health and digestion. Consuming apple cider vinegar with the mother is popular in wellness routines due to its association with naturally occurring [probiotic bacteria](https://www.drberg.com/blog/probiotics-keto) and various essential nutrients. It also has antibacterial and antifungal properties, making it a versatile addition to culinary and household uses. Apple cider vinegar is often used as a tangy addition to salad dressings, marinades, or sauces to enhance flavor. Moreover, when paired with consistent nutritious eating habits, regular apple cider vinegar consumption may assist in weight loss and blood sugar management.

## Best MCT Oil Types for Energy and Fat Loss Medium-chain triglyceride oil, widely known as MCT oil, consists of various short-chain fatty acids, each offering impressive benefits. To determine the best MCT oil for your needs, it’s crucial to understand the unique chemical compositions and specific health effects of these fats. Let’s compare different MCT oils and discover how to incorporate them into your routine to promote weight loss, enhance energy production, and lower your risk of microbial infections. ## **What is MCT oil?** MCT oil is a widely used supplement composed of medium-chain triglycerides (MCTs), a group of fatty acids known for their significant health benefits. Most MCT oils are derived from coconut and palm oil, and depending on their source and extraction method, the oil may vary in its specific fatty acid composition. While MCTs are classified as a type of saturated fat, they have a different chemical composition than long-chain triglycerides, which affects how they’re metabolized in the body. MCTs are rapidly absorbed and transported into the liver, where they can be immediately converted into ketones, a highly efficient energy source, especially for the brain, muscle cells, and heart tissue. _“Because MCTs can be quickly converted into ketones, MCT oil is a popular supplement for those following a keto diet as it can enhance fat-burning by boosting ketosis and increase energy levels,”_ explains Dr. Berg. Watch the video below to learn more about the different types of MCTs.## **MCT oil forms compared** MCT oil typically comprises four different types of medium-chain fatty acids, which vary in chain length and are classified based on their number of carbon atoms. Here’s how MCTs are categorized and the health benefits associated with each of these healthy fats. ### **Caproic acid (C6)** Caproic acid contains six carbon atoms, which makes it

## MCT Oil in Coffee: Effective Keto Fuel Explained Medium-chain triglycerides (MCTs) are health-promoting fatty acids that enhance ketone production, support metabolic balance, and can help prolong your fasting periods. Discover the impressive health benefits of MCT oil in coffee and learn why you should put MCTs on your keto diet plan. ## **What is MCT oil?** MCT oil is a rich source of medium-chain triglycerides, a group of fatty acids with profound benefits for metabolic health. Most MCT oils are derived from [coconut oil](https://www.drberg.com/blog/palm-oil-vs-coconut-oil-health-benefits), which contains exceptionally high concentrations of MCTs such as lauric acid, caprylic acid, and capric acid. MCTs are extracted from coconut oil through fractionation, which involves cooling the oil to trigger its crystallization. Different fatty acids have different crystallization points, which helps selectively harden and separate the MCTs from the other fatty acids in coconut oil. Watch the video below to learn why you should be putting MCT oil in your coffee.## **Why are MCTs important?** As their name implies, MCTs have a shorter carbon chain than long-chain triglycerides, making them easier to digest and allowing for rapid intestinal absorption. Because MCTs are shorter, they require significantly less bile for digestion than other dietary fats. MCTs are rapidly absorbed and converted into a group of acids called ketones, a by-product of fat metabolism, and a readily available energy source. MCT oil’s ketone-boosting properties promote ketosis, a metabolic state that burns fats instead of sugars as a primary fuel source. Maintaining ketosis is a crucial goal of the ketogenic diet, which explains why MCT oil is a popular choice for individuals on keto and those practicing intermittent fasting. ## **Five health benefits of MCT oil in coffee** MCTs have a shorter carbon

## 19 Keto BBQ Sides for Your Next Cookout Summer cookouts are a staple during the warmer months. Unfortunately, traditional BBQ menus often feature high-carb sides and sauces such as pasta salad, corn on the cob, and sugary baked beans. To help you stay on track with your low-carb lifestyle, here’s a list of 19 mouthwatering keto BBQ sides that won’t kick you out of ketosis. ## **Can you have a keto-friendly barbecue?** Yes, you can still enjoy all the classic BBQ dishes on a keto diet, such as burgers and grilled meats, by incorporating low-carb alternatives and creative twists. Instead of serving your burger in a traditional bun, use low-carb alternatives such as lettuce wraps or buns made with coconut flour. Research published in _Molecules_ found that compared to wheat flour, coconut flour has a significantly lower carbohydrate content while offering higher levels of protein, fat, and insoluble dietary fiber.1 _“Dietary fiber helps slow down digestion and keeps you feeling full for longer periods,”_ explains Dr. Berg. _“This helps prevent overeating and keeps you fuller for longer, which supports weight maintenance and metabolic health.”_ Instead of classic pasta salad, you can make delicious keto BBQ side dishes such as zucchini noodles or cauliflower “potato” salad. Sugary condiments such as ketchup and BBQ sauce can be replaced with sugar-free options or homemade versions using natural sweeteners, such as stevia or erythritol. ![Cauliflower mac and cheese](https://www.drberg.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/keto-cauliflower-mac-cheese-entire-recipe-21.jpg?w=800) ## **19 tasty keto BBQ sides** When planning a low-carb cookout, you don’t have to sacrifice flavor.

## The Truth About Keto Pills In today’s fast-paced world, many are seeking quick fixes to achieve weight loss, and keto pills have become a popular option. However, exogenous ketones can be costly and are often ineffective in producing lasting results. Discover the limitations of keto pills and explore effective strategies for promoting fat-burning without relying on costly supplements. ## **What are keto pills?** Keto pills are dietary supplements designed to elevate ketone concentrations in the bloodstream. These synthetic ketone bodies, also called [exogenous ketones](https://www.drberg.com/blog/are-exogenous-ketones-helpful-or-harmful), are often combined with other ingredients such as medium-chain triglycerides (MCTs), electrolytes, and caffeine. Ketones are molecules your body naturally produces during ketosis, a metabolic state where fat is burned for energy when glucose is limited. The three main types of ketones include: \* Acetoacetate \* Beta-hydroxybutyrate \* Acetone Exogenous ketones are typically available as ketone salts, which consist of ketones chemically bonded to minerals or ketone esters, created by attaching ketone bodies to alcohol molecules. Keto pills claim to mimic the effects of nutritional ketosis, allowing you to achieve this metabolic state without altering your diet or reducing carbohydrate intake. However, the effectiveness of these supplements is limited, as they don’t offer the same benefits as naturally induced ketosis achieved by following a low-carb, high-fat diet. Watch the video below to learn why keto diet pills aren’t effective for burning fat.## **Are keto pills beneficial?** If your goal is to lose weight, relying on keto pills alone is unlikely to provide the desired results. While keto pills can temporarily raise blood ketone levels, this effect is short-lived and doesn’t provide the full benefits of nutritional ketosis,

## Are Onions Keto? What You Need to Know Onions are popular root vegetables commonly used in soups, roasts, sandwiches, and salads. But are onions keto? Yes, onions are keto-friendly if you consume them in moderation and offer various nutrients that support overall health, making them an excellent addition to any keto meal plan. Discover onion nutrition facts and learn about the best onions to eat on a low-carb diet. ## **How many carbs are in onions?** According to the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), 100 grams of raw onion contains 9.3 grams of total carbohydrates and 1.7 grams of fiber.1 To calculate the net carb count of raw onions, subtract fiber from the total carb count. This leaves approximately 7.6 grams of net carbs per 100 grams of onion. However, some onion varieties have fewer carbs than others, which makes them more suitable for a ketogenic diet. ### **Onion nutrition facts** There are many types of onions, including white, yellow, and green onions. Other popular varieties include purple and red onions and Vidalia onions, a particularly sweet type of onion. Though they’re all rich sources of essential vitamins and minerals, the nutritional profile of different onion varieties can vary greatly. Here’s the nutritional value of different types of onions per 100 grams. White onion: \* 36 calories \* 0.89 g protein \* 0.13 g fat \* 7.7 g total carbs \* 1.2 g fiber \* 6.5 g net carbs Red onion: \* 44 calories \* 0.94 g protein \* 0.1 g fat \* 9.9 g total carbs \* 2.2 g fiber \* 7.7 g net carbs Yellow onion: \* 38 calories \* 0.83 g protein \* 0.05 g fat \* 8.6 g total carbs \* 1.9 g fiber \* 6.7 g net carbs Green onion: \* 32 calories \* 1.83 g protein \* 0.19 g fat \* 7.3 g total carbs \* 2.6 g fiber \* 4.7 g net carbs Sweet onion: \* 32 calories \* 0.8 g protein \* 0.08 g fat \* 7.5 g total carbs \* 0.9 g fiber \* 6.6 g net carbs Onions are also rich sources of nutrients, including: \* Vitamin B6 \* Vitamin C \* Folate \* Magnesium \* Potassium

## Pomegranate Keto: Can You Eat It on Keto? Is pomegranate keto? The answer is yes, but only the seeds, not the juice. Pomegranate seeds are keto-approved in limited amounts because they provide fiber, nutrients, and antioxidants with fewer net carbs. In contrast, pomegranate juice is high in natural sugars and lacks fiber, making it unsuitable for a Healthy Keto® lifestyle. ## **How many carbs are in a pomegranate?** Pomegranates are a sweet, tangy fruit packed with antioxidants, vitamins, and [fiber](https://www.drberg.com/blog/the-fiber-myth). However, the juice’s natural sugars raise its carbohydrate content, making it unsuitable for Healthy Keto. According to the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), 87 grams of a whole pomegranate contain about 12 grams of net carbs, while the same amount of unsweetened pomegranate juice has around 16 grams.1 Therefore, it’s best to avoid pomegranate juice to prevent raising your carb intake. Below are the nutritional profiles of whole pomegranate and juice per half-cup to help you better understand their nutritional value. Whole pomegranates: \* 72 calories \* 1.4 g protein \* 1 g fat \* 16 g total carbs \* 3.4 g fiber \* 12.6 net carbs Pomegranate juice: \* 67 calories \* .1 g protein \* .3 g fat \* 16.1 g total carbs \* .1 g fiber \* 16 net carbs Watch the video below to learn if pomegranates are permitted on a keto diet.## **Is pomegranate keto-friendly?** Yes, but only in its seed form and in small portions. _“Pomegranate seeds are low-carb since they contain fiber that helps slow digestion,”_ explains Dr. Berg. _“They also provide important nutrients, including vitamin C, which supports immune health and collagen production.”_ In contrast, pomegranate juice isn’t suitable for a keto diet due to its high sugar content and lack of fiber, which can spike insulin levels. !\[Heart symbol on

## Are Plantains Keto Friendly or Too High in Carbs? Green bananas and plantains are rich in resistant starch, an indigestible type of carbohydrate that supports gut health and blood sugar control, but are plantains keto-friendly? Plantains and bananas are high in carbs, and whether they’re keto-friendly depends on their ripeness and how they’re prepared. This can make it challenging to keep on track with your daily net carb count. Let’s look at the difference between green and yellow plantains and learn why plantains and bananas can quickly push you out of ketosis. ## **What is keto?** The ketogenic diet is a low-carb, high-fat diet that primes your metabolism to burn fat for fuel instead of sugar. As your liver breaks down fats, it generates ketone bodies–a by-product of fat metabolism and an efficient energy source. When ketones accumulate in your circulation and your cells start using them as the primary fuel source, you enter a state known as ketosis. Ketosis can achieve rapid weight loss and has several other health benefits, including improved blood sugar control, increased energy and [mental clarity](https://www.drberg.com/blog/brain-detox), and can help reduce the risk of type-2 diabetes and heart disease. To trigger and maintain ketosis, consume no more than 20 to 50 grams of net carbs per day and opt for healthy fats to get most of your daily calories. Watch the video below to learn why it’s best to avoid ripe plantains and bananas on a low-carb diet.Compared to yellow bananas, green plantains are considerably lower on the glycemic index (GI)–a scale of how quickly a food raises [blood sugar levels](https://www.drberg.com/blog/normal-blood-sugar-level) compared to glucose, which has a GI of 100. Foods with a high GI spike blood sugar and insulin levels quickly, which interferes with ketosis and pushes your body to run on sugar, which can lead to weight

## Keto Fruits to Avoid: Guide to Low-Sugar Choices The keto diet is a low-carb, low-sugar diet that triggers a metabolic state known as ketosis by focusing on healthy fats and moderate amounts of protein. Though fruits are rich in essential nutrients, antioxidants, and fiber, most contain too many carbohydrates and can quickly interfere with fat-burning, making them unsuitable for a ketogenic lifestyle. Discover six non-keto fruits to avoid and find out which ones you can enjoy in moderation when following a low-carb diet. ## **Can I have fruit on a keto diet?** The keto diet aims to put the body into the fat-burning state of ketosis, which can be achieved by reducing daily carb intake to less than 50 grams of net carbs. A [Healthy Keto®](https://www.drberg.com/blog/the-keto-diet-for-beginners) diet avoids sugars and limits carb intake while prioritizing the consumption of healthy fat, moderate protein, and plenty of non-starchy vegetables. Most fruits are high in fructose, a simple sugar classified as carbohydrate. This explains why you could quickly get [kicked out of ketosis](https://www.drberg.com/blog/7-surprising-things-that-can-kick-you-out-of-ketosis) if you eat fruit on a low-carb diet. Many fruits also have a high glycemic index (GI), which is a measure of how quickly a specific food raises blood glucose levels. This highlights fruits’ potential to trigger blood sugar and insulin spikes, which interfere with fat-burning and can contribute to weight gain and insulin resistance. Insulin resistance is a serious metabolic imbalance in which the body can’t effectively control blood sugar and is associated with various diseases, including non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NFLD), obesity, diabetes, and polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS). While keto dieters can enjoy low-carb fruits such as berries and tart citrus fruits, they should consume them in moderation to avoid exceeding their daily carb count limit.

## What Is Beef Tallow? A Natural Fat with Benefits Beef tallow is pure rendered beef fat that can be used for cooking, frying, and baking. It’s loaded with health-promoting fatty acids and fat-soluble vitamins–and it’s an excellent addition to your Healthy Keto® diet. Find out how beef tallow can help support a healthy body weight and discover how to incorporate this rendered fat into your routine. ## **Is beef tallow healthy?** Beef tallow and other traditional animal fats are rich sources of essential fat-soluble nutrients, including vitamins A, D, E, and K2. These nutrients play key roles in immune function, hormone production, and the health of your skin and hair. Animal fats also supply beneficial fats, including [omega-3 fatty acids](https://www.drberg.com/blog/basics-of-omega-3-fatty-acids) such as docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), essential for brain development, cognitive function, and overall neurological health. In addition, beef tallow offers high-quality saturated fat, which is a vital structural component in cell membranes and serves as a building block for many hormones. So why did beef tallow fall out of favor? In the late 1970s, U.S. dietary guidelines began emphasizing a reduction in saturated fat intake, based largely on poorly designed observational studies that linked it to heart disease. This led to the widespread replacement of saturated fats from animal sources like beef tallow and lard with industrial seed and vegetable oils, such as soybean, corn, and canola oil. However, these oils contain high concentrations of omega-6 fatty acids, which, when consumed in excess and in refined forms, can promote inflammation and oxidative stress. This oxidative damage has been associated with an increased risk for heart disease and other chronic health issues. Research published in _Current Opinions in Endocrinology, Diabetes, and Obesity_ found no consistent link between the intake of saturated fat or animal fat and an increased risk of coronary heart disease,

## Sardines Keto Superfood: Why You Should Eat More Sardines are nutritious and a perfect addition to a ketogenic low-carb diet. They contain no carbs and are packed with anti-inflammatory omega-3 fats, vitamins, and minerals. Here’s why sardines are an excellent choice for your health and how you can incorporate this fish into your keto lifestyle. ## **What are sardines?** Sardines are a type of herring closely related to other oily, small schooling fish such as anchovies. Canned sardines are sometimes called pilchards, and there is some debate about whether sardines and pilchards are different species of fish. In fact, they’re the same. The younger, smaller fish are known as sardines, and the older and slightly larger ones are called pilchards. Sardines rank amongst the most consumed fish species alongside [tuna](https://www.drberg.com/blog/mercury-in-tuna-what-type-is-good-and-bad), salmon, and cod. They’re a staple of the heart-healthy Mediterranean diet and have a rich, oily flavor. While sardines are typically canned in oil or water, fresh sardines also taste delicious. They can be grilled, smoked, or pickled. Watch the video below to learn more about the health benefits of eating sardines.## **Are sardines Healthy Keto®-approved?** Sardines are an excellent source of nutrients, including [omega-3 fatty acids](https://www.drberg.com/blog/the-best-source-of-omega-3-fatty-acids), vitamin D, magnesium, and calcium.

## Does Lemon Water Break a Fast or Ketosis? Will drinking lemon water ruin your keto diet? I address your worries in this article. **RELATED:** [**Use Ginger Lemon Water to do Intermittent Fasting Longer**](https://www.drberg.com/blog/use-ginger-lemon-water-to-do-intermittent-fasting-longer) In this article: 1. The Importance of Drinking Water While on a Keto Diet 2. Is Lemon Water Good for You? 3. Can Lemon Water Detox Help with Ketosis? 4. How Should You Consume Lemon Water? 5. How to Make Lemon Water a Part of Your Weight Loss Drink ## **Drinking Lemon Water on Keto Diet** ### **The Importance of Drinking Water While on a Keto Diet** Staying hydrated is crucial, regardless of the type of diet you follow. But, when you’re on a low-carb diet, such as keto, hydration is more essential because carbs hold sodium and water in your body. When your body limits carb intake, sodium and water are excreted, which also means you hold less water. This is the reason why drinking plenty of water and staying hydrated when on keto is a priority compared to other diet types. You may also experience sugar cravings and hunger pangs when on keto, and this is usually because your body lacks water. You can drink water instead to compensate for the cravings and consume lemon water from time to time. Water also aids in burning excess fat faster because when your body breaks down fats, it requires water molecules. ### **Is Lemon Water Good for You?** ![Young smiling women clinking with glasses of water with lemon | Will Lemon Water Kick You Out of Ketosis](https://www.drberg.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/blog-will-lemon-water-kick-you-out-of-ketosis-1.jpg?w=800) Healthwise, there are several benefits of lemon water you can take advantage of, such as it: \* **Cleanses Your Body of Toxins** Consuming lemon water on an empty stomach cleanses your body of toxins.

## Is Coconut Milk Keto-Friendly? | Dr. Berg Is coconut milk keto-friendly? Yes, coconut milk can be a delicious part of a Healthy Keto® lifestyle–if you choose the right kind. While some coconut milk is loaded with added sugars, full-fat unsweetened coconut milk is low in carbs and provides healthy fats that support fat burning and help you stay in ketosis. Explore the different varieties of coconut milk, uncover its potential health benefits, and learn how to choose the most nutritious option to support Healthy Keto. ## **What is keto?** The [ketogenic diet](https://www.drberg.com/blog/ketogenic-diet-side-effects) is a low-carb, high-fat eating plan that aims to shift your metabolism from burning sugar as a primary fuel source to utilizing fat for energy. By keeping net carbs low, typically between 20 and 50 grams per day, the body enters a metabolic state called ketosis. During ketosis, the liver converts fat into ketones, which serve as an alternative fuel source, offering a sustained source for both the body and brain. This metabolic shift supports insulin sensitivity and allows your body to tap into stored body fat for fuel. To maintain ketosis, it’s crucial to avoid high-carb foods, especially [sugars](https://www.drberg.com/blog/probiotics-for-sugar-cravings) and refined grains, as these foods raise blood sugar and insulin levels, which blocks fat burning and stimulates fat storage. _“You never want to do high-fat with high-carb. When you combine fat with sugar, you spike insulin and store fat. You want to burn fat, not store it–that’s what makes keto so effective,”_ explains Dr Berg. ## **What is coconut milk?** Coconut milk is a milky-white liquid made by blending the grated meat of mature coconuts with water. Unlike coconut water, which is the clear liquid found naturally inside young green coconuts, coconut milk is creamy and rich in texture. It’s naturally low in sugar and a rich source of healthy fats.

## Polydextrose Keto Explained: Benefits & Drawbacks As the ketogenic diet grows in popularity, the food industry has responded with a wave of keto-friendly products designed to support low-carb, high-fat lifestyles. To meet these demands, many manufacturers rely on synthetic low-carb additives such as polydextrose as bulking agents. However, this ingredient isn’t truly aligned with a health-focused keto plan. Discover why polydextrose isn’t as keto-friendly as it seems and learn which other hidden ingredients in low-carb products are worth avoiding. ## **What is polydextrose?** Polydextrose is a synthetic carbohydrate, not a naturally occurring compound, and its inclusion in ketogenic products should raise concerns. This artificial carbohydrate is produced in food manufacturing facilities by chemically synthesizing glucose, sorbitol, and citric acid, typically sourced from genetically modified (GMO) corn. This is a red flag when it comes to its use in keto-friendly products. Its primary applications include replacing sugar, fat, and starch, improving texture, stabilizing formulations, retaining moisture, and facilitating melting and flavor release. Polydextrose is often favored in keto-labeled products due to its low digestible carbohydrate content, which helps minimize the net carbs of a food. However, its synthetic origin and highly processed nature are inconsistent with the principles of a nutrient-dense, whole-food-based ketogenic approach such as [Healthy Keto®](https://www.drberg.com/blog/healthy-keto-plan-start-here). Polydextrose can be found in a wide range of food products, such as: \* Sugar-free and low-carb baked goods \* Protein bars and meal replacement shakes \* Reduced-calorie ice creams and frozen dairy desserts \* Low-sugar candies and chocolates \* Fiber-enriched beverages \* Breakfast cereals and granola \* Salad dressings and sauces \* Flavored yogurts and puddings \* Infant formulas Due to its chemical composition, polydextrose cannot be digested in the

## Can You Drink Wine on Keto? Alcohol and Ketosis Can you drink wine on keto? In short, no. But the full answer isn’t as simple as you may have hoped. Dry wine contains fewer carbs than sweet varieties, but that doesn’t mean it won’t interfere with ketosis. Whenever you consume alcoholic drinks, your liver prioritizes alcohol detoxification over other metabolic processes, including fat-burning. Learn why drinking even low-carb alcoholic beverages can slow down keto success and why it’s best to avoid alcohol altogether. ## **Can you drink wine on keto?** Overall, it’s best to avoid wine on keto. Whether you can [drink wine on a ketogenic diet](https://www.drberg.com/blog/can-i-drink-alcohol-on-ketogenic-diet) doesn’t just depend on its carb content. All alcoholic beverages, including wine, contain ethanol produced by fermenting high-carb grains, sugar cane, or grape sugar. Not all carbohydrates are broken down during fermentation, leaving residual carbs in the final product. Wines with a high residual sugar content, also called sweet wines, contain as much as 25 grams of carbs per 5-ounce serving (150 milliliters) and can quickly push you out of ketosis. In contrast, dry wine contains significantly fewer carbs, typically around four grams per serving. _“It may seem that drinking low-carb wine on a ketogenic diet won’t interfere with ketosis as long as you monitor your net carb intake. However, this isn’t accurate,”_ says Dr. Berg. Ethanol is a volatile organic compound that your body perceives as a toxin. Whenever ethanol enters your circulation, the liver prioritizes [alcohol detoxification](https://www.drberg.com/blog/natural-liver-cleanse-for-fatty-liver) over most other metabolic processes, which interrupts fat-burning and ketone production. Research published in _The Journal of Hepatology_ found that drinking alcohol deactivates liver enzymes needed for the breakdown of fats, meaning that your liver can’t produce ketones as long as ethanol is

The ketogenic diet is a low-carb, moderate protein, and high-fat diet plan where you limit your net carbs. It works to shift your body from using sugar and a fuel source and instead burn fat. When the body burns fat, it releases ketones, which provide an alternative fuel source for your body and helps you shed pounds. While there are many different meal plans and keto diet food lists out on the Internet today, my [ketosis approved food list](https://www.drberg.com/blog/ketogenic-diet-food-list) is slightly different.

## Diabetic Ketoacidosis: Signs and What to Do Diabetic ketoacidosis is a potentially life-threatening condition that primarily affects individuals with type 1 diabetes and is typically caused by missed or incorrect insulin therapy. Discover common diabetic ketoacidosis symptoms and learn how to manage and prevent this serious medical issue. Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) is characterized by excessive concentrations of blood ketones, a group of acids that can change the body’s pH, leading to a state of metabolic acidosis. While individuals with type 2 diabetes can develop DKA, it typically affects those with type 1 diabetes who have to rely on insulin therapy to manage blood sugar levels. Administering not enough insulin or a faulty insulin pump can quickly lead to very high blood sugar levels as the body requires adequate amounts of this hormone to utilize glucose as a fuel source. This triggers the rapid breakdown of fat to provide an alternative energy source, resulting in the production of large quantities of ketones. Because of their acidity, too many ketones can lower the blood’s pH levels. This can cause electrolyte imbalances, cardiovascular and respiratory issues, impaired central nervous system function, and bone demineralization. Watch the video below to learn how to manage and prevent ketoacidosis.## **Signs and symptoms of ketoacidosis** Ketoacidosis can develop within hours, especially in individuals who are experiencing significant insulin deficiency. Here are common early warning signs of ketoacidosis: \* Excessive thirst \* Frequent urination \* Nausea and vomiting \* Abdominal pain \* Fatigue \* Breath with a fruity odor \* Brain fog \* Poor blood pressure regulation \* Difficulty breathing In addition, severe electrolyte imbalances are a serious complication of ketoacidosis and can trigger symptoms such as muscle weakness, irregular heartbeat, and a weak

## Stevia vs Sucralose: A Sweetener Showdown Stevia vs. sucralose–are they keto-friendly, and which one is healthier? Both stevia and sucralose are calorie-free sweeteners used in a wide range of low-calorie or sugar-free products. Learn why it’s best to avoid sucralose and discover some of the best keto-approved natural sweeteners. ## **What is stevia?** Stevia is a natural sweetener derived from the leaves of the _Stevia rebaudiana_ plant. It’s 200 times sweeter than table sugar but contains virtually no calories and zero carbs. Because of stevia’s intense sweet taste, it’s a popular sugar alternative for individuals following a low-carb diet and those with diabetes or insulin resistance. However, it’s important to avoid commercial stevia products that contain maltodextrin as a bulking agent and instead opt for pure stevia extracts. [Maltodextrin is one of the worst food ingredients](https://www.drberg.com/blog/the-1-worst-ingredient-in-the-world-hiding-in-your-foods) as it causes blood sugar spikes and weight gain, making it an unsuitable option for keto dieters and those with diabetes. Watch the video below to discover the worst artificial sweeteners for weight loss.## **What is sucralose?** Sucralose is classified as an artificial sweetener. It’s a main component in Splenda, a widely used sugar substitute. Sucralose is manufactured by chemically replacing three chlorine atoms for three hydroxyl groups on a sugar molecule. This process creates a zero-calorie sweetener that is more than 600 times sweeter than regular sugar. ![Stevia in a wooden bowl](https://www.drberg.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/stevia-sugar-fresh-leaves-isolated-on.jpg?resize=1024,683) Although both sucralose and stevia contain zero calories or carbs, they have distinct differences in terms of nutrition, taste, potential health risk, and suitability for keto.

## Is Honey Keto-Friendly? | Dr. Berg Honey is a popular sweetener widely used in baking, marinades, glazes, and dressings. But is honey keto-friendly? No, honey isn’t keto-approved due to its high concentrations of natural sugars that raise blood glucose and insulin levels and can quickly kick you out of ketosis. Discover the pros and cons of using honey on a ketogenic diet and learn about the best low-carb sugar substitutes. ## **Is honey keto-friendly?** Though honey is a common kitchen staple used to sweeten beverages or drizzle on pastries and breakfast foods, it isn’t keto-friendly. A single serving, or one tablespoon, of honey contains around 20 grams of carbohydrates. Considering that most individuals following a [Healthy Keto®](https://www.drberg.com/blog/the-keto-diet-for-beginners) diet limit carb intake to no more than 20 to 50 grams of net carbs daily, honey can quickly use up or exceed this limit, making it unsuitable for a low-carb diet. In addition to avoiding natural honey, keto dieters are also discouraged from consuming high fructose corn syrup and table sugar, which can significantly spike blood sugar levels and disrupt ketosis. ### **Honey nutrition facts** The nutritional value of honey can vary based on its source. For instance, raw honey generally contains more nutrients and natural sugars compared to processed honey. However, despite these differences, most honey products are high in carbohydrates, which makes them incompatible with a keto diet. According to data from the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), one tablespoon of natural honey contains:1 \* 64 calories \* 0 g total fat \* 0 g protein \* 17 g total sugars \* 17 g total carbs \* 0 g fiber \* 17 g net carbs While high in carbohydrates, raw honey is a rich source of beneficial vitamins, minerals, and phytonutrients that may support strong immune defenses and overall health. Honey is a good source of various nutrients, including: \* Vitamin C \* B

## Sucralose Keto: Splenda's Role in Diet Sucralose is one of the most commonly used sugar alternatives often added to diet beverages, baked goods, dairy products, snacks, and candies. This artificial sweetener has zero carbs, so is sucralose keto-friendly? No, sucralose isn’t keto-friendly. Despite being classified as a low-carb sweetener, sucralose can increase blood sugar levels and has been linked to gut microbiome disruption. Find out why you should avoid sucralose on keto and discover the best low-carb sweeteners that help maintain lower blood sugar levels and won’t interfere with ketosis. ## **What is sucralose?** Sucralose is a sweetener artificially produced by chlorinating sucrose, which is widely known as table sugar. In this process, three sucrose molecules are removed and replaced with chlorine, making sucralose 600 times sweeter than regular sugar. To balance its intense sweetness and add volume, pure sucralose is often mixed with ultra-processed filler ingredients such as modified food starch. Sucralose is available in liquid and powdered form and contains zero calories. It’s often confused with sugar alcohols, though it’s chemically distinct from them. Sugar alcohols, such as xylitol or erythritol, are a separate category of sweeteners that typically contain fewer calories than sugar but aren’t the same as sucralose. ### **Common products that contain sucralose** Splenda, a popular sugar substitute brand, is among the most used artificial sweeteners containing sucralose. Sucralose can also be found in a wide range of products labeled “no sugar,” “zero sugar,” “reduced sugar,” or “sugar-free.” Here are some common foods and beverages sweetened with sucralose: \* Diet sodas and soft drinks \* Flavored water and flavor enhancers \* Milk and dairy products \* Coffee beverages and creamers \* Ice cream and frozen desserts \* Chocolate syrup \* Chocolate \* Hard and chewy candies \* Jello and pudding \* Baked goods such as cupcakes and muffins \* \[Chewing

## Coconut Flour vs Almond Flour: Which Is Better? Coconut flour vs. almond flour–which one is better? Both coconut flour and almond flour are low-carb, grain-free alternatives to wheat flour. But is one of these flours more keto-friendly than the other? The answer may surprise you. Let’s look at why almond flour is an ideal keto-friendly flour and how you can incorporate it successfully into your keto recipes. ## **What is coconut flour?** Coconut flour is dried coconut meat ground into a fine powder. Coconut pulp, a byproduct of coconut milk production, is dehydrated and milled into coconut flour. It’s low-carb, naturally gluten-free, mild in flavor, and a good substitute for conventional wheat flour. Coconut flour absorbs a lot of moisture, and you want to add plenty of eggs and liquids to your recipes. It produces slightly thicker batter than other flours and is great for [pancakes](https://www.drberg.com/blog/cauliflower-potato-free-pancakes), [muffins](https://www.drberg.com/blog/cranberry-pecan-muffins), [waffles](https://www.drberg.com/blog/amazing-low-carb-waffles), and cakes. Coconuts are technically tree nuts but are generally well tolerated, even by people sensitive to tree nuts. However, some people with tree nut allergies can react, so it’s best that you check with your doctor whether coconut flour is safe if you are allergic to coconuts or other tree nuts. Watch the video below to learn more about coconut flour vs. almond flour.## **What is almond flour?** Almond flour is made by grinding blanched almonds into fine flour. Blanching the almonds with boiling water removes the outer skin, resulting in a fine powder with a fluffy texture. Almond flour is low-carb and gluten-free, making it an ideal substitute for wheat flour for keto baking and [dessert recipes](https://www.drberg.com/keto-recipes-categories/desserts). Almond flour is white with a light

## Is Coconut Water Keto-Friendly? Benefits of Coconut Water Coconut water is a rich source of natural electrolytes, which promote hydration and support healthy blood pressure and kidney function. But is coconut water keto-friendly? While small amounts of unsweetened coconut water won’t kick you out of ketosis, many sugar-sweetened coconut water beverages are high in carbs and not keto-approved. Let’s look at the health benefits of coconut water and find out how to choose a low-carb coconut water that’s safe on the ketogenic diet. ## **What is coconut water?** Coconut water is the clear fluid found inside young coconuts. It’s a rich source of nutrients and serves as nourishment for green coconuts as they mature. This explains why an average green coconut contains significantly more coconut water than ripe coconuts, which have developed a hard and woody outer husk. Pure coconut water has a refreshing taste with a slightly sweet and nutty flavor and is often consumed as a hydrating beverage in tropical regions. Coconut water is also an excellent liquid base for smoothies and shakes, can be incorporated into various sweet and savory dishes, and works well in sauces and marinades. Because of its pleasant taste, high nutrient content, and potential health benefits, coconut water has become a trendy beverage that’s widely available in supermarkets and grocery stores. It’s important not to confuse coconut water with [coconut milk](https://www.drberg.com/blog/is-coconut-milk-or-water-keto-friendly). While coconut water is a clear fluid low in fat, coconut milk is a creamy, high-fat liquid extracted from coconut meat. Watch the video below to find out if coconut milk is keto-friendly.## **Is coconut water keto-friendly?** According to the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), one cup of plain coconut water contains six grams of net carbs, which won’t significantly impact

## Sweat Smells Like Ammonia Ketosis Have you recently started keto and noticed stinky sweat with a strong ammonia smell? While changes in body odor are a common side effect during the early stages of keto-adaptation, ammonia-like sweat can indicate electrolyte imbalances or excessive protein intake. Discover why your sweat smells like ammonia while in ketosis and what steps you can take to get rid of bad body odor fast. ## **What is ketosis?** Ketosis is a metabolic state in which your body relies on fat for energy instead of carbohydrates. As your liver breaks down fat, it generates large quantities of ketones, which act as a highly efficient energy source. When ketones start to fuel your cells, your body enters ketosis. To trigger and maintain ketosis, it’s crucial to limit your carb intake to 20 to 50 grams daily and obtain the majority of calories from healthy fats. A low-carb, high-fat ketogenic diet helps maintain a healthy weight and has profound benefits for metabolic, cardiovascular, and [cognitive health](https://www.drberg.com/blog/brain-detox). Watch the video below to discover common causes of ammonia body odor on keto.## **Five reasons your sweat smells like ammonia while in ketosis** Temporary changes in body odor, such as keto breath and even keto crotch, are common side effects of keto-adaptation. However, persistently smelling an ammonia odor in your sweat while in ketosis can indicate electrolyte imbalances or excessive protein intake, or may be linked to an underlying health condition. Ammonia is a metabolic by-product of amino acid and protein breakdown that can have toxic effects on the brain and other organs. The liver converts ammonia into urea, which is less harmful and can safely be excreted by the kidneys. In some situations, ammonia can build up in the bloodstream, and small amounts are released through sweat glands, leading to sweat

Even if you’ve been following the keto diet for a while, it can be difficult to remember which foods to include in a Healthy Keto(TM) diet. So, think of this as your refresher on summer refreshments. ## **What is the ketogenic diet?** The [ketogenic diet](https://www.drberg.com/blog/the-keto-diet-for-beginners) is popular for weight loss and includes food choices high in healthy fats, moderate in protein, and low in carbohydrates. The goal of the ketogenic diet is to use healthy fats as the body’s energy source. By depleting the body’s sugar reserves, the diet puts the body in a state of ketosis. Ketones are produced by the liver when your body burns stored dietary fat for energy instead of carbs. Ketones are an efficient fuel for the body. Foods high in carbs–including pasta, white flour, table sugar, grains, and processed foods and drinks–are off-limits on keto. These are replaced with high-fat, low-carb foods, including: \* Meat (chicken, beef, and pork) \* Fatty fish (salmon, shrimp, mackerel, tuna, and oysters) \* Avocados \* Healthy oil (coconut oil, [MCT oil](https://www.drberg.com/blog/will-mct-oil-break-a-fast), avocado oil, and olive oil) \* Butter \* High fiber, low-carb vegetables (green leafy vegetables, zucchini, lettuce, and cucumbers) Most fruit is either limited or eliminated on a low-carb diet, depending on the type.## **Watermelon nutrition facts** Watermelon is not only great tasting, but it’s also rich in nutrients, including: \* 26 mg vitamin A \* 12 mg vitamin C \* 170 mg potassium \* 0.1 mg vitamin B6 These essential vitamins and minerals provide some pretty amazing health benefits.

## Veggie and Hummus Sandwich – Keto, Vegan, and Gluten-Free ![vegan hummus sandwich](https://drberg-dam.imgix.net/others/recipes-vegan-hummus-sandwich-106-7.jpg?w=920\&auto=compress,format) Are you looking for a healthy, plant-based sandwich option that fits a low-carb ketogenic diet? This Veggie and Hummus Sandwich is made with homemade keto-friendly bread and a flavorful blend of fresh vegetables and creamy hummus. It’s perfect for those on keto, offering a satisfying, wholesome meal without the added carbs. ## **Why you’ll love this keto-friendly recipe** Plant-based keto diets might seem unconventional, but this Veggie and Hummus Sandwich recipe perfectly bridges the gap between vibrant plant-based ingredients and low-carb needs. For a low-carb and gluten-free alternative, simply replace traditional wheat or whole-grain bread with keto-approved homemade bread. This swap ensures you stay aligned with your dietary goals while still enjoying a delicious, hearty sandwich. The addition of tempeh, a traditional Indonesian fermented soy product, offers plenty of plant-based protein and various health benefits. [Research](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2666833524000364) published in _Future Foods_ found that regularly consuming tempeh may improve cognitive function, balance cholesterol levels, and provide potential antidiabetic, anticancer, and anti-aging effects. The study further suggests that tempeh is considered a health-promoting prebiotic and probiotic food due to its high concentrations of beneficial microorganisms. This recipe calls for frying tempeh in avocado oil, which is a rich source of monounsaturated fatty acids linked to a lower risk of heart disease. In addition, hummus, a spread made from mashed chickpeas, provides additional protein and dietary fiber, which plays a crucial role in digestive health and supports steady insulin levels. Fiber, classified as a carbohydrate, isn’t digested and absorbed and can be deducted from a food’s

## Are Pork Rinds Healthy? What You Should Know Are pork rinds healthy? While often dismissed as junk food, pork rinds can actually be a valuable addition to a Healthy Keto® diet–if you choose the right kind. These crispy, deep-fried pieces of pig skin are completely carb-free, rich in heart-healthy fats, and an excellent source of collagen. When made without artificial ingredients or processed oils, pork rinds are not only keto-approved but surprisingly nutrient-dense. Discover three key reasons why you should eat pork rinds on keto and how to use them in Healthy Keto low-carb recipes. ## **Are pork rinds good for you?** Pork rinds, or pork scratchings, are made from rendered pig skin that has been boiled, dehydrated, and deep-fried, resulting in a puffed and crispy texture. Because pork rinds are carb-free and have an excellent fat-to-protein ratio, pork rinds are perfect for keto diets and work well in many [low-carb recipes](https://www.drberg.com/blog/11-low-carb-breakfast-recipes-for-every-occasion). Although pork rinds don’t have significant amounts of beneficial vitamins, they are a rich source of heart-healthy monounsaturated fats, saturated fat, collagen, and selenium. Eating pork rinds is healthier than snacking on potato chips and other processed snack foods high in carbs, trans fats, and artificial ingredients. However, most pork rind products are ultra-processed and high in sodium or monosodium glutamate (MSG), a food additive commonly used in fast food and junk foods to enhance flavor. MSG intake is linked to health problems, including migraines, [high blood pressure](https://www.drberg.com/blog/the-end-of-hypertension-high-blood-pressure), headaches, and chronic fatigue. To enjoy pork rinds as part of a healthy and nutritious diet, choose organic products that are minimally processed, MSG-free, low in sodium, and contain no artificial flavoring or preservatives.

## Fruit on Keto: Stay in Ketosis with These Picks Many people start a [keto diet to lose weight](https://www.drberg.com/blog/keto-weight-loss-timeline) and improve their health. This way of eating focuses on high fat and very low carbs, requiring careful food choices. While most people on keto know to limit bread and pasta, they’re unsure about fruit. Can you have fruit on a keto diet? Let’s explore the relationship between fruit and the keto diet. The keto diet aims to switch your body into a [state of ketosis](https://www.drberg.com/blog/can-you-be-in-ketosis-with-no-ketones-in-the-urine). During ketosis, your body begins burning fat for fuel instead of glucose from carbohydrates. Maintaining a low carb diet is essential to achieving and sustaining ketosis. This is where the confusion around fruit on keto comes into play. ## **Understanding Sugar in Fruit On Keto Diet** Most fruits are naturally sweet due to natural sugars: [fructose](https://www.drberg.com/blog/fructose-the-most-dangerous-sugar-for-your-belly), glucose, and sucrose. While these are natural sugars, they still impact blood sugar levels. Keeping your carb intake low is essential to maintaining ketosis on a keto diet. Since fruits contain carbs in these sugars, they can disrupt ketosis if you consume them in excess. The total carbs in fruit can vary. So, are all fruits created equal when following a keto diet? ### **Are All Fruits Created Equal on Keto?** While fruit is generally healthy, its sugar content makes it tricky on a keto diet. However, not all fruit is off-limits. Some low-sugar fruits can be incorporated into your [keto meal plan](https://www.drberg.com/blog/ketogenic-diet-plan-food-list-cheat-sheet-pdf) in moderation, like a keto-friendly snack. Remember, moderation is key. It’s essential to watch your portion sizes carefully to avoid consuming too many carbs and exceeding your daily carb limit. !\[Blood sugar

## Can You Eat Cheese on Keto? Best Types Listed Keto is a high-fat, moderate protein, and low-carb diet, so can you eat cheese on keto? Yes, you can have cheese on the keto diet. Cheese is an excellent source of fat and protein, and many varieties contain minimal carbs. However, not all cheeses are suitable for the ketogenic diet. Learn how to choose high-quality cheese and discover the best types to have on keto. ## **Can you eat cheese on keto?** Yes, full-fat cheese can be enjoyed on a ketogenic diet since it’s high in fat and protein and low in carbs. However, low-fat cheese varieties or processed cheeses can be high in lactose and other ingredients that aren’t keto-friendly. Most traditional full-fat cheeses contain less than one gram of carbohydrates per one-ounce (28-gram) serving, making cheese an ideal option for those following a low-carb diet. Watch the video below to learn about the best cheese to have on keto.## **Conventional vs. grass-fed, organic cheese** When choosing a keto-friendly cheese, it’s vital to consider the sources and production process to avoid ingredients that could kick you out of ketosis or may cause health issues. Here’s a comparison of conventional and grass-fed, organic cheese. ### **Conventional cheese** Conventional cheese is made using milk from cows that are often treated with bovine growth hormone (BGH) or bovine somatotropin (BST). These artificial hormones are designed to stimulate muscle growth and boost milk production. Though approved by the Federal Drug Administration (FDA), BGH and BST are banned in many countries due to potential health concerns such as infertility, lameness, and mastitis in dairy cattle. Additionally, conventional dairy cows are typically fed genetically modified (GMO) grains high in pro-inflammatory omega-6 fatty acids, such as soybeans and corn. This changes the nutritional profile of the milk and

## Can You Eat Oatmeal on Keto? Truth Revealed No, oatmeal isn’t keto-approved. It’s made from grains and has a naturally high carb content, making it unsuitable for a keto diet. Let’s find out why eating oatmeal can quickly kick you out of ketosis and which low-carb oatmeal alternatives you can enjoy on a ketogenic diet. ## **What is keto?** The ketogenic diet is an extensively studied low-carb, high-fat diet with profound metabolic benefits. Limiting carbohydrate intake to no more than 50 grams daily and opting for healthy fats to get most of your daily calories pushes your metabolism to burn fat instead of sugars as a primary fuel source. As the liver breaks down fats, it generates large quantities of ketones, a group of natural acids that serve as a very efficient energy source. When [ketones](https://www.drberg.com/blog/doing-keto-but-no-ketones-in-urine-heres-why) accumulate in the bloodstream and start to fuel your cells, your body enters a metabolic state called ketosis. Ketosis offers various health benefits, such as rapid weight loss, improved blood sugar regulation, increased energy levels, and enhanced mental clarity. Research published in _Targeted Therapy_ found that the ketogenic diet is also associated with a lower risk of heart disease and type-2 diabetes and may have benefits in the management of depression, anxiety disorders, and age-related cognitive decline.1 Watch the video below to discover why it’s best to avoid oatmeal on a low-carb meal plan.## **Is oatmeal keto-friendly?** Oatmeal is a popular breakfast staple but isn’t considered keto-friendly due to its relatively high carbohydrate content. _“Oats are a type of grain and naturally rich in carbohydrates,’_ explains Dr. Berg. \_“Eating oatmeal can quickly raise your blood sugar levels and trigger the release of insulin, a key metabolic hormone that

## Can You Chew Gum on Keto? Truth Revealed Can you chew gum on keto? Yes, as long as you choose sugar-free varieties made with xylitol, spearmint oil, or natural menthol. Learn how to select the right keto gum to keep your breath smelling fresh while maintaining ketosis and fat-burning. Yes, you can chew gum on a keto diet–just be mindful of the ingredients. [To stay in ketosis](https://www.drberg.com/blog/7-surprising-things-that-can-kick-you-out-of-ketosis), opt for gums sweetened with natural, low-glycemic alternatives such as xylitol or stevia instead of sugar or high-glycemic sugar alcohols. These keto-friendly sweeteners are less likely to disrupt blood sugar or insulin levels, letting you enjoy gum without disrupting fat-burning. Plus, chewing gum can help manage cravings and reduce feelings of hunger, making it a useful tool for staying on track with your goals. Chewing gum can also be helpful for those practicing [intermittent fasting (IF)](https://www.drberg.com/blog/intermittent-fasting) or following a [one-meal-a-day (OMAD)](https://www.drberg.com/blog/23-benefits-of-one-meal-a-day) approach, where managing appetite between fasting periods is key. Regular gum consumption also promotes jaw muscle activity, which helps maintain muscle tone and supports optimal oral functions. According to a statement released by the American Dental Association (ADA), _“Chewing sugar-free gum has been shown to increase the flow of saliva, thereby reducing plaque acid, strengthening the teeth and reducing tooth decay.”_&#x31; It may also assist in reducing mindless snacking by keeping the mouth engaged without adding calories or carbs, making it a great addition for those following keto to achieve weight loss.

## Keto Gas: Why It Happens and How to Fix It In the ever-evolving landscape of nutrition, the ketogenic diet has emerged as a revolutionary approach to better health. People are embracing it not just to lose weight but to achieve better blood sugar control, improved brain function, and overall well-being. However, your body has to adapt to a high-fat diet, which can lead to temporary discomforts, including gas and bloating. Let’s explore the common causes of keto gas and discover effective remedies to help alleviate digestive issues associated with starting a low-carb diet. ![Women with digestive issues](https://www.drberg.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/stomachache-flatulence-fullness-concept-scared-shocked.jpg?w=800) ## **What is keto?** Keto, short for [the ketogenic diet](https://www.drberg.com/blog/ketogenic-diet-plan-ketone), is a way of eating that initiates a metabolic state called ketosis. During ketosis, the body burns fat to generate energy instead of relying on carbohydrates and sugars. When the body breaks down fat as a primary fuel source, large amounts of ketones are released. These organic acids act as a highly efficient energy source for the brain and body. In fact, ketones provide more energy per molecule than glucose, which helps reduce metabolic waste products and enhances energy-making efficiency. To achieve and maintain ketosis, it’s crucial to avoid sugars, limit carbohydrates, and obtain the majority of calories from healthy fat. Most keto dieters typically consume 65 to 70 percent of their daily calories from fats, 20 to 25 percent from protein, and 5 to 10 percent from carbohydrates. As the body adapts to the metabolic changes induced by ketosis, some people may experience temporary side effects, also referred to as keto flu, including fatigue, headache, [brain fog](https://www.drberg.com/blog/brain-fog-tip), and irritability. In addition, it’s not uncommon to develop transient digestive issues such as bloating, constipation, or gas.

## Is Yogurt Keto? Guide to Choosing Right Yogurt is a popular dairy product rich in essential nutrients, but is yogurt keto-friendly? Yes, yogurt can be keto-friendly, but that depends on the exact yogurt type and any potential ingredients that may have been added. Find out how many carbs are in yogurt and explore which types fit best into a keto-friendly lifestyle. ## **How many carbs are in yogurt?** The carbohydrate content of different types of yogurts varies significantly and depends on the fat content of the milk used, if the yogurt is flavored or sweetened, or if it has any other carb-containing ingredients. Plain yogurt crafted from whole milk carries approximately 11 grams of carbohydrates per 8-ounce (225-gram) serving. Greek yogurt tends to have a lower carb count as it has been strained, which removes some of the milk sugar, also known as lactose. Plain Greek yogurt typically contains around 9 grams of carbs per 8-ounce serving. In contrast, flavored yogurts are often high in sugars and can have as much as 30 grams of net carbs per 8-ounce serving. ### **Yogurt nutrition facts** The exact nutritional value of yogurt can vary depending on the type of milk used, the processing techniques employed, and any potential ingredients that have been added. According to data published by the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), a 3.5-ounce (100-gram) serving of plain Greek yogurt made from whole milk contains:1 \* 97 calories \* 5 g total fat \* 9 g protein \* 3.5 g total carbs \* 0 g fiber \* 3.5 g net carbs Unsweetened plain yogurt is generally considered a nutritious food as it’s a rich source of protein and contains various essential vitamins and minerals.

## Does MCT Oil Break A Fast? Clear Answer Inside Many people use medium-chain triglyceride (MCT) oil to support fat burning and energy levels, but does MCT oil break a fast? Technically, yes–but only slightly. While MCTs may temporarily shift fat burning from stored body fat to dietary fat, they also provide a ketone boost that can help extend fasting periods and support keto adaptation. Find out why MCT oil can be beneficial while fasting and learn how to integrate these health-promoting fatty acids into your Healthy Keto® and intermittent fasting plan. ## **What are MCTs?** MCTs are medium-length chains of fatty acids found in foods such as palm oil, coconut oil, dairy products, nuts, and seeds. There are four primary types of MCTs: \* Caproic acid (C6) \* Caprylic acid (C8) \* Capric acid (C10) \* Lauric acid (C12) Each type differs slightly in how quickly it’s metabolized, with C8 and C10 being the most efficient. Unlike long-chain fats, MCTs have a shorter carbon structure. This allows them to bypass the typical digestive process requiring bile and enzymes for breakdown. Instead, they’re directly absorbed into the bloodstream and quickly converted into ketones by the liver. [Ketones](https://www.drberg.com/blog/are-high-ketones-during-fasting-dangerous) are energy-efficient molecules synthesized during the breakdown of fat. Compared to glucose, they provide a cleaner and steadier fuel source that doesn’t cause insulin spikes and generates fewer free radicals, making them ideal for sustained mental and physical energy. This explains why MCT oil is a popular tool among those practicing intermittent fasting or following a low-carb diet. Watch the video below to learn if MCT oil will break a fast.## **What is MCT oil?** [MCT oil](https://www.drberg.com/blog/how-to-use-mct-oil) is a concentrated source of MCTs, typically extracted from coconut or palm oil. Unlike

## Keto Mood Swings: What Causes the Mood Shift When people start fasting or a ketogenic diet, they can often become very irritable. This is because shifting from burning glucose to utilizing ketones as energy may often cause temper fluctuations, including irritability. Learn why these mood shifts occur during fasting periods and what practical solutions you can use to manage them. ## **Understanding the Body’s Fuel Sources** The human body operates on a complex fuel system, utilizing three primary sources: sugar (glucose), ketones, and fatty acids. Each source is vital to maintaining our health and well-being. With [intermittent fasting](https://www.drberg.com/blog/the-most-important-intermittent-fasting-basics-for-beginners-must-watch-dr-berg), the body switches energy away from glucose, which typically acts as the primary fuel. This easily accessible energy is obtained from carbohydrates in everyday foods like bread or pasta. Nonetheless, alternative energy sources become paramount in sustaining essential bodily functions in instances of decreased carbohydrate intake, such as those encountered during intermittent fasting. ### **Ketones and Fatty Acids: The Alternative Fuels** When glucose levels are low due to decreased carb consumption or extended fasting periods, your body resorts to burning stored fat into molecules known as ketones – this metabolic state is called ketosis. Ketone bodies serve efficiently, especially for brain function, since fats cannot be used directly for energy. Fatty acids act as another backup fuel that originates from dietary fats or internal fat stores when the food supply dwindles significantly. Most cells can utilize these except those within the brain because, unlike glucose and ketones, they cannot cross the blood-brain barrier effectively. ### **Making Shift Towards Using Ketone Bodies** A diet devoid of carbs triggers a shift towards increased usage of ketone bodies instead of heavily relying upon only one form, i.e., glucose,

## Does Splenda Break a Fast? Sucralose While Fasting Does Splenda break a fast? Though Splenda has zero calories, evidence suggests it may increase blood sugar levels and trigger an insulin response that inhibits fat burning and breaks a fast. Not only is Splenda unsuitable while fasting, but it’s also linked to many potential health effects, and it’s best to avoid this artificial sweetener as much as possible. Learn why regular Splenda consumption may increase the risk of metabolic diseases and discover which sugar substitutes are safe while fasting. ## **What is Splenda?** Splenda is a popular calorie-free sweetener often used by individuals trying to manage their weight or reduce their sugar intake. Splenda is the brand name of sucralose, an artificial sweetener made by replacing the hydrogen-carbon bonds in regular sugar with chlorine atoms, resulting in a much sweeter and calorie-free sugar substitute. Splenda can be found in a wide range of sugar-free products, including tabletop sweeteners, diet soda, lower-calorie foods, and baked goods. In addition to sucralose, Splenda contains maltodextrin and dextrose, which is surprising because these sweeteners can raise blood sugar and insulin levels more than regular table sugar. This explains why it’s possible to have high blood sugar levels despite no dietary sugar intake. Watch the video below to learn why Splenda isn’t a keto-friendly sweetener.## **Can sucralose break your fast?** Despite being calorie-free, sucralose has been shown to cause insulin spikes, inhibit fat burning, and trigger metabolic pathways that can break a fast in some individuals. Research published in the _American Journal of Clinical Nutrition_ suggests that consuming sucralose activates intestinal receptors called sweet taste receptors type 1 members 2 and 3 (T1R2 and T1R3), which directly stimulate insulin release from the

## Creatine on Keto: What You Should Know Now Monitoring your health markers regularly is crucial if you’re [following a ketogenic diet](https://www.drberg.com/blog/categories/ketogenic-diet). One such marker is serum creatinine – an often overlooked yet essential indicator of kidney function. But what does this have to do with your keto lifestyle? Let’s dive deeper. ### **The Role of Muscle Metabolism in Creatinine Production** [Creatine, found in our muscles](https://www.drberg.com/blog/what-is-creatine), breaks down during physical activity into creatinine at a rate of 1% to 2% daily. This byproduct then travels through our bloodstream until it reaches the kidneys, where it’s filtered out. A rise in these levels might occur when switching to a keto diet. Why so? This low-carb, high-fat regimen can increase muscle metabolism, producing more creatinine. However, not all elevated serum creatinine levels are signs of chronic kidney disease or other pathologies. Sometimes, they reflect physiological changes due to dietary shifts or increased muscular activities – hence its designation as potentially non-pathological on keto diets. ### **Dietary Factors Influencing Creatinine Levels on Keto** Moving beyond muscle metabolism and exercise routines that could lead to higher-than-usual lab report readings, let’s discuss protein intake and supplementation practices. #### **Impact Of Protein Intake On Creatinine Levels** One aspect worth noting is excessive protein consumption while on a ketogenic diet. Eating large amounts of proteins like cooked meat might raise your body’s level significantly since amino acid breakdown contributes directly towards producing more waste product – namely creatinine – for the kidneys to filter out. ### **Effects of Creatine Supplementation on Kidney Function** Creatine supplements are like that party guest who never knows when they’ve overstayed their welcome; they’re great initially, but too much can cause problems – elevated creatinine

## Crispy Keto Fried Fish with Spicy Dipping Sauce ![](https://drberg-dam.imgix.net/food-images/recipes-fried-fish-76-10.jpg?w=920\&auto=compress,format) This Crispy Keto Fried Fish with Spicy Dipping Sauce recipe features fresh fish filets battered in coconut flour and pork rind breading, so you can enjoy a fried fish platter while staying in ketosis. ## **Why you’ll love this keto-friendly recipe** This keto-breaded fish recipe uses low-carb, gluten-free substitutions for a healthy twist on a classic fried dish. Wheat flour and bread crumbs used in traditional fried fish recipes contain gluten, which can cause sensitivities and trigger intestinal inflammation linked to [leaky gut syndrome](https://www.drberg.com/blog/what-is-really-behind-leaky-gut). Wheat is also a source of phytates. These antinutrients can block the absorption of essential minerals such as iron, magnesium, and zinc, increasing the risk of nutritional deficiencies. Additionally, all-purpose flour and bread are high on the [glycemic index](https://www.drberg.com/blog/glycemic-index-vs-glycemic-load-in-simple-terms), which means they’re rapidly absorbed and quickly spike blood sugar and insulin levels. Blood sugar fluctuations can kick you out of ketosis and lead to weight gain, mood swings, fatigue, and poor metabolic health. Fortunately, this low-carb fried fish recipe is breaded with ground pork rinds and coconut flour, which are low on the glycemic index and 100 percent keto-approved ingredients. This recipe also calls for avocado oil for frying instead of seed oils, which can promote inflammation and may contribute to conditions such as acne, heart disease, obesity, and diabetes. ![Fresh cod filets](https://drberg-dam.imgix.net/others/fresh-raw-cod-loin-fillet-steaks.jpg?w=920\&auto=compress,format) ## **How to choose the best fish for keto fried fish** It’s recommended to choose wild-caught, low-mercury filets from a flaky, white-fleshed fish for this keto fried fish recipe.

## Keto and Mood Swings – Does Keto Affect Your Mood? Is there a link between keto and mood swings? Transitioning into a low-carbohydrate diet can cause transient mood swings and irritability. However, long-term adherence to the ketogenic diet may reduce the risk of neurological disorders, depressive symptoms, and anxiety. Discover why a high-carb diet can trigger or exacerbate mood disorders, and learn how to improve your mental health with simple dietary and lifestyle changes. ## **Does keto affect your mood?** The ketogenic diet has profound benefits for cognitive function and emotional stability. While initial stages may bring irritability, a long-term keto diet may enhance mood and overall mental health. Research published in _Nutritional Neuroscience_ suggests that high-carb diets are linked to anxiety disorders and may predispose individuals to the development of major depressive disorder.1 Sugars and refined carbohydrates can induce chronic inflammation. This inflammatory response may lead to oxidative stress and impaired mitochondrial function in neuronal cells, disrupting neurotransmitter signaling and contributing to various mental disorders. In contrast, the ketogenic diet reduces inflammation and stabilizes blood sugar levels, supporting better neurotransmitter balance and overall mental health. By providing a steady source of energy from fats, ketogenic diets help maintain optimal mitochondrial function and reduce oxidative stress, which can improve cognitive functions and mood regulation. Ketones, a group of organic acids released during fat breakdown, are a highly efficient fuel source and the preferred form of energy for brain cells. This explains why low-carb diets can help enhance mental clarity and support stable moods. Additionally, ketones may offer neuroprotective effects and have been found to reduce the risk of neurodegeneration linked to Parkinson’s and Alzheimer’s disease. !\[Woman kicking carb-rich

## What Is Keto Crotch?–And How to Get Rid of It Have you recently started keto and noticed an unpleasant vaginal odor? You may have developed keto crotch. The ketogenic diet is becoming increasingly popular, and as more people are going keto, the more we learn about the side effects of keto adaptation. Keto breath, [keto headache](https://www.drberg.com/blog/headaches-and-keto-adaptation), keto diarrhea, and [keto flu](https://www.drberg.com/blog/tags/keto-flu) are common side effects. Should keto crotch be added to this list? Let’s take a look if keto crotch is a thing and what you can do to get rid of vaginal odor fast. Keto crotch is a noticeable change in vaginal odor after starting the keto diet. While there isn’t a lot of scientific research on this topic, plenty of women report that they experience keto crotch. Symptoms typically appear after about a month of starting keto and include a strong vaginal smell and sometimes unusual discharge. The odor often is compared to a sour or fishy smell, and the severity of keto crotch can range from mild to very unpleasant. Changing to a high-fat and low-carb diet shifts your body to burn fat instead of sugar for energy. Keto triggers profound metabolic changes that support weight loss, balance hormone levels, and improve cognition. Keto crotch is most likely a side effect of your body adapting to the metabolic changes of keto. The good news is that once your body adjusts to burning fat, keto crotch will go away.## **What causes keto crotch?** Precisely what causes keto crotch isn’t fully understood. Bad breath, smelly urine, and changes in body odor are common side effects of starting keto and can give us some clues why vaginal odor may develop. ### **Elevated levels of ketones** As you enter ketosis, your metabolism breaks down fat for energy and produces ketones as by-products. Acetone is one type of ketone and the

## Top Keto Vegetables You Can Eat Freely Daily Vegetables are a vital component of a nutritious ketogenic diet and should make up a significant portion of your meal. Vegetables contain dietary fiber, which supports healthy digestion and satiety. They also offer a wide range of essential nutrients that help promote a healthy body. Discover six of the best keto vegetables, how much of them you should eat, and who may benefit from avoiding them. ## **What is keto?** Keto, short for ketogenic diet, aims to eliminate sugar intake and limit carbohydrates while focusing on healthy fats and high-quality protein. Limiting carbs and sugars reduces the availability of glucose, which pushes the body to break down fat to generate energy. Fat-burning releases ketones, a highly effective alternative fuel source. When ketones enter your circulation and begin to fuel your cells, you enter ketosis. This metabolic state is characterized by fat burning instead of using sugars and carbohydrates as energy sources. Using ketones as fuel is more efficient than converting sugar and carbs into energy. In addition, ketosis has profound health benefits, including weight loss, improved energy levels, and enhanced cognitive function. Healthy Keto® takes the low-carb concept a step further by focusing on the nutritional value of foods in addition to limiting carbs and sugars to achieve ketosis. Healthy Keto encourages the consumption of unprocessed and nutrient-dense whole foods such as pasture-raised, grass-fed meats and organic, non-GMO produce. These foods offer essential vitamins, minerals, healthy fats, and other beneficial nutrients essential for health. _“The principle behind Healthy Keto is that you don’t just lose weight to get healthy. Instead, you must first get healthy to lose weight,”_ says Dr. Berg. By focusing on nutritious foods and avoiding harmful additives, Healthy Keto can help prevent nutrient deficiencies and reduce the risk of chronic inflammation. This is crucial for

## 5 Satisfying Keto Rice Substitutes Rice is a staple food in many cultures and cuisines, often enjoyed as a side dish or used as a base in many main courses. Unfortunately, traditional rice is high in carbohydrates and has a high glycemic index, meaning it can quickly spike blood glucose levels, making it unsuitable for a low-carb lifestyle. Luckily, there is more than one keto rice substitute that can satisfy carb cravings without knocking you out of ketosis. ## **Why opt for low-carb rice substitutes?** Changing your eating habits on a Healthy Keto® diet can be challenging, especially for those who have grown accustomed to eating carb-heavy foods such as rice. While traditional white rice may serve as a substantial base in many dishes, it’s high in carbohydrates and lacks essential nutrients, which doesn’t meet the requirements of a nutritious low-carb diet. According to the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), 100 grams of cooked white rice contains around 28 grams of total carbohydrates.1 Many consider cooked brown rice a healthier alternative. However, it only has a slightly lower carb count, at about 26 grams per 100 grams. As a result, both types of rice can quickly spike blood sugar levels and disrupt ketosis. Research published in _StatPearls_ found that frequent blood sugar spikes can lead to symptoms such as frequent urination, increased thirst, mood changes, headaches, and fatigue.2 Moreover, heavily processed and polished rice has little to no nutritional value, making it a poor source of essential vitamins and minerals. ![Grated cauliflower](https://www.drberg.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/cauliflower-rice-bowl-on-light-stone-21.jpg?w=800) ## **5 keto rice substitutes** If you’re a fan of rice but want to avoid its downsides, consider these five nutrient-rich, low-carb rice alternatives, which offer all the satisfaction without the extra carbs. ### \*\*1.

Find out what Gatorade Zero is made of and why it isn’t suitable for a nutritious and health-promoting keto diet. ## **What is Gatorade Zero?** Gatorade Zero is a popular sugar-free sports drink advertised to replenish electrolytes without increasing carbohydrate count or adding significant calories. It’s available in various flavors and forms, including ready-made beverages, dissolvable tabs, concentrates, and powder sachets.

## Keto-Friendly Chicken Pot Pie - Dr. Berg Ketogenic Chicken Pot Pie Enjoy a low-carb makeover of classic comfort food with this Keto-Friendly Chicken Pot Pie. Filled with tender chicken, aromatic vegetables, and a rich, creamy base, this dish is topped with an irresistibly delicious cheesy almond flour crust.

The combination of tender chicken, velvety sauce, and a flaky top pie crust offers all the comfort of the original version without breaking ketosis. What’s more, this dish is incredibly nutritious. Celery and onions are packed with antioxidants, while [carrots](https://www.drberg.com/blog/are-carrots-okay-to-eat-on-keto) provide natural sweetness and beta-carotene, a carotenoid that supports eye and skin health. Furthermore, a [study](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6770766/) published in _Foods_ found that phytochemicals in carrots, such as chlorogenic acid, carotenoids, and polyacetylenes, may benefit human health through their anticancer, antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and antibacterial properties. Meanwhile, the chicken contributes high-quality protein, and the almond flour crust is loaded with fiber and healthy fats. _“With a glycemic index (GI) of less than one, almond flour is suitable for those following a low-carb diet as it doesn’t cause blood sugar spikes,”_ explains Dr. Berg. Although this dish contains nine grams of total carbs per serving, the high fiber content of the vegetables and almond flour reduces it to just three grams of net carbs. Fiber slows digestion and stabilizes blood sugar, making this creamy chicken dish even more keto-friendly. Another reason to love this recipe

## Keto Chocolate Coconut Fat Bombs ![coconut chocolate fat bombs](https://drberg-dam.imgix.net/others/recipes-coconut-chocolate-fat-bombs-156-4.jpg?w=920\&auto=compress,format) These Keto Chocolate Coconut Fat Bombs are a low-carb, tasty treat packed with healthy fat to satisfy your sweet tooth while keeping you in ketosis. This recipe uses unsweetened coconut flakes, melted chocolate chips, and almonds to create a chewy, crunchy, and coconutty dessert. ## **Why you’ll love these Keto Chocolate Coconut Fat Bombs** These Coconut Chocolate Fat Bombs are a no-bake dessert that can be thrown together in minutes. The recipe calls for unsweetened chocolate and coconut butter, oil, and flakes for a tropical flavor and a silky but chewy texture. It also includes almonds for a nutty crunch and erythritol to infuse these fat bombs with a satisfying sweetness. Coconut is a rich source of various nutrients that support immune functions and overall health, including vitamins C and E, iron, potassium, manganese, magnesium, and lauric acid, a beneficial [medium-chain triglyceride (MCT)](https://www.drberg.com/blog/mct-oil-or-medium-chain-triglycerides-the-different-types). _“Lauric acid is a powerful antiviral and antimicrobial agent that helps decrease viral load and boost the immune system,_” explains Dr. Berg. _“This type of fat is also beneficial for fighting candida and fungal overgrowth.”_ MCTs are rapidly absorbed and converted into ketones, which explains why coconut oil and coconut butter help promote fat-burning and offer sustainable energy. Additionally, these Coconut Chocolate Fat Bombs are made with sugar-free baking chocolate, which won’t impact blood sugar or insulin levels. In contrast, sugar-sweetened chocolate is high on the glycemic index and likely to cause blood sugar fluctuations. This can lead to weight gain, mood swings, and low energy while fuelling cravings for sugar and carbohydrates. !\[Stacked keto fat

[Research](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/B9780123756886101033) published in _Nuts and Seeds in Health and Disease Prevention_ reveals that peanuts have a favorable lipid profile, boasting more unsaturated fat than saturated fat.

## Keto Zucchini Fries - Dr. Berg Keto Zucchini Fries Recipe Are you looking for a crunchy, savory side dish that fits your Healthy Keto® lifestyle? These Keto Zucchini Fries are exactly what you need. Well-seasoned and baked to golden perfection, they satisfy carb cravings without interfering with fat burning. ## **Why you’ll love this keto-friendly recipe** French fries are a popular comfort food beloved for their crispy, delectably browned exterior and soft, flavorful interior. Unfortunately, traditional fries are high in carbs and unsuitable for a ketogenic diet. However, this low-carb Zucchini Fries recipe lets you indulge in a keto-friendly side dish or appetizer that satisfies your craving without compromising your carb count. Zucchinis are an excellent keto-approved substitute for regular potatoes that aren’t just low in carbs but also offer essential vitamins and minerals. According to the [U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA)](https://fdc.nal.usda.gov/fdc-app.html#/food-details/169291/nutrients), one cup of raw zucchini contains only 2.6 grams of net carbs while providing high concentrations of vitamin C, potassium, and magnesium. _“Potassium is an essential electrolyte needed to maintain hydration and proper muscle function, while magnesium is involved in energy production and bone health,”_ explains Dr. Berg. Additionally, this recipe uses almond flour instead of wheat bread crumbs or all-purpose flour as a coating, making it a gluten-free option suitable for individuals with metabolic disorders, such as diabetes and insulin resistance. This is confirmed by a [study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7884493/) published in the _Journal of Food Science and Technology_, which found that almond flour has a low glycemic index (GI) and helps regulate blood sugar and insulin levels. Blending almond flour, grated Parmesan cheese, and aromatic spices results in a mouthwatering coating that perfectly complements the tender texture of zucchini. What’s

## Keto Oven Roasted Vegetables - Dr. Berg Weeknights can be busy and stressful, leaving little time for meal prep. However, this simple Keto Oven Roasted Vegetables recipe creates a delicious and healthy side dish without much effort. Roasted to perfection, these vegetables boast natural flavors and a crispy texture that will have you coming back for more. ## **Why you’ll love this keto-friendly recipe** Eating vegetables doesn’t have to be boring or bland when following a [Healthy Keto®](https://www.drberg.com/blog/the-keto-diet-for-beginners) diet. This Keto Oven Roasted Vegetables recipe is not only low-carb but also bursts with flavor, thanks to the addition of balsamic vinegar and Italian seasoning. What’s more, with only 9.7 grams of net carbs per serving, it’s a dish that can be enjoyed guilt-free by those following a ketogenic diet. The secret to this low-carb count is the fiber-rich cruciferous vegetables, such as broccoli and cauliflower. _“Although fiber is included in a food’s total carb count, it isn’t absorbed and won’t impact blood glucose levels. This explains why fiber can be deducted from the carb count, leading to a much lower net carb content per serving,”_ says Dr. Berg. Additionally, this recipe calls for [olive oil](https://www.drberg.com/blog/real-extra-virgin-olive-oil-best-way-to-know-it-s-real), which helps roast the vegetables and provides health-promoting fatty acids and other benefits. [Research](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8424077/) published in _Frontiers in Pharmacology_ found that consuming extra virgin olive oil can significantly lower the risk of liver damage and may prevent the progression of fatty liver disease. The study further suggests that olive oil is a rich source of powerful antioxidants that play a crucial role in preventing cellular oxidative stress and reducing inflammation. Another reason to love these perfectly roasted vegetables is that they can easily be customized to suit your taste preferences.

## Keto Chicken Tenders - Dr. Berg Whether you’re dealing with picky eaters or looking to switch up your dinner routine, these Keto Chicken Tenders offer a tasty low-carb twist on traditional breaded fried chicken. These finger-licking good chicken tenders are coated with almond meal and Parmesan cheese to create a crunchy breading that won’t raise blood sugar levels. ## **Why you’ll love this keto-friendly recipe** Packed with protein and low in carbs, each serving of these delectable keto chicken tenders offers a delicious and satisfying way to fuel your body while staying in ketosis. These low-carb chicken strips are ideal for those with gluten sensitivities or wheat allergies as they are coated in a gluten-free almond meal instead of regular breadcrumbs. [Research](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/jf2044795) published in the _Journal of Agricultural and Food Chemistry_ found that almonds offer a wide array of nutrients, including monounsaturated fats, fiber, minerals, and phytonutrients. These nutrients contribute to almond’s hypocholesterolemic effects, promoting balanced cholesterol levels.

The study also shows that almonds can effectively improve key risk factors linked to various chronic diseases, including body weight, oxidative stress, and [blood sugar control](https://www.drberg.com/blog/normal-blood-sugar-level). _“Almond flour has a glycemic index of one, which indicates that it won’t affect blood sugar or insulin levels, making it a 100 percent keto-approved ingredient,”_ explains Dr. Berg.

This heavenly dessert can be created in ten minutes and requires only five simple ingredients, making it a perfect option for satisfying your sweet tooth without compromising your ketogenic goals. ## **Why you’ll love this keto-friendly recipe** If you want to satisfy your chocolate cravings while staying in fat-burning mode, this Keto Chocolate Mousse is just the thing. Heavy cream, a key ingredient in this recipe, offers a luxurious, velvety texture that’ll have your taste buds dancing with delight. Beyond its creamy consistency, whipped cream is an excellent source of healthy fats and has been linked to significant health benefits, making it an excellent addition to any keto meal plan. A [study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5122229/) published in _Food & Nutrition Research_ found that regularly incorporating dairy products can help reduce the risk of type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular diseases, particularly stroke. Cocoa powder is another crucial ingredient in this mousse. Packed with antioxidants and flavonoids, it not only infuses rich chocolate flavors but also supports heart health and helps reduce inflammation. _“Chocolate-derived flavanols have been linked to improved brain function, better moods, and a lower risk of developing neurodegenerative disorders, including Alzheimer’s disease,”_ explains Dr. Berg. What’s more, this dish is sweetened with monk fruit, a natural sugar alternative. Because monk fruit contains zero carbs and doesn’t affect blood sugar levels, it’s suitable for individuals with diabetes and those following a [Healthy Keto®](https://www.drberg.com/blog/the-keto-diet-for-beginners) diet. Another reason to love this recipe is its customizability, as you can easily replace ingredients to suit your dietary needs. For a vegan or lactose-free

## Is Squash Keto? Which Squash for Your Keto Diet? There are many different varieties of squash that can be used as a side dish or can even act as a substitute for your favorite comfort foods–but is squash keto-friendly? Its rich, starchy texture might make you think that it has too many carbs to eat on a keto diet. Surprisingly, squash is very low in net carbs and is a wonderful addition to a ketogenic diet. ## **How many carbs are in squash?** Because squash is so starchy, people often wonder, is squash keto-approved? Generally, squash contains about half the total carbs of a potato. Squash is very high in dietary fiber, so it’s low in grams of net carbs. The total carbs in squash vary depending on the specific variety. ### **Butternut squash** A 100-gram serving of butternut squash contains the following: \* 45 calories \* 0.1 g fat \* 12 g carbohydrates \* 2 g fiber \* 1 g protein This rich and delicious squash will make you second-guess whether it’s keto-friendly. The good news is that it is! Although butternut squash is higher in net carbohydrates than some of the other types of squash, it will not prevent you from losing weight when consumed in moderation. ### **Spaghetti squash** A 100-gram serving of spaghetti squash contains the following: \* 31 calories \* 0.6 g fat \* 7 g carbohydrates \* 1.5 g fiber \* 0.6 g protein Spaghetti squash has a spaghetti-like texture that is the perfect keto-friendly alternative to pasta. ### **Yellow Squash** Yellow squash is a type of summer squash that has a big flavor and a low net carb count. Here are the nutrition facts for a 100-gram serving of yellow squash: \* 31 calories \* 0.4 g fat \* 7 g carbohydrates \* 2.2 g fiber \* 2.4 g protein ### **Acorn Squash** Acorn squash is a winter squash and a delicious squash to eat on a low-carb diet.

This gluten-free and vegan Pine Nut Pesto recipe features fresh basil leaves, garlic, pine nuts, and keto-friendly zoodles to curb your carb cravings while keeping your body in ketosis. ## **Why you’ll love this keto-friendly recipe** This Pine Nut Pesto recipe with zucchini noodles and cherry tomatoes makes a vegan keto diet a breeze. Made with garlic, basil, parsley, and lemon zest, this pesto is a bright, refreshing green herb sauce perfect for topping ketogenic pasta and enhancing the flavor of your favorite low-carb soups or salads.

These ingredients also contain heart-supporting and immune-boosting nutrients, including sulfur and polyphenols. These naturally occurring plant compounds act as antioxidants and can help reduce oxidative stress linked to cellular damage and inflammation. !\[vegan keto pine nut pesto

## Are Carrots Keto Friendly? Find Out Here Carrots are often thought of as a healthy snack. They’re crunchy, delicious, and have a natural sweetness, but are carrots keto-friendly? Carrots are root vegetables that often contain more carbohydrates. While carrots do have some carbs, they also provide a notable amount of fiber–an important factor to consider when calculating net carbs. Let’s take a look at how carrots can be incorporated into a low-carb ketogenic diet. ## **What is keto?** Keto is a type of low-carb diet that emphasizes high fat intake with moderate protein. The goal is to shift your body into ketosis, which is a metabolic state where fat, rather than carbohydrates, becomes your primary source of energy. If you’re following a [ketogenic diet](https://www.drberg.com/blog/ketogenic-diet-side-effects), it’s important to pay close attention to the carb content of your food. It’s recommended to not exceed 50 grams of net carbs each day to trigger and maintain ketosis. Dietary fiber doesn’t affect your blood sugar levels, so you don’t have to count fiber towards your total carbs. To track your daily carb intake on keto, focus on net carbs. You can calculate net carbs by subtracting the fiber content from a food’s total carbohydrates. ## **Are carrots low-carb?** The glycemic index is a scale that rates how fast a food will raise your blood sugar levels. The glycemic index of carrots may be high compared to other ketogenic foods. However, when you’re on a high-fat keto diet, it’s important to look at the whole picture rather than just the glycemic index! The glycemic load tells us the number of carbohydrates in a food but takes the amount of fiber into consideration as well. Carrots have a low glycemic load of 2.88, well below the threshold of 10. Their high fiber content helps slow down digestion, supporting a more stable blood sugar response. Carrots contain 12 grams of carbs per cup, but they also offer 3.6 grams of fiber. This means one cup of carrots

## Can You Have Dextrose on Keto? Dextrose is a sweetener that can quickly push you over your daily carb limit on keto if you’re not careful. Find out why you should avoid dextrose on keto and which low-carb sweeteners you should use instead! ## **What is dextrose?** Dextrose is a carb and acts just like table sugar. It will raise blood sugar quickly, causing your insulin levels to spike. Dextrose will kick you out of ketosis, switching your metabolism from fat-burning to using carbs for energy instead. Dextrose is very high in net carbs and is often produced from GMO corn or wheat and should not be a part of your [Healthy Keto® diet](https://www.drberg.com/blog/the-keto-diet-for-beginners). ## **How much dextrose can you have on keto?** Dextrose is generally not considered keto-friendly but some very small amounts may be okay. To stay in ketosis, you must stick to 20 to 50 grams of carbs per day. One teaspoon of dextrose contains 4 grams of net carbs. Because dextrose often is used in processed foods and as a filler, it’s important to read nutrition labels. Also, remember that dextrose is low in nutritional value. Don’t waste your daily net carbs on processed foods with little to no health benefits. Is dextrose keto-friendly? While small amounts may not kick you out of ketosis, dextrose is not optimal for your keto lifestyle. ## **Should you use sweeteners on keto?** Sugar cravings do happen, particularly in the early days of your keto diet. Once your body adapts to fat-burning, cravings will diminish. This study confirms that following a ketogenic diet leads to less hunger and cravings compared to a low-fat diet.1 If you have the occasional sweet tooth, there are several keto-friendly [alternative sweeteners](https://www.drberg.com/blog/understanding-alternative-sweeteners) you can use.

## Keto Cornbread Recipe - Dr. Berg Cornbread is a household staple, often served alongside savory dishes such as chili, stews, or casseroles. However, traditional cornbread is high in carbs, making it unsuitable for those following a keto diet. Luckily, this Keto Cornbread Recipe offers a low-carb alternative by replacing cornmeal with almond flour, resulting in a similar texture to the classic dish. ## **What is Keto Cornbread?** While some spell it as cornbread, others insist it consists of two words and refer to it as corn bread. Regardless, low-carb cornbread is a delicious replacement for traditional cornbread made with cornmeal. _“Corn makes up around 40 percent of many American diets and often contains genetically modified organisms (GMOs) that can cause health issues, including inflammation, digestive problems, and allergies,”_ explains Dr. Berg. This keto-friendly version eliminates cornmeal and replaces it with almond flour, a healthier alternative that’s low in carbs and significantly more nutritious. [Research](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Peter-Ellis/publication/250058086_The_nutritional_and_health_benefits_of_almonds_a_healthy_food_choice/links/5850497108ae8f37381940b7/The-nutritional-and-health-benefits-of-almonds-a-healthy-food-choice.pdf?_sg%5B0%5D=started_experiment_milestone\&origin=journalDetail&_rtd=e30%3D) published in _Food Science and Technology Bulletin: Functional Foods_ found that almonds promote blood sugar control, which is crucial for weight management and diabetes control. This effect has been linked to almonds’ high concentrations of healthy fats, protein, fiber, and essential nutrients, including vitamin E and potassium. The study also indicates that eating almonds as part of a healthy diet can have health advantages without contributing to weight gain. Many low-carb cornbread recipes use sweeteners such as erythritol or stevia to mimic the sweetness of corn without causing blood sugar or insulin spikes. Keto Cornbread is a

## Keto Dry Mouth: What Causes It and How to Fix It Many people who adopt the keto diet are looking to lose weight or simply improve their overall health. However, some people begin the diet and discover that they are suffering from dry mouth. Learn about the keto diet, how it encourages health and weight loss, and what adjustments you can make to ensure you avoid dry mouth. ## **Understanding Dry Mouth on Keto** A low-carb, high-fat eating pattern known as the [ketogenic diet (or “keto” for short)](https://www.drberg.com/blog/categories/diet/keto) has become popular due to its potential health benefits, such as weight loss and [improved blood sugar control](https://www.drberg.com/blog/what-to-eat-to-correct-diabetes). However, like any significant dietary shift, it can have some side effects. ### **Role of Saliva in Maintaining Oral Health** A common complaint among those new to the keto lifestyle is dry mouth. It’s not just uncomfortable; saliva plays an essential role in our oral health by washing away food particles and preventing tooth decay. Humans produce between 0.5 and 1.5 liters of saliva daily, equivalent to two to six cups. Dry mouth on keto isn’t usually a cause for concern – it’s simply your body adjusting itself during the transition from burning glucose (sugar) for energy towards using ketones produced from fats instead. If dry mouth is causing you concern, however, consult with a healthcare provider before taking any action. ## **The Role of Amylase in Starch Digestion** Think of amylase as a pair of scissors. It snips the long chains of starch molecules into smaller, digestible pieces. Your body produces plenty of this enzyme on a standard diet because you’re regularly consuming starchy foods. ### **Impact of Reduced Starch Consumption on Amylase Production** If you decide to follow a ketogenic diet, your intake of starchy foods plummets dramatically. Amylase production then slows down because there isn’t much work for it anymore. So when we cut

## Keto Fried Chicken with Whey Protein Breading Cooking time 30-60 Minutes Main Ingredient Chicken Skill Level Intermediate Servings 1 people Calories 450kcal Rate this Recipe [![](https://www.drberg.com/var/www/wp-content/themes/drberg/assets/images/icon-print.svg)](https://www.drberg.com/wprm_print/fried-chicken-with-whey-protein-breading) Calories450kcalNet carbs-16gFat28gProtein75g \* Set up your breading station. Grab 3 medium-large bowls. Fill the first bowl with ½ cup coconut flour, second bowl with ½ cup heavy whipping cream, and third bowl with ½ cup unflavored whey protein powder and Spices to taste. \* Dip 3 ounces chicken tenders in the flour, then the cream and finally coat with protein powder. \* Fill a deep pan with about 2 cups avocado oil for frying. You want enough oil for the chicken to “swim” in it. If there’s not enough oil, your chicken will make direct contact with the pan and may burn. Use medium-high heat. \* Gently drop the chicken into the hot oil. Make sure that as you drop the chicken, you are dropping it away from you to prevent hot oil from splashing back at you. Once you drop the chicken into the hot oil, do not touch it at all for 2 to 3 mins. This will allow time for the breading to fry, which will help it keep its shape and prevent it from falling apart. \* Make sure that the internal temperature of the chicken is 165 degrees. This fried chicken recipe is delicious and low in carbs. A regular piece of fried chicken has 20 g of net carbs–ours has just 2 g of net carbs! The breading is made from grass-fed whey protein powder. Make sure you use unflavored protein powder. ![](https://drberg-dam.imgix.net/food-images/recipes-fried-chicken-with-whey-protein-breading-39-2.jpg)

## Keto Meatballs and Zoodles Recipe ![meatballs and zoodles](https://drberg-dam.imgix.net/others/recipes-meatballs-and-zoodles-19-2.jpg?w=920\&auto=compress,format) While spaghetti and meatballs is a classic dish that many people love, it’s not keto-approved. Luckily, with a little creativity and the right ingredients, you can make a delicious low-carb version of this popular comfort food. This Meatballs and Zoodles recipe pairs juicy grass-fed beef with zucchini noodles, delivering the satisfaction of traditional spaghetti and meatballs without raising your blood sugar levels. ## **Why you’ll love this keto-friendly recipe** Italian cuisine is often associated with carb-heavy pasta tossed in marinara sauce. Fortunately, the zucchini spaghetti noodles in this recipe prove you can still enjoy your favorite Italian meals on a [Healthy Keto®](https://www.drberg.com/blog/healthy-keto-plan-start-here) diet. Moreover, the succulent meatballs made with grass-fed beef are a great source of protein and healthy fats, keeping you energized and in fat-burning mode. [Research](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8728510/) published in _Food Science of Animal Resources_ supports this, revealing that grass-fed beef has a healthier fat profile and fewer cholesterol-raising fatty acids than grain-fed beef. In addition to the nutritional benefits of grass-fed beef, using olive oil adds a dose of heart-healthy monounsaturated fats, which have been linked to a reduced risk of heart disease. This recipe also calls for grated Parmesan cheese, offering not only a delightful savory flavor but also providing calcium, protein, and healthy fats. For those who aren’t fans of zucchini noodles, there are plenty of other low-carb noodle options, such as spaghetti squash, shirataki noodles, or thinly sliced eggplant. Another reason you’ll love this recipe is that these zoodles and meatballs take only 30 minutes, making them the perfect dinner choice for busy nights. You can also customize

## Onion Rings - Dr. Berg \* Set up your breading station. Get 3 medium-large sized bowls. In first bowl, add ¼ cup coconut flour. In second bowl, add 3 eggs. In third bowl, add 2 cups pork rinds. \* Dip 3 onion rings in coconut flour one at the time. This will just be a light coating. \* Dip onion in egg mixture. \* Return to flour mixture. \* Dip in egg mixture again. Make sure that the onion is fully covered. \* Finally, dip the onion in the pork rinds, ensuring onion is completely coated. \* If you have a deep fryer, set it to 350 degrees and fry the onion rings. If you do not have a deep fryer, get a small sauce pot and fill it with about 2 cups avocado oil. Turn on medium-high heat. Use a meat thermometer to check the temperature of the oil. Once the oil is at 350 degrees, drop in the onion ring away from you so that the hot oil doesn’t splash back at you. Use tongs to flip the onion ring over about 2 to 3 minutes after you intially drop it into the oil. If you don’t have a meat thermometer, leave the oil on the heat for 5 to 6 minutes to let it warm up. \* Serve with a low carb marinara sauce. It is hard to believe that these onion rings are keto-friendly. You will not be able to tell the difference. Make sure to fry them in non-GMO safflower oil. This recipe’s nutritional information is based on 3 large onion rings. You can multiply this recipe times however many onion rings you decide to make. They are high in fat and very filling, so we think 3 is the perfect amount.

## Is Pesto Keto-Friendly? | Dr. Berg Pesto is a nutritious sauce and condiment available in many tasty variations, but is pesto keto-friendly? Yes, traditionally prepared pesto is low in carbs and can be a great way to add depth of flavor to various keto recipes. Discover the benefits of regularly incorporating pesto into a ketogenic diet and learn how to make the best Healthy Keto® pesto recipe. ## **What is pesto?** Originating from Genoa, Italy, authentic pesto sauce is crafted from simple ingredients, including fresh basil leaves, garlic, parmesan cheese, pecorino cheese, pine nuts, olive oil, sea salt, and pepper. The name pesto comes from the Genovese word pestare, which means to pound or crush. It depicts the traditional method of preparing pesto using a mortar and pestle to combine ingredients. Here are common ingredients used in different pesto varieties. ### **Common herbs used in pesto** The original pesto recipe, Pesto alla Genovese, exclusively uses Genovese basil as the primary herb due to its unique sweetness. Basil is a delicate herb, and using the mortar and pestle instead of harshly chopping or blending with a food processor slows down the oxidation of the leaves. This not only helps preserve the sauce’s vivid green hue but also enhances its flavor and aroma. However, pesto has evolved to encompass a broader range of ingredients. Here are some other common herbs used in many pesto recipes: \* Italian flat-leaf parsley \* Cilantro \* Mint \* [Oregano](https://www.drberg.com/blog/14-amazing-benefits-of-oregano-oil) In addition to herbs, many pesto sauces incorporate ingredients such as arugula, spinach, kale, lemon juice, or tomatoes. ### **Common nuts used in pesto** Similarly, some recipes replace the traditional toasted pine nuts with other types of nuts to add a unique twist to the classic dish. Here are some commonly used nuts used to prepare pesto: \* Almonds \* Cashews \* Walnuts \* Pecans \* Pistachios !\[Keto-friendly pesto zucchini

Unlike traditional tacos, which are typically made with corn or wheat flour, this recipe creates crispy cheese shells that won’t raise your blood sugar levels or [kick you out of ketosis](https://www.drberg.com/blog/7-surprising-things-that-can-kick-you-out-of-ketosis). _“Consuming wheat flour can cause inflammation and digestive discomfort,”_ explains Dr. Berg. _“Wheat flour is also high in carbs and has a glycemic index of 70 to 85, indicating that it causes blood sugar spikes and can quickly kick you out of ketosis.”_ In contrast, these taco shells are made from shredded cheese and form a crispy base for your beef tacos that won’t raise blood sugar levels or interfere with fat-burning. These Keto Tacos are filled with seasoned cooked ground beef, romaine lettuce, and chopped tomatoes, offering a satisfying bite and delightful flavor profile. It’s best to use grass-fed ground beef to add high-quality protein and essential B vitamins, including vitamins B3, B6, and B12. [Research](https://www.mdpi.com/2304-8158/11/5/646) published in _Foods_ found that beef from cattle raised on pasture-based diets has a more nutritious fatty acid profile than beef products from cattle raised on grain-containing fodder. The study further found pasture-raised beef contains significantly higher levels of [omega-3 fatty acids](https://www.drberg.com/blog/basics-of-omega-3-fatty-acids), including health-promoting eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid acid (DHA) compared to grain-fed beef.

## Keto Coconut Pudding - Dr. Berg Keto Coconut Pudding is a creamy, indulgent treat that will satisfy your sweet tooth without raising your blood sugar levels. Made with unsweetened coconut milk, heavy cream, and a hint of vanilla, it’s the perfect low-carb dessert for any keto meal plan. Whether you’re meal prepping or enjoying this dessert as a decadent after-dinner treat, this pudding will please even the pickiest eaters. ## **Why you’ll love this Keto Coconut Pudding recipe** Although plenty of delicious foods can be enjoyed on a [Healthy Keto®](https://www.drberg.com/blog/healthy-keto-plan-start-here) diet, finding satisfying desserts can be challenging. That’s where this Keto Coconut Pudding recipe comes in! It’s a creamy, rich dessert that’s both satisfying and guilt-free. Made with simple, keto-friendly ingredients, this pudding is low in carbs and high in healthy fats, making it the perfect treat to enjoy while staying in ketosis. This recipe features coconut milk, coconut extract, and coconut yogurt, all abundant in vitamins and minerals, including iron, magnesium, and potassium. Furthermore, [research](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7766932/) published in the _Journal of Cardiovascular Development and Disease_ highlights that coconuts are a rich source of medium-chain saturated fatty acids (MCTs). MCTs are rapidly absorbed and directly converted into energy, making them an excellent fuel source for those on a ketogenic diet. Another key ingredient is Swerve, a low-carb sugar substitute made from a blend of erythritol and allulose.

## Keto Brownies - Dr. Berg Following a low-carb lifestyle doesn’t mean you can’t enjoy decadent desserts. This Keto Brownie Recipe uses rich Dutch chocolate powder to create a fudgy, indulgent treat that will satisfy your sweet tooth without derailing your low-carb diet. ## **Why you’ll love this Keto Brownie recipe** While there really is no need to explain why brownies are amazing, this recipe takes fudgy keto brownies to the next level. Most low-carb brownies are made with conventional unsweetened cocoa powder. However, this Keto Brownies Recipe uses Dutch cocoa powder, infusing a deep and rich chocolate flavor while offering impressive health benefits. Dutch chocolate powder is a high-quality cocoa that has been treated with a natural alkalizing agent such as potassium citrate to neutralize some of the chocolate’s acidity. This natural cocoa powder offers a richer chocolate flavor and readily dissolves in liquids, making it ideal for baking and desserts. In addition, Dutch chocolate powder contains high concentrations of flavanols, a group of plant compounds with potential health advantages. Flavanols have antioxidant properties and may contribute to heart health by improving blood flow and [lowering blood pressure](https://www.drberg.com/blog/lower-blood-pressure-simply-by-cutting-out-sugar). [Research](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4340060/) published in _The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition_ also found that cocoa flavanols promote cognitive health, lower the risk of diabetes, and have cellular anti-aging effects. What’s more, this wonderful recipe calls for xylitol as a sugar substitute and almond flour to replace traditional wheat flour, making these fudgy brownies both keto-friendly and gluten-free. ![Brownies on a table](https://drberg-dam.imgix.net/others/chocolate-brownie-on-paper-light-grey.jpg?w=920\&auto=compress,format) ## **When to enjoy Keto Brownies** Although it may be tempting, it’s best not to snack on these delicious keto

Packed with healthy fats from almond flour, cream cheese, and eggs, it’s the perfect low-carb dessert to keep you in fat-burning mode. Whether you’re celebrating or simply craving a sweet treat, this cake delivers incredible taste without compromising your keto lifestyle. ## **Why you’ll love this keto-friendly recipe** Following a [Healthy Keto®](https://www.drberg.com/blog/healthy-keto-plan-start-here) diet doesn’t mean you can’t enjoy the occasional sweet dessert.

Loaded with antioxidants, cocoa powder has shown the potential to significantly benefit heart health and reduce inflammation. In addition, a [study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4696435/) published in _Antioxidants & Redox Signaling_ summarizes the health advantages of cocoa as follows, “_Cocoa can protect nerves from injury and inflammation, protect the skin from oxidative damage from UV radiation in topical preparations, and have beneficial effects on satiety, cognitive function, and mood.”_ Another reason to enjoy this Chocolate Keto Cake is that it’s suitable for diabetics as it uses low-glycemic almond flour and erythritol, a powdered sweetener that doesn’t contribute to blood sugar fluctuations. Almond flour is a low-carb alternative to traditional wheat flour and is rich in vitamin E, magnesium, and healthy fats. _“Wheat flour has a high glycemic index (GI) of 85, which can cause inflammation and spike blood sugar levels, while almond flour has a much lower GI of less than one,”_ explains Dr. Berg.

## Blueberries on Keto: Surprising Health Benefits Blueberries are packed with antioxidants and offer a vibrant sweetness that’s hard to resist. But can you have blueberries on keto? Yes, blueberries can be incorporated into a keto meal plan in moderation as they contain some carbs but offer impressive health benefits and are excellent sources of vitamin C and fiber. Learn how many blueberries you can enjoy on keto without interfering with fat-burning and discover delicious keto-approved berry recipes. ## **Can I have blueberries on keto?** Yes, eating blueberries on a ketogenic diet is acceptable, provided they’re raw or frozen rather than dried. According to data released by the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), 50 grams (1.7 ounces) of raw blueberries contain:1 \* 26 calories \* 0.3 g protein \* 0.1 g fat \* 7 g total carbohydrates \* 1.2 g fiber \* 5.8 g net carbs Because of their carb count, blueberries are keto-friendly in moderation but should be included in your daily carb allowance to avoid interfering with fat-burning or disrupting ketosis. Conversely, dried blueberries are high in carbohydrates, containing as much as 40 grams of net carbs per 50-gram serving. This is mainly due to the dehydration process that concentrates their natural sugars by removing water, making dried fruits unsuitable for those following a low-carb ketogenic diet. Additionally, many dried fruit products contain added sugars, increasing their carb count even more, which can trigger significant blood sugar fluctuations and contribute to weight gain. Watch the video below to learn about the best berries on keto.## **More keto-friendly berries** If you want to add more low-carb fruits to your diet, strawberries, blackberries, and raspberries are excellent options that offer plenty of health advantages.

Refrigerate for about 10 minutes to make the fat bombs easier to form. \* Form into tablespoon-sized fat bombs. \* Place in refrigerator, while you make your chocolate sauce.

If you melt it over heat, it becomes runny and harder to manage/not make a mess, but you can definitely warm it up a little bit. \* Add unsweetened ½ cup cocoa powder. \* Add 1 tablespoon erythritol. \* Add 3-4 drops stevia. \* Mix well! REALLY well. Make sure that all of the clumps of chocolate are mixed in. \* This mixture will not taste great until it hardens. So if you taste it while it’s still in liquid form, don’t be discouraged. \* Cover fat bombs in chocolate. Refrigerate until the chocolate hardens.

## Keto Ginger Cookies - Dr. Berg Soft and Chewy Ginger Cookies Spice up your dessert game with these irresistible Keto Ginger Cookies! Packed with aromatic ginger, cinnamon, and nutmeg, these chewy cookies deliver all the cozy flavors you love in a classic ginger cookie without the extra carbs. With only 1.8 grams of net carbs per serving, these confections are ideal for satisfying your sweet tooth while staying true to your low-carb lifestyle. ## **Why you’ll love these Keto Ginger Cookies** These chewy Keto Ginger Cookies will quickly become a favorite in your dessert rotation! Loaded with nutritious ingredients, they offer more than just delectable flavors. _“Almond flour, made by finely grounding almonds, boasts a remarkably low glycemic index (GI) of less than one, compared to all-purpose flour’s GI of 71,”_ explains Dr. Berg. _“Its low GI helps minimize blood sugar spikes, supporting sustained energy levels and better overall metabolic health.”_ [Ginger](https://www.drberg.com/blog/the-unique-health-benefits-of-ginger) is another key ingredient in this recipe, adding a spicy warmth and offering potent antioxidants and anti-inflammatory benefits. This is confirmed by a [study](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9654013/) published in _Molecules_ stating that ginger contains 6-shogaol and gingerols, which are known for their powerful anti-inflammatory properties. These natural compounds may provide relief from conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis, psoriasis, and inflammatory bowel disease. The research further revealed that ginger may provide protective benefits against cancer, especially in early stages, while alleviating chemotherapy side effects. Meanwhile, butter contributes a rich source of healthy fats that not only enhance the flavor but also create a tender, melt-in-your-mouth texture in these cookies. Moreover, this recipe is 100 percent keto-friendly as it relies on sugar alcohols, such as erythritol, instead of brown sugar to keep carbs low.

What’s more, they contain less than one gram of carbs per serving, making them an excellent low-carb treat that won’t raise your blood sugar levels. ## **Why you’ll love this keto-friendly recipe** Unlike traditional wheat cheese snacks, these baked Cheese Crisps are entirely gluten-free, making them an excellent substitute for those with gluten sensitivities.

[Research](https://www.dairy-journal.org/articles/dst/abs/2008/04/dst88s4501/dst88s4501.html) published in _Dairy Science and Technology_ found that cheese contains various essential nutrients, such as bioactive peptides, amino acids, healthy fats, vitamins, and minerals, needed to support strong bones and promote cardiovascular health.

What’s more, this Keto Cheese Crisps recipe is incredibly easy to make, requiring just a few minutes in the oven. It can also be enjoyed with many low-carb dips, including guacamole, sour cream, or spinach dip. Another reason why you will love this recipe is that you can experiment with the ingredients of these low-carb cheese chips by adding homemade taco seasoning or other unique spices.

## Are Olives Keto-Friendly? | Dr. Berg Olives have been a staple in Mediterranean cultures for thousands of years and are still used in many Greek, Spanish, and Italian-inspired dishes, but are olives keto-friendly? Yes, olives are low in carbs, and you can enjoy moderate amounts of olives without breaking ketosis. Learn how many carbs are in olives and discover why you should regularly incorporate them into your keto diet plan. ## **How many carbs are in olives?** According to data from the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), 100 grams, or about 40 canned olives, contains 6 grams of total carbohydrates and 1.6 grams of fiber.1 To calculate their net carbs, subtract dietary fiber from total carbs, which leaves 4.4 grams of net carbs in 100 grams of olives. A typical serving size of ten olives contains only 1.5 grams of net carbs, making olives an excellent addition to a low-carb diet. ### **Olives nutrition facts** Olives are rich sources of oleic acid, a monounsaturated omega-9 fatty acid linked to various health benefits, including balanced cholesterol levels and a lower risk of chronic inflammation. 100 grams of canned olives contains the following: \* 116 calories \* 10.9 g total fat \* 2.3 g saturated fats \* 7.7 g healthy monounsaturated fats \* 0.6 g polyunsaturated fats \* 0.84 g protein \* 6 g total carbs \* 1.6 g fiber \* 4.4 g net carbs Olives are also a good source of many essential nutrients, including: \* Vitamin E \* Vitamin A \* Iron \* Copper \* Calcium \* Magnesium Watch the video below to learn more about keto-friendly fats.## **Can you have olives on the keto diet?** While most fruits aren’t suitable for low-carb diets, olives are an exception.

The ketogenic version of this dish uses a limited amount of the black bean liquid and of course – cauliflower rice. This dish makes up for the lack of black bean liquid by “sweating” the vegetables for a long period of time, along with the use of spices and a little bit of chicken broth (or any broth if you’d like to make it vegan/vegetarian). ![](https://drberg-dam.imgix.net/food-images/recipes-cuban-cauliflower-rice-and-beans-93-1.jpg)

## Is Milk Keto-Friendly? How to Eat Dairy on the Keto Diet Dairy is one of the five main food groups and a good source of calcium, which supports strong bone development and skeletal health. But is milk keto? No, milk isn’t suitable for a ketogenic diet due to its high carbohydrate content. While many dairy products are keto-friendly, others can quickly kick you out of ketosis. Discover why milk isn’t ideal for a low-carb diet and which dairy options are safe for those following keto. ## **Is milk keto-friendly?** The keto diet limits carb intake to 20 to 50 grams of net carbohydrates daily to maintain ketosis and fat-burning. One cup (eight ounces) of whole milk contains 12 grams of carbohydrates. That’s more than half the daily net carb limit for most keto dieters. Reduced-fat milk products are also unsuitable for keto due to their high carb counts. Here is the carb count of cow’s milk based on fat content per cup: \* Cow’s milk, 2 percent fat content: 12 grams \* Cow’s milk, 1 percent fat content: 13 grams \* Cow’s milk, skimmed: 13 grams Although milk isn’t keto-friendly, dairy doesn’t have to be completely eliminated from a ketogenic diet. Many keto-friendly milk alternatives and dairy products suit a low-carb lifestyle. Their high-fat content can help keep you energized and satisfied, curbing hunger and cravings. Watch the video below to learn more about dairy products on keto.## **Best and worst types of milk on keto** While cow’s milk contains too many carbohydrates for a low-carb diet, various keto milk alternatives contain minimal net carbs and are safe to consume. When choosing keto-friendly cow’s milk alternatives, it’s important to select options that won’t kick you out of ketosis. Here are the best and worst types of milk on keto. ### **Best milk for keto** Some of the best keto milks are derived from nuts or fermented dairy products due to their low net

## Keto-Friendly Biscuits and Sausage Gravy Start your day right with this creamy and hearty keto sausage gravy. Made with pork sausage, heavy cream, and cream cheese, this gravy recipe is sure to keep you satiated. Serve it over homemade almond flour biscuits for a low-carb twist on a classic Southern dish that won’t raise blood sugar levels. ## **Why you’ll love this keto recipe** Finding a low-carb sausage gravy recipe that’s as indulgent as the original version can be challenging. This keto version lets you enjoy all the traditional flavors without added carbs. Almond flour substitutes traditional flour, offering a low-carb and gluten-free option for those with celiac disease or wheat sensitivity. Meanwhile, the cream cheese and heavy cream add richness and creaminess to the gravy. These ingredients are also rich sources of healthy fats that provide energy and will keep your body in ketosis. In addition, [research](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4703621/) published in _Springer_ found dairy products to be a great source of highly bioavailable calcium. The study further explains that consuming three servings of dairy daily can ensure calcium intake recommendations are met. This recipe can also be personalized to your taste preferences by using different types of sausage or experimenting with your favorite herbs and spices. ![](https://drberg-dam.imgix.net/food-images/recipes-ketogenic-biscuits-and-gravy-175-3.jpg?w=920\&auto=compress,format) ## **What type of sausage is best for keto sausage gravy?** When creating the perfect keto sausage gravy, the type of sausage you choose plays a pivotal role in flavor and nutritional value. Pork sausages labeled breakfast sausage are a popular choice. However, conventional products often contain preservatives that can cause digestive issues or sensitivities. Opting for [organic meat](https://www.drberg.com/blog/why-organic-meats-on-keto) is generally considered a better choice as it has a higher nutrient content

## Is Balsamic Vinegar Keto? Keto‑Friendly Tips Balsamic vinegar is a popular Italian condiment often mixed with olive oil to make balsamic vinaigrette and other salad dressings. But is balsamic vinegar keto-friendly? Traditional balsamic vinegar tends to be relatively low in carbs and can be enjoyed in moderation on a ketogenic diet. However, commercial balsamic vinegar and balsamic glazes are often packed with sugar and can contain up to 18 grams of net carbs per tablespoon (15 milliliters). Learn why some balsamic vinegars can quickly push you out of ketosis and discover the best keto-friendly alternatives. ## **Can you have balsamic vinegar on keto?** Whether you can have balsamic vinegar on keto depends on the carb content of the specific balsamic product you plan to use. Balsamic vinegar is made by boiling down and fermenting concentrated grape juice, creating a dark vinegar with a sweet and tangy flavor. However, not all carbs are broken down during the fermentation process, which explains why most balsamic vinegar contains some residual sugars. _“Depending on the quality of the grape juice, fermentation method, and aging period, the carb content of specific balsamic vinegar brands can differ significantly,”_ explains Dr. Berg. ### **How many carbs are in balsamic vinegar?** Regular balsamic vinegar and white balsamic vinegar varieties contain between 2 to 10 grams of carbs per 1-tablespoon serving. However, some low-carb versions contain less than 2 grams of net carbs per serving. Balsamic glaze is a highly concentrated form of balsamic vinegar with a thick and syrupy consistency, often used as a drizzle or sauce to add flavor and decoration to dishes. Most commercially produced balsamic glaze is sweetened with sugars and thickened with syrups or caramel and can contain as many as 18 grams of carbs per tablespoon. It’s important to check labels and opt for low-carb balsamic products that won’t interfere with ketosis and disrupt fat burning. Alternatively, opt

## He Should Have Been Dead 6 Years Ago - STAGE 4 CANCER He Should Have Been Dead 6 Years Ago – STAGE 4 CANCER I want to tell you a story that might blow your mind. It’s about a guy named Guy who was diagnosed with stage four cancer and given just weeks to live. But here’s the kicker: he’s still alive and kicking, six years later. How did he do it? By giving the middle finger to conventional treatments and embarking on a natural protocol that starved his cancer cells. Buckle up because this is one hell of a ride. Now, I know what you’re thinking. Stage four cancer? That’s a death sentence. Well, not for Guy. He decided to take matters into his own hands and research the heck out of alternative therapies. And what he found was pretty incredible: a combination of prolonged fasting, a ketogenic diet, and other natural remedies that essentially put his cancer cells on a starvation diet. It’s like he put his tumor on a no-carb, no-sugar plan and watched it fade up. But here’s the thing: Guy didn’t just stumble upon this protocol by accident. He spent countless hours poring over scientific literature, consulting with experts in the field, and experimenting with different approaches until he found what worked for him. And now, he’s living proof that there’s hope beyond the standard slash-and-burn approach of chemo and radiation. ## **Understanding Stage Four Cancer** Stage four cancer is the most advanced stage of cancer, where the disease has spread from its original site to other parts of the body. This process, known as metastasis, occurs when cancer cells break away from the primary tumor and travel through the bloodstream or [lymphatic system](https://www.drberg.com/blog/what-is-the-lymphatic-system) to form new tumors in other organs or tissues. Being diagnosed with stage four cancer can be a devastating and life-altering experience for patients and their loved ones.
