## Inflamed Eyelids Remedies You Can Try at Home When finding a natural remedy for inflammatory eyelids, many feel frustrated and unsure where to turn. The irritation and distress caused by swollen eyelids, or blepharitis, can be very troubling. Learn about the causes, symptoms, and remedies for inflamed eyes so you can manage this condition effectively. ## **Unraveling the Mystery of Inflamed Eyelids** One underappreciated eye disease is inflamed eyelids, also known as blepharitis. This condition manifests as redness, irritation, and itchiness on your eyelid margins . These symptoms could be easily mistaken for other issues. Blepharitis occurs when small oil glands near the base of your lashes become blocked or infected, leading to swollen eyes. Although not typically sight-threatening, blepharitis should still be addressed as a medical issue. Intriguingly enough, there are two types: anterior and posterior blepharitis, each having different risk factors. Anterior involves inflammation where lashes attach outside the front edge of your lid caused by seborrheic dermatitis (dandruff). Posterior blepharitis is associated with Meibomian gland dysfunction within lids, causing them to become inflamed. ### **The Most Common Culprits** Parasites like Demodex mites found on human skin are common causes of blepharitis. Still, in the excess cause, ocular surface irritation around the eyes, bacterial infections caused by _E.coli_ or _Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus_ (MRSA) could lead to swollen eyelid conditions, making these among the most common causes behind inflamed eyelids. Viral pathogens such as herpes simplex virus (HSV), varicella-zoster virus (VZV), and molluscum contagiosum virus can infect the surfaces of the eye, leading to persistent conjunctivitis and inflammation along the edges of the eyelids. These factors contribute to the development of chronic eye irritation. !\[Intestinal

We’ve all been there. Premature graying can be as perplexing as it is frustrating, often making us feel older than we are.

Stress, diet choices, lifestyle habits – they’re all part of this complex puzzle.

The multiple factors behind this condition can be attributed to both genetic and epigenetic influences. ### **The Role of Genetics and Epigenetics in Hair Graying** Our genes have a significant influence on our hair color, and they also affect when we begin to gray. But did you know they also influence when we start to gray? That’s right. If your parents or grandparents went gray early, the odds are you might too, according to research from the National Institutes of Health (NIH). However, it is not only determined by genetics.

Discover six benefits of ozonated olive oil and learn how to use it as a natural remedy for skin conditions. ## **What is ozonated olive oil?** Ozonated olive oil is a type of oil that has been infused with ozone, a gaseous molecule containing three oxygen atoms. Ozone is highly reactive and readily undergoes chemical reactions with other compounds it comes into contact with. Its high reactivity makes ozone an excellent antimicrobial agent that helps eliminate bacteria, viruses, and fungi. There are different types of ozonated oils, including ozonated sunflower, almond, and [coconut oil](https://www.drberg.com/blog/palm-oil-vs-coconut-oil-health-benefits). However, ozonated olive oil is the most prominent type and is widely available online and in many health food stores. Ozone is a highly effective disinfectant due to its powerful antibacterial, antiviral, and antifungal qualities. Because of limited scientific evidence, using ozonated olive oil for therapeutic purposes has been controversial in the past. Since then, much research has been conducted to investigate the effectiveness and safety of ozonated oils in the management of skin infections. A recent study published in the _International Wound Journal_ summarizes that _“Ozonated oil can promote healing of skin wounds, and topically treat atopic dermatitis, psoriasis, superficial bacterial infections, and fungal infections.”_ 1 Check out these six impressive benefits of ozonated olive oil! ### **1. Natural antibiotic** When ozone comes into contact with microbial microorganisms, it releases a highly reactive oxygen molecule called singlet oxygen.

## Cause of Eczema: What You Might Be Overlooking Eczema is a condition that affects many people and can be very difficult to live with. Understanding the condition is a good start for those suffering from eczema that want to find relief. Learn about a common cause of eczema and what steps you can take to find relief. ## **Understanding Salicylate Sensitivity and Eczema** Different factors can affect skin health, including eczema. Among these is salicylate sensitivity, a potential trigger for this common skin disorder. The link between diet and dermatological well-being has been under scientific scrutiny for some time. One dietary component that may influence symptoms of disorders like eczema is salicylates – chemicals naturally present in many plant-based foods. ### **What is Salicylate Sensitivity?** A fraction of individuals might exhibit an adverse reaction towards salicylates, termed ‘salicylate sensitivity.’ This condition isn’t classified as an allergy but a hypersensitivity where consuming high-salicylate food or using products with them could cause unpleasant symptoms in susceptible people. This intolerance varies among affected individuals. Some might be able to tolerate low levels without any noticeable effects, while others react adversely even at minimal exposure. ### **How Does Salicylate Sensitivity Trigger Eczema?** To understand how salicylates potentially exacerbate eczema, we must first grasp what happens during a flare-up. Essentially, inflammation develops in the layers of your skin due to an overly active immune system caused by various elements such as environmental allergens, irritants, and particular substances. Those sensitive to these compounds will likely notice heightened severity when unknowingly ingesting rich sources. The reactions occur when our body misidentifies a harmless substance (in this context, a plant-based compound) as something harmful, thus releasing inflammatory markers. This leads to a chain of events with visible

However, the consensus is that keratosis pilaris is caused by a buildup of keratin on the skin. Normal skin sloughs off dead cells, reducing excess keratin on the skin’s surface. In those affected with keratosis pilaris, excess keratin can clog hair follicles, contributing to bumpy patches and pustules. Research published in the _International Journal of Trichology_ suggests that keratosis pilaris may be linked to defective hair shaft
