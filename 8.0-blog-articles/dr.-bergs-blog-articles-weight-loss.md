## How to Cure Plantar Fasciitis in One Week While stretching is one of the most effective methods to get rid of plantar fasciitis, you need to perform the correct stretches to avoid further injury to the plantar fascia. Standard stretching of the plantar fascia and calf often falls short of quick relief, but with the right technique, you can significantly ease plantar fasciitis within a week. ## **What is plantar fasciitis?** Plantar fasciitis is a condition involving inflammation of the plantar fascia ligament, which is the sheath of connective tissue that connects the heel bone to the toes. The plantar fascia acts as a shock absorber and plays an important role in providing arch support. Plantar fasciitis is one of the most common causes of heel pain. ## **What causes plantar fasciitis?** Any activity that causes too much stress and tension to the plantar fascia can cause microtears in this tissue. Repetitive tearing can lead to irritation, pain, and inflammation of the plantar fascia, resulting in plantar fasciitis. The following risk factors can increase your chances of developing plantar fasciitis: \* Jobs that require long hours of walking or standing \* Obesity and excess weight \* Poor posture and foot mechanics \* Aging \* Poor dietary habits \* A tight calf muscle \* Achilles tendon tightness \* [Elevated uric acid](https://www.drberg.com/blog/7-tips-to-lower-uric-acid) \* Long-distance running According to research published in _The Journal of Bone & Joint Surgery_, reduced ankle dorsiflexion, obesity, and work-related weight-bearing were the most important risk factors for plantar fasciitis.1 ![plantar fascia](https://www.drberg.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/illustration-anatomy-foot-symptoms-plantar-fasciitis.jpg?resize=1024,695) ## **What are the symptoms of plantar fasciitis?** The most common symptom of plantar fasciitis is foot pain, typically in the heel, but it can also extend up through the bottom of the foot.

## Colloidal Silver for Pink Eye – Conjunctivitis Remedy Colloidal silver has potent antimicrobial and anti-inflammatory properties and has been used as antibiotic eye drops to treat pink eye for over 100 years. Using colloidal silver for pink eye is an effective remedy to help reduce inflammation, irritation, and swelling in the affected eye. Learn how to use colloidal silver to manage viral or bacterial infection and discover why it’s one of the best home remedies for pink eye relief. ## **What is pink eye?** Pink eye, or conjunctivitis, is an inflammation of the conjunctiva, the thin membrane that covers the inside of the eyelids and the white part of the eyeball. Pink eye can have several causes, including: \* Viral infection: Viral conjunctivitis is typically linked to adenovirus, a viral strain associated with the [common cold](https://www.drberg.com/blog/how-to-stop-a-cold-at-the-first-sign-with). Viral pink eye is highly contagious and can easily spread through touching contaminated surfaces and close contact with an infected person. \* Bacterial infection: Bacterial conjunctivitis is caused by bacterial strains, such as Staphylococcus aureus or Streptococcus pneumoniae, and typically spreads through contact with infected hands, contact lenses, or eye makeup. \* Allergic reaction: Allergic pink eye is often caused by exposure to allergens, such as pollen, dust mites, pet dander, or certain chemicals that can accumulate in the body. While most cases of pink eye are triggered by a bacterial or viral infection, individuals with a weakened immune system and those with seasonal allergies are at increased risk of allergic conjunctivitis. ### **Symptoms of pink eye** When the conjunctiva becomes inflamed, the small blood vessels in the eye become dilated, which causes the characteristic pink or reddish color in the infected eye. Here are common symptoms of pink eye: \* Redness in the white of the eye \* Blurred vision \* \[Swollen and inflamed

## Is Pantene Good for Your Hair? Find the Best Shampoo Pantene hair products are amongst the most popular shampoos and conditioners. However, Pantene shampoo contains several harsh chemicals–including sulfates and benzyl alcohol–that can lead to damaged hair and may even cause hair loss in some people. So is Pantene good for your hair? Let’s look at what kind of shampoo is best for healthy hair and which harmful chemicals you should avoid to prevent scalp irritation and hair breakage. [![biotin shampoo dr. berg](https://www.drberg.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/biotin-shampoo.jpg?w=800)](https://shop.drberg.com/products/biotin-shampoo-new-and-improved-8-fl-oz) ## **How bad is Pantene for your hair?** Pantene hair care products may work for some people, but they contain several potentially harmful ingredients that can cause significant hair damage and have been linked to various skin conditions, including dandruff, dermatitis, and acne. How bad Pantene is for your hair depends on your particular type of hair, your hair care routine, and whether you have colored or chemically treated hair. While Pantene products are marketed as beneficial for all hair types, the harsh chemicals in Pantene’s shampoos aren’t suitable for fine hair, curly and textured hair, or color-treated hair. Many Pantene shampoos contain silicone which coats your hair shafts to make the hair appear shiny and smooth. However, silicone can build up and lead to clogged hair follicles, [a common cause of hair loss](https://www.drberg.com/blog/the-most-common-cause-of-hair-loss) and scalp skin issues. Other problematic ingredients in Pantene products are sulfates, including sodium lauryl sulfate and sodium laureth sulfate. These synthetic compounds are used as foaming agents and strip your hair and scalp of natural oils, which can cause dry, brittle hair that’s prone to breakage. Some people reported that using Pantene made their hair fall out and that switching to sulfate-free shampoo improved hair

## The Strongest Candida Killer You're Not Using While _Candida_ is a naturally occurring yeast in the body, several factors can cause it to proliferate and grow out of control. This can lead to various health issues, including digestive problems, weight gain, skin irritations, and oral infections. Discover the symptoms and causes of yeast infections and learn about the strongest _Candida_ killer. ![Young woman holding Candida sign](https://www.drberg.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/menstrual-vaginal-urinary-problems-young-woman.jpg?w=800) ## **What is Candida?** _Candida_ is a genus of yeast that falls under the broader category of fungi. It includes many species that naturally live in the human body but can turn pathogenic under certain conditions. Yeasts such as _Candida_ can become problematic when disruptions in the body’s natural environment, such as changes in pH, an imbalanced microbiome, or weakened immune responses, allow it to grow disproportionately. There are over 150 different strains of _Candida_, some more infectious than others. One of the most common strains is _Candida albicans_, which is responsible for most yeast infections in humans. Excessive _Candida_ growth in the digestive tract is generally called _Candida_ overgrowth. Oral thrush refers to fungal infection in the mouth, and a vaginal yeast infection is characterized by _Candida_ overgrowth in the female reproductive system. Other strains of _Candida_, such as _Candida glabrata_ and _Candida auris_, can cause infections affecting the bloodstream. This can lead to invasive candidiasis, which may impact organ functions and lead to critical health complications. _Candida auris_ is a particularly concerning strain due to its resistance to prescription antifungal treatments and its tendency to cause outbreaks in healthcare facilities. [Research](https://www.mdpi.com/2076-2607/12/5/927) published in _Microorganisms_ highlights the potential seriousness of these infections, stating, \_“This

## Fix Abdominal Gas and Bloating: A Quick Guide If you’ve been experiencing abdominal gas and bloating, you’re **not** the only one. This is a huge problem for _many_ Americans. It may be one of the more uncomfortable topics to talk about but, while bloating and excessive gas might not make for great small talk or dinner conversation, it should be talked about more.

## Fibromyalgia Symptoms and What They Really Mean Dealing with fibromyalgia symptoms is very difficult, so figuring out what could be causing it is helpful for people struggling with this problem. Learn about the connection between [gallbladder health](https://www.drberg.com/blog/dr-bergs-gallbladder-formula) about fibromyalgia as well as possible solutions. ## **Understanding Fibromyalgia and Its Surprising Cause** Fibromyalgia, a condition often characterized by chronic widespread pain, has puzzled medical professionals for years. While many theories have been proposed, one has not been universally adopted. ### **The Connection Between Fibromyalgia and Gallbladder Congestion** While many overlook the gallbladder’s role in fibromyalgia, there are compelling reasons to look further into this connection. Diagnosing fibromyalgia typically involves identifying specific symptoms such as fatigue or cognitive difficulties alongside persistent pain. [Gallbladders](https://www.drberg.com/blog/gallbladder-the-most-ignored-organ) are rarely considered during this process. #### **Bile Acids Secreted By The Gall Bladder And Their Role In Pain Management** An essential function of your gall bladder includes secreting bile acids, which help digest fats from food consumed. Your gut bacteria then metabolize these primary bile acids into secondary ones. Dysfunctioning here can lead to issues that may influence chronic pain patterns seen in conditions similar to what’s observed among some ‘fibromyalgia’ patients. ![Gallstones symptom](https://www.drberg.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/gallbladder-on-womans-body-stone-01.jpg?w=800) ## **Identifying Gallbladder Issues As Potential Causes Of Pain** Suppose you’re experiencing chronic widespread pain, particularly on the right side of your body or in upper regions like your shoulder or neck.

## Omega 3 Benefits: 5 Ways They Boost Your Health Omega-3 fatty acids are vital for supporting brain, heart, and cellular health and play a crucial role in regulating moods and the body’s inflammatory pathways. As modern diets rely more on processed foods, many people don’t consume adequate amounts of omega-3 fats, increasing the risk of chronic inflammation, cardiovascular issues, metabolic imbalances, and cognitive decline. Discover five powerful omega-3 benefits for your health and explore the best natural food sources of these essential fatty acids. ## **What are omega-3 fatty acids?** Omega-3 fatty acids are polyunsaturated fats crucial for various bodily functions, especially within the [nervous system](https://www.drberg.com/blog/what-is-the-nervous-system), where they play a vital role in brain health and protecting nerve cells from oxidative stress. Omega-3 fats also aid energy production by maintaining cell membrane fluidity and supporting efficient cellular communication. Additionally, these fats support hormonal balance, enhance immune function, reduce inflammation, and help maintain a healthy lipid profile. There are three primary types of omega-3 fatty acids: \* Docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) \* Eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) \* Alpha-linolenic acid (ALA) DHA is a crucial structural component of the brain and eyes, supporting cognitive functions, including memory and visual processing. It also plays a key role in fetal development and early childhood growth. EPA is known for its potent anti-inflammatory effects and supports cardiovascular health by aiding balanced triglyceride levels and promoting healthy blood circulation. ALA is a precursor to EPA and DHA. However, due to the body’s limited conversion rate of just 0.1 to 0.5 percent, it primarily acts as an antioxidant and supports heart health by supporting healthy [cholesterol levels](https://www.drberg.com/blog/does-fish-oil-lower-cholesterol).

Let’s explore nine proven turmeric benefits and discover how to incorporate this health-promoting spice into your daily routine. ## **What are turmeric and curcumin?** Turmeric is a root vegetable that belongs to the ginger family _Zingiberaceae_. Turmeric contains curcumin, a polyphenol that gives this spice its distinct yellow color and medicinal properties. [Research](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5664031/) published in _Foods_ suggests that curcumin has benefits _“In the management of oxidative and inflammatory conditions, metabolic syndrome, arthritis, anxiety, and hyperlipidemia.”_ Furthermore, curcumin has potent antioxidant properties and can help neutralize free radicals, which are linked to cellular damage, inflammation, premature aging, and various chronic diseases.

## Red Meat Benefits and Disadvantages for Health To fuel or not to fuel? That is the burning question for health enthusiasts as conflicting evidence emerges on the role of red meat in our diets. Advocates propose that moderate indulgence in steak or pork chops might even confer certain health benefits, while commentators note increased susceptibility to illnesses. As we navigate these conflicting stakes, it’s crucial to educate ourselves and sort through the sensationalism from fact. In this article, we’ll take a closer look at the potential benefits and risks associated with red meat consumption, examining the latest scientific evidence and expert opinions. By the end of this post, you’ll have a better understanding of whether red meat is good or bad for your health and how to incorporate it into your diet in a way that supports your overall well-being. ## **The Controversy Surrounding Red Meat Consumption** The debate about whether red meat is good or bad for health has been ongoing for years. While some studies suggest that consuming red meat may increase the risk of certain diseases, others have found no significant link. This conflicting evidence has led to a great deal of confusion among consumers and healthcare professionals alike. One of the main issues with many observational studies on red meat consumption is that they often fail to distinguish between different types of red meat. Processed meats, [such as bacon](https://www.drberg.com/blog/how-to-find-the-right-bacon), sausages, and deli meats, are often lumped together with unprocessed, organic grass-fed beef. However, these two categories of red meat can have vastly different effects on health. ### **Processed vs. Organic Grass-Fed Red Meat** Processed meats are typically high in sodium, nitrates, and other additives that have been linked to negative health outcomes. These meats are often made from lower-quality cuts of meat and may come from animals raised in less-than-ideal conditions. In contrast,

## Apple Cider Vinegar vs White Vinegar Explained Apple cider vinegar vs. white vinegar–what are their health benefits, and which one is better? With its myriad of applications for cooking, cleaning, and even as natural remedies, it’s no wonder that different types of vinegars have been a worldwide staple for millennia. Discover the benefits of apple cider vinegar and white vinegar, and learn how you can use vinegar to improve your health and well-being. ## **What is white vinegar?** Vinegar production begins with a fermentable carbohydrate, usually a fruit or starch. During fermentation, sugars are transformed into alcohol, which is subsequently converted into acetic acid by acetic acid bacteria, creating vinegar. White vinegar, also called spirit vinegar, is made by fermenting grain alcohol, typically derived from barley, corn, or wheat. After fermentation, white vinegar is filtered to remove impurities and sediment, achieving its distinct clear and transparent appearance, which is ideal for cleaning applications where a non-staining solution is preferred. Distilled white vinegar is the most popular and widely available version of vinegar due to its versatility in cooking, cleaning, and other household uses. The distillation process helps raise vinegar’s acetic acid content and removes residual bacteria and enzymes. This makes white vinegar more shelf-stable and ensures a neutral flavor and high level of purity. Distilled white vinegar tends to have an acetic acid content of up to 20 percent. Manufacturers typically dilute vinegar to lower acetic acid concentrations to between 5 and 8 percent to make it less corrosive and more suitable for everyday use. ### **White vinegar nutrition facts** Here are the main nutrition facts for one tablespoon of white distilled vinegar. \* 3 calories \* 0 g protein \* 0 g fat \* 0 g carbohydrates In addition, white vinegar contains acetic acid and trace amounts of calcium, magnesium,

Discover the difference between plant-based and animal meat and explore the best vegetarian protein options. ## **What is plant-based meat?** Plant-based meat, or plant-based meat analogs (PBMAs), serve as substitutes for traditional meats such as pork, beef, and poultry. Fake meats are manufactured to achieve a similar appearance, texture, mouthfeel, and taste to real meats, including bacon, meatballs, burger patties, chicken filets, and ground beef.

Imagine every gram of carbohydrate dragging along roughly three grams of water–that’s quite the unwanted entourage for anyone watching their figure or trying to manage calorie intake. ### **The Sodium-Potassium Imbalance** Sodium loves company, but too much salt without its pal potassium is like throwing a party without inviting half the guests–the balance is off, leading to uncomfortable swelling. Think twice before reaching for that salt shaker because even if you’re dealing with swollen ankles now, reducing sodium could help give them a break. ## **When the Body’s Proteins Fall Short** Picture this: Your body’s like a bustling city, and proteins are its workers,

## How Does Monolaurin Kill Viruses? Full Breakdown Coconut oil contains monolaurin, which has been linked to potent antiviral and antifungal effects. But how does monolaurin kill viruses, bacteria, and fungi? Discover how monolaurin can inhibit the growth and replication of microbes and learn how to use it to lower the risk of infections. ## **What is monolaurin?** Monolaurin is a naturally occurring compound that belongs to a class of chemicals known as monoglycerides. It’s derived from lauric acid, a medium-chain fatty acid found abundantly in coconut oil and human breast milk. _“Certain fatty acids and monoglycerides, including lauric acid and monolaurin, are powerful antimicrobial agents,”_ explains Dr. Berg\_. “Virgin coconut oil has been used as a medicinal food to manage and prevent viral and bacterial infections for hundreds of years.”\_ In addition, monolaurin is a natural preservative that can play a role in food safety. Because of its antibacterial and antifungal properties, monolaurin inhibits the growth of certain microbes linked to foodborne illnesses. Watch the video below to learn why monolaurin is one of the best remedies for viral infections.## **How does monolaurin work?** Monolaurin is classified as a monoglyceride, a simple lipid that readily attaches to other lipid structures, including the membrane surrounding viruses. By binding to lipid-enveloped viruses, monolaurin directly inhibits the normal functioning of viral particles. This disruption can prevent the virus from entering host cells and replicating, ultimately inhibiting its ability to spread and cause infection. In addition, monolaurin has been found to enhance the immune response against enveloped RNA and DNA viruses. These types of viruses are responsible for various infectious diseases, including respiratory infections, sexually transmitted diseases, hepatitis, and some types of

## What Is a Lymph Node? Hidden Role in Immunity You’re probably aware of lymph nodes, and perhaps know that they get swollen when you feel ill. But I bet you didn’t know that lymph nodes are an essential part of your immune system. ![close up of a swollen lymph node on a boy's neck](https://www.drberg.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/blog-what-is-a-lymph-node-1.jpg?w=800) \* \* \* In this article, I’ll cover: \* **An overview of the** [**lymphatic system**](https://www.drberg.com/blog/what-is-the-lymphatic-system)**,** **including how the lymph nodes within it fit in to your immune system** \* **The lymph node’s purpose** \* **An explanation of the immune cells that are contained within a lymph node** \* **What kinds of things can damage your lymph system and, thus, your immune system** I know it sounds technical, but bear with me. I’ll keep it basic, and you’ll be glad you discovered this information that’s vital to your health. ## An Overview Of the Lymphatic System Let’s start with the lymphatic system, which is an extension of your [circulatory system](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK279250/). Blood flows through your body to your tissues, where some of it is converted into lymph, a colorless fluid containing white blood cells. Lymph then flows through your lymphatic system. Unlike your circulatory system, your lymphatic system doesn’t have its own pump. Instead, muscular movement causes lymph to circulate through your body, and back into your circulatory system. Part of the lymphatic system’s function is to serve as a backup drainage system to prevent fluid buildup in your body. This accumulation of fluid is called [lymphedema](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/lymphedema/symptoms-causes/syc-20374682). But the lymphatic system’s major and most important function is the activation of your immune system, a complex network of cells and proteins that defends your body against infection. If your body

## The Best Remedies to Use When You’re Sick The Best Remedies to Use When Youre Sick Have you ever considered how making just a few minor tweaks could seriously boost your well-being? It’s not about drastic overhauls or intense regimes. Often, those small, everyday actions we stick to end up piling into something big and impactful in our lives. This piece is about tiny tweaks that can pave the way for a healthier you. ## **Understanding Infections: Viral vs. Bacterial** Knowing the difference between viral and bacterial infections is crucial for proper treatment. While both can cause similar symptoms, their distinct characteristics set them apart. Let’s look at how to tell them apart and what you can do to find relief. ### **Symptoms of Viral Infections** Viral infections often come with a host of body-wide symptoms. Think fatigue, muscle aches, chills, and a runny nose. These symptoms are your body’s way of fighting off the virus. While a fever is familiar with viral and bacterial infections, viral fevers tend to be lower grade. And if you have a sore throat, it’s usually accompanied by that telltale runny nose. ### **Recognizing Bacterial Infections** Bacterial infections, on the other hand, tend to cause more localized symptoms. Often, the pain zeroes in on a specific spot – maybe it’s your ear that’s throbbing, your throat that feels like you’ve swallowed sandpaper or your tight chest. Fevers also run higher with bacterial infections. A severe, painful throat without a runny nose is a red flag for a bacterial infection like strep throat. So, if your symptoms are more focused and intense, it’s likely bacterial. ## **Natural Remedies for Viral Infections** While there’s no cure for viral infections, there are natural ways to support your immune system and ease symptoms. Elderberry and olive leaf extract are powerful allies in your fight against viruses. ### **Elderberry’s Role in Immune Support**

You can make a potent natural antibiotic drink with these seven ingredients: \* Garlic \* Ginger \* Turmeric \* Apple cider vinegar \* Lemon \* Manuka honey \* Extra virgin olive oil Research published in _Antibiotics_ confirms that these foods contain various phytochemicals with potent antimicrobial properties, making them some of the best natural antibiotics you can use against bacteria and other germs.1 Prescribed antibiotics can have significant side effects, including weight gain, [diarrhea](https://www.drberg.com/blog/how-to-stop-diarrhea), skin rashes, and nausea. They also contribute to the rise of antibiotic-resistant bacteria, a serious issue for healthcare providers worldwide. Chemical antibiotics target all types of bacteria, including the beneficial microbes that populate your digestive tract, which can weaken your immune defenses, leaving you more susceptible to bacterial and yeast infections. In contrast, natural antibacterials can protect you from infectious diseases without the risk of side effects, antibiotic resistance, impaired immune function, or a loss of beneficial gut bacteria. However, it’s important to remember that microbial infections can have serious health consequences. It’s crucial to consult with your healthcare

## Irritable Male Syndrome: Surprising Truth Irritable male syndrome affects predominantly middle-aged men and is characterized by emotional and physical changes such as mood swings, depression, low libido, and lack of energy. This common condition is linked to age-related decline in testosterone levels, and understanding irritable male syndrome and its causes can help develop effective management strategies. Discover the signs and symptoms of irritable male syndrome and learn how to support balanced hormone levels naturally. Irritable male syndrome (IMS) describes a range of physical, emotional, and behavioral symptoms that commonly emerge in aging men. IMS is often a consequence of age-related hormonal fluctuations in testosterone production, known as andropause or male menopause, that can be exacerbated by lifestyle factors such as stress, alcohol consumption, and nutritional deficiencies. Testosterone plays a critical role in male health by supporting muscle mass, bone density, mood stability, energy levels, and sexual function. Its decline often impacts overall physical and mental well-being. While IMS isn’t an officially recognized medical condition and may not be widely understood among healthcare providers, it can significantly impact mental and physical health. Research published in the _International Journal of Clinical Practice_ found that almost 40 percent of men aged 45 and older have declining testosterone levels.1 The researchers also reported a strong association between low testosterone and metabolic health, noting that men with risk factors such as obesity, high blood pressure, and elevated cholesterol were significantly more likely to have low testosterone. Because IMS remains relatively under-researched and poorly understood, many men may overlook the signs of low testosterone or dismiss them as a natural part of aging, leaving a large portion of the male population more vulnerable to its effects. However,

## Top Natural Prednisone Alternatives for Relief Prednisone is a corticosteroid medication used to treat inflammation-related health issues. It works by blocking inflammatory pathways in the body, which helps manage symptoms such as pain, rashes, swelling, and redness. However, this prescription drug has serious side effects, and long-term prednisone users are at risk of a weakened immune function, osteoporosis, high blood pressure, and significant weight gain. Discover the downsides of prednisone and find out about natural prednisone alternatives that help lower inflammation without the risk of severe side effects. ![Prednisone pill bottle](https://www.drberg.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/prednisone-corticosteroid-inflammation-immune-disorders-disorder-234.jpg?w=800) ## **What is prednisone?** Prednisone belongs to a class of prescription anti-inflammatory medications called corticosteroids, widely known as [steroid drugs](https://www.drberg.com/blog/steroid-drugs-double-edged-sword?srsltid=AfmBOoo1iQcfj5NP-pru9XJoJR5SsmMjPqbsKSttyEYV-w2ObVn4KOFA). Although inflammation is the body’s response to injury and foreign invaders, chronic inflammation can lead to cellular damage and long-term health issues. The human body relies on cortisol, a steroid hormone, to regulate inflammation. However, natural cortisol production may not be sufficient to control excessive inflammation. Steroids help reduce symptoms related to persistent and unresolved inflammation, such as pain, redness, and swelling. They also suppress immune system functions, which is why they’re often prescribed to individuals with autoimmune diseases. Prednisone essentially replaces the body’s natural cortisol, providing a stronger anti-inflammatory effect to help manage persistent inflammation. Prednisone is used to treat a variety of inflammatory diseases, including: \* Asthma \* Allergic reactions \* Autoimmune conditions \* Blood and bone marrow disorders \* Crohn’s disease \* \[Inflammatory bowel disease

## What Are the First Signs of Kidney Disease? The kidneys filter toxins and metabolic by-products from the blood, and reduced kidney function can lead to poor health and chronic disease. But what are the first signs of kidney disease? Early signs of kidney disease can include ammonia breath, meat aversion, nausea, and vomiting. Other symptoms, such as poor concentration, itchiness, loss of appetite, and water retention, may also occur. Discover the common causes of kidney disease and associated symptoms, and learn how to support kidney health naturally. ## **What are the first signs of kidney disease?** Poor kidney function can manifest in several early warning signs. However, kidney disease may share symptoms with other conditions, such as urinary tract infections, kidney stones, or an enlarged prostate. Therefore, it’s crucial to consult a healthcare provider if you suspect kidney issues. A thorough evaluation, including blood tests, urine analysis, and imaging studies, can help determine the underlying cause of your symptoms. Here are six symptoms of kidney disease. ### **1. Metallic taste or ammonia breath** Breath that smells like ammonia, which is similar to rotten fish or urine, can indicate that the kidneys aren’t functioning well enough to detoxify and eliminate waste products from the body. _“The kidneys are filter organs, and when they aren’t functioning properly, waste products build up in the blood,”_ explains Dr. Berg. _“This can lead to ammonia breath or a metallic taste known as uremia.”_ ### **2. Poor concentration** Chronic kidney disease (CKD) has been linked to an increased risk of red blood cell disorders, including anemia, which is characterized by a decrease in the number of red blood cells or hemoglobin levels in the blood. Insufficient red blood cells hinder the effective transport of oxygen to the body’s tissues, including the brain. This oxygen deficiency can result in symptoms such as weakness, fatigue, and difficulty concentrating.

## Chronic Kidney Disease: Warning Signs, Causes, and Remedies The kidneys are one of the body’s primary toxin and waste removal organs, helping to filter water, salts, urea, and other metabolic by-products from the blood. Chronic kidney disease is characterized by a gradual loss of kidney function, often resulting in symptoms such as ammonia-like breath and aversion to protein-rich foods. Discover the early warning signs of chronic kidney disease and learn how to support kidney health naturally to reduce your risk of impaired renal function. ## **What is chronic kidney disease?** The kidneys are critical organs with four primary functions: removing waste through urine, maintaining the body’s electrolyte and fluid balance, regulating blood pressure, and stimulating the production of red blood cells. Chronic kidney disease (CKD) impairs normal kidney function and compromises their filter capacity, thereby preventing effective waste and fluid removal from the blood. CKD is categorized into several stages depending on severity: \* Stage 1 \* Stage 2 \* Stage 3a and 3b \* Stage 4 \* Stage 5 According to the National Kidney Foundation, stage 1 and stage 2 CKD are characterized by mildly reduced function and kidney damage, such as recurring urinary tract infections (UTIs), for three months or longer.1 Stages 3a and 3b of CKD refer to moderate to severe kidney impairment with noticeable symptoms such as [fatigue](https://www.drberg.com/blog/the-underlying-cause-of-your-fatigue), swelling, and nausea. Stage 4 CKD is evidenced by a significant decline in renal function and health complications. Stage 5 CKD, or end-stage renal disease, can lead to kidney failure and requires dialysis treatment or a kidney transplant. If left untreated, stage 5 CKD is typically fatal within months to years.

I’m going to cover **three different home remedies** that will help with asthma symptoms including asthma attacks. **In this article:** 1. **What is Asthma?** 2. **The Three Best Remedies for Asthma** 3. **Why Not Give them a Try?** ![Woman with asthma using an inhaler while working | Best Asthma Remedies](https://www.drberg.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/blog-best-asthma-remedies-1.jpg?w=800) \* \* \* ## **What is Asthma?** If you’ve had an asthma attack before, you know it’s _not_ pleasant. What happens is the airway becomes narrow, swollen, and inflamed. This makes it difficult to inhale and causes wheezing. These asthma symptoms can _completely_ derail your day. In some cases, the inability to inhale properly can even cause you to end up in the hospital. That’s no fun at all. Now, the go-to solution for asthma relief is to start using asthma medications to relax the airways. Things like asthma inhalers are commonly used. However, asthma inhalers can sometimes cause asthma symptoms to worsen in the long run by making episodes more frequent. Even more, there are side effects that can come along with using an inhaler–acne, weight gain, and mood changes just to name a few. So what we’re going to talk about are the best asthma home remedies to help **support healthy breathing** and prevent things like asthma attacks. Keep in mind that these aren’t “cures” for asthma, these are just the best asthma remedies which will help support healthy breathing. If you’re on asthma medications such as inhalers, you’ll want to keep using those until your doctor says otherwise. However, I wouldn’t be surprised if your doctor lowers your dosage if your asthma improves using these remedies. Let’s take a look at three of the best asthma remedies. !\[Woman

## What Is Lard? Health Benefits and Risks Explained What is lard, and does it have any benefits or carry risks for cardiovascular functions? Pure lard is pig fat that is rendered and purified, often used in cooking for its high smoke point and rich taste and texture. Discover why lard isn’t as harmful as you might think, and learn how to incorporate this fat into your diet without compromising heart health. ## **What is lard made out of?** Pure lard is a cooking fat derived from pig fat. With a high smoke point and a mild flavor, it’s an ideal choice for cooking. Before Crisco vegetable shortening was introduced, home cooks relied on lard or tallow as their primary cooking fats, using them for everything from baking to deep frying. At the time, lard was widely used and not viewed as an unhealthy ingredient. You can typically find several types of lard at your local butcher, farmer’s market, or grocery store. ### **Rendered lard** Most lard is produced through a process called rendering, where pork fat is slowly cooked to separate it from the meat. This results in a semi-soft fat perfect for baking, frying, and various other cooking methods. ### **Unrendered lard** Unrendered lard, also known as raw lard, is pig fat that has not yet been processed or cooked to separate it from the meat. It’s typically solid and requires rendering before it can be used in cooking or baking. ### **Processed lard** Processed lard has been rendered, purified, and often refined to remove impurities and any strong odors. It may also be bleached and deodorized, which extends its shelf life and enhances its versatility for cooking and longer storage. ### **Leaf lard** Leaf lard comes from the leaf-shaped fat surrounding a pig’s kidneys. It’s exceptionally soft, creamy, and mild in flavor, making it ideal for baking. Leaf lard is considered the highest quality lard available. If you’d prefer not to purchase lard, you can easily make your own at home. Simply cut pork fat into small pieces,

## Acetic Acid: Food Sources and Benefits Acetic acid is a versatile and health-promoting organic acid. It’s the main component of apple cider vinegar, frequently used as a natural preservative, and can even disinfect bathrooms and kitchens. Acetic acid has been used as a natural remedy for various ailments, including cough, digestive issues, and infections, for more than 5000 years. Let’s look at the health benefits of acetic acid and find out why you should consume apple cider vinegar regularly. ## **What is acetic acid?** Acetic acid, also known as ethanoic acid, is an organic acid found naturally in apples, grapes, and blackberries. It can also be produced by bacterial fermentation of sugars and starches. Undiluted acetic acid, called glacial acetic acid, is highly corrosive and isn’t usually found in food or household products. This form of acetic acid is used to produce cellulose acetate, polyvinyl acetate, and vinyl acetate monomer, chemical compounds needed to manufacture plastic, paint, and solvents. Diluting acetic acid with water creates vinegar, and most vinegar contains around 4 to 8 percent of acetic acid. Acetic acid vinegar is considered a weak acid that inhibits bacterial growth, making it an ideal pickling agent and preservative. It’s often used in combination with other food additives–including citric acid and acetate salts–to prolong the shelf life of food products. ![Vegetable pickles](https://www.drberg.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/preserves-vegetables-in-glass-jars-in-an-old-box-on-the-black-chalkboard.jpg?resize=1024,683) ## **Sources of acetic acid** Acetic acid is the main organic acid in vinegar and is responsible for vinegar’s pungent smell and tart taste.

## Colon Cleanse Fact or Fiction – 5 to 20 lbs of Toxic Poop? Certain colon cleanse providers claim that adults can have between 5 and 20 pounds of toxic poop in their gut, supposedly causing issues such as weight gain, fatigue, and brain fog. However, scientific evidence doesn’t support this myth, as the body’s natural detoxification and elimination processes effectively manage waste without the need for extreme cleansing. Discover the steps you can take to support healthy bowel movements and explore how making beneficial dietary and lifestyle changes can significantly improve your gut health. ## **Do you have 5 to 20 pounds of toxic poop in your colon?** Advocates of colon cleanses often warn about the dangers of toxic poop, with some claiming that people can have as much as 20 pounds of stool backed up in their colon. While some individuals experience sluggish digestion or constipation, the reality is that most people don’t retain such a large amount of stool. On average, most people eliminate about 14 to 16 ounces of stool daily, making an accumulation of 20 pounds very unlikely. Even in individuals with [constipation](https://www.drberg.com/blog/constipation-remedies) or poor dietary habits, it’s highly unlikely that such a significant buildup of stool accumulates in the colon. However, in some cases, those with severe constipation or certain medical conditions may experience impacted stool. This can lead to significant discomfort and poor waste removal, affecting detoxification pathways and overall well-being. Watch the video below to learn why it’s unlikely you have 5 to 20 pounds of toxic poop.## **What is toxic poop?** Toxic poop or toxic waste are terms often used to describe fecal matter that has accumulated and impacted along the colon walls. While it’s rare for healthy individuals to accumulate 5 to 20 pounds of waste in the colon, certain inflammatory
