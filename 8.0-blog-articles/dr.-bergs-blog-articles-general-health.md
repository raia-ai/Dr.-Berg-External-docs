## Our 75 Soft Challenge: Build a Healthier Lifestyle, Day by Day Are you looking to make lasting changes to your health and well-being without the overwhelming pressure of extreme fitness regimens and fad diets? Our 75 soft challenge is a balanced approach to building healthy habits, focusing on food quality, consistency, and gradual progress rather than rigid discipline. Here’s how to get started improving your mental and physical health over the course of 75 days. ## **What is the 75 soft challenge?** The 75 soft challenge is a health and fitness program that promises to build healthy lifestyle habits by following a manageable daily routine for 75 days, at which point these habits are expected to become ingrained and lasting. There are various versions of this soft health and fitness challenge, all of which emphasize adopting a healthy diet, implementing a sustainable fitness routine, and improving mental well-being. This 75-day plan for achieving a healthy routine is a gentler alternative to other extreme viral fitness trends, such as the 75 hard challenge, which requires strict adherence to intense workouts and uncompromising discipline without any breaks. The core aspects of a 75 soft challenge include: \* Eat well and only drink alcohol on social occasions \* Train for 45 minutes every day, with one day a week for active recovery \* Drink three liters of water a day \* Read ten pages of any book a day While this self-improvement program aims to help you feel healthier without the overwhelming demands of rigid eating plans or punishing workout regimens, fitness and nutrition experts have raised concerns about potential shortcomings. The 75 soft challenge promotes healthy eating but lacks guidance on the importance of organic produce or a comprehensive focus on the nutritional quality of the foods consumed, which could impact long-term health outcomes. Additionally, the exercise requirements may not be suitable for those with busy schedules, and the hydration

## Vegan Everything Bagels - Dr. Berg \* Preheat the oven to 375 °F. \* In a large bowl, whisk together the 1 cup almond flour, 2 tablespoons coconut flour, 1 teaspoon sea salt, and ½ teaspoon xanthan gum. \* Heat 1/2 cup filtered water to 105-110 °F. Add 1 teaspoon FiberYum. Add 2 teaspoons yeast and let stand for 10 minutes. The yeast should bubble or foam, but because of the psyllium husk and chia (acting as thickeners), this is not mandatory for the recipe to work. \* Stir 1 tablespoon chia seed and 1 tablespoon psyllium husk powder into the yeast mixture. Let stand 1 minute to thicken, then whisk. \* Pour thickened yeast-chia mixture into the dry ingredients, knead until thick and fully combined. Wet your hands if the dough is too sticky. \* Divide dough into 4 portions. Press the dough into your bagel molds. \* Place the silicone bagel molds on a sheet tray. Bake for 35-40 minutes. \* With a spray bottle, mist the top of the bagels and sprinkle everything bagel seasoning on it. Serve with non-GMO vegan cream cheese! Did you know that Dr. Berg’s Healthiest Bread in the World Recipe is also vegan friendly? We used his recipe for these vegan bagels. Since we can’t use an egg wash, we used a spray bottle to mist the top of the bagels to make the everything bagel spice stick! We also used non-GMO vegan cream cheese!

## ADHD Nutrition: Natural Ways to Improve Focus Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) diagnoses are becoming more and more common in children. But are all of these diagnoses really necessary? And are medications the only answer? Or might it be more important to look at ADHD nutrition for the answer? In this article, I explain why **it is so important to look at the diet when it comes to hyperactivity and other behaviors of ADHD.** I also discuss some simple steps you can take to help your child find more balance and calm. In this article: 1. **The ADHD diagnosis hoax** 2. **The link between ADHD and nutrition** 3. **5 Dietary changes that can help ADHD symptoms** 4. **The bottom line on ADHD and nutrition** ![ADHD written on a piece of paper with colored crayons | ADHD Is a Nutritional Problem, Not a Mental One](https://www.drberg.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/blog-adhd-is-a-nutritional-problem-not-a-mental-one-1.jpg?w=800) \* \* \* ## **The ADHD diagnosis hoax** First, let’s talk about how attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is diagnosed in children. In my opinion, these ADHD diagnoses in young kids are a real scam. As you’ll see below, the “symptoms” that are included in ADHD diagnosis are really just normal behaviors for most children. Here is how they would diagnose ADHD in a second grader. \* Has trouble getting started on tasks (getting dressed, putting away toys, etc.). \* Ignores directions or delays following directions. \* Has a hard time sitting during meals. \* Fidgets and talks when expected to be quiet. \* Has trouble stopping one activity to begin another. \* Struggles to slow down enough to do things carefully. \* Needs to be reminded a lot to stop and listen. \* Has a harder time paying attention. \* Grabs things without permission. \* Is unable to wait for directions. \* Takes too much time to complete tasks. \* Has trouble recalling facts they just learned. \* Gets upset or annoyed

## Healthiest Pizza: Enjoy Pizza the Healthy Way This recipe is a slightly tweaked version of the original. To make the crust taste almost identical to an actual pizza, you need a pizza stone. This provides the heat necessary to make the crust non-soggy and quite amazing. The other mistake people make is not pre-baking the crust. You want to first cook the crust for 15 minutes, then take it out, apply the toppings, then re-bake. You’ll end up with a very amazingly delicious pizza. **Ingredients:** _2 cups finely grated cauliflower_ _2 cups shaved mozzarella cheese plus extra for topping (I use a pre-shaved organic brand.)_ _2 large eggs_ _tomato sauce (Keep sugars below 2 grams.)_ _toppings of your choice (I like mushrooms, fresh tomato slices, pepperoni, olives, and fresh basil.)_ **Kitchen Equipment:** _Cheese grater_ _Parchment paper_ _Round pizza pan with a lip or better yet – a pizza stone_ ![Pizza](https://www.drberg.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/healthy-pizza.png?w=800) **Directions:** **1.** Pre-heat oven to 450 degrees. Cut parchment paper to match the size and shape of your pizza pan. Parchment paper is the best to prevent your crust from sticking to the baking surface. Put the pizza stone in the oven and wait for 20 minutes past the point where my oven becomes pre-heated. The stone makes the crust really crispy and delicious. **2.** Finely grate cauliflower and remove any large chunks. You want a fine, uniform texture like rice. Try to spread it as thin as possible. **3.** Mix together the cauliflower, mozzarella cheese, and two eggs until well-combined. At this point, it may not look like it could possibly turn into pizza crust, but it will bake to a thin, crunchy, flexible crust- just watch! **4.** Place the cauliflower mixture in the center of the parchment paper on the pizza pan. Spread the mixture thinly but evenly out the edges of the pan. **5.** Bake crust at 450 degrees for 15 minutes. Do NOT cook crust with toppings; just the crust at this point.

## Fish Without Mercury List: Safe Picks to Eat There are no fish without mercury, as all marine life contains trace amounts of this toxic heavy metal due to environmental pollution. However, some species contain much lower levels than others, making them safer for regular consumption without the risk of mercury toxicity and associated health issues. Here’s a comprehensive guide to mercury levels in fish and how to choose the safest options to minimize mercury exposure. ## **What is mercury?** Mercury is a heavy metal that’s naturally present in the environment and the only type of metal that’s liquid at room temperature. It has a silvery appearance and is commonly used in thermometers, barometers, and fluorescent light bulbs. Processes such as volcanic activity and the weathering of rocks, as well as coal burning, mining, and improper disposal of mercury-containing products, can release elemental mercury into the atmosphere. Airborne mercury particles typically enter bodies of water through precipitation, where microbes convert them into methylmercury, a highly toxic compound that can contaminate aquatic organisms. Mercury easily accumulates in fish, particularly larger predatory species, as they ingest smaller contaminated organisms, leading to higher concentrations of methylmercury in their tissues. Watch the video below to learn which types of fish contain the highest levels of mercury.## **Why is mercury bad for you?** Mercury is highly toxic and can have serious health consequences. Mercury poisoning, also known as mercury toxicity, occurs when excessive amounts of mercury accumulate in the body, which can cause significant tissue and organ damage over time. Excessive intake of contaminated fish is the most common source of methylmercury exposure for humans. Methylmercury is a particularly dangerous form of mercury as it can easily enter the bloodstream and
