## Polycystic Ovarian Syndrome What You Need to Know Polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) can be a difficult disease to manage. Learn about PCOS, common symptoms, and what you can do to support your health against this disease. ## **Understanding Polycystic Ovarian Syndrome (PCOS)** [Polycystic Ovarian Syndrome, often PCOS](https://www.drberg.com/blog/what-is-pcos-dr-berg-interviews-dr-nadia-pateguana), is a common health concern for many women. But the name can be misleading. ![](https://www.drberg.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/health-evaluation-quiz-symptom-pcod-polycystic-ovarian-disorder.jpg?w=800) ### **Misconceptions and Clarifications about PCOS** Rather than primarily caused by cysts, PCOS results from an overproduction of follicles in the ovaries. Thus, follicular ovarian syndrome may be a more accurate name. ### **Symptoms and Characteristics of PCOS** In essence, with PCOS, your ovaries go into hyperdrive. They start producing too many eggs, which causes hormonal imbalance, leading to irregular periods and sometimes even infertility. ## **The Role of Androgens in PCOS** Androgens, called ‘male hormones,’ are integral in PCOS. Let’s explore their normal function and what happens when levels get too high. ### **The Normal Function of Androgens** Under regular circumstances, an enzyme named aromatase helps convert androgens into estrogen. [According to studies](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3277302), this process is essential for maintaining hormonal balance within the body. However, disruptions can lead to significant health issues. ### **The Impact of High Androgen Levels** If something blocks this enzyme from doing its job correctly, such as certain medical conditions or toxins, it results in a buildup of androgens. This excess can have serious consequences for women’s health. Too much testosterone might cause symptoms like hair loss or growth where you don’t want it. More seriously, these higher levels are often linked with Polycystic

## Estrogen and Menopause: Natural Relief Tips Let’s talk about estrogen and menopause, along with mood and a few other things connected to the menstrual cycle. Here’s the problem: when you enter menopause, your hormones change – but you often don’t know exactly how or what to do. Why? A lot of the symptoms for high estrogen or **estrogen dominance are** very similar to low estrogen. As a result, when you do research in the area of estrogen, you’re going to find a tremendous amount of unknowns, complexities, and confusions. Here, I’ll try to bring some clarity, explain what we definitely know for sure, and show you what course of action I recommend. **In the article:** 1. **Understanding Estrogen** 2. **Causes of Low Estrogen** 3. **Causes of High Estrogen** 4. **What You Can Do** ## **Understanding Estrogen** ![estrogen and menopause symptoms](https://www.drberg.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/blog-estrogen-mood-and-menopause-1.jpg?w=800) \* \* \* People always talk about “estrogen,” but the reality is that there’s not just one estrogen. Instead, there are actually **three different types of estrogen** and they all have slightly different purposes: \* **Estradiol:** The most common type of estrogen in women of childbearing age – and the primary estrogen when you’re not pregnant or in menopause. \* **Estriol:** The main estrogen during pregnancy. This estrogen is anti-inflammatory, anti-cancer, and it has a lot of other helpful properties. \* **Estrone:** The only estrogen your body makes after menopause (when menstrual periods stop). This estrogen increases your risk of certain types of cancer Your **ovaries make these three estrogens**, but so do your adrenal glands. Particularly when you’re menopausal, your ovarian estrogen production goes way down and your adrenals essentially help pick up the slack. If you’re menopausal and the adrenal glands are weak, however, you could start seeing all sorts of symptoms. \*\*This is not

## High pH in Urine: Symptoms, Causes, and How to Test Alkaline urine occurs when your pH level exceeds the normal urinary pH range of between 4.5 and 7.8. Factors including your dietary habits, medication use, and underlying medical issues such as kidney stones or urinary tract infections can influence the pH balance in the urinary system and cause alkaline urine. Let’s explore the symptoms and causes of high pH in urine and discover how pH urine test strips can help detect and prevent potential health issues. ## **What is pH?** The term pH refers to the potential of hydrogen, a measure of the concentration of hydrogen ions in a solution. pH is generally expressed on a pH scale ranging from 0 to 14, with 0 being the most acidic and 14 being the most alkaline. A pH of 7 is neutral. Different body fluids have different pH levels. For example, saliva has an average pH of 6.2 to 7.6, while a healthy blood pH ranges from 7.35 to 7.45. Many biochemical processes require specific pH levels, and considerable changes to the body’s acid-base balance can lead to health issues such as uric acid stones and metabolic acidosis. Factors such as sugar and stress can alter your acid-alkaline levels. While a diet high in sugars, carbs, and alcohol can make your urine acidic, the stress hormone cortisol can increase the body’s alkalinity and may lead to alkalosis. Urinary pH levels are a marker of various physiological functions, and medical professionals regularly use pH tests to monitor and treat urinary tract infections (UTIs), metabolic disorders, kidney failure, renal tubular acidosis, and gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). Watch this video to discover how your saliva and urine pH may help detect underlying health issues.## **What is the normal pH range of urine?** According to research published by _Pocket Companion to Brenner and Rector’s The Kidney_, a urinary pH range

## Can You Drink Milk on Your Period? Truth Here Not many people realize how the consumption of dairy products can significantly influence the menstrual cycle. Learn about the role hormones in dairy play in your monthly cycles and what steps you can take to improve your hormone balance. ## **The Impact of Dairy on the Menstrual Cycle** It’s no secret that dairy products, especially those from cows, are rich in [estrogen](https://www.drberg.com/blog/estrogen-the-ovary-and-adrenal-hormone). Realizing the possible issues that can arise from having an excessive amount of estrogen in your body because of external elements due to dairy products being high in this hormone should not be taken lightly. ### **Understanding the Role of Estrogen in Dairy** Estrogen is a naturally occurring hormone found in both humans and animals. It plays crucial roles, such as regulating menstrual cycles and aiding in the development of secondary sexual characteristics. However, when consumed excessively through dairy products like cow’s milk, it could potentially disrupt hormonal balance, leading to irregularities with menstruation. [Research indicates](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4524299) that cow’s milk contains significant amounts of female sex hormones, which might influence a woman’s menstrual cycle, particularly if she has high levels present within her system. This is mainly due to exposure to pesticides and insecticides that mimic these hormones. ### **How Excessive Consumption of Dairy Affects Menstrual Cycles** An overconsumption of dairy products can contribute significantly to elevated estrogen levels beyond what is considered normal for women during their reproductive years. Excess estrogen levels, often caused by overconsuming dairy products, can lead to irregular periods, heavy bleeding, and painful cramps associated with endometriosis and PCOS. In some cases, reducing consumption and switching to alternatives like almond or coconut milk can help alleviate

## What Causes Endometriosis? Explained | Dr. Berg Endometriosis is a troubling condition that causes concern for those suffering from it. It can be helpful to understand what is causing this problem during such times. Learn about the common causes of endometriosis and what steps you can take to better support your health while suffering from this condition. ## **Understanding Endometriosis** [Endometriosis](https://www.drberg.com/blog/endometriosis-and-iodine-deficiency-link) is a complex condition where endometrial tissue, which typically lines the uterus, grows outside it. This misplaced tissue can lead to painful and sometimes severe symptoms. Symptoms of endometriosis may include heavy periods, pain during intercourse, and infertility. ![Word hormones on wooden cubes](https://www.drberg.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/hormones-word-wooden-cubes-on-white-002.jpg?w=800) ### **The Role of Hormones in Endometriosis** [Hormones, such as estrogen](https://www.drberg.com/blog/estrogen-the-good-the-bad-and-the-ugly), significantly impact the growth and behavior of endometrial cells in endometriosis. Hormones like estrogen heavily influence the growth and behavior of endometrial cells. During each menstrual cycle, under the influence of these hormones, this tissue thickens and then breaks down, leading to bleeding. Research suggests that [hormonal imbalance](https://www.drberg.com/blog/hormone-imbalance-signs-causes-solutions) may contribute significantly to the development or progression of endometriosis due to an increased sensitivity within this rogue tissue towards them. ### **Dietary Influences on Endometriosis** Nutrition also impacts how your body manages conditions like endometriosis because what you eat influences hormone levels, too. Certain foods can help maintain hormonal balance, while others might disrupt it, causing inflammation and aggravating symptoms. ## **Estrogen Dominance and Endometriosis** The relationship between estrogen dominance and

## Essential Tips for Heavy Periods You Should Know Many women suffer from heavy periods and have a difficult time with their menstrual cycle. This can be a difficult issue to deal with every month, so understanding how to relieve such symptoms can be highly beneficial. Learn about what causes heavy periods and what steps you can take to reduce the symptoms. ## **Understanding Estrogen Dominance and Heavy Periods** If you’ve ever experienced a heavier-than-normal period, estrogen dominance could be the culprit. It’s like your body’s hormonal seesaw is tipped in favor of estrogen, leading to less-than-pleasant side effects. ### **The Role of Estrogen in Menstruation** Estrogen is essential for the successful functioning of menstruation, and when balanced with other hormones, it works well. But if levels surge too high, we end up with heavy periods that feel more like rock concerts than symphonies. This hormonal imbalance can be due to various factors, such as certain medications or dietary choices. ![Chemical formula of estrogen](https://www.drberg.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/chemical-formula-of-estrogen-on-a-blackboard.jpg?w=800) ### **Common Contributors to Estrogen Dominance** You might not realize it, but everyday things like [birth control pills](https://www.drberg.com/blog/birth-control-pills-and-your-future-health) and certain foods can contribute to [estrogen dominance](https://www.drberg.com/blog/why-estrogen-dominance-occurs-after-menopause). Using birth control pills every day could potentially increase your estrogen level. Taking any medication containing extra estrogen could also be a reason for imbalance. Consuming soy-rich food frequently could lead to hormonal imbalance as well. ## **Dietary Changes for Balancing Estrogen Levels** Our diet has a significant influence on how our bodies operate, including the regulation of hormones. If you’re struggling with heavy periods, making specific dietary changes can help balance your estrogen levels.
