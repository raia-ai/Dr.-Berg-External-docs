## S. Snitzer Lost 64 Pounds in 6 Months — “I Feel Like I’m 20 Again at 43” #### Quick stats Weight Lost: 64lbs (29kg) Keto Start Date: May 1, 2019 Starting Weight: 235 lbs (107 kg) Favorite Exercise: Full-body workouts at home (bodyweight + kettlebells) Favorite Keto Recipe: Keto ice cream S. Snitzer has been athletic since the age of five. A former military man and police officer of 13 years, he once took pride in his physical condition. But after leaving the military and graduating from the police academy, life got in the way — and his body began to change. > “I was unhappy with how I looked,” said Snitzer. > “My weight was taking a toll on my knees and back. I knew I had to do something, but I didn’t know how I wanted to attack this situation. Needless to say, it was time to change.” ### Turning Point Snitzer began researching solutions on YouTube and came across keto success stories — many of which credited **Dr. Berg** as their guide. One video turned into another, and soon he felt aligned with Dr. Berg’s philosophy. > “Dr. Berg and I just agreed from the start,” he said. > “He taught me that with hard work, the right nutrition, supplements, minerals, and real healthy eating, the human body can be transformed into what it should be.” On **May 1, 2019**, Snitzer committed to the **Healthy Keto(TM) lifestyle**. At the time, he weighed **235 pounds** and felt drained, exhausted, and unable to play with his children. > “All I wanted to do was sleep. My body felt horrible,” he recalled. ### The Struggles — and the Wins Like many others, Snitzer experienced the dreaded **keto flu** when his body transitioned into fat-burning mode. Looking back, he wishes he had started using **Dr. Berg’s supplements** sooner. Sticking to keto was also a challenge because his sons still ate carbs and sugar, meaning meals had to be prepared differently. But going back to the Standard American Diet? > “Not an option,” he said. ### A Strong Support System Snitzer credits much of his

## Seam Ahmed's Story - Dr. Berg #### Quick stats Starting Weight: 309 lbs (140 kg) Weight Lost\*\*:\*\* 122 lbs (55 kg) Guided by: Keto + Intermittent Fasting (OMAD – One Meal a Day) Seam Ahmed described his former life as **“physically, mentally, and socially debilitating.”** At 309 pounds (140 kg), he was struggling in every way. > “Despising my state of living, I started losing weight in January 2019,” said Seam. > “I was severely addicted to sugar and carbs and had a very difficult time.” ### Eye-Opening Habits Before starting keto and intermittent fasting, Seam followed a typical but damaging eating routine: **three full meals and constant snacking until bedtime**. He eventually tracked his eating schedule and was shocked by what he discovered. > “I ate from 6:00 a.m. to 9:00 p.m. every day,” he admitted. > “I had enough of being sick and tired, so I started **one meal a day** and keto.” ### The Mental Battle The transition wasn’t easy. One of the hardest parts was confronting the truth about his habits. > “I was in denial of my food addiction,” Seam shared. > “Believe it or not, it doesn’t go away.” But despite the cravings, he stayed the course — and the rewards began to show. \* \* \* ### Life-Changing Results In just **ten months**, Seam lost **122 pounds (55 kg)**. But for him, the most meaningful benefits weren’t physical. > “\[The best part is] clear thinking, no more feeling depressed, so much energy!” he said. > “And sleeping like a teenager again — that’s what keeps me motivated. > The coolest part? Learning that **when you fast, your body triggers amazing internal healing processes**.” \* \* \* ### Seam’s Advice to You: > “Watch all of Dr. Berg’s videos, apply the knowledge to your life, and you _will_ lose weight and feel better. > If you want it — **go get it**. > Make the change for your partner, your kids, your family — and most importantly, for YOU. > > Remember: you only have one life. Live it as the best version of yourself. > Don’t spend it in a carb-

## Dr. Berg Journey - Dr. Berg ## **Dr. Berg’s Journey: From Burnout to Breakthrough** ### **Sugar and shortcuts** Dr. Eric Berg grew up in the Midwest on a typical American diet–meat, potatoes, sugary cereals, and processed snacks. Vegetables were rarely on the plate, and sugar was a daily staple. By age 11, he began experiencing signs of blood sugar dysregulation–lightheadedness after meals, which would subside only after eating something sweet. Though these signs were easy to ignore at the time, they foreshadowed the deeper issues that would emerge later. ### **Overtraining and undernourished** In high school, Eric was a competitive athlete–wrestling, running track, and playing football. At the time, his training focused entirely on performance, with little awareness of how essential recovery was to long-term health. He pushed his body to extremes, often starving himself before matches and binging afterward. By the time he reached college and joined the Army Reserve, chronic fatigue, injuries, and unexplained weakness had taken a toll. Living on instant noodles, bread, and coffee, he experienced declining energy, poor sleep, gallbladder issues, and chronic indigestion. He chalked it up to stress and bad luck, but the truth was clearer in hindsight: years of nutrient-poor foods, overtraining, and chronic stress were catching up. ### **Early professional life–and a personal health crash** After chiropractic school, Dr. Berg launched his practice–but his own health was deteriorating. In an effort to get healthy, he became vegan–but ended up more of a “grain-a-tarian,” living on soy products, pasta, bread, and prunes. The results were disastrous: persistent fatigue, insomnia, restless legs, digestive distress, and mental fog. Even small tasks felt overwhelming. He vividly remembers having to leave a restaurant mid-meal to nap in the car. His body was in burnout–but the wake-up call was coming. ### \*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*A turning

## Dr. Berg's Farm - Dr. Berg ## **Soil as a living system** To Dr. Berg, soil isn’t just dirt. It’s a living ecosystem made up of minerals, microbes, gases, water, and insects–all working together to nourish the plants we eat. On the farm, natural predator-prey dynamics are used to maintain this balance. Beneficial insects like springtails help control pests and fungi, reducing the need for harmful pesticides and herbicides. After each harvest, composted organic matter from plants and livestock is added back to the soil, completing the nutrient cycle and regenerating fertility. ### **Microorganisms** Microorganisms play a key role in decomposition (the break down of organic matter) and the cycling of nutrients and water to our plants and crops. Decaying organic matter provides microorganisms with energy for their growth and supplies carbon for the formation of new cells. As microorganisms help break down organic matter, they release essential nutrients and carbon dioxide into the soil, fix nitrogen and help transform nutrients into mineral forms that plants can use through a process called mineralization. In addition, as these microorganisms move through the soil, they aerate it, helping to improve soil drainage and soil structure. ### **Insects** The soil developed on Dr. Berg’s farm maintains an ecologically balanced environment with predator-prey dynamics using tiny insects, such as springtails, to control harmful fungi and pests. This is an essential part of keeping the farm free of harmful pesticides and herbicides. After harvest, the soil is regenerated with organic matter from the compost of livestock and plant residues to restore the nutrient cycle. ### **Pesticides & Herbicides** Heavy treatment of soil with pesticides and herbicides can cause populations of beneficial soil microorganisms to decline. For example, plants depend on a variety of soil microorganisms to transform atmospheric nitrogen

## Total Daily Energy Expenditure (TDEE) Calculator ### Total Daily Energy Expenditure TDEE calculator allows you to estimate your total daily energy expenditure and helps you to find out how many calories you burn every day. **Table of Contents** \* [What is a TDEE calculator?](https://www.drberg.com/total-daily-energy-expenditure#content-1) \* [What is the purpose of a TDEE calculator?](https://www.drberg.com/total-daily-energy-expenditure#content-2) \* [How is TDEE calculated?](https://www.drberg.com/total-daily-energy-expenditure#content-3) \* [What is BMR?](https://www.drberg.com/total-daily-energy-expenditure#content-4) \* [Why do you need my activity level?](https://www.drberg.com/total-daily-energy-expenditure#content-5) \* [How can this free TDEE calculator help me with my Healthy Keto® plan?](https://www.drberg.com/total-daily-energy-expenditure#content-6) ## What is a TDEE calculator? TDEE stands for total daily energy expenditure. A TDEE calculator helps you determine how much energy (calories) you burn each day when accounting for physical activity. ## What is the purpose of a TDEE calculator? Your TDEE can estimate the number of calories you need to consume daily to maintain your current weight. Consuming fewer calories than your estimated TDEE can result in weight loss. Consuming more calories than your estimated TDEE can be useful for building lean muscle mass. ## How is TDEE calculated? We calculate your TDEE by first establishing your BMR (basal metabolic rate) using the Mifflin-St. Jeor equation. This requires your gender, age, height, and weight. Then, our calculator multiplies your BMR by your activity level to get your TDEE. \* _BMR × Activity Level = TDEE_ ## What is BMR? BMR stands for basal metabolic rate. This is an estimate of the calories you burn without any physical activity. To put it simply, BMR is the amount of fuel your engine (body) burns while idling (resting). If you were resting in bed all day, BMR would represent the amount of calories

## Understanding Cholesterol Levels and Numbers Poor diet and lifestyle habits, such as smoking, alcohol consumption, an ultra-processed diet, obesity, and lack of exercise, can lead to imbalanced cholesterol levels. Certain types of cholesterol can contribute to fat deposits in the arteries, also known as atherosclerosis, which increases the risk of heart disease, hypertension, heart attack, and stroke. Learn how to interpret your cholesterol numbers and discover effective strategies to support healthy cholesterol levels naturally. ## **What is cholesterol?** Cholesterol is a fat-like, waxy substance that’s found in every cell of the body. The liver produces approximately 80 percent of the body’s cholesterol stores, while the remaining 20 percent, known as dietary cholesterol, is obtained from foods. Dietary cholesterol can be acquired from nutritious animal-based foods such as eggs, full-fat dairy, and fatty meats. The liver can adjust cholesterol production in response to dietary intake to maintain cholesterol balance. However, fried, fast, and ultra-processed foods that are high in cholesterol can overwhelm the body’s ability to regulate cholesterol. This explains why these types of food in particular can contribute to a buildup of fat and cholesterol in the arteries. Plaque buildup in the blood vessels, known as atherosclerosis, causes the arteries to narrow and restricts blood flow, which significantly raises the risk of stroke and heart attacks. Watch the video below to learn more about reading and understanding your cholesterol levels.## **The importance of cholesterol** Cholesterol is widely regarded as detrimental to health. Though high levels can increase the risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD), cholesterol is essential for many vital bodily functions. Here are four critical functions of cholesterol. ### **1. Hormone balance** The endocrine glands

## What Are the Best Foods to Eat While Taking Warfarin? ## **The Importance of Vegetables on a Warfarin Diet** Consuming vegetables is crucial for maintaining overall health, even when taking a blood thinner like warfarin. While certain leafy greens are restricted due to their high vitamin K content, plenty of alternatives still provide essential nutrients without interfering with the medication’s effectiveness. ## **Why You Need 7 to 10 Cups of Vegetables Daily** A vegetable-rich diet provides numerous health benefits, such as reducing the risk of chronic diseases and promoting weight loss. For those taking warfarin, consuming 7 to 10 cups of low-vitamin K vegetables daily is crucial to ensure adequate nutrient intake while keeping vitamin K levels consistent. This helps prevent potential complications associated with fluctuating vitamin K levels and allows your healthcare provider to make appropriate adjustments in your warfarin dosage if needed. ## **Nutrient-Rich Vegetable Options for Those Taking Warfarin** \* Tomatoes: Rich in antioxidants like lycopene, tomatoes can help reduce inflammation and protect against heart disease. \* Cucumbers: High in water content and electrolytes, cucumbers aid hydration and support healthy digestion. \* Zucchini: A good source of vitamins C and B6 and potassium, zucchini supports immune function and cardiovascular health. \* Bell peppers: Packed with vitamins A, C, and E and minerals like potassium, bell peppers promote eye health and boost immunity. [Cruciferous vegetables](https://www.drberg.com/blog/what-cruciferous-vegetables-are-and-their-benefits) such as cauliflower, broccoli, and Brussels sprouts are also low in vitamin K and provide a wide range of health benefits, which can be beneficial while on warfarin. On a warfarin diet, focus on incorporating a variety of nutrient-rich options that are low in vitamin K. This will help maintain proper blood clotting function and support overall health by providing essential vitamins,

## Garlic in Nose: How It Works and What to Avoid The benefits of garlic nasal rinses are a topic of interest for those seeking natural alternatives to alleviate sinus congestion and improve overall respiratory health. Explore the advantages of using garlic as a nasal rinse, including its ability to target fungi and other pathogens responsible for causing discomfort in our nasal passages. Learn how to prepare your garlic solution at home by selecting high-quality cloves and following essential safety measures. ## **The Benefits of Garlic Nasal Rinse** A garlic nasal rinse is a natural remedy to help alleviate chronic sinus congestion and related issues such as mucus, postnasal drip, and sleep apnea. This powerful solution targets fungus, mold, mildew, viruses, and bacteria growing in the sinuses to provide relief. As an alternative to over-the-counter medications or prescription drugs with potential side effects, a garlic nasal rinse offers numerous benefits for those seeking a more holistic approach to their health. ### **Natural Alternative for Sinus Relief** Garlic has been used for centuries as a natural remedy due to its potent antimicrobial properties. Allicin, a potent antimicrobial compound, is present in garlic, which makes it effective against various pathogens responsible for sinus infections. By performing a garlic nasal rinse regularly, you can experience significant improvements in your breathing quality without relying on synthetic medications. ![](https://www.drberg.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/02f22182-2d58-4641-a0c8-00661762ea26.jpg?w=800) ### **Targeting Fungi and Other Pathogens** Sinus infections are often caused by fungi and [yeasts like Candida](https://www.drberg.com/blog/sugar-yeast-and-candida) that thrive in moist environments like the nose.

## Causes of Fatigue: What’s Behind Your Tiredness It’s normal to sometimes feel tired. However, persistent fatigue and a constant lack of energy can indicate an underlying medical condition. Fatigue is a debilitating and disruptive symptom that can be linked to autoimmune diseases, sleep disorders, metabolic imbalances, poor dietary habits, or chronic stress. Let’s talk about fatigue symptoms and the common causes of chronic fatigue. Fatigue is a feeling of tiredness and exhaustion [not relieved by rest or sleep](https://www.drberg.com/blog/why-cant-sleep-at-night-when-tired). It’s a common symptom linked to various medical conditions, such as anemia, chronic fatigue syndrome, heart disease, depression, and sleep apnea. Fatigue can also be triggered by lifestyle factors such as poor diet, lack of physical activity, insufficient sleep, and persistent stress. Common symptoms associated with fatigue include: \* Feeling constantly tired, even after getting enough sleep \* Lack of energy or motivation \* Trouble concentrating \* Irritability or mood swings \* Slow reactions and reflexes \* Difficulty with memory and thinking If you suspect an underlying medical condition may cause your fatigue, it’s important to consult a doctor. A thorough physical examination, blood tests, and other medical evaluations can identify fatigue-related causes, including [iron deficiency anemia](https://www.drberg.com/blog/iron-deficiency-anemia-symptoms-and-causes), autoimmune disorders, or underactive thyroid function. While some conditions linked to fatigue can be diagnosed quickly, other causes may be less obvious, making it challenging to discover what may contribute to persistent exhaustion. Here are two common underlying health issues linked to unexplained fatigue. ### **1. Adrenal fatigue** Adrenal fatigue is a result of overworked or exhausted [adrenal glands](https://www.drberg.com/blog/adrenal-body-type-fix) that can result in fatigue-related symptoms. \_“During periods of stress, the

## How to Lower Cortisol: Best Natural Solutions Cortisol plays a crucial role in mitigating the effects of stress on the body. However, chronic stress, a poor diet, and lack of adequate sleep can lead to high levels of cortisol, which can negatively affect your physical and mental health. Learn if you show signs of elevated stress hormones and discover how to lower cortisol levels naturally. ![Reduced stress chart illustration](https://www.drberg.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/relieve-stress-levels-reduced-through-concept.jpg?w=800) ## **What is cortisol?** Cortisol is a steroid hormone produced by the adrenal glands in response to stress. It plays a crucial role in regulating various physiological functions, including energy-making processes, immune defenses, and blood pressure. Cortisol is the body’s primary stress hormone that alters metabolic processes to sustain the body during stressful periods such as emotional distress, exercise, trauma, or injury. In addition, cortisol is part of the circadian rhythm, which regulates the sleep-wake cycle. Cortisol levels typically follow a 24-hour circadian pattern, peaking in the early morning shortly after waking and reaching their lowest in the late evening. Watch the video below to learn how to lower your cortisol levels. How To LOWER Cortisol Levels ## **How to lower cortisol naturally** Cortisol plays a vital role in stress resilience. However, chronic stress can cause high cortisol levels, also known as hypercortisolism, which is linked to serious health issues, including impaired sleep, insulin resistance, a greater risk of heart disease, depression, and weight gain, also known as [adrenal body type](https://www.drberg.com/blog/adrenal-body-type-cortisol-and-belly-fat). While it’s almost impossible to avoid stress, there are many steps you can take to reduce stress and promote healthy cortisol levels. Here are ten ways to lower cortisol naturally. ### **1.

## Constipation Remedies: Easy Natural Fixes Dealing with constipation can be uncomfortable and frustrating. While many medications only mask symptoms, several natural remedies can help address root causes and support optimal digestion. Explore three natural constipation remedies to promote regular bowel movements and learn how to restore digestive balance for lasting relief and better overall health. ## **What causes constipation?** Constipation affects millions of people worldwide. According to [data](https://www.niddk.nih.gov/health-information/digestive-diseases/constipation/definition-facts) collected by the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK) in the United States, _“about 33 out of 100 adults ages 60 and older have symptoms of constipation.”_ Here are four of the most common causes of constipation. ### **1. Poor dietary habits** Diets high in refined carbohydrates, sugars, and ultra-processed foods disrupt the gut microbiome by fueling harmful microbes. This overgrowth can overwhelm and displace beneficial gut bacteria, leading to an imbalanced microbiome. Imbalanced gut microbes can slow digestion, impair nutrient absorption, and promote inflammation, all of which can impair proper bowel muscle function and exacerbate constipation. Additionally, diets low in healthy fats can suppress the production of [bile](https://www.drberg.com/blog/bile-a-vitally-important-fluid), which is a crucial digestive fluid needed to soften stools and ensure they pass smoothly through the colon. ### **2. Dehydration** Dehydration is another significant contributor to constipation. When the body lacks adequate fluids, it conserves water, causing stools to become dry, compact, and difficult to pass. ### **3. Medications** Certain over-the-counter and prescription medications are known to interfere with bowel regularity. Opioids, antacids, and some antidepressants can slow intestinal transit time, greatly increasing the risk of constipation.

## What Causes Dry Eyes? Top Reasons and Solutions Struggling with dry eyes can make daily life difficult and can be damaging to the eyes. Understanding this condition is the first step to implementing a better management plan. Learn about common causes of dry eye, how a vitamin A deficiency can hurt you, and what you can do to prevent this issue from continuing. ## **Understanding Vitamin A Deficiency** [Vitamin A plays a crucial role in maintaining our overall health](https://www.drberg.com/blog/vitamin-a-functions-and-deficiencies). It’s not just about sight, although that is certainly significant. This essential nutrient helps with cell growth and differentiation, playing a critical part in the healthy development of the heart, lungs, kidneys, and other organs. Without adequate vitamin A, deficiencies can occur. While these are rare in developed countries thanks to abundant food sources rich in this nutrient, like [cod liver oil](https://www.drberg.com/blog/is-cod-liver-oil-healthy) or butter, they’re still an issue worldwide. ### **The Role of Vitamin A in the Body** A lack of vitamin A can impact many bodily functions, but focus on one symptom you might be surprised by: dry eyes. Vitamin A deficiency can cause dry eyes and other symptoms such as sinus issues and sleep apnea. This link between eye health and nutrition shows how interconnected our bodies are–each system influencing another, creating a symphony of biochemical reactions that keep us alive. ## **The Connection Between Dry Eyes and Vitamin A Deficiency** If you’re experiencing the annoying sensation of [eye twitching](https://www.drberg.com/blog/eyelid-twitching-find-out-why) or the discomfort of dry eyes, a potential underlying cause could be a deficiency in vitamin A.

## Natural Remedies for Cataracts and Eye Health Cataracts are a progressive eye condition marked by clouding of the eye’s natural lens, leading to blurry vision. If left untreated, cataracts can gradually worsen and may result in significant vision loss. Discover natural remedies for cataracts and learn how making beneficial dietary changes can play a crucial role in supporting clear vision and healthy eyes. ## **What are cataracts?** Cataracts are an eye condition that occurs when the normally clear intraocular lens of the eye becomes clouded, leading to various visual disturbances. This common eye disease is marked by a gradual loss of lens transparency, which interferes with the way light passes through the eye and reaches the retina. As a result, individuals with developing cataracts often notice blurred vision, making everyday tasks like reading, driving, or recognizing faces more difficult. One of the hallmark signs of cataracts is a clouded lens, which can give the appearance of looking through a foggy window. Cataract symptoms typically develop slowly over time, often including increased sensitivity to light, seeing halos, fading or yellowing of colors. In the early stages, the effects of cataracts may be subtle, but as lens cloudiness worsens, vision impairment becomes more noticeable and can significantly affect quality of life. According to research published in _StatPearls_, cataracts are one of the most widespread eye diseases, affecting almost 20 percent of the population.1 Routine eye exams can help detect developing cataracts before they severely impact vision. In advanced cases, cataract treatment, such as surgical intervention, is often necessary to restore clear sight. Watch the video below to discover the ultimate support for cataracts.## **What causes cataracts?** Multiple factors contribute to the

## Dark Circles Under Eyes: How to Get Rid of Them Dark circles under eyes are a common issue that can influence how you look and feel. While often attributed to genetics or lack of sleep, these under-eye shadows may reflect deeper health concerns. Factors such as insulin resistance, nutrient deficiencies, chronic stress, and liver dysfunction can all contribute to dark circles, making them a potential indicator of underlying imbalances rather than a purely cosmetic problem. Explore the various causes of dark circles and discover natural strategies for reducing their appearance while improving overall skin health. ## **What causes dark circles under eyes?** Dark circles under the eyes, which are also known as infraorbital dark circles or periorbital hyperpigmentation (POH), can develop due to a combination of internal and external factors. While genetics and aging can increase the likelihood of developing dark circles, several other factors can also contribute to their appearance. _“Hyperinsulinemia, which typically stems from insulin resistance, is one of the biggest causes of dark circles under the eyes,”_ explains Dr. Berg. This condition is frequently triggered by diets high in refined carbohydrates and sugars, leading to elevated insulin levels that can promote fluid retention and excess pigmentation. According to data published in the _Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism_, approximately 42 percent of young adults may experience insulin resistance, which can manifest in various systemic and dermatological conditions, including dark circles under the eyes.1 A study published in the _Indian Dermatology Online Journal_ supports this connection, reporting a clear link between insulin resistance and periorbital melanosis, a type of pigmentation associated with dark circles.2 Several other factors also contribute to a darker skin color around the eyes.

## What Is My Body Type? Find Out and Take Control _What is my_ [_body type_](https://www.drberg.com/body-type-quiz)_, and why is it important?_ If you struggle with getting healthy and losing weight, chances are, **you don’t know your body type**. Making dietary changes based on how your body functions on the inside will greatly affect how you look and feel. If you have problems with _brain fog, grogginess, lethargy, pain, losing weight, chronic stress, anxiety, depression, insomnia, joint pain, or chronic disease,_ you’re in the right place. Knowing your specific body type and how to and how to handle your body type could be the difference between staying sick, overweight, and unhealthy, and becoming happy, healthy, and full of vitality. In this article, I will cover: \* **What Are Body Types?** \* **The Four Body Types** \* **Adrenal Body Type** \* **Thyroid Body Type** \* **Liver Body Type** \* **Ovary Body Type** \* **Key Takeaways** \* \* \* ## What Are Body Types? Many go through life trying to improve their health but fail again and again. _**The problem is that not all bodies are the same.**_ Working with countless patients over the years, I’ve learned that if you treat all bodies as the same, you won’t see results. That’s because everyone’s body is driven by a different set of dominant hormones. _In other words, the hormones that you have the most of will dictate where you gain weight and what your diet should be to counteract health issues._ Rather than a one-size-fits-all approach, my hormone-driven body types approach better explains what is really going on with your body. Once you’ve figured out [which of these body types](https://www.drberg.com/blog/what-are-the-four-body-types) you are, you can customize a [diet plan](https://www.drberg.com/blog/what-to-eat-for-your-body-type) to give you the most benefits. **There are four primary body types: thyroid, liver, ovary, and adrenal.**

## Different Body Types: What You Need to Know People often ask me about body type weight loss. It’s a common concern, and rightfully so. This topic has become muddled with cookie-cutter diets and generic advice. But the truth is, body type weight loss is about understanding how your physiology interacts with food, stress, and lifestyle. There’s no one-size-fits-all approach. We’re going to break down the different body types and what they mean for your weight loss journey. ## **Decoding Your Body Type for Effective Weight Loss** Have you ever wondered why some people seem to effortlessly maintain a healthy weight while others struggle? Or why certain diets work wonders for your friend but leave you feeling frustrated and defeated? The answer might lie in your specific body type. Just as our personalities, strengths, and weaknesses differ, our bodies also possess unique characteristics. Identifying your body type is the first step to finding the most effective path to weight loss. ## **The Adrenal Body Type: When Stress Takes Center Stage** We all experience stress, but for those with an [adrenal body type](https://www.drberg.com/blog/adrenal-body-type-fix), it manifests visibly, often with a sagging belly. This is not simply about overeating; it’s about the stress hormone cortisol. [Cortisol signals our body to store fat](https://www.drberg.com/blog/cortisol-extremely-simplified-by-dr-berg), especially in the abdominal region, making it more challenging to lose weight, especially in that area. While some individuals experience weight loss from stress, it’s usually not healthy. Cortisol is a powerful hormone and too much can be hard on the body. ### **Telltale Signs You Might Have an Adrenal Body Type:** \* Difficulty sleeping, even when exhausted. \* Increased cravings for sugary or salty foods, like chocolate. \* Struggling to stay focused; experiencing brain fog. \* Feeling perpetually tired, even after a full night’s sleep.

The [ketogenic diet](https://www.drberg.com/blog/how-to-lower-your-cholesterol-on-ketogenic-diet) is a high-fat, moderate-protein, and low-carbohydrate eating plan designed to induce a metabolic fat-burning state known as ketosis. During ketosis, the body shifts from using sugar as its primary energy source to burning dietary and stored body fat for fuel. To trigger and maintain ketosis, it’s crucial to limit dietary intake of carbohydrates to no more than 50 grams daily. Carbohydrate restriction limits the body’s supply of glucose, forcing it to rely on fat for energy. By drastically reducing carbs, the body begins to break down fat into ketones, which serve as a highly efficient alternative energy source. This metabolic shift promotes fat burning and can help with [weight loss](https://www.drberg.com/blog/how-to-burn-fat-step-by-step-formula), improved energy levels, and better mental clarity, all while maintaining muscle mass due to focus on moderate protein intake. Watch the video below to discover the key differences between yogurt and kefir.## **What is kefir?** Kefir is a fermented drink made from dairy, [coconut milk](https://www.drberg.com/blog/is-coconut-milk-or-water-keto-friendly), or water, and is typically fermented with yeasts and live bacteria known as kefir grains. The name kefir is derived from the Turkish word keyif, which means to feel good after a meal. \_“While it’s often

## Ketosis vs Ketoacidosis: Health Impacts Explained Ketosis vs. ketoacidosis–what’s the difference? Ketosis is a natural metabolic state that promotes fat burning and occurs when the body doesn’t receive enough dietary carbohydrates to generate energy. Though it sounds similar, ketoacidosis is a potentially life-threatening complication of diabetes characterized by dangerously high blood acid concentrations. Discover the differences between ketosis and ketoacidosis and learn how to monitor ketone levels to stay within a safe range. Though often used interchangeably, ketosis and ketoacidosis are profoundly different conditions. Ketosis can benefit health and is induced by fasting or a low-carb diet. Contrarily, ketoacidosis is a severe metabolic imbalance affecting primarily type 1 diabetics that can lead to high blood sugar levels, coma, and even death. Let’s take a look at the differences between ketosis and ketoacidosis. ### **What is ketosis?** Ketosis, or nutritional ketosis, is a metabolic state of fat-burning in which the body breaks down dietary or stored body fat to generate energy instead of using sugar as a fuel source. This process typically occurs during prolonged fasting or when carbohydrate intake is limited to no more than 50 grams daily, which can be achieved by following a ketogenic diet. Within a few days of lowering carbohydrate intake, glycogen, a storage form of glucose, is depleted. As a result, the liver starts to burn fats and releases large amounts of ketone bodies, which are natural acids that circulate in the bloodstream and supply energy to cells. Ketosis may cause temporary side effects, widely known as the keto-flu, when first starting a ketogenic diet. Signs of ketosis include symptoms such as: \* Nausea \* Dizziness \* Fatigue \* Headaches \* Constipation \* Diarrhea \* Bad breath \* [Rashes](https://www.drberg.com/blog/what-is-keto-rash) \* Insomnia \* Brain fog \* Carb and sugar cravings \* Irritability Not everyone will experience adverse

## How Long Does It Take to Get into Ketosis? If you recently started the ketogenic diet, you may wonder how long it takes to get into ketosis. Restricting carb intake shifts your metabolism into a fat-burning mode which triggers profound changes in how your cells generate energy. While you can reach ketosis within a few days, it can take your body up to a month to fully adapt to using ketones as a primary fuel source. Let’s look at how long it takes to get into ketosis and what steps you can take to speed up your keto-adaptation. ## **How long does it take to get into ketosis?** How long it takes to enter ketosis and fully adapt to using ketones as a primary fuel source depends on several factors, including your previous diet, metabolic flexibility, body weight, and whether you are doing Healthy Keto® or a dirty keto diet. _“Most people achieve ketosis within a few days and are fully keto-adapted within a month,”_ says Dr. Berg. _“However, in some cases, it can take up to six weeks to adjust to the profound metabolic changes of keto.”_ If you have consistently restricted your carb intake and start to experience mental clarity, stable moods, diminished hunger sensations, and no longer have carb cravings, you most likely have entered ketosis, and your body adapted to using ketones as an energy source. Watch the video below to learn how long it can take for your body to adapt to keto.## **What is the ketogenic diet?** The ketogenic diet is a low-carb, moderate-protein, and high-fat diet that primes your metabolism to burn fat instead of carbs as a fuel source. Keto’s low-carb dietary pattern significantly limits the body’s ability to utilize blood glucose as a primary fuel source which triggers the breakdown of fat to generate energy. ## **How do you get into ketosis?** As your body breaks down fat, the liver generates large quantities of ketone bodies, a by-product

## Ovary Body Type Explained: Causes and Solutions Are you struggling to lose weight? It may be time to change your approach. If you have an ovary body type, this article is for you. Focusing on a diet specific to your body type can make all the difference. If you gain weight in your lower body and are experiencing symptoms associated with high levels of estrogen, you may have the ovary body type. ![Ovary body type](https://www.drberg.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/liposuction-body-slim-hips-thin-waist.jpg?w=800) ## **The five body types explained** Let’s take a look at the five hormonal body types. ### **The liver body type** The [liver body type](https://www.drberg.com/blog/the-liver-body-type) is most easily identified by a protruding pot belly. If you have a liver body type, you will likely have low levels of the human growth hormone (HGH). Human growth hormone is important for fat-burning, so when your levels are low, weight loss becomes more difficult. This body type results from a fatty liver, cirrhosis, or inflammation of the liver, like hepatitis. This can come from a virus, alcoholism, or even non-alcoholic fatty liver disease. If you have a liver body type, it can be helpful to minimize your alcohol intake. ### **The adrenal body type** The [adrenal body type](https://www.drberg.com/blog/adrenal-body-type-fix) can be characterized by a sagging belly and isn’t necessarily diet-related. If you have this body type, your adrenal glands produce high levels of cortisol–the stress hormone. Adrenal body types have issues with their response to stress, which is why diets won’t always work. This can result in trouble sleeping, the inability to feel calm, memory issues, and other stress-related issues. To lose weight faster and get your adrenal glands to stop producing excess cortisol, focus on reducing stress by getting enough sleep, walking, and consuming plenty of vegetables. ### **The ovary body type** Ovary body types experience weight gain in the hips, thighs,

## The Liver Body Type–Explanation and Symptoms Individuals with a liver body type are at increased risk of belly fat, metabolic issues, and hormonal imbalances, all of which can lead to poor health and well-being. However, various health issues associated with this hormonal body type can be managed by making the right dietary and lifestyle changes. Here’s how to support a liver body type to improve your health, shed excess weight, and regain your energy and confidence. ## **The five body types explained** There are five primary hormonal body types, including liver, adrenal, thyroid, ovary, and pancreas body types, each linked to different patterns of fat storage and health challenges. Here’s an overview of all [five body types](https://www.drberg.com/blog/what-is-your-body-type) and what they can mean for your health. ### **1. Liver body type** The liver body type is most commonly seen in men and is often characterized by a protruding belly. This abdominal fat is typically linked to underlying liver issues such as cirrhosis or non-alcoholic fatty liver disease. Individuals with this body type may also often have lower levels of human growth hormone (HGH), a key metabolic hormone for fat metabolism and energy regulation. When HGH is suppressed, which is often related to a high-carb diet, chronic stress, and elevated estrogen levels, it can become more difficult to burn fat, particularly around the midsection. Supporting liver function through dietary changes, quality sleep, and reduced alcohol intake may help restore hormonal balance and promote overall health in those with a liver body type. ### **2. Adrenal body type** The [adrenal body type](https://www.drberg.com/blog/adrenal-body-type-fix) is often characterized by a soft, sagging belly, which is commonly linked to chronic stress rather than poor diet. This body type is influenced by adrenal hormone imbalances, especially cortisol, which is the body’s primary stress hormone. When cortisol levels remain

## How to Lose Belly Fat — 6 Tips Struggling with stubborn belly fat? You’re not alone. Knowing how to lose belly fat can be tough, as your body often resists fat loss due to natural survival mechanisms. Poor dieting practices, stress, and unhealthy lifestyle habits can exacerbate the issue, leading to cravings, hormonal imbalances, and stalled weight loss. Explore the science behind how your body stores fat and discover six practical tips to get rid of belly fat and achieve the healthy weight you’ve been aiming for. ## **What causes belly fat?** Excess belly fat often reflects deeper imbalances in your body’s ability to burn fat, which is often related to dietary and lifestyle habits. A common root cause is insulin resistance, a metabolic imbalance in which your cells stop responding properly to insulin, a hormone that regulates blood sugar and stimulates fat storage. To compensate, the pancreas secretes more insulin. As insulin levels rise, your body stores more fat, particularly visceral fat around the organs, while inhibiting the use of stored fat for energy. Other contributors include chronic stress, poor sleep, and inflammatory foods, which can lead to hormonal imbalances that keep the body in fat-storage mode. Over time, this can lead to increased abdominal fat, a slower metabolism, systemic inflammation, and a higher body fat percentage, even if you eat relatively little. Additionally, visceral belly fat is hormonally active and increases levels of estrogen and other hormones that perpetuate weight gain, particularly in the lower abdomen and hips. This creates a feedback loop that makes it difficult to lose fat without addressing the underlying hormonal imbalances. Watch the video below to learn some of the best strategies to burn body fat.## **Hormones and fat-burning** The three primary hormones determining whether your body burns or stores fat are

## Can Kids Fast? Safe Fasting Tips for Children Fasting is a popular practice to support weight loss and improve metabolic health in adults, so can kids fast? No, it’s generally not recommended that kids, especially pre-pubescent children, practice fasting due to the increased energy and nutrient requirements of developing bodies. Here’s how kids can benefit from intermittent fasting principles without skipping meals or restricting calories. ## **What is intermittent fasting?** Fasting is a century-old religious or cultural practice that involves abstaining from food or drink for designated periods. Intermittent fasting is an adaptation of this practice, characterized by cycling between time-restricted fasting and eating windows. It’s recognized for its potential to enhance metabolic health, support weight loss, and improve overall well-being. During fasting periods, reduced calorie intake forces the metabolism to use stored body fat as fuel to generate energy rather than relying on sugar and carbohydrates. As fat is metabolized, the liver generates ketones, a lipid-derived group of organic acids that serve as a highly efficient alternative energy source. Fasting triggers profound metabolic changes and impacts how your body utilizes energy. This not only promotes a healthy body weight but has also been linked to a reduced risk of diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and neurodegenerative conditions. Watch the video below to learn if intermittent fasting is safe for kids.## **Can kids fast?** Intermittent fasting has become a popular strategy that has helped millions of adults lose weight, improve metabolic functions, and enhance cognitive health. However, fasting isn’t suitable for infants, toddlers, younger children, and pre-pubescent kids as they’re at particular risk of not meeting their bodies’ energy demands if they skip meals or restrict calories.

## Feeling Cold While Fasting: Causes and Solutions Feeling cold during a fast is a common experience, and it’s a sign that your body is making important metabolic shifts. As you begin to burn fat for fuel, blood flow is redirected toward fat stores, and your digestive system goes into rest mode, all of which can reduce internal heat production. Discover why it’s normal to feel cold while fasting and learn simple strategies to stay warm during periods of caloric restriction. ## **What is fasting?** Fasting involves the voluntary abstinence from all foods and calorie-containing beverages, allowing the body to reset and shift its focus from digestion to restoration and fat burning. The length of a fast can vary widely, lasting from several hours to several days, depending on your goals. One of the most popular and sustainable approaches is [intermittent fasting](https://www.drberg.com/blog/the-most-important-intermittent-fasting-basics-for-beginners-must-watch-dr-berg), which alternates between periods of eating and fasting. A common method is the 18:6 schedule, characterized by fasting for 18 hours and eating within a six-hour window. During periods of calorie restriction, the body shifts from using readily available glucose to tapping into stored body fat for energy once glycogen reserves are depleted. This natural transition into a metabolic state referred to as ketosis encourages the breakdown of fat, which can lead to reduced fat mass. Many people also experience more consistent energy and improved focus as the brain begins to efficiently use ketones, a byproduct of fat metabolism, for fuel. Other [prolonged fasting](https://www.drberg.com/blog/amazing-benefits-of-prolonged-fasting) routines, such as 24-hour or 48-hour fasts, can deepen ketosis and accelerate the body’s fat-burning processes. These extended fasts give the digestive system more time to rest and may further enhance metabolic flexibility, allowing the body to switch more efficiently between using

## 8 Benefits of OMAD (One Meal a Day) OMAD (one meal a day) is an intermittent fasting method allowing a one-hour eating window per day. It’s often used to achieve significant weight loss and can provide other health benefits, including improved digestion, energy, and mental clarity. Let’s look at eight benefits of OMAD, learn how to get started, and discover the potential risks of intermittent fasting and reduced meal frequency. ## **What is OMAD?** One meal a day, widely known as OMAD, is a type of intermittent fasting that restricts calorie intake to one meal per day. Also known as the 23:1 method, OMAD involves 23 hours of fasting followed by a one-hour eating window. When practicing OMAD, all of the daily calorie needs are consumed during the non-fasting hour, which helps trigger ketosis. This metabolic state pushes the body to burn fat instead of sugar as a fuel source. Ketosis not only promotes fat burning and helps lose weight but also has profound health benefits beyond weight loss. Watch the video below to learn more about the benefits of intermittent fasting and OMAD.## **8 benefits of eating only one meal a day** Besides losing weight, OMAD is associated with many potential health benefits, including improved digestion, enhanced moods, and stronger immune defenses. Here’s an in-depth look at eight incredible benefits of eating only one meal daily. ### **1. Promotes healthy digestion** Fasting for most of the day allows the digestive system to rest. This can help reduce gastrointestinal irritation and inflammation linked to food sensitivities, especially in those with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) or other gastrointestinal disorders. A study published in the _International Journal of Behavioral Medicine_ investigated the effects of fasting therapy in IBS patients and summarized, \_“Fasting significantly improved symptoms such as abdominal

## Best Time to Eat OMAD: Key Insights for Success One meal a day (OMAD) is an intermittent fasting approach that’s becoming increasingly popular due to its powerful benefits for metabolic health, blood sugar balance, and weight management. While the best time to eat OMAD may depend on your daily routine, aligning your eating window with your body’s natural hormonal rhythms can help you get the most out of this meal pattern. Discover the ideal timing of eating just one meal daily and learn practical tips to help you start and stay consistent with the OMAD diet. ## **What is OMAD?** OMAD stands for one meal a day and is a type of [intermittent fasting](https://www.drberg.com/blog/acceptable-snacks-inside-your-eating-window-with-intermittent-fasting) schedule that involves consuming all your daily caloric needs within one hour. This eating pattern focuses on having one large meal each day, typically at the same time, while fasting for the remaining 23 hours. Some people follow the OMAD routine daily, while others choose to do OMAD every other day, a slightly more extreme version that alternates between a full day of fasting and a day when only one large meal is consumed. OMAD allows for extended periods of caloric restriction, which has profound benefits for metabolic health and hormonal balance and has helped many people reach and maintain their weight goals. This approach to intermittent fasting is also becoming increasingly popular among individuals with busy schedules who prefer a more structured and minimal approach to eating. While OMAD requires thoughtful planning to meet daily caloric and nutritional needs, limiting food preparation to only one meal a day saves time, reduces decision fatigue, and simplifies your daily eating routine. Watch the video below to discover the best time to do OMAD.## **Benefits of OMAD** Prolonged periods of caloric restriction

## Top Benefits of Prolonged Fasting Today Prolonged fasting, typically lasting between 36 and 72 hours, has become increasingly popular due to its potential to enhance fat burning and promote weight loss. However, the advantages of extended periods of caloric restriction go far beyond shedding a few pounds, as prolonged fasts may also help reduce inflammation and boost mental clarity. Discover five potential health benefits of prolonged fasting and learn how it can help boost your energy and revitalize your body and mind. ## **What is prolonged fasting?** Prolonged fasting involves avoiding all caloric food and beverages for an extended period, usually lasting between 36 and 72 hours, or even longer. During this time, the body is forced to tap into its own energy reserves to generate energy and begins to utilize glycogen, a stored form of blood sugar located in the liver and muscle tissue. Once glycogen stores are depleted, the body shifts to [burning fat](https://www.drberg.com/blog/how-to-burn-fat-step-by-step-formula) for energy. This releases large amounts of ketones, a group of organic acids that serve as a highly effective alternative fuel source. When ketones enter the circulation and start fueling your cells, the body enters a metabolic state known as ketosis, linked to steady energy levels, mental clarity, and various other beneficial health effects. In addition, a lack of food intake decreases the release of insulin, a key metabolic hormone that regulates blood sugar levels and promotes fat storage. This is confirmed by a study published in the _American Journal of Physiology_, which found that over the course of a 36-hour fast, the body produces less insulin, which is associated with weight loss and better metabolic health.1 Watch the video below to learn more about the amazing benefits of prolonged fasting.

## Best Food to Break a Fast: What to Eat First Fasting is a powerful tool for improving health and well-being as it allows your digestive system to reset, supports detoxification, and helps enhance metabolic functions. However, how you break your fast can either enhance the benefits of caloric restriction or increase the risk of digestive discomfort, blood sugar fluctuations, and electrolyte imbalances. Learn about the best food to break a fast to restore energy, replenish nutrients, and minimize the risk of adverse effects. ## **What is a prolonged fast?** A prolonged fast generally involves fasting for 48 hours or longer, unlike shorter fasts, such as intermittent fasting or a [one meal a day (OMAD)](https://www.drberg.com/blog/23-benefits-of-one-meal-a-day?queryID=e66b2cafb9868166d003e614e9ac449d\&objectID=blog_1424) regimen. Prolonged fasting can help reset the digestive system, support immunity, and promote a healthy body weight. It also encourages a deeper state of ketosis, which enhances the body’s ability to utilize stored fat to generate energy. Extended periods of caloric restriction also stimulate autophagy, a process in which the body breaks down and recycles damaged cells, which promotes cellular repair and enhances overall health. In addition, prolonged fasting can be an excellent way to jumpstart your body’s natural healing processes and support metabolic flexibility. This may explain why fasting is associated with a lower risk of obesity, insulin resistance, and diabetes. However, a prolonged fast should be approached with caution, as it places your body under controlled stress to trigger metabolic changes. While this can have many health benefits, it also requires careful management to avoid potential health issues. ### **Tips for a successful prolonged fast** You can take several proactive measures to help ensure a successful prolonged fast.

## What Breaks a Fast? Foods and Drinks Explained Intermittent fasting is a highly effective weight-loss tool with various other impressive health benefits. However, many people practicing fasting are unsure of what breaks a fast and what doesn’t. Discover what foods and beverages you can consume during fasting without interfering with fat-burning or ketosis. ## **What will break a fast?** What will break a fasting period depends on the exact type of fast you are practicing and how you define breaking a fast. For example, [dry fasting](https://www.drberg.com/blog/why-i-don-t-recommend-water-fasting) is a strict fast that avoids the intake of all foods and beverages, including water, and consuming any fluids or calories breaks this type of fast. In contrast, water fasting permits hydration with plain water. However, eating or drinking anything else, including beverages with zero calories, will technically break this fasting practice. An [intermittent fasting](https://www.drberg.com/blog/the-most-important-intermittent-fasting-basics-for-beginners-must-watch-dr-berg) plan is a somewhat more flexible approach to time-restricted eating. It allows the intake of certain foods and beverages as long as they don’t raise blood sugar levels and contain very few calories. Fasting is characterized by calorie restriction, which induces a metabolic state that shifts the body to using stored energy as a fuel source. This promotes weight loss and releases [ketones](https://www.drberg.com/blog/doing-keto-but-no-ketones-in-urine-heres-why), a metabolic by-product of fat burning that serves as an alternative energy source. When ketones begin to fuel your cells, your body enters the metabolic state of ketosis. Not only is ketosis linked to weight loss, but it also supports hormonal balance, promotes metabolic health, increases energy, and enhances cognitive functions. Any food or beverage that raises blood sugar levels will trigger the release of insulin, a crucial hormone that regulates

Learn more about refeeding syndrome and how to safely break a prolonged fast to minimize the risk of adverse health effects. Refeeding syndrome is a dangerous and potentially life-threatening condition that can develop when a person who is malnourished resumes eating after prolonged starvation. It’s characterized by a sudden shift of electrolytes, resulting in either fluid overload or severe dehydration, potentially causing heart failure, respiratory distress, and neurological issues as the body struggles to process the rapid influx of nutrients. _“Refeeding syndrome is rare but can cause the rapid movement of nutrients into the cells,”_ explains Dr. Berg. _“After prolonged fasting, overeating causes a surge of nutrients, which can lead to a severe electrolyte imbalance and trigger symptoms such as fainting and arrhythmia.”_ Typically, the body metabolizes carbohydrates from food to generate energy for the cells. However, during starvation, the liver uses stored body fat and muscle tissue as primary energy sources. During periods of prolonged severe caloric restriction, metabolic processes slow significantly, leading to reduced production of stomach acid, digestive enzymes, and certain metabolic hormones. When refeeding begins, the body attempts to metabolize food normally, pulling excessive concentrations of electrolytes and nutrients into the cells, which can overwhelm cellular functions and lead to critical physiological imbalances. Severely malnourished patients frequently suffer from deficiencies in multiple nutrients, resulting in a range of

## The Ultimate Guide to Safe Dry Fasting Explained Dry Fasting, rooted in ancient spiritual traditions, is a method as old as it can be challenging. However, when approached correctly, this age-old technique can unlock a multitude of health advantages. Let’s look at the potential health benefits, risks, and safety concerns associated with practicing an advanced fasting method such as a dry fast. ## **What is dry fasting?** Dry fasting, also known as absolute fasting, is a technique that involves total calorie restriction as well as abstaining from all liquids. ### **Soft vs. hard dry fasting** There are two variations of dry fasting: soft and hard. The main difference between these two techniques is the amount of water intake and exposure allowed during the fast. A soft dry fast allows for certain types of water exposure primarily in relation to hygienic habits such as taking a shower or brushing teeth, whereas a hard dry fast is much more restrictive, prohibiting all water exposure during the fasting period. Watch this video to learn more about the risks and benefits of dry fasting.## **Benefits of dry fasting** Dry fasting is a popular method to lose weight and has been shown to offer several other health benefits. A 2022 study published in _Metabolism Open_ focused on individuals with metabolic syndrome, a condition marked by insulin resistance, elevated blood pressure, and abdominal obesity, who engaged in Ramadan fasting.1 Comparative blood samples after a four-week fasting period demonstrated improvements in various health markers, including: \* Blood pressure \* Cholesterol levels \* Inflammation \* Insulin resistance \* Liver function \* Regulation of circadian rhythms \* Waist circumference \* Body mass index \* Weight loss Furthermore, research published in _Nature_ on dusk to dawn dry fasting also highlighted benefits such

## How I Lost 50 Pounds with Keto and Intermittent Fasting – Johanna's Story **Name:** Johanna **Age:** 35 **Location:** Finland, Europe In April 2022, I discovered Dr. Berg on YouTube. One of his videos, _“6 Things That Make You Look Younger,”_ introduced the concept that **keto and intermittent fasting together** might be the only effective way to diet. That statement grabbed my attention. I had tried both approaches separately in the past, but neither had produced real results. ### My Turning Point By May 2022, after a year of struggling with unexplained weight gain, I decided to follow Dr. Berg’s advice and **combine keto with intermittent fasting**. I had always weighed around 70-75 kg (155-165 lbs) since middle school, and after my pregnancy in 2014, I returned to the same weight. At 175 cm tall (about 5’8″), I thought I was doing everything right: avoiding junk food, eating healthy, even going to the gym. Still, **my belly fat and love handles wouldn’t budge**. Bread especially made me feel bloated. But just over a year ago, my weight started rising rapidly–**I gained 20 kg (about 45 lbs) in six months**, hitting 90 kg (200 lbs). Along with the weight gain came **severe water retention in my feet** and **hair loss**. I hadn’t changed my eating or activity habits, so doctors were puzzled. Bloodwork didn’t reveal much–except for **extremely low ferritin levels**–and the only advice I got was that I might be consuming too many calories for my activity level. Even after restricting my diet, I couldn’t lose the weight. That’s when Dr. Berg’s guidance made all the difference. ### The Transformation Once I started following his method, the results came fast. Within the first week, I felt significantly lighter. As the weeks turned into months, I continued to lose weight without feeling hungry or deprived. I binge-watched Dr. Berg’s videos and implemented everything I learned. My daily meals became consistent and satisfying: \* A **large salad** with feta cheese, extra

## From Sweet Tooth to Sugar-Free: My Keto Journey from India By Udit Gupta, Age 28 **Dear Dr. Berg,** I recently saw in one of your videos that we could submit our keto success stories, so I thought to send mine to you in detail. ### A Bit About Me I am a 28-year-old male from India, recently happily married, and I love food, traveling, and health. I’ve always had a sweet tooth and felt it was just a part of me. I’ve been chubby (we call it being on the “healthier side” in India) since puberty. However, five years ago, when I was 23, my weight increased to **97 kg**. Despite numerous gym memberships over the years, I only got down to **91 kg**. Not understanding the core concept of fixing our bodies always meant my weight would go back to where it was. My lowest point was in **September last year**, when I hit **103 kg**. Having a pharmacy major helped me, as I was always inclined to learn more — and then I discovered your videos. \* \* \* ### How Your Videos Have Changed My Life Dr. Berg, your videos have **CHANGED** my life. For the first time since puberty, I’m sleeping happily like a child, breathing better, seeing things clearly, and thinking more clearly. Sometimes, you don’t realize you have a problem until you start living healthy — and when you see the results, you realize that maybe you weren’t living healthily before. Now I weigh **87 kg**, which is still about **10 kg** more than where I want to be — but I feel so much better, I can’t describe it in words. For the first time, I know I won’t gain the weight back, because **what I’m eating and how I’m living makes sense**. \* \* \* ### What I Did I learned about the ketogenic diet from a friend at the gym, who told me to eat only 20g of vegetables a day because veggies are carbohydrates. “Ketogenic diet” was the only thing I picked up from him. Then, after watching your videos, I realized the full **bandwidth of carbs** I’m actually allowed to eat daily on a ketogenic diet — and the **true definition** of keto.

## Intermittent Fasting That Actually Works for You Intermittent fasting is a mealtime pattern of time-restricted eating and fasting periods widely used for metabolic health benefits. In addition to promoting weight management and balanced blood sugar control, intermittent fasting may also help reduce inflammation and protect against chronic diseases such as diabetes. Discover the beneficial health effects of intermittent fasting and learn how to transition into time-restricted eating successfully. ## **What is intermittent fasting?** Different fasting routines have been practiced worldwide for millennia and are often observed at certain times of the year, such as during Ramadan or Lent. Traditional fasting, also known as periodic fasting, involves not eating for an extended period of time, typically a few days. In contrast, intermittent fasting involves consistently alternating between periods of fasting and designated eating windows. This method of time-restricted feeding is often used for weight loss, lowering blood pressure, managing blood sugar balance, and reducing the risk of various health conditions. Watch the video below to learn more about the basics of intermittent fasting.## **5 benefits of intermittent fasting** Intermittent fasting has been widely studied for its beneficial effects on weight and disease management, including conditions of the brain, heart, and gastrointestinal tract. Here are five incredible health benefits of intermittent fasting. ### **1. Boosts weight loss** Constant grazing and snacking lead to the continuous release of insulin, a metabolic hormone that helps regulate blood sugar levels. However, insulin also stimulates fat storage, which explains why snacking is a primary contributor to weight gain. During periods of fasting, blood sugar levels remain stable, reducing insulin release linked to better weight control. In addition,

## Does Keto Work? Here’s What Science Says about the Keto Diet Millions of people have adopted a ketogenic diet to achieve weight loss, improve their metabolic health, and lower their risk of heart disease. But does keto work? Yes, keto works–and research confirms that a high-fat, low-carbohydrate diet promotes a healthy body weight, increases energy, enhances cognition, and is linked to a lower risk of chronic diseases. Discover the science behind the ketogenic diet and learn why keto may be the key to longevity. ## **What is keto?** The ketogenic diet is a low-carbohydrate, moderate-protein, and high-fat diet that pushes your metabolism to burn fat instead of carbohydrates for energy. As your liver breaks down fat, it generates large quantities of ketone bodies, which are organic acids that act as highly efficient energy sources. When ketones start to build up in your circulation and begin to fuel your body, you enter a metabolic state known as ketosis. In fact, your brain, heart, and muscle cells prefer ketones as a fuel source compared to relying on sugars and carbohydrates for energy. Insulin–a key metabolic hormone that controls blood sugar levels and regulates how your body produces energy–is released in response to dietary carbs and sugars. High insulin levels stimulate fat storage and block your metabolism from burning body fat as a fuel source. Limiting carbohydrate intake to no more than 20 to 50 grams of net carbs daily and obtaining most of your calories from healthy fats keeps insulin levels low, which stimulates fat burning and triggers ketosis. Critics often point out that keto is a restrictive diet that increases the risk of nutrient deficiencies. That’s why it’s essential to do Healthy Keto®, a holistic high-fat diet that combines the metabolic benefits of ketosis with balanced nutrition. By focusing on non-GMO organic vegetables, pasture-raised eggs, full-fat organic dairy, grass-fed beef, game meats, and wild-caught fish, Healthy Keto provides

## Your Supplements Are a Lie… Really Your Supplements Are a Lie Really Have you ever felt like the institutions meant to safeguard your health are tangled up in a web of conflicts? Today’s news could prove that hunch you’ve had about the guardians of our well-being being caught in a net of competing interests. It’s all about Unveiling the Shadows: [Corruption in the FDA and Supplement Industry](https://www.drberg.com/blog/guess-which-percent-of-chemicals-in-your-food-are-self-certified-and-not-fda-approved). Yes, you heard it right. It’s a convoluted saga from undisclosed ties between drug makers and those at the helm of regulation to [dietary supplements](https://www.drberg.com/blog/do-we-need-supplements) skating by with scant scrutiny. The stakes? They couldn’t be higher. Imagine entrusting your well-being to products only for them to play roulette with your health–thanks to loopholes wider than craters on the moon. And while big pharma companies bask under regulatory sunsets crafted in their favor, consumers are left navigating a murky sea of what’s beneficial versus merely profitable. This isn’t another conspiracy theory unfolding; it’s reality knocking on our doors–a call demanding vigilance and an informed choice every time we reach out for that bottle off the shelf. ## **Unveiling the Shadows: Corruption in the FDA and Supplement Industry** The FDA and supplement industry have long danced a complex tango, shrouded not just in regulations but also, unfortunately, in corruption. This murky aspect has eclipsed consumer confidence and well-being. Let’s peel back these layers. ### **The Root Causes of Corruption** So, what feeds this beast? Two big culprits stand out: lack of oversight and juicy financial incentives.

## Xanthan Gum vs Guar Gum: Best Keto Choice Revealed Xanthan Gum vs. Guar Gum–what’s the difference, and are they keto-friendly? Both xanthan and guar gum are low-carb binding and thickening agents that serve as popular substitutes for high-carb ingredients such as flour and cornstarch. Discover the differences between xanthan gum and guar gum, comparing their nutritional value, effects on health, and suitability for maintaining ketosis. Xanthan gum was developed in the early 1960s as a biodegradable thickening agent to replace synthetic materials in various agriculture and food production applications. Today, xanthan gum has proven to be an extremely versatile ingredient that is now utilized in many industries, such as cosmetics, pharmaceuticals, and oil drilling, in addition to food production. ### **What is it?** Xanthan gum, often misspelled as xanthum gum or xantham gum, is a powdery substance produced by fermenting glucose derived primarily from corn and using a bacterial strain known as _Xanthomonas campestris_. Used as a thickener and emulsifier for liquids, xanthan gum powder serves as a highly effective substitute for gluten in carbohydrate-rich flours like wheat, rye, or barley. ### **Uses** Xanthan gum’s gluten-like properties play a prominent role in creating ketogenic and gluten-free baked goods. This enables those following carbohydrate or gluten-restrictive diets to prepare bakery items that resemble the texture and structure of their glutenous counterparts. Because xanthan gum helps bind wet and dry ingredients, it proves especially useful in gluten-free bread baking and helps make comparable wheat flour alternatives such as gluten-free biscuits, pizzas, and cakes that require elasticity and chewiness. Xanthan gum also emulsifies wet ingredients, making it an excellent choice for low-carb sauces, dressings, and pastry fillings. ### **Carbs** Two teaspoons (nine grams) of xanthan gum contains around seven grams of carbohydrates in the form of soluble

## Canola Oil vs. Vegetable Oil: What You Should Know Canola oil vs. vegetable oil-which is better for cooking, and are they healthy? While these popular cooking oils are labeled as good sources of health-promoting monounsaturated fats, consuming these ultra-processed oils may actually increase the risk of inflammation, metabolic diseases, and obesity. Learn why consuming canola and vegetable oil may harm your health and discover seven nutritious alternatives to processed seed oils. ## **Canola oil vs. vegetable oil** Due to their mild flavor and high smoke points, canola and vegetable oil are often used interchangeably in everyday cooking, including deep frying, baking, stir-frying, and sautéing. Let’s look at the nutritional values and different uses of canola oil and vegetable oil. ### **Canola oil** Canola oil is a popular cooking oil derived from the canola plant, also known as the rapeseed plant. It has a mild taste and a high smoke point, meaning it can be heated to 470 degrees F (240 degrees C) without breaking down, which explains why it’s the most commonly used frying oil in the restaurant industry. According to the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA), a serving of one tablespoon of canola oil contains:1 \* 124 calories \* 0 g protein \* 14 g total fat \* 1 g saturated fat \* 9 g monounsaturated fat \* 4 g polyunsaturated fat \* 0 g carbohydrates Canola oil comprises 100 percent fatty acids and contains no essential vitamins or minerals except for negligible amounts of vitamins E and K. Despite its poor nutrition profile, canola is marketed as a heart-healthy option due to its high monounsaturated and low saturated fat content. ### **Vegetable oil** Vegetable oil is typically derived from soybeans. However, many brands use a vegetable oil blend containing other grain or seed-derived oils such as corn, sunflower, safflower, peanuts, or cottonseed. Soybean vegetable oil has a neutral flavor and a smoke point of 460

## 10 Foods High in Vitamin C – The Best Natural Sources Vitamin C is a water-soluble vitamin found in various plant-based and fermented foods. Its powerful antioxidant properties are linked to improved immunity, better skin health, and a lower risk of cardiovascular disease. Discover ten foods high in vitamin C and learn how to boost the absorption of this essential vitamin naturally for maximum health benefits. ## **What is vitamin C?** Ascorbic acid, widely known as vitamin C, is a water-soluble nutrient, meaning it isn’t stored in the body in large amounts. Due to humans’ inability to synthesize vitamin C, it must be regularly obtained from foods to support several biological functions, which explains why it’s classified as an essential vitamin. Vitamin C plays a vital role in regenerative pathways, which is the body’s process of healing damage and restoring optimal function of cells, tissues, and organs. Watch the video below to discover the incredible benefits of vitamin C for immune function.## **10 foods high in vitamin C** Though trace amounts of vitamin C can be obtained from certain animal products, including raw liver, fish roe, and eggs, vitamin C is primarily sourced from plant-based foods such as fruits and vegetables. Here are ten of the top food sources rich in vitamin C. ### **1. Lemons and limes** One medium-sized lemon provides around 34 milligrams (mg) of vitamin C, meaning a serving size of two tablespoons, or half a lemon, contains approximately 17 mg. Additionally, one cup of [freshly squeezed lemon juice](https://www.drberg.com/blog/is-store-bought-lemon-juice-rich-in-vitamin-c-not-quite) contains 112 mg of vitamin C, which is how much you would need to make six cups (1.5 quarts) of lemonade.

## 15 Signs You Are Iron Deficient Iron deficiency is characterized by low serum iron levels and typically results from chronic blood loss, poor nutrition, or malabsorptive conditions. Inadequate dietary iron intake can lead to anemia and related symptoms such as fatigue, cognitive dysfunction, and a discolored or unhealthy appearance. Discover 15 signs you are iron deficient and learn about the best natural iron sources to prevent anemia and protect your health. ## **15 signs you are iron deficient** Iron is an essential trace mineral critical for various physiological processes, and a deficiency can significantly impact the body’s ability to function optimally. Here are 15 signs of iron deficiency. ### **1. Chronic fatigue** Fatigue that isn’t alleviated with rest or sleep is one of the most common symptoms of iron deficiency. Iron is vital for hemoglobin synthesis, the protein in red blood cells that carries oxygen throughout the body. Without enough oxygen, tissues and muscles become deprived, leading to fatigue. ### **2. Rapid breathing** Individuals with iron deficiency often have shortness of breath and a rapid breathing rate, likely due to the body attempting to increase oxygen levels in the blood. This symptom typically worsens with physical activity. ### **3. Low endurance** Inadequate iron levels can cause exercise intolerance, especially on inclines such as stairs and hills. With less oxygen reaching the muscles, their endurance and performance decline. ### **4. Poor memory** Iron is a critical nutrient for brain development, learning, and memory, which explains why low levels of this essential mineral can trigger brain fog and cognitive issues. Additionally, chronic iron deficiency anemia has been linked to an increased risk of dementia and [Alzheimer’s disease](https://www.drberg.com/blog/what-causes-alzheimers-disease). ### **5.

## 2 Natural Remedies for Sinus Infections (Sinusitis) For people who struggle with sinusitis or sinus infections, learning about natural remedies can be extremely helpful. Learn how to combat [chronic sinusitis](https://www.drberg.com/blog/two-reasons-for-chronic-sinus-congestion) with natural remedies so you no longer have to suffer from sinus infections. ### **The Complexity of Chronic Sinusitis** Treating chronic sinus problems is not always straightforward due to their complex nature. Your physician might prescribe antibiotics for immediate relief, but this approach has limitations. #### **Avoiding Antibiotic Overuse** Frequent use of antibiotics could lead to an overgrowth of fungi post-treatment since these drugs primarily kill all bacteria, good and bad, without targeting fungi effectively. In addition, this treatment strategy does little against stubborn biofilm formations within your sinuses. ### **Natural Remedies: A Better Approach?** It would help if you had effective strategies beyond conventional antibiotics to manage such complicated conditions. Natural remedies may be worth considering here. ## **The Role of Nasal Irrigation in Treating Sinus Infections** Let’s delve into the world of nasal irrigation. A potent weapon against sinus infections, this natural remedy is all about rinsing your nasal passages with a saline solution. ### **Purchasing Pre-Made Solutions** For those not interested in DIY, pre-made solutions are available to help prevent the formation of biofilm shields for bacteria and fungi. It’s not just about clearing mucus buildup from our stuffy noses. This process can also inhibit biofilm formation – those pesky calcium structures that shield bacteria and fungi from antibiotics. A surprising benefit? The ability to kill fungus naturally without side effects. ## **Kimchi Juice as an Effective Remedy** If you’re seeking natural remedies for sinus infections, consider kimchi juice.

## 24-Hour Fasting Benefits and Risks A 24-hour fast is a popular form of intermittent fasting that offers impressive health benefits. Extended periods of calorie restriction push your metabolism to burn stored body fat as a fuel source, which supports healthy body weight and is linked to a lower risk of insulin resistance and heart disease. Learn how to get started with prolonged fasting and discover why a 24-hour fast can have profound anti-aging effects. ## **What is a 24-hour fast?** A 24-hour fast involves abstaining from all foods and only drinking zero-calorie beverages such as water or unsweetened herbal teas for 24 hours. While some people do a [24-hour fas](https://www.drberg.com/blog/24-hour-fasting-benefits)t once a week to lower their overall calorie intake, others practice this type of fast once a month or whenever needed. Extended periods of fasting flip a metabolic switch that pushes your metabolism to convert body fat into energy. As your liver breaks down stored fats, it generates large amounts of ketones, a by-product of fat-burning and a very efficient energy source. When your cells begin to utilize ketones as a primary fuel source, your metabolism enters a state known as ketosis. Ketosis doesn’t just help you lose weight but has profound benefits for cellular and metabolic health. [Intermittent fasting](https://www.drberg.com/blog/the-most-important-intermittent-fasting-basics-for-beginners-must-watch-dr-berg) plans, such as 24-hour fasting and 16:8–16 hours of fasting followed by an eight-hour eating window–have gained popularity due to their potential benefits, including improved blood sugar control, enhanced cellular repair processes, and healthy brain function. In fact, research published in _Nutrients_ concludes, _“24-hour fasting may result in decreased insulin resistance, increased lipid metabolism, decreased weight and body fat, lower levels of depression, and increased cognitive performance.”_&#x31;

## What Is the Glucose Ketone Index (GKI)? Those following a ketogenic diet are familiar with testing ketone and blood sugar levels to monitor ketosis. However, factors such as stress and poor sleep can affect the validity of ketone and glucose readings. The glucose ketone index (GKI) provides a more accurate representation of your metabolic health by measuring the ratio of glucose to ketone concentrations in the blood. Discover how the GKI can help evaluate your metabolic health and how to improve your glucose-to-ketone ratios. ## **What is the glucose keto index (GKI)?** Glucose, or blood sugar, is the body’s main source of energy. However, when carbohydrate intake is limited, the body shifts to ketosis, a metabolic state in which fat is used as the primary fuel source. During ketosis, the liver breaks down fat, releasing a group of organic acids known as ketones. These ketones serve as highly effective alternative fuel sources when glucose is scarce. Ketosis can be triggered by fasting or by following a ketogenic diet. This low-carb diet restricts dietary carbohydrate intake to no more than 50 grams of net carbs daily while obtaining the majority of calories from healthy fats. Many keto dieters monitor their blood sugar levels to determine their metabolic state, and blood glucose readings between 60 and 80 milligrams per deciliter (mg/dL) typically indicate ketosis. However, monitoring ketone concentrations in addition to glucose levels provides a clearer picture of the depth of your ketosis. _“It’s crucial to monitor your ketone and glucose levels closely if you’re using ketosis to manage health conditions, as this helps ensure the effectiveness of your approach,”_ explains Dr. Berg. The glucose ketone index, widely known as GKI, is a metric that calculates the ratio of ketones to glucose, providing more accurate insight into your metabolic health. GKI was first introduced as a method to evaluate the therapeutic effects of the ketogenic diet in brain cancer

## Exogenous Ketones: What Are They and Do They Work? Endogenous ketones are organic acids released as a by-product of fat-burning when the body is in a metabolic state of ketosis. In contrast, exogenous ketones are synthetically manufactured ketone bodies widely available as nutritional supplements. Here’s the difference between exogenous and endogenous ketones and why synthetic ketone bodies don’t have the same health benefits as those generated during ketosis. ## **What are ketones?** Ketones, or ketone bodies, are organic acids produced by the liver during ketosis, a metabolic state in which the body burns fat for energy instead of relying on glucose as its primary fuel source. The breakdown of dietary and stored body fat releases large amounts of ketones, which serve as a highly effective alternative fuel that enters the bloodstream and supplies energy to the body’s tissues and cells. Acetoacetate and beta-hydroxybutyrate (BHB) are the two most abundant ketones produced during fat-burning, though acetone is another ketone body created during ketosis. Watch the video below to learn why exogenous ketones may hinder weight loss.## **Exogenous ketones vs. endogenous ketones** Ketosis and ketone production can be triggered by fasting routines, including prolonged and intermittent fasting and dietary carbohydrate restriction, such as a low-carb diet. This limits the availability of blood sugar as the primary fuel source and shifts the body into fat-burning mode. Ketone bodies naturally produced during ketosis are called endogenous ketones, which are released as the body utilizes fat to generate energy. Ketones that are synthetically manufactured and obtained through supplementation are referred to as exogenous ketones, which are typically available as ketone salts and ketone esters. Ketone salts are produced by binding BHB ketones to mineral salts, such as sodium,

## Why You Should Avoid Carb Cycling on Keto Carb cycling is a popular dietary pattern, particularly among athletes, that alternates between high-carb days and low-carb days. Eating more carbs on certain days is also a strategy often used by individuals new to a high-fat ketogenic diet to feel less restricted and boost energy. However, carb cycling is unsustainable on keto and may slow down your health and fitness success. Discover the truth behind carb cycling on keto and learn how to get back on track after a carb-laden cheat day quickly. ## **What is carb cycling?** Carb cycling is a dieting strategy commonly used by endurance athletes and bodybuilders. This approach intends to reach fitness goals and optimize physique by alternating between low-carb and high-carb days, widely known as carb loading. Dietary carbohydrates are converted into blood sugar, which serves as the body’s primary fuel source. Blood sugar that isn’t immediately used is stored as glycogen in reserves located in the liver and skeletal muscles. On low-carb days, blood sugar and glycogen stores are depleted. This pushes the body into ketosis, a metabolic state characterized by utilizing fat to generate energy instead of using sugar as a fuel source. On high-carb days, blood sugar levels rise, and glycogen stores are replenished, which stops ketosis and fat-burning. It’s widely believed that this is beneficial for building muscle and providing sustainable energy. In addition, carb loading has become more common in individuals following a low-carb diet such as keto, a practice also known as cyclical keto. Cyclical keto involves eating a strict ketogenic diet for several days, followed by 1 to 3 days of consuming a high-carbohydrate diet. This method is used to induce fat-burning without feeling deprived of high-carb foods. For example, some keto dieters limit carbohydrate intake to between 20 and 50 grams of net carbs five days a week and consume more than 50 grams on the weekend. However, carb

## What Are Lazy Keto Meals, and Are They Healthy? The ketogenic diet limits carbs and prioritizes fat to boost weight loss, but what are lazy keto meals, and are they healthy? Lazy keto is a more lenient version of the traditional keto diet that tracks net carbohydrate intake while being less strict about protein and fat consumption. Learn about the potential downsides of a lazy keto diet and discover 11 simple but nutritious lazy keto recipes. ## **What is lazy keto?** Lazy keto is a less restrictive version of the traditional keto diet. While keto dieters track carbohydrates, protein, and fat intake, those following lazy keto only monitor carb consumption. _“Lazy keto means that you’re not counting calories or monitoring ketones,”_ explains Dr. Berg. _“However, you still eat a low-carb diet, keeping carbohydrates below 50 grams of net carbs per day.”_ Low-carb diets aim to put the body in ketosis, a metabolic state characterized by burning fat as a primary fuel source instead of sugar. However, the less rigorous approach of lazy keto doesn’t always achieve consistent ketosis, potentially leading to varying weight loss and health outcomes. Watch the video below to learn more about the difference between lazy keto and dirty keto.## **Is lazy keto healthy?** The ketogenic diet has various impressive health benefits, such as improving insulin sensitivity, promoting healthy blood sugar levels, and reducing the risk of obesity and diabetes. Though lazy keto isn’t as strict as the regular keto diet, it has various advantages. The biggest benefit of lazy keto is its flexibility, as you only need to track your daily net carbs while eating fats, proteins, and non-starchy vegetables to satisfaction. This makes lazy keto a sustainable diet that can help transition to a stricter ketogenic diet later on. Limiting carb intake has profound cognitive benefits, can help you lose

## Is Keto a Gluten-Free Diet? Is keto gluten-free? This is a common question for those trying to combine a ketogenic and a gluten-free lifestyle. While a low-carb diet naturally limits or avoids gluten-containing grains, it’s important to choose keto-friendly ingredients labeled explicitly as gluten-free to avoid cross-contamination or hidden sources of gluten. Understanding how to effectively combine these two dietary approaches is crucial for those with gluten sensitivity or celiac disease who are considering a ketogenic diet. ## **What is gluten?** Gluten is a group of proteins found in grains such as wheat, barley, and rye. It provides structure and elasticity to dough, helping it rise and maintain its shape. While many people consume gluten without issues, it can cause significant problems for others, especially those with celiac disease. Celiac disease is an autoimmune condition characterized by overt immune responses to gluten, which lead to intestinal inflammation and damage to the small intestinal lining. Beyond celiac disease, non-celiac gluten sensitivity (NCGS) affects many individuals, causing symptoms such as bloating, gas, diarrhea, and constipation, as well as fatigue and behavioral changes in response to consuming gluten. Interestingly, the way gluten is processed in modern food production can affect its impact on health. For example, more traditional methods of fermenting and leavening certain breads, such as sourdough, can partially break down gluten, potentially making them better tolerated by individuals with mild gluten sensitivities. Research published in _Applied and Environmental Microbiology_ found that sourdough fermentation using selected _lactobacilli_ and nontoxic flours can hydrolyze gluten peptides, reducing the bread’s overall gluten content.1 Unfortunately, these methods are uncommon compared to quicker, more cost-effective production techniques. These shortcuts result in packaged and

## Keto Weight Loss Timeline – How Long to See Results? A nutritious, low-carb diet is one of the most effective dietary strategies for achieving significant and lasting weight loss. Here’s a complete keto weight loss timeline, including signs of ketosis and typical weight loss patterns, so you know what to expect when embarking on a high-fat diet. ## **How to lose weight on keto** A well-planned keto diet can help achieve significant weight loss and enhance metabolic health, which promotes sustainable long-term weight management. Keto is a dietary approach that limits daily carb intake to between 20 and 50 grams of net carbs while obtaining the majority of calories from healthy fats such as olive oil, coconut oil, avocados, and oily fish. Restricting carbohydrate consumption reduces the body’s availability of glucose, prompting a metabolic shift to fat-burning, a state known as ketosis. During ketosis, the liver starts to break down dietary and stored body fat to generate energy, which releases ketones. This group of organic acids serve as a highly effective alternative fuel source when glucose is limited. This explains why the keto diet is highly effective in reducing body fat, as confirmed by research published in _Canadian Family Physician_.1 This study demonstrated that a high-fat ketogenic diet led to more sustained weight loss and a significantly lower body fat percentage than a low-fat diet, underscoring its effectiveness in managing body weight. However, to achieve healthy weight loss, it’s crucial to focus on a balanced approach that includes regular physical activity, optimal nutrition, and consistent sleep patterns. That’s why it’s important to follow [Healthy Keto®](https://www.drberg.com/blog/healthy-keto-plan-start-here). This advanced version of the ketogenic diet emphasizes nutrient-rich, high-quality foods, including non-GMO organic vegetables, grass-fed beef, full-fat organic dairy, pasture-raised eggs, and

## What Is the Classic Ketogenic Diet? Although many people view keto as a modern trend, this high-fat diet was initially developed to help manage epilepsy, laying the foundation for ketosis as a powerful health strategy. While a classic ketogenic diet induces ketosis, it often lacks overall nutritional guidance, potentially increasing the risk of nutritional deficiencies and associated health problems. Learn about the downsides of a traditional low-carb diet and discover why Healthy Keto® offers a more balanced alternative that supports ketosis and long-term health. ## **What is ketosis?** Ketosis shifts your body from using carbohydrates as a primary fuel source to burning fat to generate energy. This metabolic state can be triggered by restricting carbohydrate intake to no more than 50 grams of net carbs daily, prompting your body to deplete its glucose reserves. When carbohydrates and sugars are limited or unavailable, the liver starts to convert dietary fatty acids and stored body fat into energy, which releases large amounts of ketones. Ketones serve as a highly efficient fuel for the body. Unlike glucose, which metabolizes rapidly, causing fluctuations in energy levels, mood swings, and food cravings, ketones break down slowly, providing a steady and sustainable energy source. Additionally, ketones produce fewer free radicals because of their chemical structure, causing less cellular stress and damage than glucose. This makes ketones particularly beneficial for the brain, supporting better mental clarity, focus, and overall cognitive health. To induce ketosis, ketogenic diets restrict carbohydrate intake to less than 10 percent of daily calories, while approximately 70 percent of calories come from fat and the remaining 20 percent from protein. This dietary pattern promotes nutritional ketosis, which is a safe and controlled metabolic state, not to be confused with [diabetic ketoacidosis](https://www.drberg.com/blog/what-do-you-do-if-you-get-ketoacidosis),

## The Dirty Keto Diet: What Is It and Should You Do It? Dirty keto is a variation of the traditional keto diet that focuses on low-carb, high-fat meals regardless of their nutritional quality. A dirty keto diet is typically high in processed and fast foods. While it’s less costly than a clean keto diet, it may lead to nutritional deficiencies and adverse health effects. Learn more about the dirty keto diet and discover how it compares to a nutritious low-carb diet such as Healthy Keto®. ## **What is ketosis?** Ketosis is a metabolic state characterized by increased fat burning, achieved by restricting carbohydrate intake. This state occurs when the body lacks sufficient carbohydrate intake. Carbs and sugar raise blood sugar levels, which the body utilizes to generate cellular energy. However, a low-carb diet removes this fuel source, which forces the liver to switch to using fat as a primary energy source. With limited access to glucose, fatty acids are released from fat stores and converted into ketone bodies. Ketones are a highly efficient fuel for your cells and are a preferred energy source for muscle, brain, and heart tissue. Watch the video below to learn more about dirty keto vs. Healthy Keto.## **What is the dirty keto diet?** Dirty keto, also known as the lazy keto diet, is a less restrictive version of the clean keto diet. Like the regular keto diet, dirty keto diets involve consuming 70 to 80 percent of calories from fat, 10 to 20 percent from protein, and 5 to 10 percent from carbs. However, a lazy keto diet doesn’t consider the nutritional quality of the foods consumed. Although many dirty keto meals meet keto’s macronutrient requirements, they often include inflammatory vegetable oils, processed food, artificial sweeteners, and fast foods. Dirty keto is popular with those who don’t have the time or knowledge to prepare fresh meals. While dirty keto

## Keto Fast Food Guide: Low‑Carb Meals Out Although fast food is often linked to unhealthy eating habits, that doesn’t always have to be the case. With more people following a Healthy Keto® lifestyle, increasingly more fast food restaurants are starting to offer nutritious low-carb options. Here’s a list of the 22 best keto fast food choices that won’t kick you out of ketosis and keep your body in fat-burning mode. ## **Can you have fast food on keto?** Yes, you can include fast food in your keto diet, but this should only be an occasional indulgence when you’re in a pinch rather than your daily meal routine. _“Many fast foods contain hidden carbs that cause blood sugar spikes and trigger inflammation,”_ explains Dr. Berg. _“They also tend to be high in unhealthy trans fats, sodium, monosodium glutamate, and artificial ingredients.”_ This highlights the importance of understanding the difference between [Healthy Keto®](https://www.drberg.com/blog/healthy-keto-plan-start-here) and dirty keto. Dirty keto is a low-carb diet that only focuses on macronutrients and doesn’t consider the nutritional value of foods. While this may seem appealing, dirty keto fails to promote healthy eating habits and can lead to nutrient deficiencies, hormonal imbalances, and inflammation. On the other hand, Healthy Keto encourages the consumption of [nutritious foods](https://www.drberg.com/blog/the-7-healthiest-foods-you-should-eat-dr-berg) by focusing on non-GMO vegetables, grass-fed beef, game meat, wild-caught fish, full-fat organic dairy, and pasture-raised eggs.

## Ketones in Urine: Why You Might Not See Them It can be confusing to find that you have low or no ketones in your urine after diligently following the keto diet for months. Does this mean you’re not in ketosis? Not necessarily. Find out why you may be getting negative results with ketone test kits and discover nine easy ways to determine if you’re truly in ketosis. ## **What are ketones?** During ketosis, your body uses ketones as the primary energy source–but what are ketones? Ketones are a by-product of fat burning and a highly efficient alternative fuel to glucose that offers a wide range of health benefits for your body. Ketosis is triggered by restricting carbohydrates, and you need to follow a ketogenic diet for your body to burn fat and generate ketones. There are three different types of ketones, including acetate, acetoacetate, and beta-hydroxybutyrate. As your cells adapt from burning sugar to utilizing fat, your body begins to convert acetoacetate to beta-hydroxybutyrate. Most ketone urine tests only measure acetoacetate, which explains why these test kits aren’t always accurately detecting ketones in urine as you become keto-adapted. ![Ketone blood test vial](https://www.drberg.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/urine-samples-testing-ketones-laboratory-sample-000.jpg?resize=1024,683) ## **How are ketones tested?** One of the most convenient ways to test for ketones at home is using a ketone urine test, which involves collecting a urine sample and testing the ketone bodies using a test strip. Ketone levels can also be detected through a ketone breath test. Urine tests and breath tests tend to be accurate during the early phases of keto, but can sometimes produce a negative test result when your body has become fully adapted to using ketones as an energy source. When you first start keto, your body isn’t very effective in metabolizing ketones and releases excess acetoacetate through the breath and urine, which can be easily measured.

Let’s look at eight reasons you’re gaining weight on keto and how to tweak your keto lifestyle for long-term weight loss success. ## **Eight reasons you’re gaining weight on keto** While many people have lost a considerable amount of weight on keto, some have difficulty losing weight or experience unexpected weight gain. Your metabolic rate, hormone balance, and health status are unique to you and can significantly impact your weight status. The good news is that [gaining weight on keto](https://www.drberg.com/blog/fluid-retention-on-ketogenic-diet) doesn’t mean a high-fat, low-carb diet isn’t right for you. _“What’s important to remember is that weight loss isn’t an indicator of health,”_ explains Dr. Berg\_. “You have to get healthy to lose weight, not lose weight to get healthy.”\_ Here are eight causes of weight gain on keto and the solutions to achieve a healthy weight. ### **1. Not staying in ketosis** One of the most common reasons for weight gain on keto is an inconsistent carb intake that causes your metabolism to flip-flop between fat-burning and using sugars as the primary energy source. Keto success depends on limiting carb intake to keep insulin low, which triggers ketosis and primes your metabolism to break down fats. Cheat days on keto aren’t a great idea and can quickly derail your weight loss efforts. Whenever you consume too many carbs, your insulin levels will spike, which inhibits fat burning and stimulates fat storage. And, what’s more, it typically takes your body a few days to restart ketosis after consuming too many carbohydrates, which slows down keto-adaptation and can lead to weight gain. To achieve consistent weight loss, it’s crucial to limit your net carb count to no more than 20 to 50 grams

## Keto Ruined My Health? Easing Concerns and Debunking Myths A few people share alarming stories online, claiming, “_Keto ruined my health!”_ However, on closer look, many of these individuals have been binge-eating processed and high-fat foods without paying attention to the quality and nutritional value of their diet. Discover the truth about common keto myths and learn how to approach a nutrient-dense, low-carb ketogenic diet that supports your health goals without causing harm. ## **What is keto?** The keto diet, short for ketogenic diet, is a meal plan that restricts carbohydrate intake to no more than 50 grams daily while obtaining the majority of daily calories from fat. Limiting carbohydrates shifts the body into ketosis, a metabolic state during which the liver utilizes stored body fat and dietary fat to generate energy instead of relying on glucose as a fuel source. As the liver breaks down fats, it produces a significant amount of ketones. These natural acids serve as highly efficient alternative fuel sources, powering the brain, muscles, and other tissues when glucose is limited. This high-fat diet was originally developed to manage and treat epilepsy and seizures but has since become a popular approach for weight loss, metabolic health, and overall wellness. Watch the video below to learn why it’s crucial to follow a nutrient-dense, low-carb diet.## **How does keto work?** Keto has helped millions of people worldwide lose weight, enhance cognitive functions, promote overall well-being, and reduce the risk of chronic health conditions, including heart disease and diabetes. Its impressive health benefits are primarily related to the profound metabolic changes in response to restricting carbohydrates, which promotes steady blood sugar and insulin levels. Dietary carbohydrate intake causes frequent blood sugar and insulin spikes, which can overwhelm the

## Are Ketones Poisons or a Therapeutic Fuel? Are ketones poisons, or are they simply a by-product of the liver producing them from fat to generate energy for the cells? Ketones aren’t dangerous if kept within healthy ranges. However, excessive ketone levels in the blood can acidify its pH, which can lead to life-threatening complications. Discover why ketones triggered by a ketogenic diet don’t pose health risks and how maintaining balanced levels can support your metabolic health without adverse effects. ## **Are ketones poisons?** Ketones, or ketone bodies, are acids produced by the liver when fat is broken down to generate energy. Ketones are released when the body enters a state of ketosis, which occurs when carbohydrate intake is reduced, prompting the body to switch from using glucose as its primary energy source to using fat-derived ketones. They aren’t poisons and serve as an alternative fuel source for cells when glucose is limited, such as during periods of fasting or when following a low-carb ketogenic diet. However, when ketones accumulate excessively in the blood, they can acidify its pH, leading to a condition known as ketoacidosis. Unlike nutritional ketosis, which is a controlled and safe metabolic state, ketoacidosis arises from impaired insulin release and uncontrolled blood glucose levels, typically affecting individuals with type 1 diabetes. Watch the video below to learn more about the difference between ketosis and ketoacidosis.## **Ketosis vs. ketoacidosis** Typically, blood sugar derived from dietary carbohydrates is the body’s primary fuel source. However, during ketosis, the body breaks down fat instead of using blood glucose to generate energy. Nutritional ketosis can be achieved by restricting carb intake to less than 50 grams daily. This pushes the liver to burn fat, which releases ketones. Once ketone bodies enter the bloodstream and

## Is It Dangerous to Have High Ketones While Fasting? Fasting has profound health benefits as it promotes cellular repair, weight loss, and improved blood sugar control while reducing the risk of metabolic and cardiovascular diseases. During fasting, the body shifts into ketosis, using ketones as its primary energy source. But is having high ketones while fasting dangerous? Discover the difference between ketosis and ketoacidosis and learn how to monitor your ketone levels effectively. ## **What are ketones?** Ketones, or ketone bodies, are organic acids produced from dietary fats or stored body fat that provide an alternative energy source when the body’s glucose levels are low. Glucose, derived from carbohydrates and sugars, is the body’s primary fuel source. However, when carb intake is restricted, the body begins to burn fat, which releases large amounts of ketones. As ketones start to build up in your bloodstream and begin to fuel your cells, your body enters a metabolic state known as ketosis. Ketosis can be induced by following a low-carb diet or practicing intermittent fasting, which restricts the intake of foods and calorie-containing beverages, forcing the body to burn fat to generate energy. Nutritional ketosis has impressive health benefits and is generally considered safe for most people. However, individuals with type 1 diabetes are at risk of excessive ketone production, which can have serious health consequences. Watch the video below to learn more about elevated ketone levels during fasting.## **Ketosis vs. ketoacidosis** Diet-induced ketosis, also known as nutritional ketosis, is achieved by fasting or reducing daily carbohydrate intake to 50 grams or less, typically through a ketogenic diet. Due to the caloric restriction associated with fasting, the body depletes available blood glucose and glycogen reserves, which triggers fat burning and,

Ketovore is a combination of a traditional keto diet and a carnivore diet. It’s a high-fat and low-carb diet that focuses on consuming primarily animal products and some plant foods. Learn more about ketovore and how it differs from keto, and discover this dietary approach’s potential health benefits and downsides. ## **What is the ketovore diet?** The keto-carnivore diet, widely known as ketovore, combines the carnivore and ketogenic diet. Ketovore is more restrictive than keto and less stringent than carnivore but shares the same low-carb principles as both diets. Ketovore aims to trigger and maintain ketosis. This metabolic state pushes the body to burn fat instead of glucose as a fuel source, which is achieved by consuming primarily meat, animal fats, and small amounts of low-carb vegetables. Processed foods and foods high in sugar, starches, or carbohydrates are prohibited. A ketovore food list might include the following: \* Meat \* Fish \* Lard \* Eggs \* Heavy cream \* Butter \* Avocados \* Coconut oil \* Leafy greens such as spinach, romaine, and arugula \* Low-carb vegetables, including broccoli, asparagus, and cauliflower While carb-containing condiments such as ketchup or relishes must be avoided, low-carb spices, including basil, sage, salt, pepper, and thyme, can be used to season meats.

## Best Trace Mineral Supplement for Energy & Health In today’s world, achieving optimal health can feel challenging. We focus on nutritious food, regular exercise, and adequate sleep, but sometimes, we still feel like something’s missing. That missing piece could be plant-based trace minerals. These minerals, needed in small amounts, play a vital role in our overall well-being. Years of research and patient care have shown me the significant impact of plant-based trace minerals. Let’s explore the power of these essential nutrients and discover how they contribute to a healthier you. ## **Understanding the Importance of Plant-Based Trace Minerals** Trace minerals, required only in small quantities, are crucial for our health. These nutrients act as essential cofactors for [enzymes](https://www.drberg.com/blog/what-are-enzymes) at the cellular level, driving countless bodily processes. They are the tiny gears that keep our complex bodies functioning smoothly. The difference between trace minerals and more abundant minerals like calcium and potassium is their sheer potency: although they’re required in minute quantities, their roles are significant. Trace minerals, such as [zinc](https://www.drberg.com/blog/zinc-effects-on-your-respiratory-system), iron, copper, and manganese, are involved in hundreds of biological processes, from oxygen transport to immune response and DNA synthesis. ### **Why Choose Plant-Based Trace Minerals?** Plant-based and non-plant-based trace minerals (derived from rock or salt) differ in bioavailability. Bioavailability refers to how easily our bodies absorb and utilize them. Plants, with their extensive root systems, draw minerals from the earth and transform them into readily usable forms. Plant-derived trace minerals are much smaller, about 15,000 times smaller, than metallic or salt-based counterparts. This smaller size, often referred to as “ionic,” enhances absorption. This improved absorption ensures that more nutrients reach where our

## 6 Foods and Herbs That Lower Cholesterol Naturally High levels of low-density lipoprotein, generally known as bad cholesterol, have been implicated in atherosclerosis, and maintaining balanced blood cholesterol levels can reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease. Discover six foods and herbs to lower cholesterol levels and learn why elevated cholesterol may be caused by a high-carb diet. ## **What causes high cholesterol?** Cholesterol is a waxy, fat-like substance that plays an important role in building cell membranes, bile production, and vitamin D synthesis. Because [cholesterol](https://www.drberg.com/blog/how-to-lower-your-cholesterol-on-ketogenic-diet) is a lipid, it’s not water-soluble and has to be carried through the bloodstream by specialized transport proteins, including low-density lipoprotein (LDL cholesterol) and high-density lipoprotein (HDL cholesterol). There remains a common misconception that total cholesterol levels can predict the risk of heart disease. However, this has long been refuted, and whether cholesterol impacts cardiovascular health depends on the type of lipoprotein it’s bound to. Certain types of LDL cholesterol can deposit within the walls of arteries, which increases the risk of restricted blood vessels and [atherosclerosis](https://www.drberg.com/blog/reversing-atherosclerosis-or-hardening-of-the-arteries), two primary cardiovascular risk factors. In contrast, HDL cholesterol is generally considered the good cholesterol and is associated with a lower risk of arterial plaque formation due to its ability to clear LDL cholesterol from blood vessels. It’s widely believed that cholesterol-containing foods such as meat, eggs, shellfish, and full-fat dairy products contribute to elevated cholesterol levels. However, research published in _Nutrients_ investigated the impact of dietary cholesterol intake on blood lipid levels and concluded, \_“There is no direct correlation between cholesterol intake and blood

## Fix Thyroid Problems Naturally and Effectively Let’s talk about how to get your thyroid to work better. There are many people that have thyroid problems, and a lot of people are taking medication for it. But these medications don’t treat the underlying cause, and ultimately that’s what you need to address if you want to resolve your thyroid concerns for good. Here, we discuss underlying causes of thyroid problems, as well as what you can do to correct your thyroid function and hopefully require less medication (or no medication at all). **In this article, I will cover:** \* **The fundamentals of healthy thyroid function** \* **How to find a thyroid problem** \* **Hypothyroidism due to a hormone conversion issue** \* **Hypothyroidism due to low thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH)** \* **Other causes of low thyroid function** \* **Solutions** ## **Healthy Thyroid Function** ![Healthy thyroid function](https://www.drberg.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/blog-how-to-get-your-thyroid-to-work-correctly-1.jpg?w=800) \* \* \* The pituitary gland is an important endocrine gland in the brain. It releases a hormone called thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH). The purpose of this hormone is to tell the thyroid to release T4 and T3. T4 is the inactive thyroid hormone and T3 is the active thyroid hormone, and the T4 actually converts to T3. We have about 20 times more T4 than we do T3. A good way to think of it is that T4 is kind of like the pre-hormone or the reserve. Then T3 actually does the work in all of the cells. It controls: \* The speed of your metabolism \* Digestion \* Mood ## **How to Find a Thyroid Problem** Many thyroid conditions cause a variety of symptoms. So, if you: \* Experience increased sensitivity to cold or heat \* Lose your hair \* Are mentally and physically sluggish \* Experience physical weakness or fatigue \* Have difficulty sleeping \* Lose or gain weight \* Have dry, irritated, or bulging eyes \* Have an increased heart rate Those are all

## What Is a Pescatarian Diet and Can It Be Keto? A pescatarian diet is a modified vegetarian diet that includes fish and seafood, while the ketogenic diet aims to limit carbohydrate intake to trigger and maintain ketosis. A pescatarian keto diet may benefit those who are interested in increasing their intake of omega-3 fatty acids while following a low-carb eating plan. Explore the differences between a pescatarian and ketogenic diet and discover the benefits and drawbacks of combining these two dietary approaches. ## **What is the pescatarian diet?** The pescatarian diet follows the basic principles of a vegetarian diet but includes eating fish and seafood. Pescatarians typically consume a variety of whole grains, fruit, vegetables, dairy products, and eggs. Pescatarians can eat a range of seafood, including fish, shellfish, and other aquatic life. Though the diet focuses on whole foods, processed fish-based foods, such as fish sticks or imitation crab, are also acceptable. Pescatarians don’t eat meat derived from land animals, including cows, sheep, and chickens, which is often motivated by concerns about animal welfare and environmental impact. However, some opt for a pescetarian diet to obtain ample essential fatty acids, including eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), which support cardiovascular, eye, and neurological health. Pescetarianism is a meat-free diet with no strict rules for dieters. While some pescatarians eat fish twice a week, others incorporate seafood daily. Watch the video below to learn more about eating shellfish on a ketogenic diet.## **Pescatarian vs. keto** Pescatarianism is similar to vegetarian diets but emphasizes a plant-based diet with moderate amounts of animal protein.

## Adrenal Body Type: Signs, Causes & Solutions The adrenal body type is one of the most difficult body types to repair for one reason: stress is everywhere! This article will teach you how to lower your stress and fix your adrenal body. ## **The five body types** There are five primary body types–adrenal, ovary, thyroid, liver, and pancreas. Each is related to an imbalance of hormones. While you can have more than one body type, you are likely to experience stronger signs of one type. If you are interested to learn which body type you are take this free [body type quiz](https://www.drberg.com/body-type-quiz). Now let’s take a quick look at the five body types. ### **1. The adrenal body type** The adrenal body type involves an imbalance of [adrenal hormones](https://www.drberg.com/blog/adrenal-body-type-and-adrenal-hormones). If you have this body type, you may have a sagging belly. This kind of belly fat comes from elevated cortisol, also known as the stress hormone. High cortisol is caused by chronic stress, which is why a healthy diet may not fully resolve the issues you experience with the adrenal body type. It’s important for those with this body type to actively manage their stress levels and get plenty of quality sleep and time to relax. We’ll talk more about what you can do for an adrenal body type later in this article. ### **2. The ovary body type** Those with the [ovary body type](https://www.drberg.com/blog/the-ovary-body-type) typically hold weight in their hips and below the belly button giving them the ovary body shape. This is a result of estrogen dominance caused by overactive ovaries. People with this body type may benefit from supporting their estrogen balance. The ovary type is also highly sensitive to endocrine disruptors–including herbicides, fungicides, and pesticides–so it’s important to consume organic, non-GMO, and hormone-free foods. Cruciferous vegetables are essential for supporting balanced estrogen. ### **3. The thyroid body type**

## Why Can’t I Sleep at Night Even When I’m Tired? You probably have heard that drinking coffee and alcohol can interrupt a good night’s sleep. But you may not be aware that snacking, overeating sugar and protein, and not getting enough sun can stop you from sleeping at night. Simple diet changes can fine-tune your sleep-wake cycle and reduce sleep problems. Increasing zinc-rich foods, regularly taking nutritional yeast, replenishing electrolytes, and naturally boosting melatonin can help you get restful sleep. Let’s look at common reasons for poor sleep and learn how to promote healthy sleep habits. ## ![Woman with insomnia symptoms](https://www.drberg.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/unhappy-woman-insomnia-lying-on-bed.jpg?w=800)**Seven reasons why you can’t sleep when you’re tired** Your sleep-wake cycle is controlled by sleep-regulating hormones, neuronal processes, and external cues such as light exposure and body temperature. [Research](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7230229/) published in _Nutrients_ found that certain dietary and lifestyle choices can cause hormonal imbalances and overstimulate the nervous system. This can cause difficulty falling asleep even when you are tired. Here are seven reasons why you may not get enough quality sleep. ### **1. Frequent snacking** Snacking close to bedtime can significantly disrupt your internal body clock and lead to sleep issues. Digesting food requires energy and promotes metabolic activity, which can make relaxing and falling asleep challenging. ### **2. High-carb and sugar diet** Eating sugars and carbs can quickly raise blood sugar levels and trigger the release of insulin. This critical hormone regulates energy metabolism and fat storage. Chronically elevated insulin due to a high-carb diet can lead to [insulin resistance](https://www.drberg.com/blog/how-to-test-for-insulin-resistance), a metabolic disorder characterized by a lack of cellular response to insulin signaling.

## Six Ashwagandha Benefits for Female Health Ashwagandha’s potential benefits for female health have been known for centuries. This adaptogenic herb is commonly associated with promoting a sense of balance and is frequently used to support general health, including hormonal and menstrual wellness. Discover six ashwagandha benefits for women and learn why taking an ashwagandha supplement may help promote relaxation and support overall female well-being. ## **6 ashwagandha benefits for female health** Ashwagandha’s long-standing use in traditional medicine has ignited considerable scientific interest. A growing body of research is exploring how ashwagandha may support general wellness and balance, with particular interest in its potential relevance to women’s health. Here are six benefits of ashwagandha for female health. ### **1. Adaptogen** Ashwagandha is widely regarded as one of the most well-known adaptogenic herbs, traditionally used to support the body’s natural response to physical and mental stressors. Ashwagandha contains withanolides, a group of naturally occurring compounds that have been studied for their potential to interact with hormonal, neuronal, and immune pathways involved in the body’s response to stress. During periods of stress, your adrenal glands release cortisol, an adrenal steroid-hormone that alters metabolic processes to sustain the body during stressful events such as trauma, exercise, injury, or surgery. While cortisol plays an essential role in mitigating the physiological effects of stress, chronic stress can lead to imbalanced cortisol levels linked to weak immune defenses, poor blood pressure regulation, and changes in body shape and composition, also known as [adrenal body type](https://www.drberg.com/blog/adrenal-body-type-fix). Ashwagandha is thought to influence cortisol levels and gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) activity, a neurotransmitter associated with calmness and stress regulation.

## Keto Basics: How to Start a Healthy Keto Plan Keto and Intermittent Fasting have gained considerable attention as an increasingly popular health and weight loss strategy. The approach combines the benefits of the ketogenic diet and intermittent fasting to maximize results for those seeking improved overall well-being. Learn about how combining [the ketogenic diet and intermittent fasting](https://www.drberg.com/blog/the-keto-diet-for-beginners) can maximize results for those seeking improved overall well-being. ## **What is Keto** A low-carb, high-fat diet such as the ketogenic meal plan shifts your body’s primary energy source from glucose to fat. By consuming fewer carbohydrates and more healthy fats, your body enters a state called ketosis, where it breaks down fat into ketones – an alternative and efficient energy source compared to glucose. ### **Difference between Regular Keto and Healthy Keto®** While traditional keto diets and Healthy Keto® share similarities in their approach to carbohydrate restriction, key differences set them apart. The primary distinction lies in the emphasis on nutrient density within [food choices](https://www.drberg.com/blog/ketogenic-diet-food-list) made during meal planning. Healthy Keto® prioritizes the consumption of whole foods rich in vitamins and minerals over processed alternatives which may lack essential nutrients our bodies require for optimal functioning. ### **Why Ketones are a Better Fuel Source than Glucose** \* **Sustained energy:** Unlike glucose, which can cause spikes and crashes throughout the day due to fluctuating blood sugar levels, [ketones provide consistent energy](https://www.drberg.com/blog/ketogenic-diet-plan-ketone) release, leading to improved mental clarity, sharper focus, and enhanced physical performance. \* **Better brain health:** Research suggests that ketone bodies have neuroprotective effects, potentially reducing inflammation within brain cells while promoting cognitive function improvements

## Increase Your Memory and Focus – and Lift the Fog A brain detox can help improve cognitive function and mental clarity by promoting the elimination of toxins and waste products from the brain and central nervous system. Here’s how to detoxify your brain and discover how sleep, exercise, and dietary habits can impact your central nervous system. ## **Glymphatic system explained** The glymphatic system is a waste-clearance system that facilitates the brain’s natural detoxification process. In addition to waste and toxin elimination, the glymphatic system also enables the transport of amino acids, lipids, and neurotransmitters across the central nervous system, which plays a crucial role in maintaining healthy brain function. Research published in _Neurochemical Research_ found that the glymphatic system relies on a complex interplay between cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and astrocytes, a specialized type of brain cell that provides structure and nourishes neurons.1 The flow of CSF through brain tissue allows nutrient exchange and the removal of waste products, which helps maintain normal central nervous system functions and may lower the risk of neurological diseases. The glymphatic system plays a profound role in removing and eliminating certain abnormal protein clusters, including beta-amyloid and tau, which are strongly associated with the development of dementia and Alzheimer’s disease. Watch the video below to discover the importance of sleep for brain health.## **What is a brain detox?** A brain detox focuses on enhancing the body’s natural ability to cleanse the brain of waste products, [heavy metals](https://www.drberg.com/blog/heavy-metal-detox), environmental toxins, damaged cellular components, and defective proteins.

## Insulin Resistance: Hidden Cause of Weight Gain Insulin resistance is a serious metabolic imbalance characterized by a progressive loss of blood sugar control, increasing the risk of developing diabetes. Most cases of insulin resistance are linked to a high-carb diet and lack of physical activity. Making beneficial dietary and lifestyle changes is the key to managing and restoring metabolic health. Here’s a complete guide to the symptoms and causes of insulin resistance and how to improve and restore blood sugar control. ## **What is insulin resistance?** Insulin is a critical metabolic hormone released by the pancreas in response to carbohydrate intake. Insulin stimulates the cellular uptake of blood sugar, also known as blood glucose. This enables cells to convert blood sugar into energy and helps maintain normal blood glucose levels. Insulin resistance refers to reduced cellular sensitivity to insulin signaling, resulting in chronically elevated blood sugar levels linked to various health issues such as diabetes, obesity, cardiovascular disease, [high blood pressure](https://www.drberg.com/blog/drink-1-cup-daily-to-normalize-high-blood-pressure), and metabolic syndrome. Because elevated blood sugar levels are toxic to the body, the pancreas releases more insulin to compensate for inadequate cellular glucose uptake. This creates a vicious cycle of high blood insulin levels, which can further desensitize cells, exacerbating insulin resistance and contributing to persistently high blood sugar levels. In addition to its role in blood sugar control, insulin signals liver cells to convert excess blood sugar into fat. This explains why insulin-resistant individuals typically experience rapid weight gain. Watch the video below to discover surprising facts about insulin.## **Signs and symptoms** In most cases, insulin resistance develops slowly, with few early warning

## Diabetes Nutrition Guide – Everything You Need to Know Diabetes develops as a result of poor blood sugar control, which can have serious health consequences, including vision loss, kidney problems, heart disease, and nerve damage. However, diabetes can be managed and even reversed by making beneficial dietary and lifestyle changes. Here’s the ultimate diabetes nutrition guide to promote balanced blood glucose levels and restore metabolic health. ## **What is diabetes?** Diabetes is a serious metabolic imbalance characterized by insulin resistance and loss of blood sugar control, resulting in chronically elevated blood glucose levels. Type 2 diabetes is the most widespread form, typically linked to a diet high in refined carbohydrates, sugars, trans fats, and processed foods. According to data published by the American Diabetes Association (ADA), more than 38 million U.S. adults have diabetes, which represents 11.6 percent of the total population.1 Diabetes can have serious health consequences. Prolonged periods of high blood glucose levels, also known as hyperglycemia, can lead to inflammation, hormonal imbalances, nerve damage, vision loss, and heart disease. Research published in _Cardiovascular Diagnosis and Therapy_ found that diabetes is a significant risk factor for cardiovascular disease, which may explain why people with diabetes are at an increased risk of premature death.2 Watch the video below to discover the number one nutrient to manage diabetes.## **Symptoms of diabetes** Unfortunately, diabetes is a silent disease, and most people don’t know they have diabetes until they develop serious health issues.

## Why Does Vinegar Stop Leg Cramps? Proven Insight Do you suffer from exercise-associated muscle cramps or experience recurring nighttime leg cramps? Drinking apple cider vinegar (ACV) is an incredibly effective way to help get rid of cramping muscles fast. ACV boosts acetylcholine, a neurotransmitter that regulates nerve cells and triggers muscle tissue to relax. Let’s look at how you can use apple cider vinegar mixed with water to help avoid leg cramps and what other steps you can take to prevent muscle spasms. ## **What is a leg cramp?** A leg cramp, also known as a charley horse, is a sudden and often painful involuntary contraction of a leg muscle. Leg cramps can develop in any leg muscle, but most commonly occur in the calf. They typically last a few seconds, but some suffer leg cramps lasting up to several minutes. While muscle cramping is often triggered by exercise or stretching, muscle spasms can also happen without apparent reason or suddenly occur at night in bed. A study published in _BMC Family Practice_ found that almost a third of people aged 50 and older experience nighttime leg cramps. The authors found _“Sleep disturbances, which may seriously affect well-being and quality of life, are common among patients with nocturnal leg cramps.”_ 1 While leg spasms can be painful and inconvenient, they typically are nothing to be concerned about. However, in some cases, cramps can indicate peripheral artery disease or kidney disease. It’s crucial to consult with your doctor if you are experiencing persistent and recurring cramps to rule out an underlying medical condition. Watch the video below to learn how to use apple cider vinegar to mitigate cramping.## **What causes a leg cramp?** Involuntary muscle tightening can be triggered by several factors.

## Is Keto Good for Diabetics? Type 1 Diabetes and Keto Increasingly more evidence suggests that a low-carbohydrate diet has profound benefits for metabolic health, but is keto good for diabetics? Yes, a low-carb ketogenic diet is an effective strategy to support blood sugar control and can help reduce the risk of diabetic ketoacidosis in individuals with type 1 diabetes. Let’s look at the importance of limiting carbohydrate intake for diabetics and discover how to safely and effectively implement a ketogenic diet to manage diabetes. ## **What is keto?** Keto restricts dietary carbohydrate intake to no more than 50 grams of carbs per day while obtaining the majority of daily calorie requirements from healthy fats. A typical macronutrient distribution on keto is around 70 to 80 percent fat, 15 to 25 percent protein, and 5 to 10 percent carbohydrates. This eating pattern pushes the body to utilize fat as its primary energy source instead of relying on sugars and carbohydrates for fuel. The breakdown of fat releases ketones, a group of organic acids that serve as a highly efficient fuel source. When ketones start circulating in the bloodstream, the body enters a state known as ketosis. Ketosis has impressive benefits for metabolic health, supports steady blood glucose levels, promotes weight loss, and has been associated with improved cognitive health and a lower risk of neurodegenerative conditions. Because keto restricts carbs, it keeps blood sugar and insulin levels stable and minimizes blood sugar spikes, which can help individuals with diabetes achieve consistent glycemic control. Watch the video below to learn why individuals with type 1 diabetes should follow a low-carb diet.## **Is keto good for diabetics?** Yes, keto is an excellent dietary pattern for people with diabetes, as it can help improve blood sugar control and reduce the need for diabetes

## Foods That Help You Sleep and Feel Rested It’s well known that a good night’s sleep is essential for overall health and well-being, but did you know that the foods you eat can significantly affect your sleep patterns? Discover six nutrient-dense foods that help you sleep and learn practical lifestyle tips to create a bedtime routine that promotes relaxation and restful nights. ## **Why quality sleep matters** Sleep is a critical biological process that impacts every aspect of your health. During sleep, your body repairs tissue damage, strengthens immune function, consolidates memories, and regulates essential hormones that control everything from your appetite to your mood. According to research published in the _Journal of Clinical Sleep Medicine,_ insufficient sleep and untreated sleep disorders are detrimental to health, well-being, and public safety.1 The researchers note, _“Chronic insufficient sleep is associated with an increased risk of mortality and contributes to both the individual risk and societal burden associated with several medical epidemics, including cardiovascular disease, diabetes, obesity, and cancer.”_ Watch the video below to learn about five foods that can promote better sleep.## **The role of melatonin in sleep** Melatonin is a primary hormone responsible for regulating the body’s sleep-wake cycles, which is essential to achieve restful and restorative sleep. Released by the pineal gland in response to darkness, melatonin promotes sleepiness by stimulating physiological processes conducive to sleep, such as lowering core body temperature and relaxing the nervous system. In addition to its sleep-promoting functions, melatonin also possesses antioxidant properties that help combat oxidative stress and support cellular repair processes during sleep.

## How to Stop Diarrhea Fast: Alternative Methods That Work Acute diarrhea can be triggered by microbial infections, antibiotic medications, exposure to contaminated food or water, food intolerances, or sudden dietary changes. Most cases of sudden and severe diarrhea are linked to viral, bacterial, or parasitic infection and can lead to dehydration and electrolyte imbalance if not managed promptly. Discover how to stop diarrhea fast with simple but effective home remedies and learn how to promote a healthy digestive tract and regular bowel movements. ## **What causes diarrhea?** Diarrhea is the body’s natural response to irritants in the digestive system, characterized by loose, watery stools often accompanied by an upset stomach. Sudden bouts of diarrhea are most commonly linked to viral and bacterial infections, such as norovirus or _Escherichia coli_, often contracted by eating contaminated foods. The presence of harmful microbes in the intestinal tract triggers a cascade of immune responses that stimulate cells to secrete more water and electrolytes into the gut lumen. This creates a less hospitable environment for microbes, diluting and flushing them out of the system. While fasting can be a helpful short-term approach to rest the digestive system and treat diarrhea caused by foodborne illnesses, reintroducing rich foods too quickly after prolonged periods of caloric restriction can also lead to loose and watery stools. Chronic diarrhea, which refers to experiencing diarrhea symptoms for four weeks or longer, is often a sign of an underlying health issue and requires medical attention to identify the root cause and determine appropriate treatment. Persistent diarrhea can be triggered by various causes, including: \* Inflammatory bowel disease \* [Irritable bowel syndrome](https://www.drberg.com/blog/irritable-bowel-syndrome-tips) \* Food sensitivities \* Lactose intolerance \* Celiac disease \* Overuse of laxatives \* Frequent antibiotic treatment Watch the video below

## What Are Metabolic Body Types?–3 Primary & 3 Mixed Explained Your metabolic body type is primarily determined by your genetics. But did you know that your metabolism significantly impacts the shape and size of your body? Understanding how your metabolic body type impacts your weight and body composition can help you make confident diet and lifestyle choices to achieve your weight goals and support a healthy body. Find out your metabolic body type and what this tells you about your ideal diet and exercise program. ## **What are the three metabolic body types?** The concept of metabolic [body types](https://www.drberg.com/blog/what-is-your-body-type) is based on the relationship between your metabolism and your nervous system. Your metabolism determines how quickly and effectively your body converts fuel to energy. How fast or slow your metabolism works greatly depends on your genetics. However, lifestyle factors, such as diet, sleep, and exercise, can significantly boost or decrease the effectiveness of your metabolism. Your autonomic nervous system regulates involuntary processes like heart rate, breathing, and digestion. It’s balanced by two opposing parts: the sympathetic nervous system and the parasympathetic nervous system. The sympathetic nervous system is activated during periods of high stress, as it prepares your body to respond to danger by increasing your heart rate and [blood pressure](https://www.drberg.com/blog/drink-1-cup-daily-to-normalize-high-blood-pressure) and tensing your muscles. The parasympathetic nervous system creates balance during periods of low stress, relaxing your muscles and lowering your heart rate and blood pressure. Most people have one dominant sympathetic nervous system trait, which determines energy expenditure. A dominant sympathetic nervous system results in a higher energy requirement. In contrast, a dominant parasympathetic nervous system is an energy-conserving trait. The combination of your metabolism and your dominant

## Dr. Berg Goes Carnivore for 2 Weeks Imagine stepping into a world where your plate is a monochrome of meats, from sunrise to sunset. The carnivore diet, hailed and debated by many, promises transformations that sound almost too good to be true. Weight loss? Check. Improved blood pressure and sugar levels? Allegedly, yes. A life free from the foggy brain syndrome? Advocates swear by it. Yet, skepticism abounds. Critics raise eyebrows at dismissing an entire kingdom–Plantae–for animal’s sake. “Can one thrive on meat alone?” they ask. It’s a realm where [pork rinds become croutons](https://www.drberg.com/blog/can-we-have-pork-rinds-on-keto), and steak is your staple, intriguing yet intimidating for newcomers. The stats don’t lie: individuals diving headfirst into this eating plan report staggering energy levels and health markers shifts. But what lies beneath these testimonials? Is it merely about cutting carbs or something more profound? ## **Understanding the Carnivore Diet** The [carnivore diet](https://www.drberg.com/blog/my-opinion-on-the-carnivore-diet) is a highly restrictive diet focusing only on animal-based foods. This means saying goodbye to fruits, vegetables, grains, and legumes and hello to a diet rich in meat, fish, eggs, and some dairy products. The goal? Eliminate all sources of carbohydrates and focus solely on protein and fat from animal sources. Fans of this diet are all in; swearing it helps you drop those pounds, clears up the mental fog, and boosts your health like nothing else. ### **Core Components of the Carnivore Diet** So, what exactly can you eat on the carnivore diet? The staples include beef, pork, chicken, turkey, fish, and eggs. Some people also contain small amounts of low-lactose dairy products like butter, heavy cream, and hard cheeses.

Instead, this is about understanding how both methods influence your body and why combining them could be the ultimate key to unlocking your cellular spring cleaning potential. ## **Understanding Autophagy: The Ultimate Recycling Program** Imagine your cells having their very own, highly efficient waste management system. That’s essentially what autophagy is. Autophagy, derived from the Greek words “auto” (self) and “phagy” (eat), is your body’s way of clearing out damaged organelles, misfolded proteins, and other cellular debris. Think of it as decluttering on a microscopic level, helping your body to: \* Slow down the aging process \* Improve cellular function \* Protect against various diseases \* Boost energy levels ![](https://www.drberg.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/blog-the-most-important-benefit-of-autophagy-will-surprise-you-2.jpg?w=800) ## **What Triggers Autophagy: The Key Players** As you age, autophagy naturally declines. However, certain lifestyle choices can ramp up this process, and both fasting and exercise are front-runners. They achieve this by influencing [insulin resistance](https://www.drberg.com/blog/insulin-resistance), calorie restriction, and promoting healthy longevity. Let’s break it down. When you fast, your body runs low on its primary fuel source–glucose. This forces it to tap into its reserve tanks of stored fat, breaking them down into [ketones for energy](https://www.drberg.com/blog/ketones-are-way-more-than-just-energy-fuel). This metabolic switch, triggered by low glucose, high ketones, and reduced insulin levels,

## Ectomorph Body Type Explained–Description & Characteristics Do you seem to have a fast metabolism and can’t gain weight no matter what you do? You most likely have an ectomorph body type. Metabolic body types are determined by genetics and help explain how your metabolism influences your body shape and composition. Understanding your metabolic body type can help you build muscle more effectively and achieve your fitness goals faster. ## **What are the three metabolic body types?** [Metabolic body types](https://www.drberg.com/blog/metabolic-body-types) are determined by the relationship between metabolism and the nervous system. Your metabolism determines how quickly and efficiently your cells convert fuel to energy. The effectiveness of your metabolism is primarily impacted by your genetics. However, factors including quality of sleep, exercise routines, and dietary choices can influence how fast or slow your metabolism works. Your autonomic nervous system controls physical functioning, including digestion, breathing, and heart rate, and is balanced by two opposing sides. The sympathetic nervous system is activated during stress. It requires more calories, resulting in a higher need for energy and less body fat. The muscle-relaxing and calming parasympathetic nervous system requires less energy and preserves the body’s fuel sources, typically resulting in more body fat. While both nervous systems regulate body functioning, most people tend to have one dominant nervous system trait that determines the body’s overall energy needs. It’s the interplay between your dominant nervous system trait and the effectiveness of your metabolism that determines your body composition and metabolic body type. Research published in _PLOS ONE_ suggests that the three main metabolic body type classifications are ectomorph, mesomorph, and endomorph.1 **Ectomorph** The ectomorph body type has a small body frame with narrow hips and shoulders.

## What Is Parkinson's Disease? Symptoms and Causes Parkinson’s disease can feel like an uphill battle, but understanding the condition and available Parkinson’s disease treatment options can bring hope. This disease affects the central nervous system, impacting movement and causing tremors or rigidity. While the exact cause is unknown, research links it to factors like genetics and environmental toxins. Treatment often focuses on managing disease symptoms, but there are many different angles to explore. ## **Decoding Parkinson’s Disease** [Parkinson’s disease](https://www.drberg.com/blog/can-parkinsons-disease-be-reversed) centers around the decline of dopamine, a neurotransmitter. Neurotransmitters carry signals throughout the brain and body. [Dopamine](https://www.drberg.com/blog/the-dopamine-myth) plays a crucial role in movement control. When you have Parkinson’s disease, the brain cells responsible for producing dopamine begin to die off. This leads to a dopamine deficiency, disrupting communication needed for coordinating movement. As the disease progresses and dopamine levels drop, symptoms often become more pronounced. ### **Unmasking the Symptoms: What to Look For** Parkinson’s disease doesn’t manifest overnight. It’s a gradual process, with subtle signs that might be dismissed at first. Parkinson’s is often characterized by motor symptoms, which primarily impact physical movement. However, nonmotor symptoms can also occur. These involve changes in bodily functions, mood, and cognition. Early detection of these symptoms allows for quicker intervention and might help slow the disease’s progression. ### **Motor Symptoms of Parkinson’s Disease** Parkinson’s Disease often involves a combination of motor symptoms. Each symptom impacts movement and coordination differently. Tremors are a hallmark sign, characterized by involuntary shaking. These tremors usually begin in the hands or fingers, particularly at rest. Another symptom is bradykinesia, or slowness of

## Foods to Avoid on Keto: Carbs That Block Fat Burn Today, we’re going to talk about _**the type of carbs to avoid on a ketogenic diet**_. Whether you’re new to keto, or you’ve been doing the keto diet for a while now, you may have found it challenging to figure out which type of carbs are _good_, and which carbs are _bad_. Keep in mind that the keto diet is a low-carb diet, **not a no-carb diet**. You do need _some_ foods with carbs while on a keto diet; you just generally stay away from high-carb foods. For instance, even spinach and broccoli, which are fantastic sources of vitamins, have a small number of carbs. We’re also going to talk about why some foods are keto-friendly, and some aren’t, even if they have the same total carbs. But before we jump in, let’s talk about the keto diet and why carbs are such a big deal in the first place. ![Unhealthy and healthy carb foods on table | Type of Carbs to Avoid on a Ketogenic Diet](https://www.drberg.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/blog-type-of-carbs-to-avoid-on-a-ketogenic-diet-1.jpg?w=800) \* \* \* **In this article:** \* **What is Keto?** \* **Total Carbs Vs.

## Five Signs Your Body Is in Fat-Burning Mode Understanding if your body is efficiently burning fat can be a key indicator of your metabolic health and fitness progress. Identifying these signs can help you adjust your lifestyle choices to enhance fat metabolism and support your overall well-being. Discover five signs your body is in fat-burning mode and learn about the most effective strategies for sustainable weight loss. ![](https://www.drberg.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/slim-girl-bodybuilder-centimeter-measuring.jpg?w=800) ## **What is fat-burning mode?** When your body enters fat-burning mode, a metabolic state known as ketosis, it undergoes a major shift in energy-making processes where fat replaces glucose as the primary fuel source. Fat burning is triggered when the body depletes its glycogen reserves, which are deposits of glucose strings bound to water stored in the liver and muscle cells. Achieving this state requires carbohydrate restriction to ensure that fat becomes the primary source of energy. Triggering and maintaining ketosis is the primary goal of the [ketogenic diet](https://www.drberg.com/blog/ketogenic-diet-results-what-to-expect). During ketosis, the liver converts fatty acids into ketones, a group of organic acids and highly effective alternative fuel. In addition to offering a steady energy supply, ketones are also more efficient than glucose at producing adenosine triphosphate (ATP), the energy currency of cells. As a result, being fuelled by ketones can have several positive effects beyond fat burning, such as enhanced energy levels, improved physical and mental performance, and increased satiety. Watch the video below to discover seven signs and symptoms that prove you’re burning fat.

## Palm Oil vs Coconut Oil: Which Should You Use? Coconut and palm oils are popular kitchen ingredients and can be found in a variety of products, from cooking oils to cosmetics. Though both come from tropical plants, their production methods and nutritional makeup aren’t the same. Discover the differences between coconut oil vs. palm oil to better understand their roles in your diet and lifestyle. ## **What is palm oil?** Palm oil is produced from the pulp of the oil palm fruit. It’s composed of saturated, unsaturated, and polyunsaturated fatty acids. This liquid fat absorbs fewer pesticides and chemical fertilizers than other oils, and it’s a great alternative to partially hydrogenated oils and other vegetable oils. Two edible oils are derived from the African oil palm: palm kernel oil and palm fruit oil. Palm kernel oil is extracted from the seed, or kernel of the oil palm fruit and is known for its firm texture and neutral flavor. In contrast, palm fruit oil, also known as palm oil or crude palm oil, comes from the fleshy pulp of the fruit itself and is naturally reddish due to its carotenoid content. The palm oil industry has earned a bad reputation over the years, falling behind competitors, such as [olive oil](https://www.drberg.com/blog/real-extra-virgin-olive-oil-best-way-to-know-it-s-real), canola oil, and vegetable oil, because of the effects of palm oil production on the environment. Farmers have to clear trees in tropical rainforests to produce effective amounts of palm oil. This can be detrimental to the forests and their wildlife. If you add palm oil to your diet, ensure you find an eco-friendly and sustainable product. Watch the video below to learn the benefits of palm and coconut oil.## **Health benefits of palm oil** While palm oil may have a negative impact on the environment, it does have benefits for human health.

## Is Bacon Good for You? Finding the Right Bacon You aren’t alone if you love the smell and taste of bacon–it’s the most popular pork product across the globe. Bacon delivers sweet, salty, and umami flavors all at once, making it satisfying and delicious. So, is bacon good for you? Many believe bacon is unhealthy, but it actually has some surprising health benefits. In fact, bacon is on the Healthy Keto® Food List! Discover five health benefits of bacon and learn how to choose the highest quality option to support a healthy diet without compromising on flavor. ## **Is bacon healthy?** You may have heard that consuming bacon and other processed meat products harms your health and increases your risk of cancer and heart disease. This is a common misconception. Bacon contains saturated fats, and it was previously believed that this type of fat increases the risk of heart disease. However, research published in _Progress in Cardiovascular Diseases_ found that saturated fat is not inherently harmful and may not increase the risk of coronary heart disease when consumed in the context of whole foods.1 Interestingly, the study also emphasized that replacing saturated fat with refined sugar, a typical ingredient in low-fat products often labeled heart-healthy, may pose greater health risks. Bacon and other types of processed meat tend to be cured with sodium nitrite, a chemical compound linked to the development of colon cancer and high blood pressure. It’s crucial to distinguish that the curing method increases the risk of adverse health effects, not the bacon itself. Eating high-quality bacon as part of a healthy diet doesn’t pose health risks. Bacon is surprisingly nutritious and rich in healthy fats, B vitamins, and essential minerals. Watch the video below to learn how to identify the best quality bacon to support your health.

## Vitamins That Remove Plaque from Arteries It’s clear that having a nutritious diet is essential to maintain healthy arteries. But did you know that some nutrients can prevent arterial plaque and lower your risk of coronary artery disease? Plaque buildup is a natural response to arterial damage. However, coronary artery calcification can cause stiff arteries and high blood pressure, significantly increasing the risk of coronary heart disease, cardiac arrest, and stroke. Vitamin K2, vitamin D3, magnesium, and phytic acid are powerful nutrients that can help reduce the plaque in your arteries. Let’s take a deeper look at these four powerful nutrients and why they support a healthy cardiovascular system. ![Atherosclerosis illustration](https://www.drberg.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/closeup-atherosclerosis-3d-rendering.jpg?w=800) ## **What is plaque?** Arterial plaque, also known as atherosclerotic plaque, is a buildup of cholesterol, proteins, and calcium in the walls of major arteries. This buildup can cause the blood vessels to harden and become less flexible, leading to atherosclerosis and an increased risk of cardiovascular disease. Arterial plaque formation stiffens and narrows blood vessels, reducing blood flow and interfering with the oxygen supply to vital organs and tissues. Continuous plaque buildup can cause arterial blockage, significantly increasing the risk of heart attacks and stroke. Risk factors for developing arterial plaque include high blood pressure, high cholesterol, smoking, diabetes, obesity, and a family history of heart disease. Conventional treatment for arterial plaque consists of dietary changes, increased physical activity, quitting smoking, and medication to manage cardiovascular risk factors, including high blood pressure or elevated cholesterol levels. In some cases, surgery may be necessary to remove or bypass the plaque to restore blood flow and lower blood pressure. Watch the video below to learn more about the steps you can take

However, screen time before bed can negatively impact sleep hygiene and overall health. Explore the effects of screen time on sleep patterns and learn how to reduce blue light exposure before bed to promote restful and rejuvenating sleep. ## **The health effects of screen time before bed** The nightly ritual of checking phones, tablets, and laptops before sleep has become deeply ingrained in modern life. According to sleep research data released by The National Sleep Foundation, 58 percent of Americans are exposed to screens within an hour before bedtime.1 However, research published in _Sleep Health_ indicates that screen use before bed significantly disrupts sleep, potentially triggering a cascade of issues that can adversely affect overall health.2 This has been confirmed by a study published in _Pharmacy and Therapeutics,_ reporting that sleep deprivation is linked to a variety of disorders, including hypertension, obesity, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and impaired immune functions.3 In addition, prolonged screen use has also been associated with an increased risk of depression and [anxiety](https://www.drberg.com/blog/7-vitamins-for-stress-and-anxiety-relief). Screen time disruptions to normal sleep cycles are primarily driven by blue light and electromagnetic field (EMF) exposure. ### **Blue light exposure** _“Cell phones, tablets, and TVs all emit blue light, which can affect the circadian rhythm, which is the internal clock that governs the sleep-wake cycle,”_ explains Dr. Berg. _“Blue light can even elevate cortisol, the body’s stress hormone that can cause difficulty falling or staying asleep.”_ This is because specialized cells

## How to Raise Your Testosterone Naturally Fast As men age, they need the help of a testosterone booster because the decreasing levels of the hormone can significantly affect their health. Today, I’m going to talk about how to raise testosterone in men to avoid the symptoms of low testosterone. In this article: 1. Symptoms of Low Testosterone 2. What Are the Other Causes of Low Testosterone? 3. How to Increase Testosterone Levels 4. Aging Lowers Testosterone Levels ## **Testosterone Booster: Ways to Improve the Hormone** ### **Symptoms of Low Testosterone** The following are symptoms of low testosterone: ### 1. Prostate Enlargement Sometimes, people are confused and say “I thought testosterone causes prostate enlargement.” They’re talking about a powerful form of testosterone called dihydrotestosterone (DHT). First of all, if testosterone causes prostate enlargement, then as you get older and men have more incidence of prostate enlargement, that does not correlate with the aging process that lowers testosterone. So, what really happens is having a lower testosterone level makes estrogen higher. It’s the estrogen dominance in a male body that enlarges the prostate. In fact, certain doctors use DHT to shrink the prostate. With more testosterone, the prostate becomes healthier and protected against estrogen. **DHT Definition:** A hormone that helps stimulate male characteristic development. ### 2. Low Libido ![Upset young couple having problems with sex | How To Raise Your Testosterone (Men Only) | Testosterone Booster](https://www.drberg.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/blog-testosterone-booster-men-only-1.jpg?w=800) Although libido varies from one man to another, low testosterone can significantly affect a man’s sexual desire.

Air hunger can be described as shortness of breath and is known clinically as dyspnea. Clinical dyspnea has various causes, some of which require medical attention. Acute dyspnea comes on suddenly, while chronic dyspnea occurs for longer periods of time. Environmental pollutants often make breathing discomfort worse. ## **Causes of air hunger** Some of the most common causes of air hunger are the following: \* Asthma \* COPD (Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease) \* Pneumonia \* Tuberculosis \* Anxiety \* Allergies \* Anemia \* Congested gallbladder \* Pulmonary embolism \* Heart failure/heart attack \* Respiratory failure Another lesser-known cause of air hunger is related to pH issues in your body.

## Does Protein Make You Sleepy or Energized? I’m on a mission to uncover the truth behind protein’s sneaky sleep-inducing effects. One minute I’m devouring a mouth-watering steak, the next I’m fighting to keep my eyes open. And let’s not forget those innocent-looking protein shakes after a workout – suddenly, I’m more lethargic than a sloth. What’s the science behind this protein coma? But here’s the thing: protein is supposed to be the “building block” of our bodies, right? So why is it making me feel like I need to take a siesta? Well, I did some digging, and it turns out there’s a whole lot more to this protein-sleepiness connection than meets the eye. Curiosity got the better of you? Me too! Let’s explore this together. ## **Understanding Postprandial Somnolence** Have you ever felt sleepy after eating a protein diet meal rich in protein, like a steak dinner or chicken breast? This phenomenon is known as [postprandial somnolence](https://www.drberg.com/blog/hypoglycemia-without-symptoms), and it’s more common than you might think. Excessive protein intake can lead to sleepiness due to raised blood sugar levels. Think of amino acids as the LEGO bricks of your body. When you eat protein, your body breaks it down into these tiny building blocks. But here’s the catch: consuming too much protein at once can cause a blood sugar spike, leaving you feeling sluggish and, well, sleepy. ## **The Role of Blood Sugar Levels** When protein molecules meet our body’s internal systems, a delicate balance is struck. This intricate interplay determines how our blood sugar levels fluctuate, and ultimately, whether we’ll feel sluggish or energized. The link between protein intake and blood sugar levels is a critical one. ### **Protein and Insulin Response** When we consume low-fat proteins, like whey protein, our bodies release insulin to help regulate sugar levels. While this is a normal response, consuming too much protein at once can cause our insulin levels to spike, leading to

## Cause of Restless Leg Syndrome: Facts Revealed Restless legs syndrome can be a common issue that makes people feel unsettled. Learn about how what causes restless leg syndrome, what potassium does in the body, and how you can take steps to manage your restless legs. ## **Understanding Restless Legs Syndrome** If you’ve ever felt a persistent urge to move your legs, particularly at night or when resting, you might be familiar with [restless legs syndrome](https://www.drberg.com/blog/restless-leg-syndrome-an-interesting-finding). This condition is characterized by an uncomfortable sensation in the legs and other muscles that often feels like restlessness, quivering, shaking, or even a feeling of electricity. ### **The Role of Lactic Acidosis in Restless Legs Syndrome** One common cause of these symptoms is lactic acidosis. This occurs when more lactic acid builds up in the body than it can effectively eliminate. The excess buildup leads to lactic acidosis, which essentially deprives your muscles of oxygen. Lack of adequate oxygen supply triggers spasms and twitching – what we commonly recognize as symptoms of restless leg syndrome. But don’t worry; this condition isn’t without its remedies. By addressing underlying causes, such as nutritional deficiencies or certain health conditions, you may find relief from those sleep-disturbing sensations. ![Potassium-rich foods](https://www.drberg.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/potassium-food-sources-dried-apricots-raisins-002.jpg?w=800) ## **The Importance of Potassium in Muscle Function** [Potassium](https://www.drberg.com/blog/potassium-the-most-important-electrolyte-yet-an-ignored-epidemic-dr-berg) is a vital mineral for our bodies, essential to muscle function.

## How to Increase Height Naturally: Factors That Influence Growth While an adult’s height is primarily determined by genetic predisposition, various diet and lifestyle choices can significantly impact whether a person reaches their full height potential. Discover the environmental factors that influence and determine growth and learn how to increase height naturally. ## **Is it possible to increase your height?** Yes, it’s possible to increase your height, particularly during the active growth phases of childhood and adolescence. During this time, the growth plates in the bones are still open, allowing for increases in height before they gradually close as puberty concludes. Most people stop growing during the late teenage or early adult years, although girls often reach their final height earlier, depending on when they start puberty. While genetics establish the foundation for height, other factors contribute to reaching maximum growth potential before growth plates close. These include nutrition, physical activity, sleep, and hormone levels. Therefore, focusing on the right dietary habits, especially during growth phases, supports bone health, while physical activity and getting enough restful sleep encourage the release of growth hormones. Once skeletal growth plates close, a height increase becomes unlikely. However, maintaining a good posture and supporting skeletal health can combat shrinking caused by age-related changes in bone density. Watch the video below to learn how to increase your height and grow taller.## **What factors affect height?** An adult’s final actual height is determined by a variety of factors that work together during active growth phases until skeletal development and growth plate closure are complete.

Longer nerves that reach your extremities are the most susceptible to damage. Imagine a garden hose that gets kinked. The water flow reduces, and the farthest end receives less water. Similarly, with damaged nerves, the signals between your brain and the rest of your body get disrupted. This leads to various sensations that are hallmarks of this condition. It’s as though your nerves are trying to send a message, but the lines are fuzzy, resulting in mixed signals and discomfort. ## **Understanding Peripheral Neuropathy Diabetes** One of the first steps in managing any health condition is understanding what’s happening within your body, especially something like peripheral neuropathy or diabetes. Having a clear picture of the causes and symptoms can help you take charge of your health journey.

The ones that stick like gum under a school desk. They’re more than pesky; they’re part of an intricate dance within the brain, a condition known to many but understood by few: Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD). The narrative around OCD is often cloaked in myths and half-truths. It’s not just about neatness or orderliness; it’s a complex mental health condition with layers as deep as the ocean. And here’s where things get interesting – what if I told you there were paths less traveled for managing OCD? Paths weaved through our daily habits, diets, and even fasting schedules. Venturing into this realm of mental well-being, we’re not treading the usual grounds of care and treatment. Forget what you thought you knew about treatment options, and prepare for some eye-opening revelations on natural remedies and lifestyle interventions that might change everything. ## Understanding OCD and Its Traditional Treatments OCD is a mental health condition that affects millions worldwide. Intrusive, obsessive thoughts and repetitive, compulsive behaviors characterize it. The persistent presence of these intrusive ideas and ritualistic actions often disrupts everyday existence, hindering professional achievements, straining personal connections, and diminishing life’s quality. ### The Nature of OCD OCD involves two main components: obsessions and compulsions.

## How to Use Probiotics for Sugar Cravings Beneficial gut microbes help regulate appetite and food intake. Evidence suggests that an imbalanced microbiome can lead to food cravings and excessive sugar intake. Learn how to use probiotics for sugar cravings and discover the importance of fermented foods and prebiotics for maintaining a diverse gut microflora. ![woman with sugar craving](https://www.drberg.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/young-worried-latin-woman-feeling-tempted.jpg?w=800) ## **The connection between gut health and sugar cravings** Your [gut bacteria play a significant role](https://www.drberg.com/blog/gut-bacteria-and-viruses) in balancing hormones that regulate hunger, satiety, and eating behavior. Certain probiotic bacteria ferment dietary fibers, which releases large amounts of short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs). SCFAs have been found to impact the secretion of several satiation hormones, including glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1), peptide YY (PYY), and ghrelin. These hormones communicate with the central nervous system and send signals to the brain that trigger or inhibit cravings for certain foods. [Research](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41392-022-01117-5) published in _Nature_ confirms the role of gut bacteria in regulating food intake and concludes, _“The gut microbiota has the ability to regulate the host’s appetite, food preferences, and feeding behaviors through satiety pathways.”_ A lack of healthy gut microbes can lead to an overgrowth of potentially bad bacteria that can alter the production of satiation hormone, which is linked to increased cravings for sugary foods. _“Poor gut health can contribute to obesity and metabolic imbalances,”_ explains Dr. Berg. _“Promoting a healthy gut flora with probiotics can stop sugar cravings and promote a healthy body weight.”_ Interestingly, consuming too much sugar and \[processed

## How to Use MCT Oil Medium-chain triglyceride (MCT) oil is a popular supplement in the health and wellness community and a staple ingredient for those following a ketogenic diet. It sparked widespread interest for its potential to promote fat burning and enhance brain function, leaving many people wondering how to use MCT oil effectively. Let’s explore the benefits of MCT oil and learn how to incorporate this supplement into your routine to maximize its health benefits. ## **What is MCT oil?** Medium-chain triglycerides (MCTs) are a type of saturated fat comprising three medium-chain fatty acids bonded to a glycerol molecule. Unlike long-chain triglycerides, MCTs can be absorbed directly into the bloodstream without requiring bile or pancreatic enzymes to break them down. Although not classified as essential fatty acids, MCTs are directly converted into ketones, a group of organic acids that support sustained energy, enhance mental clarity, and promote a feeling of fullness by stimulating the release of satiety-inducing hormones. While small amounts of MCTs are naturally found in coconut oil, bovine milk, and palm kernel oil, MCT oil is a concentrated extract that provides a higher and more consistent dose of these beneficial fats. MCT oil can consist of several different types of medium-chain fatty acids, including: \* Caproic acid (C6) \* Caprylic acid (C8) \* Capric acid (C10) \* Lauric acid (C12) The numbers associated with each fatty acid represent the amount of carbon atoms in their chemical structure. This plays a critical role in how the body processes these fats and the benefits they provide. For instance, caproic acid is the shortest medium-chain fatty acid and converts into ketones the quickest, offering a rapid energy source. However, caproic acid is rare and challenging to extract, and its lower carbon count gives it a strong taste and odor, which makes it less appealing. As a result, it’s usually not found in many MCT oil products. In contrast, lauric

## Pelvic Congestion Syndrome Natural Treatment and Causes Pelvic congestion syndrome (PCS) is a medical condition characterized by chronic pain in the pelvic region. PCS occurs due to the development of varicose veins in the lower abdomen that restrict normal blood flow, resulting in pain and discomfort. PCS is more common in women and can be caused by various factors, including hormonal changes, pregnancy, and genetic predisposition. Let’s look at common causes of PCS and what steps you can take to ease symptoms fast. ![Woman sitting with hand over pelvis](https://www.drberg.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/female-suffering-from-abdominal-pain.jpg?w=800) ## **What is pelvic congestion syndrome (PCS)?** Blood vessels in the lower abdomen can become [varicose](https://www.drberg.com/blog/the-best-way-to-deal-with-varicose-veins), resulting in twisted and enlarged veins that no longer function properly. Varicose pelvic veins can’t drain blood effectively from the pelvic region. This increases pressure within the abdomen, resulting in discomfort and chronic pain, and can impede the ability to perform everyday activities, including exercising, walking, and lifting heavy objects. Although more common in women, men also can suffer from PCS and typically develop varicose veins in the testicular area of the pelvis. ## **Signs of PCS** While most people with PCS suffer dull abdominal pain and increased pressure in the pelvic region, it can cause a wide range of other symptoms. These are common pelvic congestion syndrome symptoms: \* Chronic pelvic pain \* Dull or aching pain that may be worse on one side of the pelvis \* A feeling of fullness or pressure in the pelvic area \* Pain during intercourse \* Lower back pain \* Pain worsens after long periods of standing or sitting \* [Abdominal bloating](https://www.drberg.com/blog/how-to-stop-bloating-fast-learn-the-5-causes-dr-berg) or swelling \* Dysmenorrhea or painful periods !\[pelvic pain

## Foods to Shrink Fibroids: Most Effective Choices Dealing with uterine fibroids can be incredibly frustrating. You’re likely experiencing symptoms that disrupt your life, from heavy bleeding and pelvic pain to [bloating and digestive problems](https://www.drberg.com/blog/lectins-in-vegetables-causing-bloating). You’re searching for answers, especially when it comes to managing this condition with non-surgical treatment options. Diet plays a crucial role, and there’s growing interest surrounding the power of certain foods to shrink fibroids. Let’s talk about foods that may contribute to fibroid growth. These include [high-estrogen](https://www.drberg.com/blog/consequences-of-high-estrogen-in-men) foods and those that impact insulin levels. For instance, conventional dairy products contain hormones meant to help a calf grow, and soy can also be highly estrogenic. Additionally, refined sugars and processed carbohydrates can lead to insulin spikes, which may promote fibroid growth. ## **Understanding the Connection Between Diet and Fibroids** Uterine fibroids are non-cancerous tumors that grow in or around the uterus. While their exact cause is unknown, researchers believe they are linked to hormone levels like estrogen and progesterone. These hormones stimulate the uterine lining’s growth. This link between hormones and fibroids has led many individuals to explore how dietary choices impact their condition. ## **Foods to Shrink Fibroids: Harnessing the Power of Nature** Certain foods have shown promise in managing uterine fibroids naturally. Keep in mind that these foods are not a cure for fibroids. However, if you are seeking more than just treatment options and want to take control of your fibroid treatment, these foods may support your overall health and well-being: ![Fresh berries](https://www.drberg.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/mix-different-berry-berries-fruits-background-24.jpg?w=800) ### **1.

## Cause of Rosacea Revealed: Gut Link Explained Dealing with persistent redness and those tiny, visible blood vessels on your face can be incredibly frustrating. Many people are searching for effective rosacea natural treatment options to soothe their skin without resorting to harsh chemicals or medications. Let’s explore the potential causes of rosacea and delve into some promising natural remedies. ## **Understanding Rosacea and Its Triggers** While the exact cause of rosacea remains a bit of a mystery, clues suggest it might be linked to a combination of factors. There might be a connection to certain bacteria or possibly even parasites. This idea is further supported by the fact that [antibiotics](https://www.drberg.com/blog/can-antibiotics-cause-weight-gain), especially those with anti-parasitic properties, have shown some effectiveness in treating rosacea. Interestingly, research suggests that some lavender essential oils have [strong antimicrobial properties](https://www.drberg.com/blog/interesting-benefits-of-castor-oil) that can target certain strains of bacteria as a potential natural treatment for rosacea. ### **The Role of Cortisol and Stress** Another piece of the puzzle lies in the connection between rosacea and [high cortisol levels](https://www.drberg.com/blog/difference-between-high-cortisol-and-low-cortisol-symptoms), often observed in Cushing’s disease. Cortisol, a natural anti-inflammatory hormone, should theoretically combat inflammation. But, in cases where cortisol is constantly elevated, the body might start resisting its effects. This resistance may create a situation where cortisol, even at high levels, can’t do its job effectively. It seems a cortisol deficiency might be contributing to the inflammation seen in rosacea. Have you noticed that certain things seem to trigger or worsen your rosacea? Many individuals with this condition report that factors like extreme temperatures (both hot and cold), strenuous workouts, excessive sun

## How Long to Get Back into Ketosis after Drinking Alcohol Although alcohol has no carbs, it’s a toxin, and the liver prioritizes the detoxification of ethanol over other metabolic functions, which inhibits fat-burning and ketosis. How long it takes to get back into ketosis after drinking alcohol depends on how much alcohol you drink and how quickly your liver detoxifies ethanol. However, it typically takes between 48 and 72 hours to restart ketosis after consuming alcohol. Learn about the impact of ethanol on your overall health and why alcohol counteracts the many health benefits of the keto diet and intermittent fasting. ## **Does alcohol contain carbs?** While pure alcohol, or ethanol, is carb-free, most alcoholic beverages contain carbs. Ethanol is typically made by fermenting high-carb grains or fruits such as sugar cane and grapes. However, not all carbohydrates and sugars are broken down during the fermentation process, leaving residual carbs in the final product. In addition, many types of alcohol are flavored with sugars and syrups or are mixed with sugary soft drinks and fruit juices. Here is the average carb content of common alcoholic beverages: \* Beer: 10 to 15 grams per 12-ounce (355 ml) serving \* Wine: 2 to 4 grams per 5-ounce (148 ml) serving \* Champagne: 3 to 6 grams per 5-ounce serving \* Margarita: 19 grams per 5-ounce serving \* Gin and tonic: 25 grams per 8-ounce (240 ml) serving \* Bloody Mary: 15 grams per 8-ounce serving \* Liquor: 10 to 20 grams per 1-ounce (30 ml) serving Consuming alcoholic drinks can stop you from achieving successful keto dieting results, even if they aren’t high-carb. Watch the video below to learn how much alcohol will stop weight loss and ketosis.## **Can alcohol kick you out of ketosis?** Yes, drinking alcohol affects your metabolism and can potentially kick you out of ketosis. While ethanol doesn’t contain

## 48-Hour Fasting: Benefits, Tips, and Beginner’s Guide A 48-hour fast is a popular form of intermittent fasting that offers considerable health benefits. Extended periods of calorie restriction help boost weight loss, trigger metabolic changes linked to improved insulin sensitivity, support healthy blood pressure, and profoundly impact cellular regeneration and energy production. Learn how you can get started with prolonged fasting and what steps you can take to minimize the potential side effects of restricting your calorie intake for 48 hours. ## **What is 48-hour fasting?** [Intermittent fasting](https://www.drberg.com/blog/the-most-important-intermittent-fasting-basics-for-beginners-must-watch-dr-berg) is a mealtime schedule that alternates between fasting periods and eating periods. The 16:8 intermittent fast–16 hours of fasting followed by an eight-hour eating period–is one of the most popular fasting patterns and is a perfect addition to a keto lifestyle. However, if you can tolerate more extended fasting periods, regularly doing a 48-hour fast may be an even better choice. As the name implies, 48-hour fasting requires caloric restriction for two days. While fasting, it’s necessary to abstain from all foods and only drink zero-calorie fluids such as water or herbal teas. Prolonged fasting triggers significant metabolic changes and pushes your metabolism to convert stored body fat into energy. As your body breaks down fats, the liver generates ketones, a metabolic by-product of fat-burning and a very efficient energy source. When your cells use ketones as fuel, you enter a metabolic state known as ketosis. Ketosis doesn’t just support weight loss but has profound benefits for cellular health. While some people do 48-hour fasting once a week, others may opt for a two-day fast once a month or whenever needed. Watch the video below to discover the amazing benefits of prolonged fasting.

## Weight Watchers vs. Keto for Weight Loss & Health Weight Watchers is a commercial diet program based on a point system encouraging participants to eat fewer calories. In contrast, the ketogenic diet is a low-carb, high-fat diet that pushes your metabolism to burn fat instead of carbs for energy. If done correctly, keto doesn’t just help to achieve your weight goals but also promotes a healthy body. Learn why restricting carbs is the best way to lose weight and how to get started with Healthy Keto®. ## **Weight Watchers and keto compared** Weight Watchers and the keto diet are both popular weight loss programs that have helped a large number of people to shed weight. However, they are based on fundamentally different metabolic approaches, which explains why long-term weight loss success differs between these two diets. Let’s take a look at the key differences between Weight Watchers and keto. ### **What is Weight Watchers?** The Weight Watchers diet is a diet plan created by Weight Watchers International. It uses a points system, where each food and drink is assigned a point value based on its calorie, fat, and sugar content. Weight Watcher participants are given a daily points allowance based on their age, gender, weight, and activity level, and they can use these points to create a daily meal plan. Low-calorie foods generally have a lower point value than high-calorie foods such as soda, candy, or donuts, encouraging calorie restriction to achieve weight loss. Interestingly, no food is off limits on the Weight Watchers weight loss program. While it may sound appealing that you can eat all your favorite foods while trying to lose weight, it’s also Weight Watchers’ major drawback. Weight Watchers point-based diet approach is similar to calorie counting and only focuses on caloric restriction and portion control instead of motivating healthy food choices. It’s also important to note that Weight Watchers is a subscription model that requires a monthly fee to access

## Understanding Risk of Mercury in Tuna: Health Implications Tuna is a rich source of omega-3 fatty acids, high-quality protein, essential vitamins, and important trace minerals, making it a valuable addition to a balanced, nutrient-dense diet. Unfortunately, large predatory fish species, including tuna, often contain high levels of mercury, an environmental heavy metal that can have numerous health consequences. Find out which types of tuna have the highest mercury levels and learn how to enjoy this oily fish as part of a nutritious diet while keeping heavy metal exposure to a minimum. ## **What is mercury?** Mercury is a naturally occurring heavy metal found in air, water, and soil. Human activity, such as mining, coal burning, and industrial processes, has significantly increased its presence in the environment. In high amounts, mercury acts as a neurotoxin, potentially affecting the brain and nervous system. Long-term or high-level exposure can result in mercury toxicity, which may lead to serious health effects. Common symptoms of mercury toxicity include: \* Tremors \* Headaches \* Nausea \* Poor coordination \* Peripheral neuropathy \* [Skin rashes](https://www.drberg.com/blog/psoriasis-relief-the-best-remedy-for-your-skin) \* Poor memory \* Trouble speaking \* Vision loss \* Muscle weakness \* Twitches \* Insomnia \* [High blood pressure](https://www.drberg.com/blog/drink-1-cup-daily-to-normalize-high-blood-pressure) \* Mood swings and anxiety \* Fatigue Mercury, especially in its organic methylmercury form, has a high affinity for fatty acids and accumulates in lipid-rich tissues, including the brain. This makes it particularly dangerous for the [central nervous system](https://www.drberg.com/blog/brain-detox), where it can interfere with neuronal function, development, and communication. ### **Why do fish contain mercury** Most fish contain mercury due to widespread environmental contamination.

## Electrolytes for Fasting: What You Must Know While fasting has impressive health benefits, prolonged caloric restriction can trigger fluid loss and disrupt the body’s electrolyte balance, leading to tiredness and muscle discomfort. Discover why taking electrolytes for fasting can help achieve your health goals and support overall wellness during periods of caloric restriction. Electrolytes are mineral salts, including calcium, chloride, sodium, potassium, and magnesium, that carry a small electric charge when dissolved in a fluid. Due to their charge, electrolytes generate electrical currents, which play a crucial role in facilitating a wide range of vital bodily functions. Sodium and potassium help maintain the body’s fluid balance by controlling water movement in and out of cells and regulating urinary excretion through the kidneys. In addition, electrolytes are involved in many essential biological processes, including those related to energy, nerve signals, muscle activity, and pH regulation throughout the body. Consuming enough electrolytes can help support hydration and overall well-being, especially during physical activity, periods of increased fluid loss, and fasting routines. Watch the video below to learn more about the importance of electrolytes for overall health.## **Benefits of electrolytes for fasting** [Fasting has profound health benefits](https://www.drberg.com/blog/intermittent-fasting) and is a highly effective strategy to support a healthy body weight and promote overall well-being. Extended periods of caloric restriction deplete blood glucose levels and glycogen stores, which are glucose molecules bound to water that are stored in muscle and liver cells. When these fuel sources are exhausted, the body starts to burn body fat to generate energy, which explains why prolonged fasting can help achieve rapid weight loss. However, fasting causes

## 6 Incredible Milk Thistle Benefits Backed by Science Milk thistle is generally considered to be a pesky weed–but did you know that this prickly plant contains powerful flavonoids that can promote liver function, lower cancer risk, and may improve insulin resistance? Let’s look at six milk thistle benefits and learn how to use milk thistle supplements to promote a healthy body. ![Milk thistle flowers](https://www.drberg.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/milk-thistle-plant-silybum-marianum.jpg?w=800) ## **What is milk thistle?** Milk thistle, also known as mary thistle, is a flowering herb that belongs to the Asteraceae family and is closely related to daisies, marigolds, [dandelions](https://www.drberg.com/blog/benefits-dandelion-root), and artichokes. They have large, spiky leaves and tall stems topped by distinct purple flowers that produce small, mottled seeds. Milk thistles are native to the Mediterranean region but have spread to many parts of the world, where they’re typically considered an invasive weed species. Milk thistle seeds contain high concentrations of silymarin, a group of bioactive compounds with potent anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties linked to several potential health benefits.

## Can You Drink Water While Fasting? Essential Tips Fasting has many health benefits and has helped countless people achieve a healthy body weight, lower blood pressure, and enhance brain functions. It’s clear that fasting involves abstinence from solid food, but can you drink water while fasting? Learn why drinking the right fluids is essential while fasting and how adding sea salt to your water during your eating window can help you get the most out of your fasting practice. ## **Can you drink water while fasting?** Yes, you can drink water during a fast. Plain water doesn’t contain calories and won’t impact blood sugar levels, making it safe to drink while fasting. In fact, drinking water during fasting periods is essential to maintaining healthy fluid levels, supporting normal kidney function, and flushing out toxins. However, plain water isn’t all your body needs during fasting. When you restrict caloric intake to promote fat burning, a process called metabolic switching, your liver triggers glycogen shedding, which can cause fluid loss and electrolyte imbalances. Glycogen shedding refers to the depletion of glycogen, a form of glucose bound to water that’s stored in muscles and the liver. During fasting periods, glycogen is metabolized, which releases large quantities of water. When your kidneys eliminate excess fluids, they also excrete essential electrolytes such as sodium, potassium, magnesium, and calcium. Electrolytes are crucial for maintaining fluid balance, promoting normal muscle and cellular functions, and supporting energy production. Dehydration and electrolyte imbalances are among the most common causes of [fasting-related fatigue](https://www.drberg.com/blog/the-5-reasons-you-get-tired-on-intermittent-fasting), headaches, and muscle cramps.

## The Ultimate Guide to Getting Fat Adapted Are you ready to become fat-adapted on the keto diet? Achieving this metabolic state can unlock efficient weight loss, provide stable energy levels, and improve overall health. It’s a powerful tool in the [ketogenic lifestyle](https://www.drberg.com/blog/categories/diet/keto). Learn about how being fat-adapted is different from [simply being in ketosis](https://www.drberg.com/blog/how-to-know-you-are-in-ketosis) and how you can take full advantage of the benefits the keto diet has to offer. ## **Understanding Fat Adaptation and Its Role in the Keto Diet** Fat adaptation holds a key position in the realm of high-fat diets, such as the ketogenic diet. It’s about your body’s switch from glucose to fats for energy needs. ### **How Fat Adaptation Differs from Ketosis** Fat adaptation and ketosis are often mentioned together when discussing keto diets. In simple terms, while ketosis signifies carbohydrate restriction leading to the production of ketones by your body, fat adaptation is an advanced stage where these dietary changes have been assimilated at a deeper metabolic level. The journey towards becoming fully fat-adapted on a ketogenic diet can span between four to 12 weeks, depending on individual metabolism and lifestyle choices. The transition typically kickstarts around week four of faithfully following this high-fat dietary path. Ketosis may be achieved within days after limited carb intake. However, being in ketosis doesn’t automatically imply efficient utilization of fats across all bodily functions, that’s exclusively part of being fat-adapted. ### **The Significance of Being Fat Adapted** Achieving metabolic flexibility, or becoming fat-adapted, provides numerous advantages, such as improved endurance during exercise and enhanced feelings of fullness that support weight loss efforts. When our bodies learn to utilize stored fatty acids instead of relying on quickly burned carbohydrates for energy throughout the day,

## 72 Hour Fast: Proven Benefits for Immunity & More Prolonged caloric restriction, such as a 72-hour fast, is a powerful tool for optimizing hormonal balance, supporting immune system functions, and enhancing metabolic health. However, restricting food intake for three days can be challenging, especially for those new to fasting. Discover the impressive health benefits of extended fasting periods and learn how to safely and successfully complete a 72-hour fast. ![](https://www.drberg.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/72h-icon-flat-vector-illustration-black-21.jpg?w=800) ## **What is a 72-hour fast?** A 72-hour fast involves abstaining from food for three consecutive days while allowing water, electrolytes, and non-caloric beverages such as herbal teas and moderate amounts of black coffee. During extended fasting periods, the body shifts from utilizing sugars as the primary fuel source to burning fat to generate energy, a metabolic state known as ketosis. Ketosis occurs when the body begins to burn fat, converting fatty acids into ketone bodies, a group of organic acids that serve as a highly efficient alternative fuel source when glucose is limited. This metabolic shift forces the body to tap into stored body fat, promoting both fat loss and an overall reduction in body weight. With each fasting hour, the body becomes more efficient at burning fat, making a 72-hour fast an effective strategy for those seeking to lose weight and improve their metabolic health. In addition to significant weight loss, [prolonged fasting](https://www.drberg.com/blog/prolonged-fasting-too-hard-watch-this) has also been linked to improved mental clarity, antiaging effects, cellular rejuvenation, and a lower risk of chronic inflammatory diseases. While some individuals prefer to practice prolonged fasting monthly, others opt for a three-day fast every other month or whenever they feel the need for a metabolic reset.

## 7-Day Fast: Essential Guide Before You Begin Intermittent fasting is a popular mealtime pattern that cycles between periods of eating and fasting, and many individuals add the occasional prolonged fasts to their routine. Periodic fasts have been found to help improve insulin resistance, control blood sugar balance, boost cognition, and lower high blood pressure. But what happens on a prolonged 7-day fast? Discover the health benefits of fasting for seven days, how to do it safely, and tips for a successful fasting experience. ## **What is a 7-day fast?** A 7-day fast is a prolonged water fasting approach that involves total caloric restriction for a week. These fasts are typically performed only by consuming water, but low-calorie beverages, such as tea or coffee, are also permitted. Seven-day water fasts differ from [dry fasts](https://www.drberg.com/blog/why-i-don-t-recommend-water-fasting), which entail total calorie restriction and abstaining from water and other liquids. However, dry fasting can only be performed for 24 hours or less before becoming hazardous to health. Week-long water fasts are generally safe for healthy adults and are associated with several health benefits. However, it’s important to consult a healthcare provider before attempting a 7-day fast to minimize the risk of potential adverse effects. ### **What happens during a water fast?** During the first 24 hours of water fasting, the body depletes blood sugar and glycogen, a storage form of glucose that’s deposited in the liver and muscle tissues. Once glycogen reserves are depleted, you’ll start to enter ketosis. This metabolic state pushes the body to burn fat to generate energy instead of using sugar as a fuel source. By 48 hours, you’ll likely reach full ketosis and transition into burning your own fat stores to fuel your cells. During this [fasting stage](https://www.drberg.com/blog/6-stages-of-fasting), you may notice a reduced appetite and more mental clarity as the body starts to

## 6 Powerful Stages of Fasting to Know Today Fasting is a powerful practice that triggers profound metabolic and hormonal changes linked to weight loss, steady blood glucose levels, and better cognitive functions. Different stages of fasting offer unique benefits, ranging from initial depletion of glycogen stores and fat burning to deep ketosis, advanced autophagy, and immune cell rejuvenation. Understanding the benefits of each fasting stage can help maximize the full potential of fasting to improve your health and longevity. ## **Fasting basics** Fasting refers to voluntarily abstaining from all foods and calorie-containing beverages for a set period. Extended caloric restriction triggers various physiological, metabolic, and hormonal changes linked to improved metabolic health, enhanced cognition, and increased longevity. These changes also support weight management, help reduce inflammation, and promote cellular repair, all of which contribute to better overall health and well-being. While some individuals practice [dry fasting](https://www.drberg.com/blog/why-i-don-t-recommend-water-fasting), meaning they abstain from all food and liquids, water fasting is generally recommended as it permits fluid intake, which minimizes the risk of dehydration and associated health issues. ### **Fasting vs. starving** Fasting and starving are often confused. However, these distinct metabolic states trigger unique physiological processes with significantly different impacts on the body. Starvation refers to an involuntary and prolonged lack of food, leading to severe energy deficits and malnutrition. This forces the body to break down fat and muscle tissue to release fatty acids and amino acids for energy. This can cause substantial loss of lean muscle mass, severe body deterioration, and, in extreme cases, may result in organ failure, coma, or even death. In contrast, fasting is a controlled and deliberate practice that shifts the body from using sugar and carbohydrates as

## What Causes Diarrhea after Fasting and How to Avoid It Prolonged fasting has gained popularity due to its impressive health benefits. Caloric restriction has been linked to improved brain function, enhanced immune defenses, and significant weight loss. However, a prolonged fast can lead to digestive issues, including diarrhea, if you break your fast with the wrong foods. Learn about the causes of diarrhea after fasting and how to prepare for a prolonged fast to maximize health benefits. ## **What causes diarrhea after fasting?** Prolonged fasting, which can last from 24 hours to several days, can trigger significant physical and psychological effects. Diarrhea, loose stools, gas, abdominal pain, bloating, or nausea are common side effects that can occur after fasting. The risk of gastrointestinal (GI) issues during or after prolonged fasting periods depends on several factors. These include how the fast is broken, the individual’s health status, and what has been consumed before, during, and after the fast. One of the primary benefits of prolonged fasting is that it enables the body to redirect energy from digestive processes to other physiological functions. This helps improve metabolic pathways, enhances cognitive function, and triggers autophagy, a process of cell repair and renewal. When the digestive system slows and rests during fasting, the production of essential digestive components such as hydrochloric acid, enzymes, and bile temporarily decreases. A sudden reintroduction of hard-to-digest foods after a prolonged fast can overwhelm the GI system. This can cause accelerated movement of contents through the digestive tract, leading to incomplete digestion, reduced nutrient absorption, and diarrhea. Watch this video to learn more about potential digestive issues after breaking a fast.### **What is refeeding syndrome?** Refeeding syndrome is a severe

## Seven Signs to Stop Water Fasting – Know the Risks Both intermittent fasting and prolonged fasting are popular types of fasts with impressive health benefits. Extended periods of calorie restriction push your body to burn body fat, which helps you lose weight and supports healthy blood sugar control. Water fasting refers to consuming nothing but water during fasting periods. While this may seem the purest form of fasting, it’s associated with several risks. Understand seven signs to stop water fasting and know the risk of restricting the intake of all nutrients while fasting. ## **Risks of water fasting** Fasting has amazing benefits and may lower blood pressure and body weight, reduce the risk of heart disease, and reverse insulin resistance and diabetes. Water fasting involves refraining from consuming any food and solely relying on water for sustenance throughout the fasting period. As a result, a water fast effectively limits the intake of essential nutrients crucial for maintaining bodily functions. _“The main concern with water fasting is the high risk of electrolyte imbalances and depletion of nutritional reserves,”_ explains Dr. Berg\_. “While the body can sustain, and even thrive on, extended periods without eating, it still requires electrolytes, vitamins, and minerals to maintain the normal function of cells, tissues, and organs.”\_ Watch the video below to learn more about water fasting and how different intermittent fasting techniques can unlock fasting success without the risks of water fasting.## **Seven signs to stop water fasting – know the risks** Relying exclusively on water while fasting can have adverse effects and may worsen medical conditions. Here are seven signs that indicate you should stop water fasting. ### **1. Lethargy and mental fatigue** Frequent water fasting, combined with a poor diet that lacks essential nutrients, can quickly

## Does Cinnamon Break a Fast? What You Need to Know Cinnamon contains insignificant calories, and small amounts won’t break a fast. Adding this health-promoting aromatic spice to your morning coffee, herbal tea, or plain water is an excellent choice to support healthy blood glucose and insulin levels and may lower your risk of diabetes. Learn the best ways to enjoy cinnamon while fasting. ## **What is fasting?** Fasting is a popular method of meal timing that’s characterized by cycling from fasting periods to periods of eating. There are several different fasting routines practiced across the world for various spiritual, cultural, and health purposes: \* Time-restricted eating, also known as intermittent fasting, refers to eating only in a specific time frame each day, typically between 8 and 10 hours, and fasting for the remainder of the day. \* Alternate-day fasting rotates between days of regular eating days and days of restricting caloric intake to around 500 to 600 calories daily. \* [Prolonged fasting](https://www.drberg.com/blog/amazing-benefits-of-prolonged-fasting) involves fasting for longer durations, typically more than 24 hours, up to several days or even weeks. Keeping insulin levels low is one of the major metabolic benefits of intermittent fasting. Insulin is a critical player in regulating energy-making processes, and low insulin pushes your metabolism to utilize fat instead of sugar for energy. As your body breaks down fatty acids, the liver produces large quantities of ketones, a by-product of fat metabolism and a highly efficient energy source. As ketones enter your circulation and are used as a fuel source, your body enters a state known as ketosis. [Intermittent fasting](https://www.drberg.com/blog/the-most-important-intermittent-fasting-basics-for-beginners-must-watch-dr-berg) helps achieve fast weight loss, and most people practicing time-restricted eating also experience better sleep quality, diminished cravings, improved cognitive abilities,

## Does Salt Break a Fast? Benefits of Sodium While Fasting Most foods and beverages are off-limits during a fast, but what about taking certain trace minerals and electrolytes like sodium chloride? Does salt break a fast? No, taking salt won’t break a fast, and replenishing electrolytes, such as sodium, magnesium, and potassium, during your fasting period can have an important impact on your body and mind. Let’s look at the benefits of salt for intermittent fasting and discover the importance of electrolyte balance for your overall health. ![sea salt in a wooden spoon](https://www.drberg.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/spoon-salt-on-wooden-background-2.jpg?w=800) ## **Does salt break a fast?** Does salt break a fast? No, consuming salt doesn’t break a fast and can help maintain fluid balance and muscle function. However, [research](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37624210/) published in _Toxics_ suggests that the type of salt used shouldn’t be overlooked. There is a long list of salt variations to choose from, such as Baja gold sea salt, Celtic sea salt, [Himalayan salt](https://www.drberg.com/blog/himalayan-vs-celtic-sea-salt-which-is-better), iodized table salt, and kosher salt, and some options are more mineral-rich than others. Table salt or common salt, for example, is often heavily processed and stripped of many trace minerals. Salts that are less refined, such as Baja gold sea salt or pink Himalayan sea salt, contain higher concentrations of trace minerals and are generally better options for maintaining optimal hydration and electrolyte balance in the body. ![healthy fats fasting clock](https://www.drberg.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/intermittent-fasting-healthy-breakfast-diet-food-0004.jpg?w=800) ## **Benefits of sodium while fasting** Sodium plays a pivotal role in several vital bodily functions, and maintaining adequate sodium balance is especially important during fasting.

## Egg Prices Are NOT by Accident We’ve all been there. We walk into the grocery store expecting to pick up a carton of [eggs](https://www.drberg.com/blog/why-eggs-protect-your-liver-if-youre-postmenopausal), only to find empty shelves, or maybe the price has skyrocketed compared with our last trip. This is an alarming trend lately, but a bird flu egg shortage might be the last thing on your mind. The current situation with the bird flu feels like a replay of what we went through with COVID-19. Egg prices aren’t fluctuating randomly; the increase comes down to something bigger: avian influenza. ## **The Real Reason Behind the Bird Flu Egg Shortage** Dr. Clayton Baker, a doctor of internal medicine with over 25 years of experience, shared some keen insights on the situation. He sees the current bird flu outbreak as a pattern, one very similar to events that unfolded during the COVID pandemic. With COVID, the virus was found and modified for several years before it spread to different parts of the world.

The CIA has said that a virus came out of a lab in Wuhan. It turns out the virus was brought to the lab and worked on so that it became weaponized. Whether intentional or not, the release of the virus spread, and it later was declared a pandemic. ### **The Connection With Bird Flu** There are a lot of labs that took what naturally occurs and made it more transmissible. These groups have been trying to make the H5N1 avian flu able to jump species. The Southeast Poultry Research Laboratory is doing this. This location might be how this new wave has come about. Also, the University of Wisconsin Veterinary School, with Yoshihiro Kawaoka working there, could also be partially to blame; he is

## Magnesium Glycinate: Benefits, Uses, and Dosage Magnesium glycinate is a highly bioavailable form of magnesium made by bonding magnesium to the amino acid glycine. This popular magnesium supplement has been linked to several health benefits, including more restful sleep and better mood regulation. Discover five unique benefits of magnesium glycinate and learn about the early warning signs of magnesium deficiency. ## **Magnesium basics** Magnesium is an essential mineral involved in over 350 enzymatic biochemical reactions needed to regulate and maintain normal physiological functions. Magnesium helps facilitate muscle and nerve function, supports metabolic processes, promotes steady blood sugar levels, and is critical for healthy blood pressure. It also is involved in protein synthesis, bone and muscle development, and the expression and repair of DNA. Compared to other minerals, the body isn’t very efficient at storing magnesium, and consistent dietary intake is necessary to maintain adequate levels. Watch the video below to learn why magnesium glycinate differs from other forms of magnesium.## **What is magnesium glycinate?** Magnesium glycinate, also known as magnesium bisglycinate, is a combination of elemental magnesium and the amino acid glycine. This form of magnesium is highly bioavailable, primarily due to the addition of glycine, which enhances mineral absorption in the digestive tract. Because of its chemical composition, magnesium glycinate is more stable and soluble, which allows it to bypass some of the common barriers that can significantly reduce the absorption of other forms of magnesium. Due to its excellent absorption rate, magnesium glycinate has become a popular supplement and is widely available as capsules, powders, or chewable tablets. !\[Restful

## Keto and Fatty Liver: How This Diet Reverses It Fat accumulation in the liver can result in serious metabolic imbalances and liver damage–unfortunately, it’s estimated that almost 25 percent of adults have some degree of fatty liver disease. Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) typically develops due to a high-carb diet and is more common in individuals with type 2 diabetes, obesity, and insulin resistance. Learn how a low-carb, high-fat keto diet supports your liver health and reduces liver fat quickly! ## **How to reduce liver fat with keto** Restricting carbohydrates prevents fatty liver and helps to reduce existing liver fat, making keto an ideal diet to support your liver health. During ketosis, the liver converts dietary fats and stored fatty acids into ketones to fuel your body. Ketosis also stimulates the increased production of enzymes that promote fatty acid oxidation and speed up the breakdown of fats stored in the liver. In addition, keto helps to maintain healthy blood sugar levels and keeps your cells sensitive to insulin, preventing the storage of fats in liver cells and significantly reducing the risk of fatty liver disease. Several studies confirm that a ketogenic diet helps to reduce liver fat in individuals with NAFLD and significantly improves liver function. One study published in _Cell Metabolism_ found that a low carbohydrate keto diet reduced liver fat by over 40 percent in overweight and obese individuals. The authors observed that carbohydrate restriction leads to _“a dramatic reduction of liver fat.”_&#x31; Here are three steps you can take to maximize the reduction of liver fat on keto. ### **1. Follow Healthy Keto®** While a low-carb diet is crucial to reduce liver fat, following a nutritious diet is equally important, making [Healthy Keto®](https://www.drberg.com/blog/another-reason-why-you-should-do-healthy-keto) a perfect choice to support your liver health.

## Low-Carb Tostadas - Dr. Berg ![crab tostadas](https://drberg-dam.imgix.net/others/recipes-crab-tostadas-113-9.jpg?w=920\&auto=compress,format) Tostadas are a traditional Mexican dish featuring crispy corn tortillas topped with refried beans, meat, and cheese. However, for those following a keto diet, traditional tostadas aren’t compatible due to their high carb count. Luckily, this delicious Low-Carb Tostadas recipe replaces corn for a crispy cheese base, topped with a delectable crab salad, ensuring you remain in ketosis while enjoying flavors you love. ## **Why you’ll love this keto-friendly recipe** If you’re craving Mexican restaurant-style tostadas but follow a [Healthy Keto®](https://www.drberg.com/blog/the-keto-diet-for-beginners) diet plan, this recipe is perfect for you.

This recipe incorporates fresh lemon, providing a refreshing, tangy flavor and offering numerous health benefits, such as being a rich source of [vitamin C](https://www.drberg.com/blog/the-best-and-worst-vitamin-c) and promoting digestion. In addition, [research](https://jst.org.in/index.php/pub/article/view/249) published in the _Journal of Science & Technology_ found lemons to contain potent antimicrobial, antifungal, anti-inflammatory, and anti-cancer effects. Instead of carb-heavy corn tortillas, this recipe uses mozzarella cheese as a low-carb tostada alternative, which keeps blood sugar levels steady while providing calcium and protein. _“Avocado, the main ingredient in guacamole, is packed with healthy fats that have been linked to balanced cholesterol levels and a reduced risk of heart disease,”_ explains Dr. Berg. ![Crab tostadas recipe](https://drberg-dam.imgix.net/others/recipes-crab-tostadas-113-2.jpg?w=920\&auto=compress,format) ## **What are tostadas?** Tostadas, originating in Mexico, are a beloved dish across many Latin American countries.

## How to Sear Steak - Dr. Berg \* Let steak rest at room temperature for 20 minutes. \* Pat steak dry with paper towel to achieve good sear. Season steak with 1 pinch sea salt and 1 pinch pepper on both sides. \* Place pan on medium-high heat and add 1 tablespoon avocado oil. When oil is hot, place steak in pan, dropping steak away from you to prevent any hot oil from splashing back, \* Lower heat to medium, not moving steak for 2 to 3 minutes to create a crispy sear. \* If steak was at room temperature, cook each side for about 3 to 4 minutes. \* For medium steak, use a meat thermometer and remove from pan when internal temperature reaches 135 degrees F / 57 degrees C. \* Allowing steak to rest for 5 minutes before slicing into it helps the natural juices to absorb back into the meat. \* Cover in 1 tablespoon butter and enjoy!

## Rosemary Water for Hair Health: Fact or Fiction? Rosemary is an aromatic and flavorful herb widely used in culinary applications, traditional medicine practices, and cosmetic products. This perennial herb is a rich source of phytonutrients and antioxidants that may help stimulate new hair growth by promoting blood circulation and protecting the hair follicles and scalp from damage. Discover the benefits of rosemary water for hair health and find out how to use it to promote hair growth naturally. ## **Rosemary water for hair** Rosemary water is created by steeping fresh rosemary sprigs in water, which infuses the liquid with phytonutrients and antioxidants that offer potential benefits for hair and scalp health. This natural remedy has been used for centuries to support hair growth and combat hair loss, especially in cases related to postpartum hormonal changes, pattern hair loss, or alopecia. Additionally, many people use rosemary water to maintain hair health or restore thickness, luster, and shine after the overuse of chemical hair products and harsh dyes. Rosemary essential oil and extracts have been found to decrease hair loss, particularly in those with androgenetic alopecia (AGA), which causes pattern hair loss in men and women. This is likely due to its ability to lower blood levels of dihydrotestosterone (DHT), a potent of testosterone that contributes to hair follicle shrinkage and eventual hair loss. However, some remain skeptical about rosemary water’s effectiveness in preventing hair loss and stimulating growth, noting that the potency of an infusion is far lower than the highly concentrated rosemary essential oil formulations used in scientific studies.

## How to Reduce Cancer Risk Naturally & Fast Last month, a close friend faced the news that changed everything: a cancer diagnosis. It was a wake-up call for all of us. There’s much we can do to shield ourselves from this disease. This article is about taking control back–understanding how our cells power life and sometimes betray us. We’ll dive into why cancer cells seem immortal, how your eating could fuel risk, and why hitting the gym does more than pump up your muscles–it might just repair them at their core. We’ll also look at syncing sleep patterns with nature’s clock to keep those cellular gears running smoothly. So get ready; by the end of this read, you’ll have powerful strategies in your arsenal for reducing your cancer risk. ## **Understanding Cancer’s Mitochondrial Roots** Cancer, often seen as a ruthless invader, actually stems from a desperate adaptation. When our [mitochondria](https://www.drberg.com/blog/mitochondrial-protector-ampk)–the cell’s powerhouses–get damaged, cells may turn to an ancient survival tactic: fermentation. This switch allows them to thrive even when oxygen is scarce but comes at a cost; it paves the way for cancerous growths. ### **The Mitochondrial Function Beyond Energy** Mitochondria do more than churn out energy; they’re pivotal in hormone and neurotransmitter production that governs everything from your mood swings on a lousy day to how quickly you sprint after your dog when he escapes the yard. But here’s the kicker: damage these cellular dynamos, and you don’t just feel sluggish–you also bump up your risk of developing cancer. This isn’t just theoretical–cold, hard facts back it. Cells morph into cancer cells not because they want to wreak havoc but because their mitochondrial energy factories have crumbled beyond repair, forcing them into this last-ditch survival mode. It’s like watching someone trying to run away from trouble using only one leg–inefficient and ultimately dangerous. ## **The Immortality of Cancer Cells**

## Powerful Keto Magnesium Foods You Need Daily Magnesium is crucial for optimal health as it’s a cofactor for hundreds of enzymatic reactions. This essential mineral plays a pivotal role in energy production, muscle development, mood regulation, and more. If you’re following a ketogenic diet and don’t focus on mineral-rich foods, you may be at risk of magnesium deficiency, which is linked to muscle cramps, fatigue, poor blood sugar control, and keto flu symptoms. Learn to identify potential signs of magnesium deficiency and discover the best keto-friendly, magnesium-rich foods to include in your low-carb diet. ## **What does magnesium do?** _“Magnesium is involved in over 350 different enzymatic reactions in the body, making it the second most important mineral next to potassium,”_ explains Dr. Berg. Magnesium is essential for energy production and facilitates the production of adenosine triphosphate (ATP), the cell’s primary energy source. It also plays a pivotal role in muscle and nerve function and is vital for DNA and RNA synthesis. Moreover, magnesium helps regulate insulin, which is crucial for maintaining healthy blood glucose levels. It also influences other vital functions, such as blood pressure regulation, calcium balance, and vitamin D absorption, which are critical for maintaining heart, bone, and immune system health. In addition, magnesium’s [benefits](https://www.drberg.com/blog/the-benefits-of-magnesium) extend to neurological support. It significantly reduces stress and improves sleep quality by lowering cortisol and calming the nervous system, which can also help alleviate headaches and migraines. Furthermore, magnesium is important for maintaining hair, skin, and nail integrity, contributing to overall physical wellness. Watch the video below to discover the top keto-friendly magnesium-rich foods.## **What causes a magnesium deficiency?**
